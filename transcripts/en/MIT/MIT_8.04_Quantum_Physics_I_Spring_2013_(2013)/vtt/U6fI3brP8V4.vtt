00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.740
PROFESSOR: All right. So today's task is going
to be to outline some of the basic experimental

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.900
facts that we will both have to deal with
and that our aim should be to understand and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.210
model through the rest of the course.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.019
Physics doesn't tell you some abstract truth
about why the universe is the way it is. Physics

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.280
gives you models to understand how things
work and predict what will happen next. And

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.309
what we will be aiming to do is develop models
that give us an intuition for the phenomena

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.859
and allow us to make predictions. And these
are going to be the experimental facts I would

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.930
like to both explain, develop an intuition
for, and be able to predict consequences of.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:15.530
So we'll start off with-- so let me just outline
them. So, first fact, atoms exist. I'll go

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.750
over some of the arguments for that. Randomness,
definitely present in the world. Atomic spectre

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.420
are discrete and structured. We have a photoelectric
effect, which I'll describe in some detail.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.009
Electrons do some funny things. In particular
electron diffraction. And sixth and finally,

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.950
Bell's Inequality. Something that we will
come back to at the very end of the class,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.520
which I like to think of as a sort of a frame
for the entirety of 8.04.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.600
So... we'll stick with this for the moment.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.200
So everyone in here knows that atoms are made
of electrons and nuclei. In particular, you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.340
know that electrons exist because you've seen
a cathode ray tube. I used to be able to say

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.119
you've seen a TV, but you all have flat panel
TVs, so this is useless. So a cathode ray

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.598
tube is a gun that shoots electrons at a phosphorescent
screen. And every time the electron hits the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.140
screen it induces a little phosphorescence,
a little glow. And that's how you see on a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.300
CRT.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.220
And so as was pithily stated long ago by a
very famous physicist, if you can spray them,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.140
they exist. Pretty good argument. There's
a better argument for the existence of electrons,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.879
which is that we can actually see them individually.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.480
And this is one of the most famous images
in high-energy physics. It's from an experiment

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:47.950
called Gargamelle, which was a 30-cubic meter
tank of liquid freon pulsing just at its vapor

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.340
pressure 60 times a second. And what this
image is is, apart from all the schmut, you're

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.079
watching a trail of bubbles in this de-pressurizing
freon that wants to create bubbles but you

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.159
have to nucleate bubbles. What you're seeing
there in that central line that goes up and

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.790
then curls around is a single electron that
was nailed by a neutrino incident from a beam

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.599
at CERN where currently the LHC is running.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.590
And this experiment revealed two things. First,
to us it will reveal that you can see individual

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.019
electrons and by studying the images of them
moving through fluids and leaving a disturbing

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.709
wake of bubbles behind them. We can study
their properties in some considerable detail.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.760
The second thing it taught us is something
new-- we're not going to talk about it in

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.989
detail-- is that it's possible for a neutrino
to hit an electron. And that process is called

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.099
a weak neutral current for sort of stupid
historical reasons. It's actually a really

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.829
good name. And that was awesome and surprising
and so this picture is both a monument to

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.790
the technology of the experiment, but also
to the physics of weak neutral currents and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.420
electrons. They exist if you can discover
neutrinos by watching them. OK.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.220
Secondly, nuclei. We know that nuclei exist
because you can shoot alpha particles, which

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.620
come from radioactive decay, at atoms. And
you have your atom which is some sort of vague

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.430
thing, and I'm gonna make the-- I'm gonna
find the atom by making a sheet of atoms.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.459
Maybe a foil. A very thin foil of stuff. And
then I'm gonna shoot very high-energy alpha

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.390
particles incident of this.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.470
Probably everyone has heard of this experiment,
it was done by Rutherford and Geiger and Marsden,

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.660
in particular his students at the time or
post-docs. I don't recall-- and you shoot

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.080
these alpha particles in. And if you think
of these guys as some sort of jelly-ish lump

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.000
then maybe they'll deflect a little bit, but
if you shoot a bullet through Jello it just

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.390
sort of maybe gets deflected a little bit.
But Jello, I mean, come on.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.790
And I think what was shocking is that you
should these alpha particles in and every

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.940
once in a while, they bounce back at, you
know, 180, 160 degrees. Rutherford likened

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.630
this to rolling a bowling ball against a piece
of paper and having it bounce back. Kind of

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.470
surprising. And the explanation here that
people eventually came up upon is that atoms

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.170
are mostly zero density. Except they have
very, very high density cores, which are many

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.430
times smaller than the size of the atom but
where most of the mass is concentrated. And

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.700
as a consequence, most of the inertia.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.920
And so we know that atoms have substructure,
and the picture we have is that well if you

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.860
scrape this pile of metal, you can pull off
the electrons, leaving behind nuclei which

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.440
have positive charge because you've scraped
off the electrons that have negative charge.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.720
So we have a picture from these experiments
that there are electrons and there are nuclei--

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.650
which, I'll just write N and plus-- which
are the constituents of atoms.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.820
Now this leads to a very natural picture of
what an atom is. If you're a 19th-century

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.990
physicist, or even an early 20th-century physicist,
it's very natural to say, aha, well if I know

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.840
if I have a positive charge and I have a negative
charge, then they attract each other with

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.530
a 1 over r minus q1 q2-- sorry, q1 q2 over
r potential. This is just like gravity, right.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.030
The earth and the sun are attracted with an
inverse-r potential. This leads to Keplerian

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.880
orbits. And so maybe an atom is just some
sort of orbiting classical combination of

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.290
an electron and a nucleus, positively charged
nucleus.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.840
The problem with this picture, as you explore
in detail in your first problem on the problem

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.790
set, is that it doesn't work. What happens
when you accelerate a charge? It radiates.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.600
Exactly. So if it's radiating, it's gotta
lose energy. It's dumping energy into this--

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.040
out of the system. So it's gotta fall lower
into the potential. Well it falls lower, it

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.930
speeds up. It radiates more. Because it's
accelerating more to stay in a circular orbit.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.380
All right, it radiates more, it has to fall
further down.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.520
So on the problem set you're going to calculate
how long that takes. And it's not very long.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.120
And so the fact that we persist for more than
a few picoseconds tells you that it's not

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.220
that-- this is not a correct picture of an
atom. OK.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.870
So in classical mechanics, atoms could not
exist. And yet, atoms exist. So we have to

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:56.880
explain that. That's gonna be our first challenge.
Now interestingly Geiger who is this collaborator

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.380
of Rutherford, a young junior collaborator
of Rutherford, went on to develop a really

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.190
neat instrument. So suppose you want to see
radiation. We do this all the time. I'm looking

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.570
at you and I'm seeing radiation, seeing light.
But I'm not seeing ultra high energy radiation,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.540
I'm seeing energy radiation in the electromagnetic
waves in the optical spectrum.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.370
Meanwhile I'm also not seeing alpha particles.
So what Geiger wanted was a way to detect

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.860
without using your eyes radiation that's hard
to see. So the way he did this is he took

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.470
a capacitor and he filled the-- surrounded
the capacitor with some noble gas. It doesn't

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:36.190
interact. There's no-- it's very hard to ionize.
And if you crank up the potential across this

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:43.409
capacitor plate high enough, what do you get?
A spark. You all know this, if you crank up

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:46.600
a capacitor it eventually breaks down because
the dielectric in between breaks down, you

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.080
get a spontaneous sparking.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.840
So what do you figure it would look if I take
a capacitor plate and I charge it up, but

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.050
not quite to breakdown. Just a good potential.
And another charged particle comes flying

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.950
through, like an alpha particle, which carries
a charge of plus 2, that positive charge will

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:06.620
disturb things and will add extra field effectively.
And lead to the nucleation of a spark.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.830
So the presence of a spark when this potential
is not strong enough to induce a spark spontaneously

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:17.200
indicates the passage of a charged particle.
Geiger worked later with-- Marsden? Muller.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:24.270
Heck. I don't even remember. And developed
this into a device now known as the Geiger

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:31.210
counter. And so you've probably all seen or
heard Geiger counters going off in movies,

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:36.880
right. They go ping ping ping ping ping ping
ping ping ping, right. They bounce off randomly.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.860
This is an extremely important lesson, which
is tantamount to the lesson of our second

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.520
experiment yesterday. The 50-50, when we didn't
expect it. The white electrons into the harness

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.150
box then into a color box again, would come
out 50-50, not 100 percent. And they come

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.030
out in a way that's unpredictable. We have
no ability to our knowledge-- and more than

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.400
our knowledge, we'll come back to that with
Bell's Inequality-- but we have no ability

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.000
to predict which electron will come out of
that third box, white or black, right.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.270
Similarly with a Geiger counter you hear that
atoms decay, but they decay randomly. The

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.510
radiation comes out of a pile of radioactive
material totally at random. We know the probabilistic

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.710
description of that. We're going to develop
that, but we don't know exactly when. And

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.510
that's a really powerful example-- both of
those experiments are powerful examples of

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.190
randomness.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.890
And so we're going to have to incorporate
that into our laws of physics into our model

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:29.800
of quantum phenomena as well. Questions? I
usually have a Geiger counter at this point,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.700
which is totally awesome, so I'll try to produce
the Geiger counter demo later. But the person

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:41.700
with the Geiger counter turns out to have
left the continent, so made it a little challenging.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:48.630
OK. Just sort of since we're at MIT, an interesting
side note. This strategy of so-called hard

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:54.010
scattering, of taking some object and sending
it at very high velocity at some other object

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.760
and looking for the rare events when they
bounce off at some large angle, so-called

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:05.070
hard scattering. Which is used to detect dense
cores of objects. It didn't stop with Rutherford.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.680
People didn't just give up at that point.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.360
Similar experience in the '60s and '70s which
are conducted at Slack, were involved not

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:19.140
alpha particles incident on atoms but individual
electrons incident on protons. So not shooting

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.510
into the nucleus, but shooting and looking
for the effect of hitting individual protons

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:28.250
inside the nucleus. And through this process
it was discovered that in fact-- so this was

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.630
done in the '60s and '70s, that in fact the
proton itself is also not a fundamental particle.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:39.170
The proton is itself composite.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:44.140
And in particular, it's made out of-- eventually
people understood that it's made out of, morally

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.210
speaking, and I'm gonna put this in quotation
marks-- ask me about it in office hours--

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:54.400
three quarks, which are some particles. And
the reason we-- all this tells you is that

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.570
it's some object and we've given it the name
quark. But indeed there are three point-like

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.590
particles that in some sense make up a proton.
It's actually much more complicated than that,

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.230
but these quarks, among other things, have
very strange properties. Like they have fractional

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.220
charge.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:16.320
And this was discovered by a large group of
people, in particular led by Kendall and Friedman

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.600
and also Richard Taylor. Kendall and Friedman
were at MIT, Richard Taylor was at Stanford.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.660
And in 1990 they shared the Nobel Prize for
the discovery of the partonic structure out

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.140
of the nucleons. So these sorts of techniques
that people have been using for a very long

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.190
time continue to be useful and awesome.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.700
And in particular the experiment, the experimental
version of this that's currently going on,

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.240
that I particularly love is something called
the relativistic heavy ion collider, which

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.640
is going on at Brookhaven. So here what you're
doing is you take two protons and you blow

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.320
them into each other at ultra high energy.
Two protons, collide them and see what happens.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:54.610
And that's what happens. You get massive shrapnel
coming flying out. So instead of having a

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.720
simple thing where one of the protons just
bounces because there's some hard quark, instead

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:03.750
what happens is just shrapnel everywhere,
right. So you might think, well, how do we

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.700
interpret that at all. How do you make sense
out of 14,000 particles coming out of two

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.440
protons bouncing into each other. How does
that make any sense? And the answer turns

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.480
out to be kind of awesome.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:20.110
And so this touches on my research. So I want
to make a quick comment on it just for color.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.370
The answer turns out to be really interesting.
First off, the interior constituents of protons

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:29.850
interact very strongly with each other. But
at the brief moment when protons collide with

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:35.130
each other, what you actually form is not
a point-like quirk and another point-like

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.470
quark. In fact, protons aren't made out of
point-like quarks at all. Protons are big

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.690
bags with quarks and gluons and all sorts
of particles fluctuating in and out of existence

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.130
in a complicated fashion.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:50.910
And what you actually get is, amazingly, a
liquid. For a brief, brief moment of time

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.290
the parts of those protons that overlap--
think of them as two spheres and they overlap

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.960
in some sort of almond-shaped region. The
parts of those protons that overlap form a

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.380
liquid at ultra high temperature and at ultra
high density. It's called the RHIC fireball

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.000
or the quark-gluon plasma, although it's not
actually a plasma. But it's a liquid like

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.380
water. And what I mean by saying it's a liquid
like water, if you push it, it spreads in

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.400
waves. And like water, it's dissipative. Those
waves dissipate.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.620
But it's a really funny bit of liquid.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.200
Imagine you take your cup of coffee. You drink
it, you're drinking your coffee as I am wont

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.790
to do, and it cools down over time. This is
very frustrating. So you pour in a little

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.730
bit of hot coffee and when you pour in that
hot coffee, the system is out of equilibrium.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:34.300
It hasn't thermalized. So what you want is
you want to wait for all of the system to

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.660
wait until it's come to equilibrium so you
don't get a swig of hot or swig of cold. You

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.620
want some sort of Goldilocks-ean in between.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.710
So you can ask how long does it take for this
coffee to come to thermal equilibrium. Well

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.990
it takes a while. You know, a few seconds,
a few minutes, depending on exactly how you

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.850
mess with it. But let me ask you a quick question.
How does that time scale compare to the time

00:13:51.850 --> 00:14:00.250
it takes for light to cross your mug? Much,
much, much slower, right? By orders of magnitude.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:05.190
For this liquid that's formed in the ultra
high energy collision of two protons, the

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.779
time it takes for the system-- which starts
out crazy out of equilibrium with all sorts

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:14.350
of quarks here and gluons there and stuff
flying about-- the time it takes for it to

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:19.990
come to thermal equilibrium is of order the
time it takes for light to cross the little

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:25.430
puddle of liquid. This is a crazy liquid,
it's called a quantum liquid. And it has all

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.040
sorts of wonderful properties. And the best
thing about it to my mind is that it's very

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:35.660
well modeled by black holes. Which is totally
separate issue, but it's a fun example. So

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:41.880
from these sorts of collisions, we know a
great deal about the existence of atoms and

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.160
randomness, as you can see. That's a fairly
random sorting.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:51.150
OK so moving on to more 8.04 things. Back to
atoms. So let's look at specifics of that.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:58.630
I'm not kidding, they really are related to
black holes. I get paid for this. So here's

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.720
a nice fact, so let's get to atomic spectra.
So to study atomic spectra, here's the experiment

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.670
I want to run. The experiment I want to run
starts out with some sort of power plant.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.970
And out of the power plant come two wires.
And I'm going to run these wires across a

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:19.380
spark gap, you know, a piece of metal here,
a piece of metal here, and put them inside

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:25.230
a container, which has some gas. Like H2 or
neon or whatever you want. But some simple

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.130
gas inside here.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.339
So we've got an electric potential established
across it. Again, we don't want so much potential

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:38.070
that it sparks, but we do want to excite the
H2. So we can even make it spark, it doesn't

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.730
really matter too much. The important thing
is that we're going to excite the hydrogen,

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:48.210
and in exciting the hydrogen the excited hydrogen
is going to send out light. And then I'm going

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:56.850
to take this light-- we take the light, and
I'm gonna shine this on a prism, something

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:05.930
I was taught to do by Newton. And-- metaphorically
speaking-- and look at the image of this light

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.610
having passed through the prism.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:14.330
And what you find is you find a very distinct
set of patterns. You do not get a continuous

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.480
band. In fact what you get-- I'm going to
have a hard time drawing this so let me draw

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.740
down here. I'm now going to draw the intensity
of the light incident on the screen on this

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.600
piece of paper-- people really used to use
pieces of paper for this, which is kind of

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.300
awesome-- as a function of the wavelength,
and I'll measure it in angstroms.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:39.690
And what you discover is-- here's around 1,000
angstroms-- you get a bunch of lines. Get

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.860
these spikes. And they start to spread out,
and then there aren't so many. And then at

00:16:43.860 --> 00:17:01.120
around 3,000, you get another set. And then
at around 10,000, you get another set.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.819
This is around 10,000.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:10.220
And here's the interesting thing about these.
So the discovery of these lines-- these are

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:19.020
named after a guy named Lyman, these are--
these are named after a guy named-- Ballmer.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:29.400
Thank you. Steve Ballmer. And these are passion,
like passion fruit. So. Everyone needs a mnemonic,

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:36.679
OK. And so these people identified these lines
and explained various things about them.

00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:39.900
But here's an interesting fact. If you replace
this nuclear power plant with a coal plant,

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.890
it makes no difference. If you replace this
prism by a different prism, it makes no difference

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:49.670
to where the lines are. If you change this
mechanism of exciting the hydrogen, it makes

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.910
no difference. As long as it's hydrogen--
as long as it's hydrogen in here you get the

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.190
same lines, mainly with different intensities
depending upon how exactly you do the experiment.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:02.350
But you get the same position of the lines.
And that's a really striking thing.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.790
Now if you use a different chemical, a different
gas in here, like neon, you get a very different

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.900
set of lines. And a very different effective
color now when you eyeball this thing. So

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:18.630
Ballmer, incidentally-- and I think this is
actually why he got blamed for that particular

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.929
series, although I don't know the history--
Ballmer noticed by being-- depending on which

00:18:22.929 --> 00:18:28.500
biography you read-- very clever or very obsessed
that these guys, this particular set, could

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.250
be-- they're wavelengths. If you wrote their
wavelengths and labeled them by an integer

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:37.110
n, where n ran from 3 to any positive integer
above 3, could be written as 36. So this is

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:44.020
pure numerology. 36, 46 angstroms times the
function n squared over n squared minus 4,

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.679
where N is equal to 3, 4, dot dot dot-- an
integer.

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:51.270
And it turns out if you just plug in these
integers, you get a pretty good approximation

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:58.020
to this series of lines. This is a hallowed
tradition, a phenomenological fit to some

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.760
data. Where did it come from? It came from
his creative or obsessed mind. So this was

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:10.510
Ballmer. And this is specifically for hydrogen
gas, H2.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:16.750
So Rydberg and Ritz, R and R, said, well actually
we can do one better. Now that they realized

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.720
that this is true, they looked at the whole
sequence. And they found a really neat little

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.750
expression, which is that 1 over the wavelength
is equal to a single constant parameter. Not

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:30.559
just for all these, but for all of them. One
single numerical coefficient times 1 over

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:36.460
m squared minus 1 over n squared-- n is an
integer greater than zero and greater in particular

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.450
than m. And if you plug in any value of n
and any value of m, for sufficiently reasonable--

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.770
I mean, if you put in 10 million integers
you're not going to see it because it's way

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:52.750
out there, but if you put in or-- rather,
in here-- if you put any value of n and m,

00:19:52.750 --> 00:20:03.390
you will get one of these lines. So again,
why? You know, as it's said, who ordered that.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.030
So this is experimental result three that
we're going to have to deal with. When you

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:09.530
look at atoms and you look at the specter
of light coming off of them, their spectra

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:14.799
are discrete. But they're not just stupidly
discrete, they're discrete with real structure.

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:19.559
Something that begs for an explanation. This
is obviously more than numerology, because

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:25.179
it explains with one tunable coefficient a
tremendous number of spectral lines. And there's

00:20:25.179 --> 00:20:29.760
a difference-- and crucially, these both work
specifically for hydrogen. For different atoms

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.450
you need a totally different formula.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:44.740
But again, there's always some formula that
nails those spectral lines. Why? Questions?

00:20:44.740 --> 00:21:00.120
OK. So speaking of atomic spectra-- whoops,
I went one too far-- here's a different experiment.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:07.470
So people notice the following thing. People
notice that if you take a piece of metal and

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.660
you shine a light at it, by taking the sun
or better yet, you know, these days we'd use

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.840
a laser, but you shine light on this piece
of metal. Something that is done all the time

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.640
in condensed matter labs, it's a very useful
technique. We really do use lasers not the

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.390
sun, but still it continues to be useful in
fact to this day.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.630
You shine light on a piece of metal and every
once in a while what happens is electrons

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:35.049
come flying off. And the more light and the
stronger the light you shine, you see changes

00:21:35.049 --> 00:21:39.920
in the way that electrons bounce off. So we'd
like to measure that. I'd like to make that

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.429
precise. And this was done in a really lovely
experiment. Here's the experiment. The basic

00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:47.510
idea of the experiment is I want to check
to see, as I change the features of the light,

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.660
the intensity, the frequency, whatever, I
want to see how that changes the properties

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.059
of the electrons that bounce off.

00:21:52.059 --> 00:21:55.690
Now one obvious way-- one obvious feature
of an electron that flew off a piece of metal

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.890
is how fast is it going, how much energy does
it have. What's its kinetic energy. So I'd

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.540
like to build an experiment that measures
the kinetic energy of an electron that's been

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:09.400
excited through this photoelectric effect.
Through emission after shining light on a

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.280
piece of metal. Cool?

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.590
So I want to build that experiment. So here's
how that experiment goes. Well if this electron

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:20.809
comes flying off with some kinetic energy
and I want to measure that kinetic energy,

00:22:20.809 --> 00:22:26.390
imagine the following circuit. OK first off
imagine I just take a second piece of metal

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:33.000
over here, and I'm going to put a little current
meter here, an ammeter. And here's what this

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.370
circuit does. When you shine light on this
piece of metal-- we'll put a screen to protect

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.020
the other piece of metal-- the electrons come
flying off, they get over here. And now I've

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.230
got a bunch of extra electrons over here and
I'm missing electrons over here. So this is

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:47.170
negative, this is positive. And the electrons
will not flow along this wire back here to

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.330
neutralize the system.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:52.870
The more light I shine, the more electrons
will go through this circuit. And as a consequence,

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:58.030
there will be a current running through this
current meter. That cool with everyone? OK.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.299
So we haven't yet measured the kinetic energy,
though. How do we measure the kinetic energy?

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:04.929
I want to know how much energy, with how much
energy, were these electrons ejected.

00:23:04.929 --> 00:23:10.210
Well I can do that by the following clever
trick. I'm going to put now a voltage source

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:15.370
here, which I can tune the voltage of, with
the voltage V. And what that's going to do

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.960
is set up a potential difference across these
and the energy in that is the charge times

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.770
the potential difference. So I know that the
potential difference it takes, so the amount

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:31.020
of energy it takes to overcome this potential
difference, is q times V. That cool?

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:35.990
So now imagine I send in an electron-- I send
in light and it leads an electron to jump

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:41.660
across, and it has kinetic energy, kE. Well
if the kinetic energy is less than this, will

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.320
it get across? Not so much. It'll just fall
back. But if the kinetic energy is greater

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.360
than the energy it takes to cross, it'll cross
and induce a current.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:58.780
So the upshot is that, as a function of the
voltage, what I should see is that there is

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:04.030
some critical minimum voltage. And depending
on how you set up the sign, the sign could

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:11.260
be the other way, but there's some critical
minimal voltage where, for less voltage, the

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:18.500
electron doesn't get across. And for any greater
voltage-- or, sorry, for any closer to zero

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:24.020
voltage, the electron has enough kinetic energy
to get across. And so the current should increase.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.740
So there's a critical voltage, V-critical,
where the current running through the system

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:35.030
runs to zero. You make it harder for the electrons
by making the voltage in magnitude even larger.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.390
You make it harder for the electrons to get
across. None will get across. Make it a little

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:45.470
easier, more and more will get across. And
the current will go up. So what you want to

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.830
do to measure this kinetic energy is you want
to measure the critical voltage at which the

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:57.440
current goes to zero.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.210
So now the question is what do we expect to
see. And remember that things we can tune

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:08.530
in this experiment are the intensity of the
light, which is like e squared plus b squared.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:14.130
And we can tune the frequency of the light.
We can vary that. Now does the total energy,

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.919
does that frequency show up in the total energy
of a classical electromagnetic wave? No. If

00:25:18.919 --> 00:25:25.950
it's an electromagnetic wave, it cancels out.
You just get the total intensity, which is

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:33.880
a square of the fields. So this is just like
a harmonic oscillator. The energy is in the

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.919
amplitude. The frequency of the oscillator
doesn't matter. You push the swing harder,

00:25:36.919 --> 00:25:43.440
it gets more kinetic energy. It's got more
energy. OK.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.740
So what do we expect to see as we vary, for
example, the intensity? So here's a natural

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.220
gas. If you take-- so you can think about
the light here as getting a person literally,

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.559
like get the person next to you to take a
bat and hit a piece of metal. If they hit

00:25:57.559 --> 00:25:59.970
it really lightly they're probably not going
to excite electrons with a lot of energy.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:03.840
If they just whack the heck out of it, then
it wouldn't be too surprising if you get much

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.860
more energy in the particles that come flying
off. Hit it hard enough, things are just gonna

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.980
shrapnel and disintegrate.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:20.900
The expectation here is the following. That
if you have a more intense beam, then you

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:25.510
should get more-- the electrons coming off
should be more energetic. Because you're hitting

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:37.370
them harder. And remember that the potential,
which I will call V0, the stopping voltage.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:44.230
So therefore V0 should be greater in magnitude.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:49.850
So this anticipates that the way this curve
should look as we vary the current as a function

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:57.250
of v, if we have a low voltage-- sorry, if
we have a low-intensity beam-- it shouldn't

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.990
take too much potential just to impede the
motion.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.880
But if we have a-- so this is a low intensity.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.960
But if we have a high-intensity beam, it should
take a really large voltage to impede the

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.250
electric flow, the electric current, because
high-intensity beam you're just whacking those

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:19.870
electrons really hard and they're coming off
with a lot of kinetic energy. So this is high

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:28.070
intensity. Everyone down with that intuition?
This is what you get from Maxwell's electrodynamics.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.990
This is what you'd expect.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:40.660
And in particular, as we vary-- so this is
our predictions-- in particular as we vary--

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:50.820
so this is 1, 2, with greater intensity. And
the second prediction is that V-naught should

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:55.169
be independent of frequency. Because the energy
density and electromagnetic wave is independent

00:27:55.169 --> 00:28:04.600
of the frequency. It just depends on the amplitude.
And I will use nu to denote the frequency.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:15.020
So those are the predictions that come from
8.02 and 8.03. But this is 8.04. And here's what

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:21.880
the experimental results actually look like.
So here's the intensity, here's the potential.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.230
And if we look at high potential, it turns
out that-- if we look, sorry, if we look at

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:32.770
intermediate potentials, it's true that the
high intensity leads to a larger current and

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:36.690
the low intensity leads to a lower current.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:44.330
But here's the funny thing that happens. As
you go down to the critical voltage, their

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:52.440
critical voltages are the same. What that
tells you is that the kinetic energy kicked

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.010
out-- or the kinetic energy of an electron
kicked out of this piece of metal by the light

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:03.530
is independent of how intense that beam is.
No matter how intense that beam is, no matter

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:09.120
how strong the light you shine on the material,
the electrons all come out with the same energy.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:15.600
This would be like taking a baseball and hitting
it with a really powerful swing or a really

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.450
weak swing and seeing that the electron dribbles
away with the same amount of energy. This

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:25.140
is very counter-intuitive.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:32.690
But more surprisingly, V-naught is actually
independent of intensity. But here's the real

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:41.770
shocker. V-naught varies linearly in the frequency.
What does change V-naught is changing the

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.960
frequency of the light in this incident. That
means that if you take an incredibly diffuse

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:51.090
light-- incredibly diffuse light, you can
barely see it-- of a very high frequency,

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:56.710
then it takes a lot of energy to impede the
electrons that come popping off.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:01.900
The electrons that come popping off have a
large energy. But if you take a low-frequency

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:07.720
light with extremely high intensity, then
those electrons are really easy to stop. Powerful

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.539
beam but low frequency, it's easy to stop
those electrons. Weak little tiny beam at

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:16.530
high frequency, very hard to stop the electrons
that do come off. So this is very counter-intuitive

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:23.730
and it doesn't fit at all with the Maxwellian
picture. Questions about that?

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:34.340
So this led Einstein to make a prediction.
This was his 1905 result. One of his many

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.679
totally breathtaking papers of that year.
And he didn't really propose a model or a

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:42.720
detailed theoretical understanding of this,
but he proposed a very simple idea. And he

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.990
said, look, if you want to fit this-- if you
want to fit this experiment with some simple

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:53.850
equations, here's the way to explain it. I
claim-- I here means Einstein, not me-- I

00:30:53.850 --> 00:31:09.539
claim that light comes in packets or chunks
with definite energy. And the energy is linearly

00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:14.120
proportional to the frequency. And our energy
is equal to something times nu, and we'll

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:18.780
call the coefficient h.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:31.820
The intensity of light, or the amplitude squared,
the intensity is like the number of packets.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:36.580
So if you have a more intense beam at the
same frequency, the energy of each individual

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:44.070
chunk of light is the same. There are just
a lot more chunks flying around. And so to

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.350
explain the photoelectric effect, Einstein
observed the following. Look, he said, the

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:52.860
electrons are stuck under the metal. And it
takes some work to pull them off. So now what's

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:59.159
the kinetic energy of an electron that comes
flying off-- whoops, k3. Bart might have a

00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:03.470
laugh about that one. Kinetic, kE, not 3.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:07.780
So the kinetic energy of electron that comes
flying off, well, it's the energy deposited

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:13.580
by the photon, the chunk of light, h-nu well
we have to subtract off the work it took.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:18.070
Minus the work to extract the electron from
the material. And you can think of this as

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:24.820
how much energy does it take to suck it off
the surface. And the consequence of this is

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:34.809
that the kinetic energy of an electron should
be-- look, if h-nu is too small, if the frequency

00:32:34.809 --> 00:32:37.850
is too low, then the kinetic energy would
be negative.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.090
But that doesn't make any sense. You can't
have negative kinetic energy. It's a strictly

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:45.679
positive quantity. So it just doesn't work
until you have a critical value where the

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:50.460
frequency times h-- this coefficient-- is
equal to the work it takes to extract. And

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:55.960
after that, the kinetic energy rises with
the frequency with a slope equal to h. And

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:04.000
that fits the data like a champ.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.650
So no matter-- let's think about what this
is saying again. No matter what you do, if

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:13.130
your light is very low-frequency and you pick
some definite piece of metal that has a very

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:17.049
definite work function, very definite amount
of energy it takes to extract electrons from

00:33:17.049 --> 00:33:23.610
the surface. No matter how intense your beam,
if the frequency is insufficiently high, no

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.799
electrons come off. None.

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:30.840
So it turns out none is maybe a little overstatement
because what you can have is two photon processes,

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.309
where two chunks hit one electron at the right,
just at the same time. Roughly speaking the

00:33:34.309 --> 00:33:37.950
same time. And they have twice the energy,
but you can imagine that the probability of

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.850
two photon hitting one electron at the same
time of pretty low. So the intensity has to

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:45.450
be preposterously high. And you see those
sorts of multi-photon effects. But as long

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:52.730
as we're not talking about insanely high intensities,
this is an absolutely fantastic probe of the

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:53.450
physics.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:57.650
Now there's a whole long subsequent story
in the development of quantum mechanics about

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.320
this particular effect. And it turns out that
the photoelectric effect is a little more

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:07.440
complicated than this. But the story line
is a very useful one for organizing your understanding

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.460
of the photoelectric effect. And in particular,
this relation that Einstein proposed out of

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:16.940
the blue, with no other basis. No one else
had ever seen this sort of statement that

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:22.699
the electrons, or that the energy of a beam
of light should be made up of some number

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:27.909
of chunks, each of which has a definite minimum
amount of energy.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:33.859
So you can take what you've learned from 8.02
and 8.03 and extract a little bit more information

00:34:33.859 --> 00:34:39.639
out of this. So here's something you learned
from 8.02. In 8.02 you learned that the energy

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:44.239
of an electromagnetic wave is equal to c times
the momentum carried by that wave-- whoops,

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:51.509
over two. And in 8.03 you should have learned
that the wavelength of an electromagnetic

00:34:51.509 --> 00:34:59.099
wave times the frequency is equal to the speed
of light, C.

00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:07.539
And we just had Einstein tell us-- or declare,
without further evidence, just saying, look

00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:13.809
this fits-- that the energy of a chunk of
light should be h times the frequency. So

00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:16.960
if you combine these together, you get another
nice relation that's similar to this one,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:25.269
which says that the momentum of a chunk of
light is equal to h over lambda. So these

00:35:25.269 --> 00:35:29.789
are two enormously influential expressions
which come out of this argument from the photoelectric

00:35:29.789 --> 00:35:33.279
effect from Einstein. And they're going to
be-- their legacy will be with us throughout

00:35:33.279 --> 00:35:36.789
the rest of the semester.

00:35:36.789 --> 00:35:51.989
Now this coefficient has a name, and it was
named after Planck. It's called Planck's Constant.

00:35:51.989 --> 00:35:55.339
And the reason that it's called Planck's Constant
has nothing to do with the photoelectric effect.

00:35:55.339 --> 00:36:03.489
It was first this idea that an electromagnetic
wave, that light, has an energy which is linearly

00:36:03.489 --> 00:36:07.469
proportional not to its intensity squared,
none of that, but just linearly proportional

00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:13.339
to the frequency. First came up an analysis
of black body radiation by Planck. And you'll

00:36:13.339 --> 00:36:16.690
understand, you'll go through this in some
detail in 8.044 later in the semester. So I'm

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:20.660
not going to dwell on it now, but I do want
to give you a little bit of perspective on it.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:28.710
So Planck ran across this idea that E is equal
to h/nu. Through the process of trying to

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:34.829
fit an experimental curve. There was a theory
of how much energy should be emitted by an

00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:39.329
object that's hot and glowing as a function
of frequency. And that theory turned out to

00:36:39.329 --> 00:36:44.019
be in total disagreement with experiment.
Spectacular disagreement. The curve for the

00:36:44.019 --> 00:36:48.109
theory went up, the curve for the experiment
went down. They were totally different.

00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:52.819
So Planck set about writing down a function
that described the data. Literally curve-fitting,

00:36:52.819 --> 00:36:58.069
that's all he was doing. And this is the depths
of desperation to which he was led, was curve-fitting.

00:36:58.069 --> 00:37:02.749
He's an adult. He shouldn't be doing this,
but he was curve-fitting. And so he fits the

00:37:02.749 --> 00:37:07.339
curve, and in order to get it to fit the only
thing that he can get to work even vaguely

00:37:07.339 --> 00:37:13.299
well is if he puts in this calculation of
h/nu. He says, well, maybe when I sum over

00:37:13.299 --> 00:37:17.569
all the possible energies I should restrict
the energies which were proportional to the

00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:20.759
frequency.

00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:24.979
And it was forced on him because it fit from
the function. Just functional analysis. Hated

00:37:24.979 --> 00:37:30.910
it. Hated it, he completely hated it. He was
really frustrated by this. It fit perfectly,

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:34.950
he became very famous. He was already famous,
but he became ridiculously famous. Just totally

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:40.539
loathed this idea. OK. So it's now become
a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. But he

00:37:40.539 --> 00:37:41.549
wasn't so happy about it.

00:37:41.549 --> 00:37:46.579
And to give you a sense for how bold and punchy
this paper by Einstein was that said, look,

00:37:46.579 --> 00:37:52.269
seriously. Seriously guys. e equals h/nu.
Here's what Planck had to say when he wrote

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:55.910
a letter of recommendation to get Einstein
into the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1917,

00:37:55.910 --> 00:38:01.170
or 1913. So he said, there is hardly one among
the great problems in physics to which Einstein

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:05.670
has not made an important contribution. That
he may sometimes have missed the target in

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:11.479
his speculations as in his hypothesis of photons
cannot really be held too much against him.

00:38:11.479 --> 00:38:18.249
It's not possible to introduce new ideas without
occasionally taking a risk.

00:38:18.249 --> 00:38:22.680
Einstein who subsequently went on to develop
special relativity and general relativity

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:28.559
and prove the existence of atoms and the best
measurement of Avogadro's Constant, subsequently

00:38:28.559 --> 00:38:33.180
got the Nobel Prize. Not for Avogadro's Constant,
not for proving the existence of atoms, not

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:39.380
for relativity, but for photons. Because of
guys like Planck, right. This is crazy.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:45.089
So this was a pretty bold idea. And here,
to get a sense for why-- we're gonna leave

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:51.599
that up because it's just sort of fun to see
these guys scowling and smiling-- there is,

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:57.339
incidentally there's a great book about Einstein's
years in Berlin by Tom Levenson, who's a professor

00:38:57.339 --> 00:39:04.539
here. A great writer and a sort of historian
of science. You should take a class from him,

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:08.549
which is really great. But I encourage you
to read this book. It talks about why Planck

00:39:08.549 --> 00:39:14.650
is not looking so pleased right there, among
many other things. It's a great story.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:18.630
So let's step back for a second. Why was Planck
so upset by this, and why was in fact everyone

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:24.529
so flustered by this idea that it led to the
best prize you can give a physicist. Apart

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:36.450
from a happy home and, you know. I've got
that one. That's the one that matters to me.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:42.529
So why is this so surprising? And the answer
is really simple. We know that it's false.

00:39:42.529 --> 00:39:47.700
We know empirically, we've known for two hundred
and some years that light is a wave. Empirically.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.069
This isn't like people are like, oh I think
it'd be nice if it was a wave. It's a wave.

00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:56.799
So how do we know that? So this goes back
to the double-slit experiment from Young.

00:39:56.799 --> 00:40:04.489
Young's performance of this was in 1803. Intimations
of it come much earlier. But this is really

00:40:04.489 --> 00:40:09.609
where it hits nails to the wall. And here's
the experiment.

00:40:09.609 --> 00:40:15.700
So how many people in here have not seen a
double-slit experiment described? Yeah, exactly.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.880
OK. So I'm just going to quickly remind you
of how this goes.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.339
So we have a source for waves. We let the
waves get big until they're basically plane

00:40:23.339 --> 00:40:29.459
waves. And then we take a barrier. And we
poke two slits in it. And these plane waves

00:40:29.459 --> 00:40:35.680
induce-- they act like sources at the slits
and we get nu. And you get crests and troughs.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.579
And you look at some distant screen and you
look at the pattern, and the pattern you get

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:45.509
has a maximum. But then it falls off, and
it has these wiggles, these interference fringes.

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:49.799
These interference fringes are, of course,
extremely important. And what's going on here

00:40:49.799 --> 00:40:55.579
is that the waves sometimes add in-- so the
amplitude of the wave, the height of the wave,

00:40:55.579 --> 00:41:01.160
sometimes adds constructively and sometimes
destructively. So that sometimes you get twice

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:06.369
the height and sometimes you get nothing.

00:41:06.369 --> 00:41:11.859
So just because it's fun to see this, here's
Young's actual diagram from his original note

00:41:11.859 --> 00:41:18.640
on the double-slit experiment. So a and b
are the slits, and c, d and f are the [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:27.690
on the screen, the distant screen. He drew
it by hand. It's pretty good.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:32.039
So we've known for a very long time that light,
because of the double-slit experiment, light

00:41:32.039 --> 00:41:35.119
is clearly wavy, it behaves like a wave. And
what are the senses in which it behaves like

00:41:35.119 --> 00:41:44.940
a wave? There are two important senses here.
The first is answered by the question, where

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:55.430
did the wave hit the screen? So when we send
in a wave, you know, I drop a stone, one big

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.900
pulsive wave comes out. It splits into-- it
leads to new waves being instigated here and

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:07.700
over here. Where did that wave hit the screen?
Anyone?

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.040
AUDIENCE: Everywhere.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.259
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly. It didn't hit this
wave-- the screen in any one spot. But some

00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:15.890
amplitude shows up everywhere. The wave is
a distributed object, it does not exist at

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:20.420
one spot, and it's by virtue of the fact that
it is not a localized object-- it is not a

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:27.910
point-like object-- that it can interfere
with itself. The wave is a big large phenomena

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:31.519
in a liquid, in some thing.

00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:37.299
So it's sort of essential that it's not a
localized object. So not localized. The answer

00:42:37.299 --> 00:42:45.569
is not localized. And let's contrast this
with what happens if you take this double-slit

00:42:45.569 --> 00:42:56.120
experiment and you do it with, you know, I
don't know, take-- who. Hmm. Tim Wakefield.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.979
Let's give some love to that guy.

00:42:57.979 --> 00:43:03.729
So, baseball player. And have him throw baseballs
at a screen with two slits in it. OK? Now

00:43:03.729 --> 00:43:10.650
he's got pretty good-- well, he's got terrible
accuracy, actually. So every once in a while

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:15.150
he'll make it through the slits. So let's
imagine first blocking off-- what, he's a

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.670
knuckle-baller, right-- so every once in a
while it goes, the baseball will go through

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:19.930
the slit.

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:22.719
And let's think about what happens, so let's
cover one slit. And what we expect to happen

00:43:22.719 --> 00:43:26.759
is, well, it'll go through more or less straight,
but sometimes it'll scrape the edge, it'll

00:43:26.759 --> 00:43:30.769
go off to the side, and sometimes it'll come
over here. But if you take a whole bunch of

00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:39.309
baseballs, and-- so any one baseball, where
does it hit? Some spot. Right? One spot. Not

00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:40.519
distributed. One spot.

00:43:40.519 --> 00:43:44.739
And as a consequence, you know, one goes here,
one goes there, one goes there. And now, there's

00:43:44.739 --> 00:43:50.059
nothing like interference effects, but what
happens is as it sort of doesn't-- you get

00:43:50.059 --> 00:43:54.309
some distribution if you look at where they
all hit. Yeah? Everyone cool with that? And

00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:59.839
if we had covered over this slot, or slit,
and let the baseballs go through this one,

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:00.729
same thing would have happened.

00:44:00.729 --> 00:44:04.650
Now if we leave them both open, what happens
is sometimes it goes here, sometimes it goes

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.670
here. So now it's pretty useful that we've
got a knuckle-baller. And what you actually

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:12.989
get is the total distribution looks like this.
It's the sum of the two. But at any given

00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:16.200
time, any one baseball, you say, aha, the
baseball either went through the top slit,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.650
and more or less goes up here. Or it went
through the bottom slit and more or less goes

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:28.219
down here. So for chunks-- so this is for
waves-- for chunks or localized particles,

00:44:28.219 --> 00:44:43.190
they are localized. And as a consequence,
we get no interference.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:55.509
So for waves, they are not localized, and
we do get interference. Yes, interference.

00:44:55.509 --> 00:45:01.849
OK. So on your problem set, you're going to
deal with some calculations involving these

00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:05.509
interference effects. And I'm going to brush
over them.

00:45:05.509 --> 00:45:13.599
Anyway the point of the double-slit experiment
is that whatever else you want to say about

00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:19.769
baseballs or anything else, light, as we've
learned since 1803 in Young's double-slit

00:45:19.769 --> 00:45:23.569
experiment, light behaves like a wave. It
is not localized, it hits the screen over

00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:28.369
its entire extent. And as a consequence, we
get interference. The amplitudes add. The

00:45:28.369 --> 00:45:34.519
intensity is the square of the amplitude.
If the intensities add-- so sorry, if the

00:45:34.519 --> 00:45:39.559
amplitudes add-- amplitude total is equal
to a1 plus a2, the intensity, which is the

00:45:39.559 --> 00:45:57.920
square of a1 plus a2 squared, has interference
terms, the cross terms, from this square.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.900
So light, from this point of view, is an electromagnetic
wave. It interferes with itself. It's made

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:08.700
of chunks. And I can't help but think about
it this way, this is literally the metaphor

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:18.160
I use in my head-- light is creamy and smooth
like a wave. Chunks are very different. But

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:25.089
here's the funny thing. Light is both smooth
like a wave, it is also chunky. It is super

00:46:25.089 --> 00:46:31.900
chunky, as we have learned from the photoelectric
effect. So light is both at once. So it's

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:36.400
the best of both worlds. Everyone will be
satisfied, unless you're not from the US,

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:45.400
in which case this is deeply disturbing. So
of course the original Superchunk is a band.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:49.309
So we've learned now from Young that light
is a wave. We've learned from the photoelectric

00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:58.430
effect that light is a bunch of chunks. OK.
Most experimental results are true. So how

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:02.759
does that work? Well, we're gonna have to
deal with that.

00:47:02.759 --> 00:47:07.339
But enough about light. If this is true of
light, if light, depending on what experiment

00:47:07.339 --> 00:47:10.739
you do and how you do the experiment, sometimes
it seems like it's a wave, sometimes it seems

00:47:10.739 --> 00:47:17.180
like it's a chunk or particle, which is true?
Which is the better description?

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:21.739
So it's actually worthwhile to not think about
light all the time. Let's think about something

00:47:21.739 --> 00:47:27.099
more general. Let's stick to electrons. So
as we saw from yesterday's lecture, you probably

00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:30.589
want to be a little bit wary when thinking
about individual electrons. Things could be

00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:34.999
a little bit different than your classical
intuition. But here's a crucial thing. Before

00:47:34.999 --> 00:47:38.449
doing anything else, we can just think, which
one of these two is more likely to describe

00:47:38.449 --> 00:47:39.799
electrons well.

00:47:39.799 --> 00:47:46.190
Well electrons are localized. When you throw
an electron at a CRT, it does not hit the

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.199
whole CRT with a wavy distribution. When you
take a single electron and you throw it at

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:54.699
a CRT, it goes ping and there's a little glowing
spot. Electrons are localized. And we know

00:47:54.699 --> 00:48:02.940
that localized things don't lead to interference.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.279
Some guys at Hitachi, really good scientists
and engineers, developed some really awesome

00:48:06.279 --> 00:48:10.019
technology a couple of decades ago. They were
trying to figure out a good way to demonstrate

00:48:10.019 --> 00:48:13.680
their technology. And they decided that you
know what would be really awesome, this thought

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.579
experiment that people have always talked
about that's never been done really well,

00:48:16.579 --> 00:48:20.499
of sending an electron through a two-slitted
experiment. In this case it was like ten slits

00:48:20.499 --> 00:48:24.910
effectively, it was a grading. Send an electron,
a bunch of electrons, one at a time, throw

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:28.529
the electron, wait. Throw the electron, wait.
Like our French guy with the boat.

00:48:28.529 --> 00:48:34.349
So do this experiment with our technology
and let's see what happens. And this really

00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:42.269
is one of my favorite-- let's see, how we
close these screens-- aha. OK. This is going

00:48:42.269 --> 00:48:50.180
to take a little bit of-- and it's broken.
No, no. Oh that's so sad.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:57.620
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:07.440
PROFESSOR: Come on. I'm just gonna let-- let's
see if we can, we'll get part of the way.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.729
I don't want to destroy it. So what they actually
did is they said, look, let's-- we want to

00:49:11.729 --> 00:49:15.839
see what happens. We want to actually do this
experiment because we're so awesome at Hitachi

00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:22.289
Research Labs, so let's do it. So here's what
they did. And I'm going to turn off the light.

00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:29.599
And I set this to some music because I like
it.

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:37.529
OK here's what's happening. One at a time,
individual photons.

00:49:37.529 --> 00:49:55.280
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:05.979
PROFESSOR: So they look pretty localized.
There's not a whole lot of structure. Now

00:50:05.979 --> 00:50:13.400
they're going to start speeding it up. It's
100 times the actual speed.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:41.240
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.520
PROFESSOR: Eh? Yeah.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:49.280
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.580
PROFESSOR: So those guys know what they're
doing. Let's-- there were go. So I think I

00:50:55.589 --> 00:51:00.509
don't know of a more vivid example of electron
interference than that one. It's totally obvious.

00:51:00.509 --> 00:51:04.069
You see individual electrons. They run through
the apparatus. You wait, they run through

00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:08.529
the apparatus. You wait. One at a time, single
electron, like a baseball being pitched through

00:51:08.529 --> 00:51:12.660
two slits, and what you see is an interference
effect. But you don't see the interference

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:16.400
effect like you do from light, from waves
on the sea.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.079
You see the interference effect by looking
at the cumulative stacking up of all the electrons

00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:25.680
as they hit. Look at where all the electrons
hit one at a time. So is an electron behaving

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:35.339
like a wave in a pond? No. Does a wave in
a pond at a spot? No. It's a distributed beast.

00:51:35.339 --> 00:51:40.650
OK yes, it interferes, but it's not localized.
Well is it behaving like a baseball? Well

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:41.969
it's localized.

00:51:41.969 --> 00:51:47.440
But on-- when I look at a whole bunch of electrons,
they do that. They seem to interfere, but

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.079
there's only one electron going through at
a time. So in some sense it's interfering

00:51:50.079 --> 00:51:54.239
with itself. How does that work? Is an electron
a wave?

00:51:54.239 --> 00:51:56.569
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:56.569 --> 00:52:00.130
PROFESSOR: Does an electron hit at many spots
at once?

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:00.880
AUDIENCE: No.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:08.920
PROFESSOR: No. So is an electron a wave. No.
Is an electron a baseball? No. It's an electron.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:14.029
So this is something you're going to have
to deal with, that every once in awhile we

00:52:14.029 --> 00:52:17.150
have these wonderful moments where it's useful
to think about an electron as behaving in

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:21.699
a wave-like sense. Sometimes it's useful to
think about it as behaving in a particle-like

00:52:21.699 --> 00:52:25.630
sense. But it is not a particle like you normally
conceive of a baseball. And it is not a wave

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:35.680
like you normally conceive of a wave on the
surface of a pond. It's an electron.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:41.229
I like to think about this like an elephant.
If you're closing your eyes and you walk up

00:52:41.229 --> 00:52:44.670
to an elephant, you might think like I've
got a snake and I've got a tree trunk and,

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:48.739
you know, there's a fan over here. And you
wouldn't know, like, maybe it's a wave, maybe

00:52:48.739 --> 00:52:52.650
it's a particle, I can't really tell. But
if you could just see the thing the way it

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:57.569
is, not through the preconceived sort of notions
you have, you'd see it's an elephant. Yes,

00:52:57.569 --> 00:53:03.709
that is the Stata Center. So-- look, everything
has to happen sometime, right?

00:53:03.709 --> 00:53:06.780
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:12.600
PROFESSOR: So Heisenberg-- it's often, people
often give the false impression in popular

00:53:12.609 --> 00:53:16.369
books on physics, so I want to subvert this,
that in the early days of quantum mechanics,

00:53:16.369 --> 00:53:23.609
the early people like Born and Oppenheimer
and Heisenberg who invented quantum mechanics,

00:53:23.609 --> 00:53:26.880
they were really tortured about, you know,
is it an electron, is it a wave. It's a wave-particle

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:31.740
duality. It's both. And this is one of the
best subversions of that sort of silliness

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:32.300
that I know of.

00:53:32.319 --> 00:53:36.019
And so what Heisenberg says, the two mental
pictures which experiments lead us to form,

00:53:36.019 --> 00:53:41.259
the one of particles the other waves, are
both incomplete and have the validity of analogies,

00:53:41.259 --> 00:53:46.099
which are accurate only in limited cases.
The apparent duality rises in the limitation

00:53:46.099 --> 00:53:50.390
of our language. And then he goes on to say,
look, you developed your intuition by throwing

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:56.239
rocks and, you know, swimming. And, duh, that's
not going to be very good for atoms.

00:53:56.239 --> 00:54:01.609
So this will be posted, it's really wonderful.
His whole lecture is really-- the lectures

00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:05.440
are really quite lovely. And by the way, that's
him in the middle there, Pauley all the way

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:12.279
on the right. I guess they were pleased. OK
so that's the Hitachi thing.

00:54:12.279 --> 00:54:19.539
So now let's pick up on this, though. Let's
pick up on this and think about what happens.

00:54:19.539 --> 00:54:23.599
I want to think in a little more detail about
this Hitachi experiment. And I want to think

00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:28.099
about it in the context of a simple two-slit
experiment. So here's our source of electrons.

00:54:28.099 --> 00:54:31.690
It's literally a gun, an electron gun. And
it's firing off electrons. And here's our

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:37.259
barrier, and it has two slits in it.

00:54:37.259 --> 00:54:44.049
And we know that any individual electron hits
its own spot. But when we take many of them,

00:54:44.049 --> 00:54:48.380
we get an interference effect. We get interference
fringes. And so the number that hit a given

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:57.390
spot fill up, construct this distribution.
So then here's the question I want to ask.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:01.839
When I take a single electron, I shoot one
electron at a time through this experiment,

00:55:01.839 --> 00:55:06.430
one electron. It could go through the top
slit, it could go through the bottom slit.

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:12.960
While it's inside the apparatus, which path
does it take?

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.920
AUDIENCE: Superposition.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.939
PROFESSOR: Good. So did it take the top path?

00:55:17.939 --> 00:55:18.799
AUDIENCE: No.

00:55:18.799 --> 00:55:20.249
PROFESSOR: How do you know?

00:55:20.249 --> 00:55:23.400
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:28.959
PROFESSOR: Good, let's block the bottom, OK,
to force it to go through the top slit. So

00:55:28.959 --> 00:55:32.619
we'll block the bottom slit. Now the only
electrons that make it through go through

00:55:32.619 --> 00:55:37.839
the top slit. Half of them don't make it through.
But those that do make it through give you

00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:43.390
this distribution. No interference. But I
didn't tell you these are hundreds of thousands

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:47.430
of kilometers apart, the person who threw
in the electron didn't know whether there

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:50.599
was a barrier here. The electron, how could
it possibly know whether there was a barrier

00:55:50.599 --> 00:55:52.089
here if you went through the top.

00:55:52.089 --> 00:55:57.719
This is exactly like our boxes. It's exactly
like our box. Did it go through-- an electron,

00:55:57.719 --> 00:56:03.229
when the slits are both open and we know that
ensemble average it will give us an interference

00:56:03.229 --> 00:56:08.329
effect, did the electron inside the apparatus
go through the top path? No. Did it go through

00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:13.489
the bottom path? Did it go through both? Because
we only see one electron. Did it go through

00:56:13.489 --> 00:56:14.969
neither? It is in a--

00:56:14.969 --> 00:56:16.360
AUDIENCE: Superposition.

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.140
PROFESSOR: --of having gone through the top
and the bottom. Of being along the top half

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:25.519
and being along the bottom path. This is a
classic example of the two-box experiment.

00:56:25.519 --> 00:56:34.529
OK. So you want to tie that together.

00:56:34.529 --> 00:56:37.779
So let's nuance this just a little bit, though,
because it's going to have an interesting

00:56:37.779 --> 00:56:47.650
implication for gravity. So here's the nuance
I want to pull on this one. Let's cheat. OK.

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:53.939
Suppose I want to measure which slit the electron
actually did go through. How might I do that?

00:56:53.939 --> 00:56:57.630
Well I could do the course thing I've been
doing which is I could block it and just catch

00:56:57.630 --> 00:57:02.420
the-- catch electrons that go through in that
spot. But that's a little heavy-handed. Probably

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.529
I can do something a little more delicate.

00:57:03.529 --> 00:57:11.979
And so here's the more delicate thing I'm
going to do. I want to build a detector that

00:57:11.979 --> 00:57:17.259
uses very, very, very weak light, extremely
weak light, to detect whether the particle

00:57:17.259 --> 00:57:20.920
went through here or here. And the way I can
do that is I can sort of shine light through

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:27.380
and-- I'm gonna, you know, bounce-- so here's
my source of light. And I'll be able to tell

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:31.779
whether the electron went through this slit
or it went through this slit. Cool?

00:57:31.779 --> 00:57:38.479
So imagine I did that. So obviously I don't
want to use some giant, huge, ultra high-energy

00:57:38.479 --> 00:57:41.279
laser because it would just blast the thing
out of the way. It would destroy the experiment.

00:57:41.279 --> 00:57:45.979
So I wanna something very diffuse, very low
energy, very low intensity electromagnetic

00:57:45.979 --> 00:57:51.209
wave. And the idea here is that, OK, it's
true that when I bounce this light off an

00:57:51.209 --> 00:57:56.439
electron, let's say it bounces off an electron
here, it's true it's going impart some momentum

00:57:56.439 --> 00:58:00.079
and the electron's gonna change its course.
But if it's really, really weak, low energy

00:58:00.079 --> 00:58:03.199
light, then it's-- it's gonna deflect only
a little tiny bit.

00:58:03.199 --> 00:58:08.569
So it will change the pattern I get over here.
But it will change it in some relatively minor

00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:13.749
way because I've just thrown in very, very
low energy light. Yeah? That make sense? So

00:58:13.749 --> 00:58:24.320
this is the experiment I want to do. This
experiment doesn't work. Why.

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:27.160
AUDIENCE: You know which slit it went through.

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:31.100
PROFESSOR: No. It's true that it turns out
that those are correlated facts, but here's

00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:36.089
the problem. I can run this experiment without
anyone actually knowing what happens until

00:58:36.089 --> 00:58:42.170
long afterwards. So knowing doesn't seem to
play any role in it. It's very tempting often

00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:46.170
to say, no, but it turns out that it's really
not about what you know. It's really just

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:47.499
about the experiment you're doing.

00:58:47.499 --> 00:58:53.140
So what principle that we've already run into
today makes it impossible to make this work?

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:58.269
If I want to shine really low-energy, really
diffuse light through, and have it scatter

00:58:58.269 --> 00:59:01.580
weakly. Yeah.

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:05.400
AUDIENCE: Um, light is chunky.

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:10.660
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly. That's exactly right.
So when I say really low-energy light, I don't--

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:14.549
I really can't mean, because we've already
done this experiment, I cannot possibly mean

00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:20.499
low intensity. Because intensity doesn't control
the energy imparted by the light. The thing

00:59:20.499 --> 00:59:25.079
that controls the energy imparted by a collision
of the light with the electron is the frequency.

00:59:25.079 --> 00:59:28.999
The energy in a chunk of light is proportional
to the frequency.

00:59:28.999 --> 00:59:33.499
So now if I want to make the effect the energy
or the momentum, similarly-- the momentum,

00:59:33.499 --> 00:59:39.229
where did it go-- remember the momentum goes
like h over lambda. If I want to make the

00:59:39.229 --> 00:59:42.079
energy really low, I need to make the frequency
really low. Or if I want to make the momentum

00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:47.369
really low, I need to make the wavelength
what? Really big. Right? So in order to make

00:59:47.369 --> 00:59:51.489
the momentum imparted by this photon really
low, I need to make the wavelength really

00:59:51.489 --> 00:59:52.089
long.

00:59:52.089 --> 00:59:58.299
But now here's the problem. If I make the
wavelength really long, so if I use a really

00:59:58.299 --> 01:00:03.380
long-wavelengthed wave, like this long of
a wavelength, are you ever going to be able

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:07.369
to tell which slit it went through? No, because
the particle could have been anywhere. It

01:00:07.369 --> 01:00:10.739
could have scattered this light if it was
here, if it was here, if it was here, right?

01:00:10.739 --> 01:00:15.569
In order to measure where the electron is
to some reasonable precision-- so, for example,

01:00:15.569 --> 01:00:19.599
to this sort of wavelength, I need to be able
to send in light with a wavelength that's

01:00:19.599 --> 01:00:25.479
comparable to the scale that I want to measure.
And it turns out that if you run through and

01:00:25.479 --> 01:00:30.589
just do the calculation, suppose I send in--
and this is done in the books, in I think

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:37.029
all four, but this is done in the books on
the reading list-- if you send in a wave with

01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:41.719
a short enough wavelength to be able to distinguish
between these two slits, which slit did it

01:00:41.719 --> 01:00:47.309
go through, the momentum that it imparts precisely
watches-- washes out is just enough to wash

01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:52.509
out the interference effect, and break up
these fringes so you don't see interference

01:00:52.509 --> 01:00:55.229
effects.

01:00:55.229 --> 01:00:59.880
It's not about what you know. It's about the
particulate nature of light and the fact that

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:06.880
the momentum of a chunk of light goes like
h over lambda. OK? But this tells you something

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:13.979
really interesting. Did I have to use light
to do this measurement? I could have sent

01:01:13.979 --> 01:01:17.650
in anything, right? I didn't have to bounce
light off these things.

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:24.519
I could have bounced off gravitational waves.
So if I had a gravitational wave detector,

01:01:24.519 --> 01:01:29.939
so-- Matt works on gravitational wave detectors,
and so, I didn't tell you this but Matt gave

01:01:29.939 --> 01:01:34.420
me a pretty killer gravitational wave detector.
It's, you know, here it is. There's my awesome

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:38.130
gravitational wave detector. And I'm now going
to build supernova. OK.

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.519
And they are creeping under this black hole,
and it's going to create giant gravitational

01:01:40.519 --> 01:01:44.369
waves. And we're gonna use those gravitational
waves and detect them with the super advanced

01:01:44.369 --> 01:01:48.859
LIGO. And I'm gonna detect which slit it went
through. But gravitational waves, those aren't

01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:52.670
photons. So I really can make a low-intensity
gravitational wave, and then I can tell which

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:59.429
slit it went through without destroying the
interference effect. That would be awesome.

01:01:59.429 --> 01:02:05.699
What does that tell you about gravitational
waves? They must come in chunks. In order

01:02:05.699 --> 01:02:09.679
for this all to fit together logically, you
need all the interactions that you could scatter

01:02:09.679 --> 01:02:15.029
off this to satisfy these quantization properties.
But the energy is proportional to the frequency.

01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:18.979
The line I just gave you is a heuristic. And
making it precise is one of the great challenges

01:02:18.979 --> 01:02:23.890
of modern contemporary high-energy physics,
of dealing with the quantum mechanics and

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:24.839
gravity together.

01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:30.140
But this gives you a strong picture of why
we need to treat all forces in all interactions

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:39.589
quantum-mechanically in order for the world
to be consistent. OK. Good. OK, questions

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:51.679
at this point? OK. So-- oh, I forgot about
this one-- so there are actually two more.

01:02:51.679 --> 01:02:55.029
So I want to just quickly show you-- well,
OK.

01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:59.549
So, this is a gorgeous experiment. So remember
I told you the story of the guy with the boat

01:02:59.549 --> 01:03:05.029
and the opaque wall and it turns out that's
a cheat. It turns out that this opaque screen

01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:11.939
doesn't actually give you quantum mechanically
isolated photons. They're still, in a very

01:03:11.939 --> 01:03:17.179
important way, classical. So this experiment
was done truly with a source that gives you

01:03:17.179 --> 01:03:20.359
quantum mechanically isolated single photons,
one at a time.

01:03:20.359 --> 01:03:26.759
So this is the analogue of the Hitachi experiment.
And it was done by this pretty awesome Japanese

01:03:26.759 --> 01:03:30.599
group some number of years ago. And I just
want to emphasize that it gives you exactly

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:34.519
the same effects. We see that photons-- this
should look essentially identical to what

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:37.920
we saw at the end of the Hitachi video. And
that's because it's exactly the same physics.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.369
It's a grating with something like 10 slits
and individual particles going through one

01:03:42.369 --> 01:03:45.788
at a time and hitting the screen and going,
bing.

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:53.949
So what you see is the light going, bing,
on a CCD. It's a pretty spectacular experience.

01:03:53.949 --> 01:03:58.509
So let's get back to electrons. I want another
probe of whether electrons are really waves

01:03:58.509 --> 01:04:03.390
or not. So this other experiment-- again,
you're going to study this on your problem

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:11.259
set-- this other experiment was done by a
couple of characters named Davisson and Germer.

01:04:11.259 --> 01:04:15.839
And in this experiment, what they did is they
took a crystal, and a crystal is just a lattice

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:25.600
of regularly-located ions, like diamond or
something. Yeah?

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.540
AUDIENCE: Before you go on I guess,

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:33.900
I wanted to ask if the probability of a photon or an electron going through the 10 slits is about the same?

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.560
PROFESSOR: Is what, sorry?

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.839
AUDIENCE: Is exactly the same.

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:38.549
PROFESSOR: You mean for different electrons?

01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.839
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:38.839 --> 01:04:42.069
PROFESSOR: Well they can be different if the
initial conditions are different. But they

01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:46.599
could be-- if the initial conditions are the
same, then the probabilities are identical.

01:04:46.599 --> 01:04:50.379
So every electron behaves identically to every
other electron in that sense. Is that what

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.380
you were asking?

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:58.140
AUDIENCE: It is actually like through any [INAUDIBLE] the probability of it going like [INAUDIBLE]?

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:02.200
PROFESSOR: Sure, absolutely. So the issue
there is just a technological one of trying

01:05:02.219 --> 01:05:07.049
to build a beam that's perfectly columnated.
And that's just not doable. So there's always

01:05:07.049 --> 01:05:11.880
some dispersion in your beam. So in practice
it's very hard to make them identical, but

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:16.939
in principle they could be if you were infinitely
powerful as an experimentalist, which-- again,

01:05:16.939 --> 01:05:19.910
I was banned from the lab, so not me.

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:23.469
So here's our crystal. You could think of
this as diamond or nickel or whatever. I think

01:05:23.469 --> 01:05:32.140
they actually use nickel but I don't remember
exactly. And they sent in a beam of electrons.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:38.299
So they send in a beam of electrons, and what
they discover is that if you send in these

01:05:38.299 --> 01:05:44.390
electrons and watch how they scatter at various
different angles-- I'm going to call the angle

01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:54.059
here of scattering theta-- what they discover
is that the intensity of the reflected beam,

01:05:54.059 --> 01:06:03.099
as a function of theta, shows interference
effects.

01:06:03.099 --> 01:06:06.059
And in particular they gave a whole calculation
for this, which I'm not going to go through

01:06:06.059 --> 01:06:09.640
right now because it's not terribly germane
for us-- you're going to go through it on

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.679
your problem set, so that'll be good and it's
a perfect thing for your recitation instructors

01:06:12.679 --> 01:06:17.660
to go through. But the important thing is
the upshot. So if the distance between these

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:24.630
crystal planes is L-- or, sorry, d-- let me
call it d. If the distance between the crystal

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:31.059
planes is d, what they discover is that the
interference effects that they observed, these

01:06:31.059 --> 01:06:40.429
maxima and minima, are consistent with the
wavelength of light. Or, sorry, with the electrons

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:46.288
behaving as if they were waves with a definite
wavelength, with a wavelength lambda being

01:06:46.288 --> 01:06:56.239
equal to some integer, n, over 2d sine theta.

01:06:56.239 --> 01:07:01.449
So this is the data-- these are the data they
actually saw, data are plural. And these are

01:07:01.449 --> 01:07:06.049
the data they actually saw. And they infer
from this that the electrons are behaving

01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:11.079
as if they were wave-like with this wavelength.
And what they actually see are individual

01:07:11.079 --> 01:07:13.839
electrons hitting one by one. Although in
their experiment, they couldn't resolve individual

01:07:13.839 --> 01:07:15.799
electrons. But that is what they see.

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:21.538
And so in particular, plugging all of this
back into the experiment, you send in the

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:24.660
electrons with some energy, which corresponds
to some definite momentum. This leads us back

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:29.809
to the same expression as before, that the
momentum is equal to h over lambda, with this

01:07:29.809 --> 01:07:35.229
lambda associated. So it turns out that this
is correct.

01:07:35.229 --> 01:07:40.420
So the electrons diffract off the crystal
as if they have a momentum which comes with

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:48.759
a definite wavelength corresponding to its
momentum. So that's experimental result--

01:07:48.759 --> 01:07:53.999
oh, I forgot to check off four-- that's experimental
result five, that electrons diffract. We already

01:07:53.999 --> 01:07:57.959
saw the electron diffraction.

01:07:57.959 --> 01:08:04.150
So something to emphasize is that-- so these
experiments as we've described them were done

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:09.559
with photons and with electrons, but you can
imagine doing the experiments with soccer

01:08:09.559 --> 01:08:14.390
balls. This is of course hard. Quantum effects
for macroscopic objects are usually insignificantly

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:19.830
small. However, this experiment was done with
Buckyballs, which are the same shape as soccer

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:26.189
balls in some sense. But they're huge, they're
gigantic objects. So here's the experiment

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:31.819
in which this was actually done. So these
guys are just totally amazing. So this is

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:38.580
Zellinger's lab. And it doesn't look like
all-- I mean it looks kind of, you know. It's

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.420
hideous, right? I mean to a theorist it's
like, come on, you've got to be kidding that

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.710
that's--

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:47.640
But here's what a theorist is happy about.
You know, because it looks simple. We really

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.318
love lying to ourselves about that. So here's
an over. We're going to cook up some Buckyballs

01:08:52.318 --> 01:08:57.000
and emit them with some definite known thermal
energy. Known to some accuracy. We're going

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.830
to columnate them by sending them through
a single slit, and then we're going to send

01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:03.000
them through a diffraction grating which,
again, is just a whole bunch of slits.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:09.818
And then we're going to image them using photo
ionization and see where they pop through.

01:09:09.818 --> 01:09:16.559
So here is the horizontal position of this
wave along the grating, and this is the number

01:09:16.559 --> 01:09:20.660
that come through. This is literally one by
one counts because they're going bing, bing,

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:25.479
bing, as a c60 molecule goes through. So without
the grating, you just get a peek. But with

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:29.540
the grating, you get the side bands. You get
interference fringes.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:36.910
So these guys, again, they're going through
one by one. A single Buckyball, 60 carbons,

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:41.479
going through one by one is interfering with
itself. This is a gigantic object by any sort

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:47.899
of comparison to single electrons. And we're
seeing these interference fringes.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:51.160
So this is a pretty tour de force experiment,
but I just want to emphasize that if you could

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.910
do this with your neighbor, it would work.
You'd just have to isolate the system well

01:09:55.910 --> 01:10:02.559
enough. And that's a technological challenge
but not an in-principle one.

01:10:02.559 --> 01:10:16.460
OK. So we have one last experimental facts
to deal with. And this is Bell's Inequality,

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:24.940
and this is my favorite one. So Bell's Inequality
for many years languished in obscurity until

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:28.960
someone realized that it could actually be
done beautifully in an experiment that led

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:32.309
to a very concrete experiment that they could
actually do and that they wanted to do.

01:10:32.309 --> 01:10:39.460
And we now think of it as an enormously influential
idea which nails the coffin closed for classical

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:46.110
mechanics. And it starts with a very simple
question. I claim that the following inequality

01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:54.720
is true: the number of undergraduate-- of
the number of people in the room who are undergraduates,

01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:00.350
which I'll denote as U-- and not blonde, which
I will denote as bar B-- so undergraduates

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:04.840
who are not blonde-- actually let me write
this out in English. It's gonna be easier.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:18.530
Number who are undergrads and not blonde plus
the number of people in the room who are blonde

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:27.970
but not from Massachusetts is strictly greater
than or equal to the number of people in the

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:36.960
room who are undergraduates and not from Massachusetts.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.960
I claim that this is true. I haven't checked

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.860
in this room. But I claim that this is true.

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:47.860
So let's check. How many people are undergraduates
who are not blonde? OK this is going to--

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:56.110
jeez. OK that's-- so, lots. OK. How many people
are blonde but not from Massachusetts? OK.

01:11:56.110 --> 01:12:01.860
A smattering. Oh God, this is actually going
to be terrible.

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:11.860
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:21.559
PROFESSOR: Shoot. This is a really large class.
OK. Small. And how many people are undergraduates

01:12:21.559 --> 01:12:25.520
who are not from Massachusetts? Yeah, this--
oh God. This counting is going to be-- so

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.600
let's-- I'm going to do this just so I can
do the counting with the first two rows here.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.710
OK. My life is going to be easier this way.

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:34.270
So how many people in the first two rows,
in the center section, are undergraduates

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:40.550
but not blonde? One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:45.790
thirteen, fourteen. We could dispute some
of those, but we'll take it for the moment.

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:52.110
So, fourteen. You're probably all undergraduates.
So blonde and not from Massachusetts. One.

01:12:52.110 --> 01:13:01.180
Awesome. Undergraduates not from Massachusetts.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:07.460
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen. Equality.

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.030
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:15.150
PROFESSOR: OK. So that-- you might say well,
look, you should have been nervous there.

01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:19.809
You know, and admittedly sometimes there's
experimental error. But I want to convince

01:13:19.809 --> 01:13:25.620
you that I should never, ever ever be nervous
about this moment in 8.04. And the reason is

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.630
the following. I want to prove this for you.
And the way I'm gonna prove it is slightly

01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:33.000
more general, in more generality. And I want
to prove to you that the number-- if I have

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.059
a set, or, sorry, if the number of people
who are undergraduates and not blonde which,

01:13:37.059 --> 01:13:43.250
all right, is b bar plus the number who are
blonde but not from Massachusetts is greater

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:48.840
than or equal to the number that are undergraduates
and not from Massachusetts.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:54.040
So how do I prove this? Well if you're an
undergraduate and not blonde, you may or you

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:58.540
may not be from Massachusetts. So this is
equal to the number of undergraduates who

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:03.750
are not blonde and are from Massachusetts
plus the number of undergraduates who are

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:09.920
not blonde and are not from Massachusetts.
It could hardly be otherwise. You either are

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:15.690
or you are not from Massachusetts. Not the
sort of thing that you normally see in physics.

01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:19.460
So this is the number of people who are blonde
and not from Massachusetts, number of people

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:23.570
who are blonde, who are-- so if you're blonde
and not from Massachusetts, you may or may

01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:27.300
not be an undergraduate. So this is the number
of people who are undergraduates, blonde,

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:32.350
and not from Massachusetts plus the number
of people who are not undergraduates, are

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:36.040
blonde and are not from Massachusetts.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:42.330
And on the right hand side-- so, adding these
two together gives us plus and plus. On the

01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:45.080
right hand side, the number of people that
are undergraduates and not from Massachusetts,

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.720
well each one could be either blonde or not
blonde. So this is equal to the number that

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.520
are undergraduates, blonde, and not from Massachusetts,

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.740
plus-- remember that our undergraduates not

01:14:56.750 --> 01:15:00.440
blonde and not from Massachusetts. Agreed?

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:05.460
I am now going to use the awesome power of--
and so this is what we want to prove, and

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:12.150
I'm going to use the awesome power of subtraction.
And note that U, B, M bar, these guys cancel.

01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:19.380
And U, B bar, M bar, these guys cancel. And
we're left with the following proposition:

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:23.750
the number of undergraduates who are not blonde
but are from Massachusetts plus the number

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:27.809
of undergrad-- of non-undergraduates who are
blonde but not from Massachusetts must be

01:15:27.809 --> 01:15:31.570
greater than or equal to zero.

01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:37.800
Can you have a number of people in a room
satisfying some condition be less than zero?

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:44.260
Can minus 3 of you be blonde undergraduates
not from Massachusetts? Not so much. This

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:47.570
is a strictly positive number, because it's
a numerative. It's a counting problem. How

01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:53.230
many are undergraduates not blonde and from
Massachusetts. Yeah? Everyone cool with that?

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:56.090
So it could hardly have been otherwise. It
had to work out like this.

01:15:56.090 --> 01:16:01.670
And here's the more general statement. The
more general statement is that the number

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:06.410
of people, or the number of elements of any
set where each element in that set has binary

01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:12.780
properties a b and c-- a or not a, b or not
b, c or not c. Satisfies the following inequality.

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:19.450
The number who are a but not b plus the number
who are b but not c is greater than or equal

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:27.160
to the number who are a but not c. And this
is exactly the same argument.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:35.020
And this inequality which is a tautology,
really, is called Bell's Inequality. And it's

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:43.190
obviously true. What did I use to derive this?
Logic and integers, right? I mean, that's

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:46.520
bedrock stuff.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:53.390
Here's the problem. I didn't mention this
last time, but in fact electrons have a third

01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:58.830
property in addition to-- electrons have a
third property in addition to hardness and

01:16:58.830 --> 01:17:05.080
color. The third property is called whimsy,
and you can either be whimsical or not whimsical.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.270
And every electron, when measured, is either
whimsical or not whimsical. You never have

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:14.580
a boring electron. You never have an ambiguous
electron. Always whimsical or not whimsical.

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:20.800
So we have hardness, we have color, we have
whimsy. OK. And I can perform the following

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:31.030
experiment. From a set of electrons, I can
measure the number that are hard and not black,

01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:40.960
plus the number that are black but not whimsical.
And I can measure the number that are hard

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.520
and not whimsical. OK?

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.460
And I want to just open up the case a little
bit and tell you that the hardness here really

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:56.380
is the angular momentum of the electron along
the x-axis. Color is the angular momentum

01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:01.210
of the electron along the y-axis. And whimsy
is the angular momentum of the electron along

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:05.830
the z-axis. These are things I can measure
because I can measure angular momentum.

01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:16.559
So I can perform this experiment with electrons
and it needn't be satisfied. In particular,

01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:24.080
we will show that the number of electrons,
just to be very precise, the number of electrons

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:30.470
in a given set, which have positive angular
momentum along the x-axis and down along the

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:38.520
y-axis, plus up along the y-axis and down
along the z-axis, is less than the number

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:46.610
that are up. Actually let me do this in a
very particular way. Up... zero down at theta.

01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:53.790
Up at theta, down at-- two theta is greater
than the number that are up at zero and down at theta.

01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:59.130
Now here's the thing-- two theta. You can't
at the moment understand what this equation

01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:06.030
means. But if I just tell you that these are
three binary properties of the electron, OK,

01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:11.850
and that it violates this inequality, there
is something deeply troubling about this result.

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:18.770
Bell's Inequality, which we proved-- trivially,
using integers, using logic-- is false in

01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:19.830
quantum mechanics.

01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:23.800
And it's not just false in quantum mechanics.
We will at the end of the course derive the

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:27.460
quantum mechanical prediction for this result
and show that at least to a predicted violation

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:33.870
of Bell's Inequality. This experiment has
been done, and the real world violates Bell's

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:39.880
Inequality. Logic and integers and adding
probabilities, as we have done, is misguided.

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:44.460
And our job, which we will begin with the
next lecture, is to find a better way to add

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:49.980
probabilities than classically. And that will
be quantum mechanics See you on Tuesday.
