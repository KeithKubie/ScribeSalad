00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This last point called for a quiz.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Why is it better to have an automated test rather than a problem report?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Is it that you can always check whether the problem persists

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
by running the automated test?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Is it that you can always reproduce the problem?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If the test fails, you can start debugging right away?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Or you can query as much additional information as you need?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Check all that apply.
