00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.450
Most of our lives are spent in situations
of numbing sterility. There is usually no

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.119
option but to conform and obey boring
rules. We don’t in our work generally create

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.140
anything of particular wonder or interest.
We don’t know how to paint or play Chopin’s

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.470
Scherzo No. 2 in B flat minor. We can’t
personally manufacture an iphone; we don’t

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.860
don’t know how to extract oil from the ground.
And yet, without being conscious of the specifics,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:42.260
we are at points capable of doing something
properly miraculous: we can make another person.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.809
We can conjure up the limbs and organs of
a fellow creature. We can create a liver,

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.559
we can design someone else’s brain, we can
– by ingesting a mixed diet perhaps including

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.859
bananas, cheese sandwiches and ginger biscuits
– make fingers, we can connect neurones

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.000
that will transmit thoughts about the history
of the Ancient Persians or the workings of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.590
the dishwasher. We can choreograph the birth
of an organic machine that will probably still

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.229
be going close to a hundred years from now.
We can be the master coordinator and chief

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.630
designer of a product more advanced than any
technology and more complex and interesting

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.409
than the greatest work of art. Having a child
definitively refutes any worry about our lack

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.200
of creativity and dismantles (at least for
while) the envy we might otherwise feel about

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.299
the inventiveness of others. They may have
written a stirring song, started and sold

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.149
a bio-engineering company or plotted an engaging
novel. But we will have created the oddest

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.230
yet most inspiring work of art and science
around: one that is alive; one that will develop

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.100
its own centers of happiness and secrecy;
that will one day do its homework, get a job,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.100
hate us, forgive us, end up being, despite
itself, a bit like us and eventually, make

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.680
humans of its own that can spawn themselves
into perpetuity. However much they may resent

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.250
one another, grow apart or be worn down by
the humdrum nature of family life, parents

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.080
and children are never entirely able to get
past the supernatural sequence of events that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.990
connects creators and created. Because two
people met fifteen years ago in a friend’s

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.941
kitchen, liked the look of one another, swapped
phone numbers and went out for dinner, there

00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:33.330
is now – across the table – a being with
a particular sort of nose, a distinctive emotional

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.480
temperament and a way of smiling that (as
everyone remarks) unnervingly echoes that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.830
of a dead maternal grandfather.  Parenting ineluctably

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.610
demands that one address the greatest, founding
philosophical question: what is a good life?

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.720
As we go about answering it live in our words
and actions over long years, we will at least

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.490
know that we have been spared the one great
fear that otherwise haunts us and usually

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.030
manifests itself around work: that of not
being able to make a difference. There will

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.290
not be the remotest danger of lacking impact,
only of unwittingly exerting the wrong kind.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.790
We will as parents be the biographers, coaches, teachers,
chefs, photographers, masters and slaves of

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.290
our new charges. Our work will lend us the
opportunity to show our worst, but also our

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.310
best selves in action: it is the particular
words we will find, the touch of our hands,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.120
the encouraging look only we will be able
to give, the swerve towards lenience or the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.660
brave defence of principles that will make
a decisive difference to the sorrows and joys

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.520
of another human being. Who we are every day,
the specific individuals we will have matured

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.940
into, will have an unparalleled power to exert
a beneficial influence on somebody else’s

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.980
life. We will – in our role as parents – be
terrified, exhausted, resentful, enchanted

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.500
and forever spared any lingering doubt as
to our significance or role on the earth.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.070
