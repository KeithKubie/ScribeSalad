00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:09.690
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning and
welcome to "Talks at Google"

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.560
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.149
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Tom Clynes.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.090
Tom is a science
journalist, photographer,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.220
and professional speaker.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.030
He's covered environmental
issues, energy,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.650
and science stories
around the world,

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.070
taking memorable
photos along the way.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.340
He's here today to talk
about his latest book.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.330
In 2010, as contributing editor
for "Popular Science Magazine,"

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.270
he wrote about a community of
nuclear physics enthusiasts,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.850
hobbyists who were
reproducing in labs

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.610
they'd built themselves, what
scientists were accomplishing

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.790
in layou-- in the world's
most sophisticated research

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.380
facilities.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.200
One of these amateurs was a
14-year-old boy from Texarkana

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.030
who had just become
one of 32 people

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.620
to build a working
nuclear fusion reactor.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.820
The story Tom wrote
turned in the book

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.860
he's here to discuss today,
"The Boy Who Played with Fusion:

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.960
Extreme Science,
Extreme Parenting,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.370
and How to Make a Star."

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.725
It's the extraordinary
account of how

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:23.600
one exceptionally gifted
young man, Taylor Wilson,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.130
with nearly endless
patience and support

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.500
from his parents
and allies realized

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.620
his early potential, emphasis
on the patience and support.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.830
Taylor's limitless curiosity
and outsized personality

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.230
have made him a force
of nature on par

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.655
with those he's
worked to harness.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.760
This is also, I'm guessing,
the only book any of us

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.030
will read this
year that describes

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.020
a pivotal event in these terms.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.700
The moment were a small boy
stirred his dying grandmother's

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.470
pee.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.450
There's something unexpected
on just about every page here.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.920
In the Q and A, you might ask
Tom about quack radium cures

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.505
in the 1920s if you want to
get into unexpected things.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:16.078
In the meantime, please join
me in welcoming Tom Clynes.

00:02:16.078 --> 00:02:21.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.650
TOM CLYNES: OK.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.370
Thank you John, appreciate it.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.170
And thanks everyone
for coming out.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.650
So I want to tell you a
story about the youngest

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.420
person on Earth to achieve
a nuclear fusion reaction.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.860
But beyond that I think
what's more interesting

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.330
is what he chose to do with
his machine that he built,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.610
and we'll get into
some of that today.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.190
The story is basically a
science adventure story.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.495
It also ventures into the
outer realms of giftedness,

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:04.310
and genius, and creativity, and
more than anything parenting.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.700
In fact, I started off thinking
that this was a book about kid,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.260
but I really thought after
getting into it that it

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.480
was a book about parenting.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.069
And Taylor himself--
I would say the things

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.610
that he's accomplished
and the things

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.750
that he continues
to accomplish are

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.900
as much as a result of
having extraordinary parents

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.500
and being gifted
with those parents

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.440
as they are with his
intellectual gifts.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.020
And so we'll talk a
little bit about what

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.140
it means to parent a genius or
a child with any sort of gifts.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.540
Because when we talk
about academic giftedness,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.730
we're really talking
about 10% or up to 10%

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.327
of the population in the US.

00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:53.910
But there's other
kinds of giftedness.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.370
There's artistic giftedness.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.050
There's musical giftedness
and athletic giftedness,

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.220
all kinds of things.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.900
In fact, just about everybody
the latest science suggests

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.650
has the capacity to
work at an expert

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.610
level or a sort of
world changing level

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.690
in some domain of expertise.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.769
The real trick is
finding and matching

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.630
those gifts with
the right domain.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.030
And when you do find that
match, especially if you find it

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.420
early in your life
or a child's life,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.770
it's amazing how quickly
things can happen.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.080
So the story as John said
started with a 2010 "Popular

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.260
Science" story.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.090
And I was really interested in
the high energy amateur science

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.620
communities.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.078
These people that
were doing things

00:04:48.078 --> 00:04:49.820
like splitting atoms
in their garages,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.410
and fusing atomic nuclei
in their basement,

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.550
and building particle
accelerators,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.300
and really doing things
that mostly people

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.464
do at these large state-funded
research laboratories.

00:05:02.464 --> 00:05:04.130
But they were doing
them as individuals.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.865
So I started getting
into this community.

00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:10.460
I was really interested
that these people

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.610
had mastered both the formidable
physics of nuclear fusion--

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.440
and other sorts of
high energy physics--

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.570
and also the hands on sort
of engineering skills.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.770
And really something
that Taylor did

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.660
requires some
expertise in about 40

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.580
different scientific
and technical fields,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.660
everything from nuclear
engineering and plasma physics

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.009
to vacuum technology,
which is something

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.050
that I don't think you
can even go to school for.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.210
It's sort of a black art.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.040
You have to really figure it out
by having mentors, and doing it

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.370
yourself, and trial and error.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.272
So the story for
me was a departure

00:05:52.272 --> 00:05:53.230
from what I usually do.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.280
Because it was so
incredibly optimistic.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.630
I typically cover things
like Ebola epidemics,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.352
and scientific slap fights
that end careers, the battle

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:10.060
over climate change
and the people trying

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.720
to influence that debate,
or some eco-mercenaries

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.320
in central Africa trying to
protect rhinos and elephants,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.040
and some of their
hard drinking friends

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.390
that came along for the ride.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.120
Actually we rescued this
guy from a bushmeat market

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.180
while we were on
that assignment.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.230
And he quickly learned
to swipe our beers.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.050
We didn't actually give
him beers and we wouldn't.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.550
But you couldn't set up a beer
down for more than a couple

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.758
seconds without this chimp
running over, and grabbing

00:06:37.758 --> 00:06:39.580
your beer, and
running up in a tree,

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.840
and laughing at you while
he downed the bottle.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.340
So, for me getting into
something like this

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.610
was really, really different.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:56.100
Taylor is a really-- he's not
your typical science nerd.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.200
He's not over in the corner
sort of skulking at the science

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.820
fair.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.620
He's very switched on.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.910
He's very eyes
up, very hands on.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.920
He's very good at drawing
people into his orbit

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.920
and talking people into things,
talking people out of things.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.420
And he's been like this
ever since he was a child.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.210
When he was very
small, his parents

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.300
said, Yeah, this was a really
hard kid to keep on the ground.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.590
When he was five, he got into
construction like a lot of boys

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.090
do.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.690
In fact my sons Charlie
and Joe are here,

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.540
and they were into
construction too.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.450
But Taylor took it a
little bit farther.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.840
He didn't want anything to do
with toys, construction toys,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.532
Tonka trucks and
things like that.

00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:36.990
For his fifth
birthday, his parents

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.580
took him to a Toys R Us store
and said pick out any crane,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.530
because he'd said
he wanted a crane.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.360
And he stopped his feet.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.420
And he said, No,
I want a real one.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.800
And so this is
about the time when

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.740
most dads would put their
own feet down and say,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.150
what do I got to do?

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.350
Well, his dad actually
called a friend

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.920
to bring over a crane for
his fifth birthday party.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.250
And the kids all sat on
the lap of the operator

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.590
while they swung the
boom-- this isn't it

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.360
actually-- swung the
boom over the rooftops

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.660
in the neighborhood.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.305
And so that gives you
an idea about this sort

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:19.940
of intellectual spoiling that
was going on in this household,

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.300
and the very
interesting and extreme

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.400
I would say intellectual
indulgence that was happening.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.457
Taylor got into space next.

00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:31.540
A lot of kids do that too.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.220
Myself, that's what I was
into when I was a kid.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.140
But his parents would do things
like, they'd take him out

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.880
of school to visit places
like Huntsville's US Space

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.740
and Rocket Center,
or Cape Canaveral

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.530
for a launch of the shuttle.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.110
They said, we never
had any qualms

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.389
about him missing a test
or his little brother

00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:53.430
missing a test to do
something they wanted to do.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.900
Because we thought it might
inform something later.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.130
And I kind of look at that as
sort of helicopter parenting

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.280
2.0.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.970
In that, instead of the parents
piloting the helicopters

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.690
and taking the kids
where they want to go

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.030
and hovering over them.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.160
You're actually letting the
kids pilot the helicopters.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.490
The parents jump on board
with the supplies, the fuel,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.220
the mentors, the experiences.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.930
And from what I can tell
researching the book,

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.900
I talked to dozens and dozens of
child psychologists, creativity

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.980
experts, and others,
this is really

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.570
the way you want to
cultivate a kid's talents.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.310
And especially in
the early years

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:42.020
when early novel experiences are
super important for developing

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.260
these parts of the brain, they
can actually see it in scans

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.850
that the brain development
is different when kids

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.820
have early novel experiences.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.260
And now that doesn't
mean stressful,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.479
super stressful novel
experiences all the time,

00:09:57.479 --> 00:09:58.770
that could be very destructive.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.450
They've seen that in scans too.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.590
And it's a big part
of research right now.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.700
But Taylor was indulged,
got into chemistry,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.670
he got into building
his own rockets.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.930
He wanted to make his
rockets go higher and higher.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.212
And he was buying
bigger and bigger

00:10:15.212 --> 00:10:16.670
rockets, bigger
and bigger engines,

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.370
started building
his own rockets.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.820
Then he was running out of money
to buy the engines to propel

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.320
the rockets.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.440
He wanted to get them up as high
as they do in the Black Rock

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.850
Desert, when you have to get
FAA approval to shoot them off.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.335
So he started making
his own rocket fuel.

00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:35.455
While that meant that he
had to master chemistry.

00:10:35.455 --> 00:10:37.580
And then he started making
his own biodiesel, which

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.570
he tried to talk
his dad into putting

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.216
into his fleet of
Coca-Cola trucks.

00:10:42.216 --> 00:10:43.590
Now keep in mind
both his parents

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.900
had no scientific
training whatsoever.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.654
Dad was a Coca-Cola bottler,
mom, a yoga instructor.

00:10:49.654 --> 00:10:51.070
They both would
say we didn't know

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.430
a dang thing about science.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.830
They're in southern
Arkansas, in Texarkana.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.250
This is not by any means
a technical hot bed

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.080
in the US, not much
infrastructure at all.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.670
But Taylor was mixing up
rocket fuel biodiesel.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.816
Then he got into,
instead of seeing

00:11:09.816 --> 00:11:11.190
how high his
rockets would go, he

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.260
got into seeing how
spectacularly he

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.060
could blow them up when
they got up in the air.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.600
So I guess, only a
matter of time just

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.090
like the Chinese with fireworks.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.400
And soon he was putting on
really spectacular fireworks

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.750
demonstrations all
over the neighborhood.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.410
And 4th of July was always a
big thing around their house.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:35.210
His parents didn't do-- and
this becomes even more apparent

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.520
later on-- they didn't do what
most of us sort of intuitively

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.710
do, which is keep our kids away
from things that can kill them.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.250
They actually found
ways to help him

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.850
learn how to do things safely.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.170
How to-- they found ways to
bring people into his life,

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.340
and bring experiences
into his life,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.020
and bring knowledge
into his life

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.860
so that he could do
these things that

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.690
pales in comparison to blowing
a few things up in the driveway.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.200
He was 10 years old.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.926
And it was his birthday.

00:12:03.926 --> 00:12:06.300
And his grandmother said, hey,
let's go to the bookstore.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.370
I want to get you any book
you want for your birthday.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.040
And Taylor went right to the
science section of course.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.690
And he picked out this book
called "The Radioactive Boy

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.230
Scout."

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.280
Has anyone read
that, or know of it?

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.720
It was a kid in
suburban Detroit who

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.820
started with the nuclear
energy scout badge,

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.830
and then took it really far
and tried to build a breeder

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.420
reactor in his backyard shed.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:40.390
And it eventually led to a
super fun cleanup of the house

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.820
and part of the neighborhood,
and the terrified neighbors

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.140
watching the belongings being
carted away, and eventually

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.590
led to an arrest and
really sort of went

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.900
in the opposite
direction as Taylor.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.135
And his parents-- the kid's name
is David Hahn-- and his parents

00:12:57.135 --> 00:12:59.010
really were the opposite
of Taylor's parents.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.090
They didn't give him
any support at all.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.174
They said, hey, we just
don't want you doing this.

00:13:02.174 --> 00:13:04.214
You do this again, you're
going to be in trouble.

00:13:04.214 --> 00:13:06.010
So he ended up going
underground with it,

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.180
with almost disastrous results.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.930
But Taylor's parents took
him to nuclear facilities

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.950
around the country, and
gave him a Geiger counter

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.440
for his 10th birthday.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.690
He started collecting
uranium at abandoned mines.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.270
And this is one
that we visited when

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.580
he was a late teenager
in the Virginia mountains

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.920
north of Reno.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.360
And went into the mine,
started digging around,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.750
and found some nice
uranium nuggets,

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.740
and then Taylor discovered
that his pants were

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.460
radioactive on the way out and
was quite concerned about it,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:48.150
and pulled them
off, and ended up

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.600
wearing my extra shorts
for the rest of the trip.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.900
Never did figure out
where it came from.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.750
But another thing they did as
part of their nuclear tourism

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.620
as a family was visit Los Alamos
and some of the desert sites.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.520
This is a-- you can't even
read it-- but it says,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.020
do not disturb until
the year 2142 AD.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.770
It's a marker in place
at technical area 10,

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.760
outside of Los Alamos where
they did the [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.780
tests for the Fat Man bomb.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.630
The summer soon became filled
with trips like this for Taylor

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.960
and his little brother Joey.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.150
Taylor, out in the
desert to scan around

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.730
for radioactive
materials, and as Tiffany,

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.390
his mom said, Yeah this is
how we spend our vacations.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.850
But then things got
really a bit more scary.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.150
Taylor started
collecting things,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.760
and it's amazing what you
can get on eBay still as

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.490
long as you don't
call it radioactive.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.540
Because essentially the
people that are monitoring

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.630
this kind of thing
are completely inept.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:59.000
If you don't call it nuclear
or radioactive or other

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.030
certain key phrases, you
can sell just about anything

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.950
by describing it
kind of what it is

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.450
but not using certain keywords.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.732
Taylor started bringing
home things that

00:15:09.732 --> 00:15:10.940
literally glowed in the dark.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.150
He started taking apart
the old computer monitors

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.460
from his school,
building an x-ray machine

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.810
by reversing things
around, learning

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.690
to use shielding for that.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.760
He started collecting
things like spent fuel

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:33.150
rods from the Kerr-McGee plant
where Karen Silkwood worked.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.750
And at some point-- well
all along-- his parents

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.370
were very concerned
about safety.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.170
So they're bringing
in various people,

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:48.720
trying to figure out what--
is what he's doing safe?

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.530
But they really didn't know.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.160
When Tiffany and Kenneth
questioned him about safety,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.470
Taylor spoke convincingly if
bafflingly about time doses

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.050
and distance intensities
of inverse square laws

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.860
and roentgen submultiples.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.330
He explained the different
types of radiation alpha,

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.960
beta, gamma, x-ray, and how they
dictated the amount and kind

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.900
of shielding necessary.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.940
With his new phone-- newfound
knowledge Taylor insisted,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.550
he could master
the furtive energy

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.900
that seeped from his rocks and
metals and other collectibles.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.620
I know what I'm doing,
Taylor reassured his parents.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.720
I'm the responsible
radioactive Boy Scout.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.690
One afternoon Tiffany
ducked her head

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.340
into Taylor's garage laboratory
to call him in for supper.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.380
And she saw her son in his
yellow hazmat overalls,

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.860
watching a pool of
liquid as it spread

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.370
from an overturned container
across the concrete floor.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.860
Tay, it's time for supper.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.800
I'm going to have to
clean this up first.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.060
That's not the stuff you said
would kill us if it broke open,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:52.810
Tiffany asked.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.270
Is it?

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.010
I don't think so, Taylor said.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.300
Not instantly.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:07.599
So, he started collecting
a lot of uranium rocks, ore

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:11.520
and about this time, he was 11.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.930
He found out that his
grandmother was dying.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.630
Now she'd had cancer
for a long time.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.671
It had been in remission.

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:19.800
It came back.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.940
And she was really
his biggest fan

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.250
and his closest-- the person
that was closest to him.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:31.250
And Taylor approached this
in a very interesting way.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:37.940
He asked her for a
sample of her urine

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.820
after she came
back from her test,

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.200
because it was very radioactive.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.850
And then he also asked her
for a sample of the tumors

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.270
that she was coughing
up from her lungs.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:54.230
And he said, I know this is
weird but interestingly--

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.160
scientifically it was
very interesting to me,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.480
and she indulged me.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.230
Taylor was also-- his mind
was working this whole time.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.110
He was 11 years old.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.830
He didn't want to
lose his grandmother.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.480
But pretty soon
everybody was saying,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.240
there's nothing more
anyone can do for grandma.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.740
And Taylor was
thinking, well gosh

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.060
there's got to be
something somebody can do.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.790
So he'd been thinking about how
radioactive isotopes are made.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.530
And usually they're made in
these multimillion dollar

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.467
cyclotrons.

00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:23.800
There's only a few in the world.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.230
They're shipped very
quickly by private jet

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.372
to distribution facilities
around the world.

00:18:28.372 --> 00:18:30.330
They have to be shipped
quickly because they're

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.980
half lives are so short.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.260
They need to get in,
light up the tumors,

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.570
and then decay away before
they can do much more damage.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.840
So Taylor started
thinking, well I

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.840
wonder if there's a
different way of doing this.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.976
Because he'd been working
with a nuclear pharmacist, who

00:18:46.976 --> 00:18:50.230
had become a mentor to him.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.330
And he'd asked the guy,
David Boudreaux, so

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.770
how do people in Africa get
these things when they're sick?

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.520
And he said, well unfortunately
Taylor, usually they can't.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.810
They're not really available.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.460
It's just too expensive.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.580
So one day, he and I were making
some yellowcake in his garage.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:16.260
And he told me about this
day he was stirring up

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.370
his grandmother's pee
and holding the Geiger

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.060
counter to it, measuring it.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.000
And he got this idea.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.100
Well, what about using
nuclear fusion to make

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.170
radioactive medical isotopes?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:35.740
And it was a novel idea for an
11-year-old to think of this.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.760
So anyway, he started
thinking, well

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.380
if I could build
a reactor that was

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.530
small enough and safe
enough and cheap enough

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.502
to put in every electrified
hospital on earth.

00:19:46.502 --> 00:19:47.960
How many more lives
could be saved?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.168
How much cheaper could it be?

00:19:49.168 --> 00:19:52.630
How many more people could
we get these things to?

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.390
And so at that
point, he realized

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.510
that's what he wanted
to do with his life.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:05.790
And this notion of-- I guess
a future image of oneself

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.940
is extremely important in the
development of most people

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.520
who have had big creative
breakthroughs in their lives.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.460
People who have pushed certain
fields of knowledge forward.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.750
And Taylor saw himself as
not only doing this thing,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.540
but also as being a
groundbreaking nuclear

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.340
physicist when he was older.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.770
So this would end up propelling
him for the next several years

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.430
as he pursued this idea.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.720
After his grandmother passed
away, he started looking into,

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.100
how can I build a
nuclear fusion reactor?

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.920
At this point, only 10 people
as individuals had ever done it.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.770
And so he started
writing to people

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.911
and sort of getting--
trying to find

00:20:49.911 --> 00:20:51.160
somebody that could help them.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.800
Well this is very difficult
because of where he lived.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.760
How could an 11-year-old
kid living into Texarkana

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.260
ever hope to achieve
this kind of thing?

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.500
But he was an extremely
resourceful kid.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.780
He was able to find a mentor,
by the name of Carl Willis.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:11.790
And eventually would meet
him and Kenneth and Tiffany

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.310
would bring him to meet
him in Albuquerque.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:19.190
Now Carl is a nuclear
engineer with a PhD,

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:23.310
and he took Taylor
under his wing.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:28.120
And he was the 10th person to
build a working nuclear fusion

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.654
reactor.

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:30.070
He said, well
Taylor this is going

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.050
to be extremely difficult to do.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.770
But he never said,
you'll never do it.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.030
In fact, he sent Taylor a
neutron detector thinking

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.760
that some day he might.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.930
So I went with these guys to
a place called the Black Hole,

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.810
which is outside of Los Alamos.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.790
And it's defunct now,
but it is a place

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.960
where the weapons industry,
nuclear weapons industry,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.910
sends its surplus gear.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.260
So we went shopping there
one day for equipment.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.270
This is sort of Taylor's version
of a light bulb going off

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.740
over his head.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.300
But he scanned the aisles
and came out with some stuff

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.060
and filled the shopping cart,
and had some complex fittings,

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:18.090
and some detectors and
a lot of spare parts,

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.480
and brought it up
to the check-out.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.964
And he said, all right, mom
I want to buy this stuff.

00:22:23.964 --> 00:22:25.880
She says, what do you
want all this stuff for?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.446
He says, I want to build a
second reactor for the house.

00:22:30.446 --> 00:22:31.820
And she said,
Taylor, you are not

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.990
going to build a nuclear
reactor in the house.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.960
But he ended up coming
away with the stuff.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.376
As I said, he was very good
at talking people into things.

00:22:39.376 --> 00:22:41.400
So he would do things
like, he found out

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:47.680
that an astronaut in Houston
was selling a mass spectrometer,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.880
an instrument that
Taylor could cannibalize

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.500
for parts for his particle
accelerator and his fusers.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.300
So the guy wanted
several thousand dollars

00:22:59.300 --> 00:22:59.950
for this thing.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.890
And Taylor just called
him up and said,

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.210
Hey, I'm 11 years old,
and I was wondering

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:11.000
if you'd consider donating it
to me for the nuclear fusion

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.020
reactor I want to build.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.230
This is the way this
kid's life works, right?

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.570
This is just the way
things roll for him.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:23.290
And the guy said, well,
can you come pick it up?

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.789
So his dad got one of
the Coca-Cola trucks

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:27.330
to go down to Houston
and pick it up.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.200
And Taylor started putting
this thing together.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:38.560
Well again, he was now
12, 13, and lacking really

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.310
the expertise or the mentors
to be able to pull this off,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.490
especially where he lived.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.960
Now with any gifted
kids if any of you

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.460
have kids that
are gifted, you're

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.980
going to run up
against a problem

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.720
that Kenneth and Tiffany ran up
against, which is the schools.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.870
The schools in this
country by and large

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.110
just can't handle these kids.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:08.080
We had a golden age of
specialized gifted education

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.990
after Sputnik, when suddenly
we saw America's smartest kids

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:17.390
as being a national resource
and national security resource

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.120
even.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.700
And so a lot of
energy money was put

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.050
into developing science
labs, developing

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.150
learning opportunities,
acceleration,

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.860
special opportunities for kids.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.840
As soon as the Cold War ended,
the interest in gifted kids

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.570
really started to fade.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:40.180
And then you had a sort
of anti-elitist movement

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.110
that was going on
in the '80s, where

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:47.420
the thought of segregating
kids because they're smart

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.160
was thought to be maybe
not such a good idea.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.030
Because well, are the other
kids getting a second class

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.190
education?

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.810
And if those kids
that were smart

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.950
happened to be already
advantaged socially,

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.180
race, class, then it was
even more problematic.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.490
But in any case, gifted
education programs

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.870
began to go out of fashion.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.810
And they disappeared
most quickly

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:17.350
in the more PC communities
like Cambridge, and Ann Arbor,

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.320
Michigan, where my
kids go to school.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.750
One of the things I
encountered in my research

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.750
was that they're trying
to figure out what do we

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.480
do with these programs?

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.170
We can-- we don't-- we're not
going to have any more pulling

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.320
these kids out of
these program--

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.706
of their regular classrooms.

00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:35.080
We're going to
have to figure out

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.670
some other way of doing this.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:42.880
And so the school system
in Ann Arbor in the mid-90s

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.430
did a survey of parents.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.170
And this is in
every college town

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.420
it would probably be the same.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.010
They asked the parents
all kinds of things

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.160
about gifted education,
other kinds of education.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.250
One of the questions was,
are your own kids gifted?

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.070
Well, in a college
town, what do you

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.490
think was the response
to that question?

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.410
What percentage of respondents
answered, yes, my own kids

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:06.910
are gifted?

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:12.189
It turns out that 99% of
parents in Ann Arbor, Michigan

00:26:12.189 --> 00:26:12.730
thought that.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.590
I have no doubt that Cambridge
would be pretty much the same.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.810
But you know it's not
actually-- it doesn't

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.830
take an evolutionary biologist,
or psychologist to understand

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.972
why we all think their kids
deserve special treatment.

00:26:29.972 --> 00:26:31.680
And why we think our
own kids are gifted.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.140
I've got two geniuses
here in the front row.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:44.470
And the thing is that the same
developmental processes really

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.330
guide the development
of gifts, whether you--

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.520
no matter what level
you're working at.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.430
And as I said before,
really everyone

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.750
is gifted in
certain-- in some way.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.040
There's some sort of
specialty that everybody's

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.030
going to be great at if
you manage to match them

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.490
with the right thing.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.084
So for Taylor what happened
was that schools just

00:27:05.084 --> 00:27:06.250
weren't going to do the job.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.970
He spent most of
the time waiting.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.850
And that's the response
that researchers

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:14.372
got when they asked gifted
kids across the country, what's

00:27:14.372 --> 00:27:15.330
your school experience?

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.365
Most of them said, waiting.

00:27:17.365 --> 00:27:18.740
Describe it in
one word, waiting.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.000
Always waiting for the
rest of class to catch up.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.750
Waiting for the teacher
to teach something

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.310
that I don't already know.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.400
So they ended up finding
this school in Reno, Nevada

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.390
and deciding to move there.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:34.600
It's a public school for
kids that score in the 99.9th

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.875
percentile on the
standardized tests.

00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:39.070
It's called Davidson Academy.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:43.730
And it's parked on the campus
of University of Nevada, Reno.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.609
So Taylor went there.

00:27:45.609 --> 00:27:47.900
It turns out the physics
department's quite good there.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.820
So he was very happy about that.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.230
And ended up there.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.410
And ended up finding
mentors there.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.750
He found-- went
to some professors

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.720
and was turned down
once, and went to the guy

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.230
next door, by the name of
Ron Phaneuf, a famous plasma

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.360
physicist.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.920
And said, hey, I want to build
a nuclear fusion reactor.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.280
And I want to do
it in my garage.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.522
And Taylor said, well-- or
Ron said, well, my god, we

00:28:12.522 --> 00:28:13.980
can't have you do
it in you garage,

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.771
but maybe we could
figure out a way for you

00:28:15.771 --> 00:28:18.367
to try it here in the sub
basement of the physics lab.

00:28:18.367 --> 00:28:19.700
So that's exactly what they did.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:25.480
So Ron and Bill Brinsmead,
the physics department's

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.650
chief technician, a super
eccentric and fascinating guy,

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.440
ended up becoming
Taylor's mentors.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.440
And they worked with
him over many months

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.030
to eventually build-- help
him build this nuclear fusion

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.510
reactor.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.560
And he mastered all
these technical fields,

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.760
and eventually got it
to work, got neutrons,

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.880
and was recognized for it.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.710
He became the 32nd
person on Earth

00:28:54.710 --> 00:29:00.050
to achieve nuclear
fusion as an individual.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:04.070
Here he is running the
control panel of the machine.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:10.580
And here is the grid with
the plasma field around it.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.720
What was most interesting though
about this machine was not

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.770
really its-- the machine
itself but what he did with it.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:22.250
So we went together
once to a field outside

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.890
of the airport of Albuquerque
International Airport, which

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.600
is shared with the
Sandia Air Force Base.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.410
And it turns out that a really
weird thing happened there

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:36.180
in the '50s, 1957, when a
nuclear bomb was accidentally

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.020
dropped in a field on approach.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.070
And it was probably the sort of
closest to Doctor Strangelove

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.900
moment that the Air
Force has ever had,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.880
where one of the
crewmen was sent back

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.640
to check on the
bomb to make sure

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.530
it was secure, and ended
up pulling the wrong lever.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.900
The bomb dropped
from its platform

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.610
on to the bomb bay
doors, forced them open,

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:05.460
and then fell 3,000 feet
and exploded in a field.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.640
Now luckily the plutonium
core wasn't in it

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.410
or all of Albuquerque
would be gone, gone, gone.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.960
But there was a lot of
radioactive material in it.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.440
This so called spark plug that
surrounds the plutonium core.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.520
And Taylor got his hands on
some declassified documents,

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.170
and found out where
this had happened,

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.100
or roughly where it happened,
and went out and found it.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.800
And they said they
had cleaned it up.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.450
But we ended up finding all
kinds of radioactive debris.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.410
There's Taylor and
Carl looking at it.

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.840
So the first time
he went there, he

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:43.750
was shipping it home in a
box through the airports

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.640
and TSA looked at it.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.200
They had a piece of
white tape across it when

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.910
he took it off the bag check.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:54.910
And there's a little note inside
that said, we checked this.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.770
And Taylor said, wow,
they had no idea what

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:58.860
they were looking at.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:03.040
They weren't checking
for radiation.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.520
So he started thinking
about the tens of thousands

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.160
of shipping containers that
enter the US every month,

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.430
every week actually.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.240
About 10,000 a day I think.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.540
And they're sort of
the soft underbelly

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.110
as far as nuclear security
in that hardly any of them

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:24.480
are checked, and when they are,
it just slows down everything.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.710
It's very hard.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:30.160
So he got this idea
to develop a detector

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.970
that trucks could
drive through and it

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:38.750
could shoot a directed
neutron beam at the contents.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.230
And if there were any
fissionable materials

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.390
inside the box, it would pick
them up and alert the operator.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.330
It would also pick
up nitrogen signals,

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.630
signatures from any
conventional explosives.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.180
So we took this to
the science fair.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.480
And the first year
he was there, he just

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:02.530
entered the reactor and some
neutron multiplication stuff.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:04.964
And it was sort
of like, wow a kid

00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:07.130
shows up at the science
fair with a nuclear reactor.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:10.880
And it's like a Ferrari showing
up at a Soapbox Derby, right?

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.510
So wins big in physics, the
second year he wins bigger.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:19.250
The third year, he ends up
with a security application,

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.630
and he wind it all.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.110
He wins the intell--
young scientist award

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.990
and becomes this superstar.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:30.720
And $50,000 award with
several other awards

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.990
stacked on top of it, a
trip to CERN in Switzerland.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:37.790
And then I do my story
in "Popular Science."

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:42.140
So his life starts to
get really interesting.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.860
So Chris Anderson, who curates
TED, got a hold of the story

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.190
in "Pop Sci" and
said, my god, we

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.180
got to get this
kid to talk at TED.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.510
Taylor's only prepared
for one talk in his life

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.390
and it was a disaster.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.620
This one he didn't
prepared at all for.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.570
His only preparation was
calling me an hour and a half

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.850
before he was due to go on
stage and saying, hey Tom,

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.060
can you email me some slides?

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.450
That was it.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:11.050
So he comes back next year.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.860
He's getting more
and more famous.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.610
He's invited to the
National Ignition Facility

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.750
to give a talk.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.345
He's a big shot at his school.

00:33:20.345 --> 00:33:23.060
At this school, there's
no football team.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.870
It doesn't get bigger
than what he was doing.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:29.360
He's invited to the Halifax
Security Conference.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.640
And he's sitting between the
Palestinians and Israelis

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:41.250
and talking about how we
might be able to get along.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.150
And then he says to his
math teacher one day.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.140
Hey, can I have the
homework ahead of time?

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.030
I've got to go to Washington.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.070
What's going on in Washington?

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.736
Well, I've got to go
meet the President.

00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:51.749
Sure enough, he's
invited to talk to Obama.

00:33:51.749 --> 00:33:53.040
Some other kids were there too.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.070
Obama was talking to every
kid, so, nice to see you.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.616
These two start
riffing and talking,

00:33:58.616 --> 00:34:00.240
what do your parents
think of all this?

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.320
This is crazy.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.642
And then, Obama
says, so when are

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:05.966
you going to come work for me?

00:34:05.966 --> 00:34:07.590
And Taylor says, well
I kind of thought

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.010
that was why I was here.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.380
So Obama makes the rounds.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.679
He comes back to
Taylor on the way out.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:17.760
And he says, yeah,
you're definitely going

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.130
to be working for me soon.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.580
Several people that
heard about this

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.690
thought that it might end
up being the other way

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.260
around, actually.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.870
Obama might end up
working for Taylor.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.159
So he's getting a
very, very big profile.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:37.480
So what happens to a teenager
when someone is calling him

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.600
genius and Einstein every day?

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:47.094
Well, what happened was
sort of the dark side

00:34:47.094 --> 00:34:48.469
of this kind of
thing, and really

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:51.239
the dark side of giftedness.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:55.270
And he abandoned some
of his old friends

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:59.370
to have lunch with a new
girl that he liked a lot.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.030
He was driving
everybody crazy at home.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:08.380
He was demanding to
watch his own TV shows,

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.990
shows that featured him.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.810
Got addicted to the spotlight.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:16.380
And so sometimes by indulging
this sort of showman thing,

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.450
these super smart kids
learn that if they keep up

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:22.630
the demands, they'll be met,
which really doesn't do them

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.180
a lot of good in the long run.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.710
And this sense of
entitlement and a really sort

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:34.105
of a narcissistic tendency
will the overconfidence it

00:35:34.105 --> 00:35:36.080
will get challenged eventually.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.210
Sometimes a gifted
kid, their identity

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.990
will get caught up
in being a whiz kid.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:43.780
So sometimes they
will stop trying

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.790
to be anything else than
what protects that identity.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.830
There's some really,
really, really interesting

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.990
educational theories about that.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:58.582
If you really want a kid to
be smart and keep being smart,

00:35:58.582 --> 00:36:00.290
whatever you don't
tell them their smart.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.090
Tell them that
they're hard workers.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:05.720
It's a really common scenario.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.610
Also he was putting a lot
of energy into the science,

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:12.550
and into sort of even
self-promotion I would say.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.470
And it wasn't going into
really self-awareness and some

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.740
of the social,
emotional sort of tasks.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:24.320
So I'm going to read a
couple more paragraphs

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.110
by way of wrapping it up.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:29.380
I will say that the people
who are worried about Taylor,

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.790
at this point in his life,
when he was 16, 17, 18

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.070
are still his friends.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:40.080
And Taylor and I
are still close.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:47.500
He-- when he saw the book,
and he saw for the first time

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.810
what some of the people
that were closest to him

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.390
were saying about him
during this period,

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:58.080
it was really actually
very hard for him.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.760
Since then he was able
to rebuild things.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.590
And he did it by returning
to really his roots.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.350
What he had envisioned
when he was 11,

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:14.460
himself sort of saving his
grandmother's life by building

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.710
these medical isotopes.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.490
And so he got to work in that.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:21.630
He sort of buried himself
in science for a year.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.420
And when he came back
up, he'd finished

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:29.440
this device that would allow
them to create these isotopes.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:37.240
But in the meantime,
this sort of really this

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.040
nadir in his life.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.730
I'm going to read you
some of the things

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.130
that people were saying.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.480
His friend, Bill Brinsmead,
his number one mentor, he said,

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.760
my worry, says
Brinsmead, is that it

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.070
could have an unhappy ending.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.990
What happens when everything
he does doesn't succeed?

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.922
Some kids burn out.

00:37:53.922 --> 00:37:55.130
They're so intense, so young.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.130
And they get to
be 20 and they're

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.120
hanging out on Telegraph
Avenue in Berkeley.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.400
Then again Taylor's successes
were a relatively recent thing.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.444
He'd had plenty
of early failures,

00:38:07.444 --> 00:38:09.360
maybe they would gird
him against the downfall

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.510
that so many people
worried about.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.995
Maybe so, Brinsmead said.

00:38:12.995 --> 00:38:14.620
But right now he's
headstrong, and he's

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.940
playing games with people.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.162
It may be just a phase,
and he'll get through it.

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:20.120
But right now I just feel
sorry for his parents

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.920
and for Joey, that's
his little brother.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.610
I'd already confided
to his parents,

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:28.350
Tiffany and Kenneth,
who looked exhausted,

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.050
that I was beginning
to worry that I'd

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.890
helped to create a monster with
my magazine story about Taylor.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:36.850
I think we'll get through
this, Tiffany said.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.450
But honestly Tom we
just want it to be over.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:43.710
We're ready for him to move on
so we can concentrate on Joey.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:45.950
Taylor as a high school
student had already

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:49.420
done things that would
be the envy of most PhDs.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.390
Everywhere you turned,
someone was calling him

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.650
a genius or an Einstein.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.890
But Taylor wasn't ready
to be an Einstein.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:57.830
And as those closest
to him watched

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.410
hi celebrity status
grow, they saw

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.555
the traits that had
brought him this far,

00:39:02.555 --> 00:39:06.400
his passion and curiosity,
his exuberance, his confidence

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.040
devolving into hubris.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.430
Taylor's arrogance
and narcissism

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.580
were having corrosive
effects on himself

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.690
and everyone around him.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.510
The lesson of the Icarus
myth came to mind.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.920
How could it not?

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.440
But Icarus' story
wasn't a perfect fit.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:29.070
After all Icarus hadn't
put the sun in a box.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.247
Thanks.

00:39:30.247 --> 00:39:36.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:42.130
So, that's the only
picture of Joey

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.560
that we have, with his back to
the camera, very different kid

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.700
than Taylor.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.780
And this brings up one
of the other issues when

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.150
you have more than one
kid and the first one's

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:57.580
a superstar sucking all
the air out of the room.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.690
Sometimes the other ones
left with the leftovers.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.017
Joey wasn't interested
in being a superstar.

00:40:03.017 --> 00:40:04.350
He was interested in doing math.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.210
He was an extremely bright
kid, as bright as Taylor.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.290
But he would-- his
mother would go

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:13.370
into the shower or the bathroom
after he was in the shower,

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:16.650
and see that he'd drawn
calculus equations on the steam

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:18.300
in the shower door.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.769
He had no interest in being
a showman like Taylor.

00:40:21.769 --> 00:40:22.810
But he was just as smart.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:24.680
So what do you do
with the introverted

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.520
sort of gifted kids?

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.120
Do you want to
hear about the time

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.010
we went to the set of
the "Big Bang Theory,"

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.420
Taylor and I. That's fun.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:38.240
So we went to see the live
taping of the "Big Bang

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.400
Theory."

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.160
These are sort of
excruciating experiences,

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.280
if you've ever been to a live
TV show taping of a comedy.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.990
You've got this overbearing
emcee, trying to get the crowd

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.620
to laugh on the fourth take,
just as hard as you laughed

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:01.210
the first time you saw
the skit, heard the joke.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.700
And it's just hard
to sit through.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.820
But anyway afterwards,
we were invited down

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.770
to the cast and crew's
Christmas party.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.110
And Taylor's sitting
in Sheldon's spot

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.610
with Johnny Galecki.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:19.560
And he looks over to the
shelf, and you can see this

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.250
on the show, where
this instrument is

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.416
sitting on one of the shelf.

00:41:22.416 --> 00:41:25.140
It's a Korean war
era Geiger counter.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.260
And Taylor recognized it.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:30.730
He said, hey that
prop over there.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:34.665
Those things they had a
radioactive source in them.

00:41:34.665 --> 00:41:36.290
And they were supposed
to take them out

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.340
when they decommissioned them,
but they miss a lot of them.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.390
You want me to go take a look.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.155
And so at this point, Chuck
Lorre is brought over.

00:41:44.155 --> 00:41:45.530
And he says, Yeah definitely.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:50.240
So they bring a screwdriver, and
Taylor takes this thing apart.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.410
And bingo, he finds this
disc of strontium 90

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.940
that's been quietly
irradiating the cast and crew

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.020
for the last five years.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:02.300
And Taylor says, wow that
would make a nice souvenir.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.800
You want me to take
it out of there?

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.320
And Chuck Lorre says, and
get it the heck off the set.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.900
Yes.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.730
So Taylor ended up
with a nice souvenir.

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.520
This is David Saltzberg,
he's the science adviser

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.260
for the show.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.530
And he said, Yeah I
think this will go down

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:25.010
in "Big Bang Theory"
lore, Taylor, as one

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:28.340
of the interesting moments.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.430
Anyway let's-- let's
take some questions.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:33.390
AUDIENCE: So
everything I've read

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.090
and I think a lot of people know
this, a lot of these extremely

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.030
capable young people
turn out to be

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.280
just kind of regular
old really smart adults.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.610
And likewise, extremely
capable adults

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.300
were not child prodigies.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.300
Given that why do you
think people are just

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:57.970
so obsessed and interested
in kids like Tom-- sorry,

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.180
kids like Taylor?

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.346
TOM CLYNES: I wish they
were obsessed and interested

00:43:01.346 --> 00:43:03.050
in kids like Tom.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.430
Well, I mean we love to hear it.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.160
It's a great story, right?

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.910
I mean it's amazing
but you're right.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:15.930
Sometimes the
mistake people make

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.090
is closing the door too soon.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:21.530
A lot of kids are
early bloomers.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:24.140
A lot are bloomed right in
the middle, most of them.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.120
Some are late bloomers.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.450
The trick for parents
is to be watching

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:33.720
for those sparks of interest and
talent and to pick up on them

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.700
and feed them, and to not
close the door too soon

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.390
on a kid who's seemingly
interested in nothing

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:45.280
or a late bloomer.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.110
Lots of times early bloomers
do burn out as well.

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:52.800
And we talked about
some of the reasons why.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.950
It's just that they
get so caught up

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:58.110
in being that smart
kid, that they instead

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:01.570
of taking risks and bringing
themselves to the next level

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:06.720
constantly, and
learning to do things

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.890
for the sake of learning
and doing, and being

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:10.700
willing to fail.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.590
Instead of doing
that, they end up

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.410
sort of buttressing this image
of themselves as the smart kid.

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:20.180
So you don't take risks because
you might fail at something.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.180
And then you're not the
super smart kid anymore.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.390
You're not the whiz kid.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.360
So that's a super big problem.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.590
There's a theory
called Mindset theory

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.280
that Carol Dweck
has come up with.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:37.700
And it's quite interesting, just
about how you encourage kids.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.410
Just as far as OK,
it's not because you're

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:41.660
smart that you achieve things.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.030
It's because you try hard
that you achieve things.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.820
And because you're willing to
fail that you achieve things.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:50.660
So we often-- we make
mistakes with gifted kids,

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.990
with every kid.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.120
This doesn't apply
just to gifted kids.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:59.620
We have to really I think be
on the lookout for these, again

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.930
these sparks of talent and
interest and then feed them.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:05.030
And even when you're
an adult, OK, it's

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.530
not your parent's
responsibility anymore,

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.341
but it's our own responsibility
to find the things that

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:13.340
make the most sense to
us and that we're good at

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.600
and that we can really excel at.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:20.860
Yes.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.318
AUDIENCE: So I'm
wondering what you

00:45:22.318 --> 00:45:26.050
think of the role of
competition in academics?

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:33.800
So the US, you may know, for won
the International Math Olympiad

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.740
beating China and
other countries

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.860
for the first time
in over 20 years.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.840
It seems like those
kind of competitions

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.530
can really be both
a cure for hubris,

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:45.640
too early, because
there's always

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.950
other people trying hard,
as well as a motivator

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.530
for these kinds of students.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:55.470
TOM CLYNES: Yeah it's
great, great stuff.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:58.880
Competition, science
fairs, math Olympiads

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.390
are just fantastic events.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.110
And the great
thing about them is

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:06.380
that it takes some of the
focus away from the kids

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.610
who are the athletic
superstars and the entertainers

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.890
and so forth, and
puts it on kids

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:19.020
that are going to find a cure
for a certain kind of cancer

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.340
or treatment or whatever.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.110
And these are the
kids that we should

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:28.610
be making into superstars
and really pumping up.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:33.299
Now, was that a fluke
that we won that Olympiad?

00:46:33.299 --> 00:46:33.840
I don't know.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.430
I mean our scores in
general keep going down

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.430
and down and down compared
to other countries.

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:42.660
And our scores-- our top
student's scores have really

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:46.300
gone down in the past 30 years.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.260
Vietnam, which has a per
capita GDP of somewhere 2

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.660
or $3000 a year,
a small fraction

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:59.760
of the US's kicks our butts
every year in math and science.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:08.360
So I think we have got our
priorities in the wrong place.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.800
That's probably a fairly obvious
thing to say, and it's no news.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.200
But if we're able
to shift and make

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.050
these kids into some
sort of superstars

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:22.950
on the level of
athletes than great.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:25.300
And that's what really a
lot of the physics community

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.030
thinks of Taylor.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.450
They see him as a really
good communicator.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:31.450
I think that might
be his biggest

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:34.990
impact beyond the science,
beyond his inventions.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:39.910
I think that he has already
and could bring more people--

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.736
get more people
interested in science--

00:47:41.736 --> 00:47:43.360
all kinds of science,
not just physics.

00:47:50.197 --> 00:47:52.030
AUDIENCE: I'm interested
to learn a bit more

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:54.390
about his parents.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:56.660
And on the topic of Carol
Dweck and growth mindset,

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.880
it seems pretty clear his
parents had a growth mindset.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.930
I'm curious, was
that something they

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:04.180
were overtly conscious about?

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.320
Did it just come naturally?

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.653
TOM CLYNES: They didn't know it.

00:48:06.653 --> 00:48:10.780
This is something that just
came naturally to them.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:14.910
They didn't start out with
any sort of intentionality

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.820
to their parenting, whatsoever.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.200
They had a kid that
came out on the run

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.240
basically, out of
the womb on the run.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.140
And a lot their
parenting style evolved

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.550
because of the kind
of kid Taylor was.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:31.030
That's what you see with
a lot of these kids.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.530
The parents aren't
pushing the kids,

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:37.840
the kids are pulling the
parents along into things.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:44.410
Now this whole business of
this intellectual spoiling,

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:49.340
creating this climate of
emotional and intellectual

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.740
support in the house that
was really quite extreme,

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.860
especially when he got into
these super harrowing sorts

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.390
of things that were literally
glowing in the dark.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:02.050
This was something that
they saw his passion for it,

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:03.619
and they were inspired.

00:49:03.619 --> 00:49:05.910
They didn't feel like they
could take it away from him.

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:09.179
And so they had to pro-- but
they had to protect themselves,

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:10.470
they had to protect the family.

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.928
They had to make sure he didn't
kill anyone, or blow things

00:49:12.928 --> 00:49:18.160
up, or get them all set
up with early cancers.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.950
So they were able to bring in
mentors, and other learning

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:26.200
opportunities, and really
take him places far away.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.320
And I think that
was something that

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.760
was just sort of instinctive.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.160
I talked to one person,
a child psychologist

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.780
David Feldman, that
studied these sort

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.990
of super precocious kids.

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:40.950
And he had an interesting theory
that could never be proven.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.800
And he's just kind of throwing
it out on a whim really.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.590
But it's because he can't
explain it any other way.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:52.680
Well maybe just as there might
have been a scientist somewhere

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:57.590
back in the gene pool
that resulted in Taylor,

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:00.430
there might have been
a parenting style

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.430
back who knows how
many generations that

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:07.070
was like Taylor and
Tiffany's, and that

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:10.570
was appropriate for
the time and the place.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.410
And it might not have
worked in 16th century

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:19.280
Bologna or something,
or with a kid who was

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.050
interested in something else.

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:23.300
But a lot of things
lined up for Taylor,

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:28.610
just a lot of what makes
these gifted kids succeed

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:31.140
is actually luck.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:31.890
They need support.

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:33.098
There's no question about it.

00:50:33.098 --> 00:50:34.340
They can't do it themselves.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.590
They need the innate talent.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:41.890
They need mentorship and
resources and so forth.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:43.552
But they also just need luck.

00:50:43.552 --> 00:50:45.010
They need the right
time and place.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.200
They need to come
onto this earth,

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.990
and find a place like
Davidson Academy,

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:53.740
and find people like Ron and
Bill that could help them.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.140
And that's not so easy.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.180
We can't-- we can make our
own luck to a certain extent

00:50:59.180 --> 00:50:59.889
as a democracy.

00:50:59.889 --> 00:51:02.430
And we probably should make a
little bit more of our own luck

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:03.200
in that regard.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:09.050
But most of the kids that have
that sort of innate capability

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.430
are not going to get
that kind of support.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.990
And they're not going
to be able to develop

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:24.090
to their full potential
as a result. OK.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:25.620
It looks like we're out of time.

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:28.640
And thanks a lot everybody,
appreciate you coming out,

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.470
and I'll be glad to talk
with anybody or sign books

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.030
or whatnot afterwards.

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.710
Thank you.

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:35.260
