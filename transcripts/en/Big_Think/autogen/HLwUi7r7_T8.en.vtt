idea that like we could use a drug that

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570
idea that like we could use a drug that
 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.990

choice is generally misguided because

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300
choice is generally misguided because
 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.230
choice is generally misguided because
the problem isn't the drug of choice the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
the problem isn't the drug of choice the
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.480
the problem isn't the drug of choice the
problem is why you need that drug and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490
problem is why you need that drug and
 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.810
problem is why you need that drug and
why those drugs appeal to you and why

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820
why those drugs appeal to you and why
 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.420
why those drugs appeal to you and why
you are trying to get out why you were

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
you are trying to get out why you were
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.120
you are trying to get out why you were
trying to escape and what you need in

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130

your life in order to feel comfortable
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.420
your life in order to feel comfortable
and safe and productive so I don't think

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430
and safe and productive so I don't think
 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.020
and safe and productive so I don't think
that there will be future weird cures

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
that there will be future weird cures
 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.020
that there will be future weird cures
like that but what I do think is

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030
like that but what I do think is
 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.850
like that but what I do think is
interesting about the future of drugs is

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860
interesting about the future of drugs is
 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.990
interesting about the future of drugs is
that we can make better drugs part of

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000
that we can make better drugs part of
 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.550
that we can make better drugs part of
the reason that prohibition is

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560
the reason that prohibition is
 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.280
the reason that prohibition is
collapsing at the moment is because of

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
collapsing at the moment is because of
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.510
collapsing at the moment is because of
what are called new psychoactive

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520
what are called new psychoactive
 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.780
what are called new psychoactive
substances or legal hides and basically

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
substances or legal hides and basically
 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.050
substances or legal hides and basically
you can make a new recreational drug by

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060
you can make a new recreational drug by
 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.600
you can make a new recreational drug by
sort of tweaking molecules of the other

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610
sort of tweaking molecules of the other
 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.320
sort of tweaking molecules of the other
ones and it will be technically legal

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330
ones and it will be technically legal
 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.990
ones and it will be technically legal
because it hasn't been made illegal and

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000
because it hasn't been made illegal and
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.630
because it hasn't been made illegal and
what this reveals is that our system for

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640
what this reveals is that our system for
 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.580
what this reveals is that our system for
making drugs illegal is completely

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590
making drugs illegal is completely
 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.890
making drugs illegal is completely
irrational and based on you know 19th

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900
irrational and based on you know 19th
 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.800

century prejudices has nothing to do
 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.920
century prejudices has nothing to do
with science and if we apply science to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930
with science and if we apply science to
 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.490
with science and if we apply science to
this problem and look at well people are
