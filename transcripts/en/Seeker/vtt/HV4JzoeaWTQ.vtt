00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.850
NARRATOR: This guy went
over 600 miles per hour,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.000
earning himself the title
of fastest man alive.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.036
But did he survive?

00:00:08.036 --> 00:00:10.830
John Paul Stapp was a
physician in the Air Force

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.040
who was fascinated by speed
and the effects of g-force

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.720
on the human body.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.630
g-force is the measurement of
acceleration due to gravity.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.760
On earth, gravity
causes us to accelerate

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.550
towards the center of the planet
at 32 feet per second squared,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.220
which is a force of 1g.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.610
But if you hop onto a roller
coaster or into an airplane,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.380
the increased
acceleration will cause

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.630
more g-force and perceived
weight on your body.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.070
So how much g-force is safe?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.380
In the 1940s it was assumed that
pilots could only withstand up

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.880
to 18 g's.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.840
But Stapp believed humans could
withstand more, much more.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.060
To test his theory,
Stapp built a rocket sled

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.360
that propelled down a track
at hundreds of miles an hour.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.460
At first he used dummies,
but eventually he

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.050
tested it on himself.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.860
During his last run, Stapp
hit 632 miles an hour

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.280
in five seconds, and stopped
in just over one second,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.810
subjecting himself to a whopping
46.2 g's, and making his body

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.120
weight around 7,700 pounds
for that brief moment.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.600
Stapp's trials led
to some injuries

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.560
like broken ribs, a
hernia, a shattered wrist,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.950
hemorrhages in the eye,
a fractured tailbone,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.480
and temporary blindness.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.830
But Stapp survived.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.350
And he later went on to
work with NASA as well

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.180
as on some of the first
tests for airbags in cars.
