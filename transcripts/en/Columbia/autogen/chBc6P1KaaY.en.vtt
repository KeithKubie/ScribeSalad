get into Columbia and I think it was

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
get into Columbia and I think it was
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.450

just so you know I school just was

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460

the views out of John Glenn's spaceship
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.210
the views out of John Glenn's spaceship
and and also the camaraderie between

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
and and also the camaraderie between
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.480
and and also the camaraderie between
those astronauts and you know what they

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
those astronauts and you know what they
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.370
those astronauts and you know what they
were doing doing something that I

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
were doing doing something that I
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020
were doing doing something that I
thought was really important and really

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

may have been on a plane once at that
point when I was a senior but you know I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
point when I was a senior but you know I
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.780
point when I was a senior but you know I
hadn't I wasn't a military person I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
hadn't I wasn't a military person I
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.270

wasn't very outdoorsy or a thrill seeker
I grew up in New York you know the the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
I grew up in New York you know the the
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170
I grew up in New York you know the the
subway was the most exciting thing i did

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
subway was the most exciting thing i did
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.899
subway was the most exciting thing i did
so i wasn't sure how you know what the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
so i wasn't sure how you know what the
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.069
so i wasn't sure how you know what the
what the deal was but I started looking

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
what the deal was but I started looking
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.039
what the deal was but I started looking
into it I applied to grad schools and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
into it I applied to grad schools and
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.749
into it I applied to grad schools and
look for jobs when I got out of when I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759
look for jobs when I got out of when I
 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.910
look for jobs when I got out of when I
was a senior I took a job and i deferred

was a senior I took a job and i deferred
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.920
was a senior I took a job and i deferred
grad school and that was good for me

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
grad school and that was good for me
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900
grad school and that was good for me
because it gave me a time to think about

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
because it gave me a time to think about
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.740
because it gave me a time to think about
what i really

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
what i really
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.570
what i really
to do and I just could not get this idea

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
to do and I just could not get this idea
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.020
to do and I just could not get this idea
of a space program out of my head and I

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
of a space program out of my head and I
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.130
of a space program out of my head and I
didn't know if you know the Astron I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
didn't know if you know the Astron I
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.120
didn't know if you know the Astron I
think I found out was like really

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130
think I found out was like really
 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.030
think I found out was like really
competitive and you're impossible but I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
competitive and you're impossible but I
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.670
competitive and you're impossible but I
thought I could do something for NASA so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
thought I could do something for NASA so
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320
thought I could do something for NASA so
I went to grad school with the intent of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
I went to grad school with the intent of
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.600
I went to grad school with the intent of
pursuing the career with the space

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
pursuing the career with the space
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.850
pursuing the career with the space
program in an application into the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860
program in an application into the
 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.980
