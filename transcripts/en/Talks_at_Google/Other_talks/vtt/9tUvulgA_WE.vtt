00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
RUCHIKA: Right.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.370
We'll go ahead and get
started with the talk today.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.390
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.200
I'm Ruchika.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.840
I work in the people
development department

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.320
within People
Operations, particularly

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.430
focusing on well-being
learning for Googlers.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.290
I have helped
co-found G+ Program.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.680
And I also teach
Search Inside Yourself.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.330
Our team also brings
other programs

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.130
like Managing Your Energy.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.220
We're working on an online
version of Good Stress/Bad

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.340
Stress program that will be
brought to you very soon.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.980
I'm really passionate about
mindfulness as a vehicle for me

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.930
to have sanity in my work
life and in my personal life.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.840
I started these practices
about eight years ago.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.350
And they have been
profoundly helpful

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.420
in all kinds of difficult
situations in my life.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.550
My journey started with Search
Inside Yourself program here.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.210
And I've done some
work outside, as well.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.680
But as a parent, I
find so many moments

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.540
where just being
present and aware

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.280
in times of difficulty
when our children are sick,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.470
they're having a tantrum.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.330
I have an 11-year-old
daughter, a middle schooler,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.870
and a one-year-old son.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.220
And I have a lot of
moments where I just

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.430
don't know how I can be helpful
in that particular situation.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.760
So staying mindful
and present and open

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.730
to whatever is
happening in that moment

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.410
has been tremendously helpful.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.100
So to support that and share it
with all of you as part of G+,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.250
we are trying to integrate
mindful parenting program

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.730
at Google where we will
bring speakers at least once

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.700
a quarter, if not more,
to talk about this topic

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.370
and potentially also
offer some classes,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.160
or give you resources that you
can avail outside of Google.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.970
So with that
introduction, I'm really

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.100
excited to have
Isa Gucciardi here

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.610
to talk to us about
conscious parenting today.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.420
She describes this
talk as, let's face it.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.690
Parenting is hard.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.260
We agree.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.060
Parenting is hard.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.860
Most of us become parents
with very little idea

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.070
about what will be
asked of us, and what we

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.640
will need to ask of ourselves.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.990
In order to offer our
children as many opportunities

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.440
to be successful in
navigating the complexities

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.560
of modern life, we have to
gain great awareness of how we

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.100
can best meet those challenges.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.930
In this talk, Isa Gucciardi
covers important topics

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.160
to help parents meet their
children with as much

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.270
love, discernment, and
capacity as possible,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.810
while offering
strategies to help

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.470
parents gain greater
confidence and enjoyment

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.880
raising their children.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.250
So Isa holds a degree
and certificates

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.960
in psychology, cultural and
linguistic anthropology,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.720
comparative religion,
hypnotherapy,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.670
and transformational healing.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.780
She's the creator of highly
effective therapeutic model

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.600
called Depth Hypnosis.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.930
And she's also the author of
"Return to the Great Mother,"

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.840
a book that she's gifted
to me this morning.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.210
And I'm eager to read that.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.220
It's a book on birthing.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.890
Isa is the founding director
of the Foundation of the Sacred

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.060
Stream, and teaches nationally
and internationally.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.250
She has two children.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.410
so she's been there.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.505
It's not all abstract.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:28.680
I'm sure she'll share some of
her own experiences with us

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.570
as well.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.200
And an active counseling
practice in San Francisco

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.030
where she resides
with her partner.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.130
Please join me in
welcoming Isa, who

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.245
will take us through
this one-hour journey

00:03:38.245 --> 00:03:39.930
on conscious parenting together.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.325
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:47.830
ISA GUCCIARDI:
Thank you, Ruchika.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.579
Thank you so much.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.250
Just a moment to thank
Ruchika for all the work

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.250
that she has done
in carrying forward

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.330
the legacy of [INAUDIBLE]
and your own inspiration

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.110
to benefit the Google community.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.690
And I've actually
had the good fortune

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.400
to join you here a couple
of times over the last year.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.580
In May I was here
with Thupten Jinpa,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.610
who is His Holiness, the Dalai
Lama's main English language

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.110
interpreter.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.940
And he was here
speaking on his new book

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.480
called "A Fearless Heart,"
which is an amazing book.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.050
If you're looking for tools
to become more conscious,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.430
try that book.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.340
And if you didn't get to see
his talk when he was here,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.590
I think it's on YouTube.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.900
And you can benefit
from seeing that.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.480
And it was actually on
[INAUDIBLE] last day

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.150
last fall that I accompanied
Robert Thurman, who

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.070
came to speak to
the Google community

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.970
about spirituality
and the workplace.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.410
And again, he's another
wonderful teacher

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.330
if you're looking for
resources to become more aware.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.490
His book, "Infinite
Life," really

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.140
focuses on qualities that can
help you as you're parenting.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.260
So over the last
year I've also gotten

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.830
to know Ruchika a
little bit better.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.080
And one of the
things that I've seen

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.000
is that we really
share a common vision.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.300
And that vision is to try to
bring as much mindfulness,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.370
as much awareness, as
much consciousness,

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.710
to as many people as possible.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.510
So it's such a
privilege to be here,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.660
to be able to share
that vision, and to be

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.100
able to speak to you on the
topic of conscious parenting.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.110
As Ruchika said, I'm the
parent of two children.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.540
And I've been
counseling and teaching

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.220
families and children,
teens, couples,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.790
over the last 20 years.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.410
And over the course
of the last 10 years,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.060
I've noticed a big shift
in the central issues

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.690
around parenting.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.010
And that shift is due mainly
to the more central role

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.370
that technology is now
playing in the family.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.580
And I think this is one
of the big, big challenges

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.810
that parents are
trying to work with.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.350
And the challenges that parents
face today in raising children

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.140
are really, really different
than the challenges

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.070
that their parents faced.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.040
Not only do parents
have to figure out

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.850
how to do with less
sleep, but they also

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.210
have to determine the role
they want technology to play

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.470
in their child's development.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.220
If parents find
themselves with less time

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.800
than they would like
to devote to parenting,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.830
they have to figure out new
strategies for discipline,

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.870
nourishment, and enrichment.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.360
And this is
difficult when people

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.280
find themselves trying
to navigate the issues

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.240
around work/life balance.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.360
Many times people
have to face down

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.470
issues of self-doubt
and guilt in trying

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.600
to make the choices
that they want

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.310
to make for the best and
highest good for their children.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.560
So one of the first
steps that parents

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.050
must take toward
meeting these challenges

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.040
and learning to parent
more consciously

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.820
is to develop a
good understanding

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.895
of their own values.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.860
If parents want to be
able to raise children

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.490
who can meet the
challenges of the future

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.180
with an open heart
and a focused mind,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.210
they must not only
understand, but be

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.200
able to clearly
communicate their values

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.130
to their children in everything
they do and in everything they

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.240
say.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.060
So in order to be able to
communicate values clearly

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.220
and to apply them
in a consistent way,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.680
parents must spend some time
learning what their values are.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.100
This may sound simple.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.620
But it's surprising to see
how many people struggle

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.680
to articulate their
values for themselves,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.380
and much less for
their children.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.900
The effort to engage
in this articulation

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.800
is very important, perhaps one
of the most important steps

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.020
that parents must take
in order to parent

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.400
with more mindfulness
and more awareness.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.909
Because parenting
is taking place now

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.360
in such a different environment,
role models and mentors

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.820
are difficult to come by.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.300
This compounds an
already age-old problem,

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.700
which is that many of us were
parented by people who weren't

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.790
parented well themselves.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:59.370
So we have this legacy of less
than ideal situations leading

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.330
into parenting.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.460
So many parents just
don't have the role models

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.130
they need readily
at hand when they're

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.900
trying to make decisions
about screen time,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.100
toilet training,
internet privacy,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.030
curfews, it's all together.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.110
And it's important
therefore to seek

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.340
role models who hold the
values that you hold,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.870
and seek their help.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:32.390
In order to do this, you have
to define your own values.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.820
What is important to you?

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.305
Do you know how to
begin to answer this?

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.230
Do you have a clear
idea of what values

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.780
you want your children to
bring forward into the world

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.410
as they mature and take
their place in confronting

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.360
the complexities of
the modern world?

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:07.220
Let's start at a fairly high
level here looking at values.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.920
So I'd like you to
just take a moment

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.636
and focus inward
and allow yourself

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:20.900
to consider two spiritual values
that are important to you.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:27.936
So just let yourself
think for a moment.

00:10:27.936 --> 00:10:31.560
What are two spiritual values
that are important to you?

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.170
And if you're
co-parenting, what are

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.610
two spiritual values you know to
be of value to your co-parent?

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.620
If there are differences
in your sets of values,

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.040
what is your strategy for
bridging those differences

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.900
so you can present a unified
message to your children?

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.040
If your values are
similar, what kinds

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.160
of activities and
interactions do you

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.822
create on a regular basis
to communicate those values

00:11:27.822 --> 00:11:28.530
to your children?

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.550
Given the importance
of these values,

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.090
whom do you have to turn
to, to help you continue

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.307
to address and develop
these values in parenting

00:11:49.307 --> 00:11:49.890
your children?

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.800
You can see how much goes into
the development of just one

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.900
set of values.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.060
But there are many other
values to look at in order

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.770
to be able to parent with as
much mindfulness, awareness,

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.320
and consciousness as possible.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.950
As I was putting my thoughts
together to talk to you,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.490
I thought I was going to
touch more fully on the issues

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.640
that we touch on in
the conscious parenting

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.370
classes at the Sacred Stream
Center in Berkeley, California.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:37.690
These classes focus on helping
parents locate inner resources,

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.000
and learning how to
draw upon them better.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.670
They focus on helping parents
articulate their needs

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.070
and values.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.240
And they help parents learn
how to work effectively

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:57.490
with willfulness, and focus on
discipline more effectively.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.060
And they offer
parents strategies

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.120
for parenting a child
who is challenged.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.850
The reason for
examining these issues

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.270
in the context of conscious
parenting is simple.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.980
When these issues are addressed,
the protection and cultivation

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.680
of the child's authentic
expression in the world

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.190
is assured.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.890
And if you were to ask me
to define one goal that we

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.660
as parents must do
our best to attain,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.640
I would say that it is
this-- the protection

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.390
and cultivation of our
child's authentic expression

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.940
in the world.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.210
So that is the topic I would
like to focus on here today.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.120
Whenever I'm working
with families,

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.480
especially the parents
of young children,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.620
I always try to walk a line
between creating a forum where

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.410
people can understand
themselves more fully

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.210
so that they can understand how
many resources they actually

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:08.990
have, and offering advice
or council from that place,

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.580
and the line between
offering opinion.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.650
It's really easy for me to go
into opinion about parenting.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.880
But I'm really going
to try not to do that.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.480
But I might.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.830
I might wander into
the opinion place,

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.270
because this is really
so close to my heart--

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.440
this idea of being able
to protect your child's

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.730
expression in the world.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.220
This is so important.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.420
Many great educators,
including Maria Montessori

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.900
and Rudolf Steiner,
spoke to this issue, each

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.080
in their own way.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.990
They each offered structures
that support children

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.840
and having the
freedom to discover

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.420
their own unique talents,
gifts, and capacities.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.650
And they also offer structures
to address areas of weaknesses

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.430
or obstacles that children may
have which affect their ability

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.870
to fully move into the world
with those native gifts.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.420
The reason that the discussion
around values is so important

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.750
is because it is values that
become the structures we

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.610
offer our children
within which they

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.365
learn to express themselves.

00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:32.670
I'm gonna say that again,
because it sounds complicated,

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.122
but not-- can't get there.

00:15:35.122 --> 00:15:37.850
I'm gonna do it again.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.400
The reason that the discussion
around values is so important

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.940
is that values
become the structures

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.050
we offer our children
within which they

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.645
learn to express themselves.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.750
If we do not have clarity
around our own values,

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:00.080
we cannot offer effective
structures to our children.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.700
And worse, if we have
no values, or values

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.690
that actually inhibit
the authentic expression

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:12.100
of the child, children spend
important developmental time

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.880
trying to adapt themselves
to values which have nothing

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.870
to do with their
authentic expression,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.700
and which in fact may impede it.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.040
How many of you have spent
time trying to navigate around

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.800
a parent with anger issues?

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.940
Or addiction issues?

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.860
What did that do to your
ability to know what calls

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.415
to you from your own heart?

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.370
It is, I believe,
important to consider

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.170
that our most important
task as parents

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.330
is to try to develop a family
system whose structures support

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.770
the authentic expression
of the highest

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.860
potential of our children,
to help them learn

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:05.220
how to listen to what is calling
to them in their own hearts.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.510
This may sound easy.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.030
But it's not.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.319
When some people hear
this, they think, OK.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.480
Anything goes.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.079
Let the kids do
whatever they want.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:19.030
As long as they're expressing,
it's going to be OK.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.339
Or other parents may
hear this and think, OK.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.010
I have to figure out what my
child's highest potential is

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.120
and steer that child
toward them at every turn.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.120
Other parents may
respond, they're my kids.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.390
They're going to do what I
want, not what they want.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.270
But the task at hand is
more nuanced than any

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.720
of these approaches.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.140
First of all, we
need to define what

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.950
we mean by a child's
highest potential, which

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.500
I am using interchangeably
here with the child's deepest

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.870
calling, the child's most
authentic expression,

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.230
the child's gifts.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.750
I'm using these terms
interchangeably,

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:06.320
because they each offer a
different view and definition

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.830
that point to the
complexity of the deepest

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.230
aspects of our children.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.800
Naturally, every child's
highest potential

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.400
has its own expression.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.750
Every child has a
set of gifts that she

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:24.040
brings into the world that
resonate with her highest

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.820
calling.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.790
We must at once try
to tune ourselves

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.980
to this deepest aspect
of our children,

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.300
understand its
requirements, and get out

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.780
of the way of impeding
its expression,

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.850
while at the same time creating
structures which support it.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.380
This may sound like
rubbing your belly

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.460
and tapping your head
at the same time.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.340
And indeed, it is.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.730
But it is something we
can learn how to do.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.250
So I would like to identify
some of these tasks that will

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.320
help you with this process.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.590
First individually,
and then show you

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:08.090
how to put them together so
that the tapping and the rubbing

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.670
seems intuitive and easy.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.470
These tasks center
around a set of questions

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.500
I would like to offer you.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.970
First, how do I recognize
my child's deepest calling?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.215
Two, how do I recognize
my child's gifts?

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.520
Three, why do I have to get out
of the way of the expression

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.520
of my child's potential?

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.090
Four, how do I get
out of the way?

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.040
Five, what does
it mean to create

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.750
structures that support the
expression of my child's

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.250
potential?

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.370
So we're going to address each
one of these individually.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:13.610
The first question is, how do
I recognize my child's deepest

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.160
calling?

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.300
This is actually
surprisingly easy to do.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.340
It is really just a
matter of watching

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.490
what your child is drawn to.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:31.180
Your children will naturally be
drawn to their highest calling

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.903
if they are not interrupted.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.630
How do I recognize
my child's gifts?

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.500
The answer is the same.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.650
Watch what your
child is drawn to.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:52.220
But recognizing the child's
gifts goes one step further.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.410
This involves watching what
games the child creates,

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:01.380
what stories the child
tells, and the way the child

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.720
seeks to express herself.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.830
There is an important part to
cultivating a child's gifts

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.150
that has to do with the
filtering of the kind

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.360
of information
that the child uses

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.940
as raw material for
that expression.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.250
And I will speak to
that in just a moment.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.500
The next question
is, why do I have

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.171
to get out of the way of
the expression of my child's

00:21:28.171 --> 00:21:28.670
potential?

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.940
We tend to think of
our children as ours.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.245
But they actually
belong to themselves.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.290
If they are lucky, their
path through this life

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:51.580
is a long one that extends
far beyond the few years

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.730
that we care for them.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:22:00.920
It is important to consider that
your ideas about what you want

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:06.580
for your child beyond wanting
them to be happy and safe

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.320
might become interrupting
to their natural expression.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.840
How many of you wanted
to study music, but were

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.590
told by your parents you had
to go to business school?

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.200
What message did this give
you about the possibility

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.790
of being supported in the
world by your deepest calling?

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.360
How does this affect you
on a daily basis today?

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.290
With this information,
consider how important

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.510
it is to give your child the
message that he can trust

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.230
his deepest calling, and that
he will be able to find a way

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.200
to let that expression of
that calling-- whatever

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.130
that expression
is-- support him.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.930
Give him practice in
letting all the potential

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.400
that the calling
and that calling

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.540
express itself by
supporting what he loves.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.900
And step out of the way.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.384
Next question is, how
do I get out of the way?

00:23:18.384 --> 00:23:20.870
Well, I've got a long
answer to this question.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.280
So bear with me.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.830
One of the best ways
to get out of the way

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.670
is to look at your
attachments to your children

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.220
being a particular way.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.410
Those attachments are probably
a function of something

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.210
that did not work in
your own childhood.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.120
For instance, let's say
you grew up in a household

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.660
without a mother present.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.640
And you felt her absence keenly.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.045
You grow, you marry a woman,
and you have children.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.310
And then you realize this
woman is more problematic

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.050
than I thought.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:07.250
This is not the person I
thought I was marrying.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.500
But now you have children.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.510
And because you
know how hard it was

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.090
for you not to
have a mother, you

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.946
put up with all kinds of bad
behavior from your spouse

00:24:18.946 --> 00:24:22.780
or from the child's mother,
rather than take the child

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.060
and leave the situation
and take the risk

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.820
that the child may grow up
without a full-time mother

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.790
figure.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.690
If you were not so
attached to your child

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.090
having a mother
because of the pain

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.560
that you experienced
at not having a mother,

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.960
you might have more
clarity in responding

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.140
to your spouse's bad behavior.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.300
Who knows?

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.170
Not having this problematic
woman in your child's life

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.020
on such a consistent
basis might be

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.740
the best thing for your child.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.400
But you cannot see this,
or even consider it

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.660
because of the unaddressed
issues that you carry from

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.530
your own wounding
at being motherless.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.970
In many ways, when we talk
about conscious parenting,

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.220
we are talking about becoming
more conscious of ourselves.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.140
We are talking
about understanding

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.240
what motivates us before we
even approach our children.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.190
The examination
of our motivation

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.830
and the way that it
drives decision-making

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.240
is a good example
of one of the steps

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.420
in the process of becoming
a more aware parent.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.050
Again, one of the best
ways to get out of the way

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.800
is to stop risking
interrupting your child's

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.610
authentic expression,
and to look deeply

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:53.050
at your own experience
of being parented.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.390
Seek to understand the
aspects of your upbringing

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:01.540
that worked best for you and
your own self-expression.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.100
And ask how you can apply
that understanding to serving

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.080
your child's expression.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.360
In this way you can tap
into your own resources

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.675
and become your own mentor.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.740
You can also look at the
aspects of your upbringing

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.470
that did not work
for you, and get help

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.830
in changing the way that these
aspects of your childhood

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:26.770
affect you today.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.680
I remember when
I first found out

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.070
I was pregnant with
my first child.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.626
I was looking at the
pregnancy indicator.

00:26:37.626 --> 00:26:38.750
And it was like it was yes.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.420
And I'm like, oh!

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.530
And I literally with the
indicator still in my hand,

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.700
I ran to the phone.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.440
We made phone calls back then.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.000
I ran to the phone and
I called a therapist.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.930
And I literally had the receiver
for the phone and the pregnancy

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.300
kit indicator in
my hand, because I

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.750
knew there was no
way I was going

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.210
to be able to face the
challenges of mothering

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:10.780
with all of my own
childhood experience

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.450
affecting me in
an uninformed way.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.580
I mean, I didn't
know much back then.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.210
But I knew that, right?

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:23.900
So not only do you have
to get out of the way

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.580
by addressing your own
unexamined experience in order

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.030
to be as clear as possible about
how to support your child's

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:35.730
potential, but it is
also important to look

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.950
at the experience that the child
is exposed to in the larger

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.870
cultural context.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.670
With the newfound
clarity gained in looking

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.890
at your personal issues,
you can determine

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.420
if the experience of the
larger cultural environment

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.380
is supporting your
child's potential or not.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.620
And this is where
that raw material

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:04.740
the child uses to formulate
her expression that I just

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.980
spoke about comes in.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.520
And it is also where
the issue of values

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.460
comes into play in
a very powerful way.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.850
You have to understand
what you value

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:24.590
and what you don't value in
the larger cultural context.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.310
How do you feel
about screen time

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.485
versus personal engagement?

00:28:35.157 --> 00:28:36.740
Something to think
about for a minute.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:46.760
What role should technology play
in early childhood development?

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.120
What level of violence
in computer games

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.190
is acceptable to you?

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.499
How do you feel about letting
children play with toy guns?

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.930
The answer to these questions
will determine the answer

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.810
to the last question for you.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.430
What does it mean
to create structures

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.290
that support the expression
of my child's potential?

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.820
The choices that you
make around values

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.229
create the structures
that support

00:29:44.229 --> 00:29:45.270
your child's development.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.930
If you have no
defined value system,

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:53.930
the values of the
larger cultural context

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:58.350
will become the structure
that supports or impedes

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.350
your child's expression.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.890
If your values are based
on an unexamined response

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.420
to the way you
were parented, they

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.660
will become the
structures that support

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.630
or impede the expression of
your child's authentic self.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.920
Is this what you
want for your child?

00:30:27.016 --> 00:30:30.800
If the answer is no,
you already understand

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.640
why conscious parenting
is so important.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.180
If you enter into
parenting without being

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.250
aware of the values
that are driving

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.740
your decisions
around parenting, you

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:46.050
will not know how to define
or articulate your values.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.130
If you don't have clear values,
you cannot know how to create

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:52.560
structures that support
you in skillfully guiding

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.345
the manifestation of your
child's highest potential.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.970
So as you get ready to
practice rubbing your belly

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.460
and tapping your
head at the same time

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.340
as you step into becoming
a more conscious parent,

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.790
just remember--
all you have to do

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:19.220
is observe carefully what
your child is drawn to.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.780
What stories is he telling you?

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.135
How does she express herself?

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.260
Invest time in looking
at your own experience

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.090
of being parented.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.475
And see what worked for
you and what did not.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.260
Take time to understand
the extent to which you

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.680
want the larger cultural
context to participate

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.990
in the formation of your child.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.830
If you follow these
steps, you will

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:59.120
know how to create experiences
which provide enough structure

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.070
to nurture your
child's potential,

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.790
but not so much
structure that it

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.190
stifles the expression
of your child's

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.785
heart's deepest calling.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.610
See.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.315
No so hard.

00:32:15.315 --> 00:32:17.565
Conscious parenting may not
be as hard as you thought.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.780
In these times when we are
facing societal upheaval,

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.610
environmental destruction,
and so much uncertainty

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:33.450
about the prospect that
technology has for delivering

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:37.310
us from an increasingly
unstable future,

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.170
I believe it is our
responsibility as parents

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:44.140
to do our best to raise
children who as adults meet

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.390
the challenges of the
future with an open heart

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.880
and a focused mind.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.560
It will be much easier
for them to do this

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.180
and to attain this
level of clarity

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.500
if they can listen to
their heart's calling.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.610
If they know what
their gifts are,

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:05.080
and if they can trust the
expression of their highest

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.700
potential, and know how
it will support them,

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.470
not only themselves,
but those around them.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.200
So if you'd like to explore
these matters in more depth

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.990
and gain more insight in how to
parent more consciously, please

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:27.000
join us at the Sacred
Stream Center in Berkeley.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.800
Weekly classes are
starting March 2.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.960
And if you're interested in
our offering those classes

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.500
in this context here to
the Google community,

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.620
just let Ruchika know.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:43.030
But for now I ask you to
bring forward some questions.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:47.190
I love questions, even questions
on things we haven't covered,

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.990
because there's so
much to parenting

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.060
that it's hard to cover
it in a short talk.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.491
So please.

00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:56.490
Anybody have a question?

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.580
You had a question, right?

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.445
Ruchika, did you want
to say something?

00:33:58.445 --> 00:34:00.191
RUCHIKA: I'm going
to pass on the mic.

00:34:00.191 --> 00:34:01.145
ISA GUCCIARDI: Oh, OK.

00:34:01.145 --> 00:34:02.560
RUCHIKA: I put it under here.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.060
There it is.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.768
ISA GUCCIARDI: You
had a question, right?

00:34:04.768 --> 00:34:05.520
He had a question.

00:34:08.287 --> 00:34:09.370
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Phillip.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.480
Thanks for being here.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.489
My question is, the
things you talk about, do

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:19.120
you have any data of how
much it actually matters,

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.139
as in give child a good
environment to grow up in.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.310
But all these micromanagerial
type of things.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:29.370
Do they actually matter?

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:34.409
Like if we obstruct the child's
expression of their talents,

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.340
aren't they going
to end up actually

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.250
doing what they want anyways?

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:44.280
I mean, how much real direction
control do we have as parents?

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.159
Like, this is all something
we might choose to do.

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:51.654
But in retrospect,
does it really matter?

00:34:51.654 --> 00:34:53.320
ISA GUCCIARDI: Well,
you know, if you're

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.590
going to speak at that
level, then you're saying,

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.380
well, the child has
their own destiny.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.574
They have their own fate.

00:34:59.574 --> 00:35:01.990
It doesn't matter what we do
because they're following it.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.747
Is that what you're saying?

00:35:03.747 --> 00:35:05.330
AUDIENCE: I'm not a
proponent of fate.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.108
I'm just asking about the data.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.450
ISA GUCCIARDI: I think
that it's difficult

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.900
when you're dealing with
issues of expression,

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.470
of the ineffable.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:25.960
It's hard to have hard
data that supports

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:35.680
or that denies the efficacy
or the authenticity

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.510
of that expression,
because we are really far

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.830
into the ineffable when
we think about what

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:46.580
is it that impels us
into the world, what

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.780
is it that draws us.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:55.530
And I spend most days
working with people

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.390
who have been really badly
wounded in their childhood,

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:03.990
where they've had-- I mean,
sometimes I joke around

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.910
and I say, all you
have to do these days

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.520
in order to be
wounded is be born.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.370
It's so hard to be in
the world right now.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.740
But one of the things
that I see again

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.900
and again every day,
I mean 10 hours a day,

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:23.130
is that people who have
been hurt or interrupted

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.560
in being able to
rest in themselves

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.610
have serious problems
later in life.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:34.002
And those problems can range
from anxiety, depression.

00:36:34.002 --> 00:36:36.210
I mean, look at the number
of people-- you want data?

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.991
Look at the number of people
who are on antidepressants.

00:36:38.991 --> 00:36:39.490
What is it?

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.700
Like 20 million?

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.640
I mean, sometimes I'm
in a grocery store

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.020
and I look around.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.470
And I realize I'm
the only person

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:50.110
in this place that is
not altered-- either

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:55.620
on prescription drugs or on
pot or on alcohol or on heroin

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.670
or on ice.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:00.876
It's like, everybody is trying
to get away from themselves.

00:37:00.876 --> 00:37:03.250
And the reason they're trying
to get away from themselves

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.390
is because they
weren't parented well.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.160
People who can
rest in themselves,

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.180
people who know
themselves, people

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.680
who understand what's
important for them

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.320
and want to express that
importance and trust that they

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:23.090
can express that importance,
don't need drugs.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.290
So I don't know if that
answers your question.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.076
But hopefully I got
somewhere near there.

00:37:28.076 --> 00:37:29.028
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:29.028 --> 00:37:29.980
ISA GUCCIARDI: Mm hm.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.680
AUDIENCE: As I've
been trying to become

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.130
more mindful in my
own practice and not

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:39.177
trigger as quickly, you know,
be more detached and everything.

00:37:39.177 --> 00:37:41.260
One of the places I've
found it hardest to do that

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.595
is in parenting.

00:37:42.595 --> 00:37:44.470
I have an almost
five-year-old girl and a one

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.190
and one half-year-old boy.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.606
And one of the
things I've noticed

00:37:46.606 --> 00:37:48.710
is obviously kids
trigger you a lot.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:49.220
Right?

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.761
They're sort of
almost programmed to.

00:37:50.761 --> 00:37:53.630
But I've also found I try
to sometimes be detached

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.967
and say, let's do this thing.

00:37:54.967 --> 00:37:55.800
Let's do this thing.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.160
But oftentimes being a little
bit more forceful in terms

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.368
of getting a little bit
angry or showing a little bit

00:38:00.368 --> 00:38:03.490
of disappointment or even
being a little bit stronger,

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.680
it compels them in a way
then just sort of saying,

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.860
let's not make a mess, let's
not make a mess over and over

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:08.190
doesn't.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.356
And so I struggle with that
because on the one hand,

00:38:10.356 --> 00:38:13.694
I don't want to just be reacting
from my amygdala to my kids.

00:38:13.694 --> 00:38:15.360
I want to be compassionate
and so forth.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.980
But kids often do seem to
respond more to a little bit

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.530
more forceful response.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:24.040
I'm just curious how you think
about resolving that paradox.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.570
How to remain mindful, but still
be compelling to your kids.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.070
ISA GUCCIARDI: I
don't think there's

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.700
any contradiction
between mindfulness

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.490
and being compelling.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.690
I think that this is
important for your children

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.110
to understand that
there are structures.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.900
And you play a little bit.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.070
OK, let's put it all away.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.010
Here we are.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.980
Sing a song.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:47.924
Put it away.

00:38:47.924 --> 00:38:49.590
And then they start
punching each other.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.320
It's like, OK.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.570
We're not playing anymore.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.020
We're putting things away.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:58.410
And you can have that
kind of compelling quality

00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:59.410
in your voice.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.410
But you need to
strip out the anger.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.940
And that's what the mindfulness
practice helps with.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:09.770
But I don't think it's a problem
giving very clear, compelling

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.352
statements to your children.

00:39:11.352 --> 00:39:12.310
I think it's important.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.130
They need that.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:15.410
AUDIENCE: If you're firm,
even in a detached way,

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:17.819
that works as well as--

00:39:17.819 --> 00:39:19.110
ISA GUCCIARDI: It works better.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.540
It works better.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.446
If you've got anger
issues coming up,

00:39:23.446 --> 00:39:24.820
it probably doesn't
have anything

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.740
to do with the child
doing what they're doing.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.050
So one of the great
things about parenting

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:33.800
is that it's a workshop to show
you the places within yourself

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.670
that you haven't addressed yet.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.045
And that's why you're saying
like they kind of go for it.

00:39:38.045 --> 00:39:40.300
They do kind of go for it.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.060
They want to push.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.130
They want to know how big
a container do I have here?

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.310
You know, how much can I
trust you to support me

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.760
without getting off balance?

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.670
And what happens
when I push you?

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:55.330
I mean, those are important
questions for children

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.060
to know the answer to.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.070
And what's really
important to do

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:02.360
is to give them a clear answer.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.340
You can push me this far.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.240
But you can't push
me any further.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.110
And if you push me any further,
I'm not going to get angry.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:10.760
I'm not going to reject you.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.909
But you are going to
have some consequences.

00:40:12.909 --> 00:40:14.700
And we're going to
apply those consequences

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.560
in a consistent and clear way.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.736
And I think that--

00:40:19.736 --> 00:40:20.450
AUDIENCE: And that's the
structure you're talking about.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:21.560
ISA GUCCIARDI: That's the
structure we're talking about.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.710
Exactly.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.690
And you know, if you
address your anger issues,

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:26.880
then you've got a structure.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.350
If you don't address
your anger issues,

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:29.490
you don't have a structure.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:33.110
Or the kids are like, I
don't know what to do.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.310
And then they pull back.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:37.330
They hold back.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:40.210
They're thinking about
what am I going to do

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.970
and how is it going
to affect you,

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.770
rather than what
am I going to do

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.000
and how is that
going to affect me.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.210
You don't want to have
children in that position.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:49.390
They want to know.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:52.850
They need to know what's going
to happen at any given time,

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.590
in general.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.680
I mean, of course,
things can happen

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.240
that are outside the box.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.177
But they generally need
to have consistency.

00:41:01.177 --> 00:41:02.760
And I think it's a
big mistake-- a lot

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.190
of times in
spiritual communities

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.600
there's this idea that you're
not allowed to be angry,

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.391
or that you shouldn't
listen to your anger,

00:41:08.391 --> 00:41:10.480
or you should
overcome your anger.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.520
I actually think anger
tells us important things.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.910
And I think that you can't just
be unleashing your anger all

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.490
the time and say, oh, I
have my right to my anger.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:24.120
But if you are
getting angry, it may

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.290
be because your
boundary's being violated.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:28.910
Or your child may
be getting angry

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.956
because her boundaries
are being violated.

00:41:30.956 --> 00:41:32.330
And that needs to
be listened to.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.872
And you don't want to give
her the same instruction

00:41:34.872 --> 00:41:35.830
that you give yourself.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:36.996
I have to overcome my anger.

00:41:36.996 --> 00:41:38.680
I can't be angry.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.670
And she's got somebody who's
taking her books at school all

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:43.170
the time.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.010
And she's angry.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:44.510
Good.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.380
She should be angry.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.600
Right?

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.610
It's not like, OK.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.100
Let's think about forgiveness.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:49.870
No.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.980
Let's think about
why are you angry.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.840
You're angry because
you're being violated.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.630
How are you being violated?

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.240
How do you deal
with that violation?

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.470
What is the most useful
way in approaching,

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.700
working with that violation,
other than your anger?

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.200
But listen to the anger.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:05.700
Right?

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.402
So I could give that
same advice to you.

00:42:08.402 --> 00:42:09.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:20.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.120
How useful would it
be if in addition

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.610
to listening to their
child's calling and interests

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.250
and providing that
environment for them

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.400
to fulfill that
potential, you also

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.870
introduce a more structured
mindfulness practice.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:36.870
Some sort of practice
in which they

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:39.690
are asked to sit and to breathe
and do something that clearly

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.620
is not coming from
them, but rather

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.500
from us trying to teach them
some tools and skills that

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.580
are useful for us.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.620
Is that going against that
principle law of allowing

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.180
them to be themselves?

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:51.930
ISA GUCCIARDI: No.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.850
The idea of doing some
kind of a structure

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:57.730
liked a mindfulness practice is
exactly what I'm talking about.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:01.610
It's a structure that's coming
out of the set of values

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:03.140
that you hold dear.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.180
OK?

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.132
So you're going to sit with
your child and say, OK.

00:43:07.132 --> 00:43:08.840
This is something
that's important to me.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.850
This is something that I value.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:16.560
And I'd like to offer it to
you to see what you do with it.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.210
And you know, I don't think that
that's inhibiting the child's

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.490
expression in any way.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.520
It's offering, again,
structures that

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.630
are based on your values
through which the child can

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.259
learn about themselves.

00:43:29.259 --> 00:43:30.050
And that's helpful.

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.485
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:43:34.485 --> 00:43:39.340
I was wondering about the
idea of the deepest calling.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.840
And to what extent do
you think it's something

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.920
that's kind of set at birth?

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.530
And to what extent do you
think it might be influenced

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:51.740
by the experiences the child
has maybe before he or she is

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:56.626
able to demonstrate affinity for
any particular sort of thing?

00:43:56.626 --> 00:43:57.500
ISA GUCCIARDI: Sorry.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.090
What?

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.971
AUDIENCE: Maybe like
um-- to what extent

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.720
do you think that that
might be influenced

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.910
by the experiences the child has
before he or she is old enough

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:11.280
to be able to show an affinity
for certain types of things

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.330
or people or experiences?

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.970
I guess part of my question
is how young do you

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:18.670
see this calling in children?

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.560
ISA GUCCIARDI: I see It from
almost the moment they're born.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.060
Yeah.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:26.172
And there are lots
of experiences

00:44:26.172 --> 00:44:27.130
that children can have.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.710
You're asking, is this is
something that's in them?

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.840
Or is it something
that comes forward

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:37.570
as they mature and have external
environmental influences

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:39.820
on them?

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:45.530
The question of nature
versus nurture, right?

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:47.420
Again, so here's my opinion, OK.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.690
So I actually firmly,
totally, and completely

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:56.260
believe-- OK,
there's an opinion--

00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:03.760
that everyone has something in
them that calls them to life.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.920
And different people have
different experiences

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:13.220
that either help them
fulfill that calling,

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.520
or they have experiences
where their experience of life

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.625
is a thwarting of that calling.

00:45:18.625 --> 00:45:22.020
But the calling is
there either way.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.184
And it depends.

00:45:23.184 --> 00:45:24.600
I mean, one of the
great tragedies

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.630
that I see every day is how
many people have so much beauty

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:32.310
in them that they can't express
because of their wounding

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.090
or their pain, right?

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:38.440
And of course, we have all
kinds of ways and depth hypnosis

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.770
of resolving that pain,
changing that pain,

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:42.770
changing the relationship
to that pain,

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:46.340
relieving the potential,
releasing the calling.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.930
I mean, that's what
I do all day long.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:51.800
So I feel like my opinion
is somewhat informed here.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.750
It may be anecdotal.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:58.290
But I can give you lots of
data of people who feel better

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:03.210
being able to release
their sense of calling

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.120
into the world.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.460
Everyone feels better
when they do that.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.460
There's some back there.

00:46:11.351 --> 00:46:11.850
That's OK.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:13.900
Go ahead.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.640
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
about resources

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.390
that I guess-- at
your organization,

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:23.205
you teach about resources to
use to call on during parenting.

00:46:23.205 --> 00:46:24.980
Resources to call
on during parenting.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.540
And I was just wondering if you
could maybe mention some things

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:33.840
about resources that-- I guess
you mean like at the exact time

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.200
that some issue's coming up.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.500
I've heard that term before.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.491
And I was just
wondering what you're--

00:46:40.491 --> 00:46:41.990
ISA GUCCIARDI: What
I'm referring to

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:45.110
with those resources
is that we spend

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:50.110
some time doing some inner
guided meditation to help

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:53.270
connect with aspects
of our self that

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:58.880
actually do know how to parent.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.130
Or have some wisdom
that we don't normally

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:05.890
tap into, because we're
trying to get the milk ready

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.380
and like get the
bus driver to wait.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.098
And, you know.

00:47:10.098 --> 00:47:16.990
And I think that this is one
of the values of meditation

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:20.480
is to help you be
able to look inward.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.380
But the guided
meditations that we

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:26.310
do are quite focused
in connecting

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.380
with an aspect of
yourself that might

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:33.860
take the form of a light or a
sound or a person or an animal.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:38.650
It may take some form that
is kind of a ray-ified aspect

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.290
of this wisdom within yourself.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:42.210
So that you can
call upon it when

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:44.440
you're ready to
tear your hair out

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.420
because your kid won't
get their shoes on.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.620
And it's time to go to school.

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:52.041
And you're going to be late for
that meeting with your boss.

00:47:52.041 --> 00:47:52.540
Right?

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.130
Where you can just
develop a relationship

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:59.340
with this part of yourself
in a more ray-ified way

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.040
so that you can
connect with that

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:06.130
and work with that as
you're deciding what

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:08.320
you're going to do about
putting the shoes on.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:08.840
Right?

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.670
It kind of slows
everything down.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:11.542
Right.

00:48:11.542 --> 00:48:12.250
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:22.049
ISA GUCCIARDI: OK

00:48:22.049 --> 00:48:23.590
AUDIENCE: Thanks a
lot for your talk.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.660
I particularly
appreciate your focus

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:31.740
on really helping the
kid discover themselves.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.410
And I noticed you talked also
about some structures that

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.550
help them learn emotional
intelligence skills,

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.310
be more whole,
that sort of thing.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:44.510
But I feel like as a
parent you are bombarded

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:47.160
with all these structures
that people suggest,

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.870
or that society
holds as a standard.

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:53.130
And so you very quickly
get into this situation

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.850
where you have to
choose those structures.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:02.380
And in so doing, you make
decisions based on your values,

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.030
assuming that they will
be their values, right?

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:09.400
The business school
example, for instance.

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.760
I feel like some parents
would look at that position

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.350
as, well, you can't have a
comfortable living if you're

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.330
a musician, right?

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:18.300
So make sure you have-- so
that's-- and you don't know

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:22.480
whether your kid is going to
replicate that by you or not.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.440
Right?

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.520
And then there are structures
that seem kind of arbitrary,

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.930
like anything from table
manners to learning

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.320
how to spell correctly.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.330
So you have to make
lots of decisions

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:43.050
your kid before you know or
they know how they would choose.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:46.450
And so I wonder how
you approach that.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.180
ISA GUCCIARDI: Well,
as I mentioned--

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.610
it's a great question.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.970
As I mentioned,
one of the things

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.770
that I think is most
helpful to focus on,

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:57.560
especially when kids
are little, is what do I

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.990
need to do to keep them safe?

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:02.050
And what do I need to
do to keep them happy?

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.710
And that doesn't mean giving
them all the candy they want.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:10.375
It doesn't mean putting
them on a leash.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.800
So especially when
they're little,

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.050
those are two things that you
can always focus on if you're

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:23.150
trying to make a decision.

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:25.810
What do I think about
this computer game?

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:26.960
OK.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.650
Is this going to keep
my kid feeling safe?

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:32.290
Or is the violence in that game
going to give them nightmares?

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:32.720
OK.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.261
I guess I'm not going to give
them that computer game, right?

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:41.810
But if you think about safety
and happiness, and then

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.410
you just use that as a measure
as you're holding it up

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:47.325
against all of the
bombardment, as you say,

00:50:47.325 --> 00:50:49.630
of the cultural environment.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:53.510
I have to say as a parent, I
felt like my main primary duty

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:56.022
became filtering the culture.

00:50:56.022 --> 00:50:58.480
It was so important because
there's so much in the culture.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.521
I mean, I have a degree
in cultural anthropology.

00:51:00.521 --> 00:51:03.400
So I'm already looking
at culture, right?

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:09.570
But there's so much in the
culture that is deadening.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.270
And you have to decide--
again, that's my opinion.

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:14.320
Right?

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.390
And you have to
decide, to what extent

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:20.850
do I want my child to
be influenced by that?

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:22.760
And the way you answer
that is, is this

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.650
going to keep my
child happy and safe?

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:26.240
Right?

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.290
I find that that is a really--
if you don't take anything

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:33.590
else away from this
talk-- just think, mantra.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.906
What will keep my
child happy and safe?

00:51:35.906 --> 00:51:38.030
And you may have different
ideas than other people.

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.300
But you know you're
doing your best.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.790
Again, I don't think
there's one answer.

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:46.260
Because I think there
are general answers.

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:50.100
But every child has
their own tolerances.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.670
And every parent has
their own set of values.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.600
So again, you have to
have enough structure

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.950
to allow for a
range of expression,

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.330
not so much structure
that you crush it.

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:04.180
And those two questions--
what will keep my child safe.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:06.710
And what will keep
my child happy.

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.270
Navigate those two
poles pretty well.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.188
Hopefully that's helpful.

00:52:11.188 --> 00:52:12.104
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:16.800
ISA GUCCIARDI: Yeah.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.805
RUCHIKA: And Isa will
be around even after

00:52:18.805 --> 00:52:22.410
if you want to [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.940
Give opportunity
for the live stream.

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.494
One person emailed--

00:52:27.494 --> 00:52:28.910
ISA GUCCIARDI:
Ruchika, I'm sorry.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:29.910
I don't think that's on.

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:34.070
So in case-- Is it?

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:34.570
RUCHIKA: OK.

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:36.220
I'll come closer to you, Isa.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.850
So you can hear me.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:41.820
So Kendall would
love to know what's

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:45.250
your opinion on CDC announcing
that they're coming to Palo

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:49.400
Alto plus Silicon Valley to
study our mass teen suicides

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.370
that you may have
heard of occurring

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.350
in Palo Alto in particular.

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:55.230
And why do you
think that might be?

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.520
She has her own hypothesis
because she lives here,

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.442
but is interested in
knowing what could

00:53:05.442 --> 00:53:06.650
be causing the teen suicides.

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.770
ISA GUCCIARDI: The question
is, from the live stream,

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:18.325
what do I think might
be causing the surge

00:53:18.325 --> 00:53:20.285
in teen suicides in Palo Alto.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.610
Well, the first
thing I always say

00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:28.000
is that every case is
completely individual.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.030
It's very difficult to
make generalizations

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:32.995
about any form of behavior.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:42.390
I would say that this is a very
difficult time to be alive.

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:46.830
I would say that our
children at a very young age

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:51.170
are dealing with the specter
of environmental destruction.

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:54.280
There's a great sorrow in that.

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:59.300
I also think it's very hard
to be young and realizing

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.940
that this is what's happening.

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.590
It's hard enough for us since
we're older to confront it.

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:10.760
But I think that
also there is a lot

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.560
of violence in this culture.

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.190
I know that's my opinion.

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:19.120
But there is a lot of
violence in this culture.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.520
And when you have
a lot of violence

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.460
that is tolerated,
like on TV shows

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.190
and cartoons and
video games, when

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:30.420
you have a lot of violence
that is witnessed and seen

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.350
in all the different media
places where children are

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:36.770
seeing it, it's
not too far a step

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:40.540
to think about that violence
being turned inward.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:45.450
It's like there's a tolerance
of violence in the culture

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:49.000
generally that I personally
think is not healthy.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.160
So the idea of
self-destruction is not

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.820
too far away from the
kind of destruction

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.870
that they're seeing all
around them all the time.

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:58.650
Now, I think that every
one of those children--

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:00.150
like I would really
like to sit down

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:02.030
with every one of
those children.

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:04.720
I would have loved
the opportunity

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.300
to sit down, because there
is this phenomenon that

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.030
is occurring.

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:09.780
And this is something
that Jinpa spoke to.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.290
And it's something that I
speak to all the time, which

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:19.310
is this split within the self
that arises in the West, which

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:22.750
is a form of self-loathing.

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:25.370
And it's a disease that
we have here in the West

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:28.440
that doesn't seem to exist
so much in other places,

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.880
although everyone
else is catching it.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:37.250
But this inner division of
the rejection of the self.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.460
And Jinpa tells a
story about this.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:43.920
Well, I actually-- before I got
to know Jinpa as well as I do,

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.550
I used to tell this story,
because I heard this interview

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:51.140
that he gave on "Fresh
Air" in the '90s, when

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:55.810
Terry Gross asked him what is
the most difficult thing you've

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:58.740
ever had to translate
for His Holiness?

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.350
And he said that he was in
an East/West conference.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:07.520
And he translated the word
self-loathing into Tibetan.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:10.720
And His Holiness stopped
him and said, no, no, no no.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.890
You must be doing that wrong.

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.950
That's the wrong translation.

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:17.390
And Jinpa said, no.

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:18.990
That's the translation.

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:20.300
It's self-loathing.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:24.980
And His Holiness said, but the
self cannot loathe the self.

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:28.970
So I mean, one of the most
erudite people on the planet

00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:32.620
did not understand that we
do have this disease here

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.620
in the West, the self-loathing,
the self-- and this

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.880
is one of the primary
things that I work with.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:43.050
I have a new book coming out
called "Coming to Peace."

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:48.310
And it's about the
reflection of inner violence

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.560
in outer relationships,
and the way

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:55.000
that our outer relationship
express or give us information

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.660
about our own inner violence.

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.630
Other inner experience as well.

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:02.230
But it's a book about
conflict resolution,

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:06.730
basically saying that we
cannot have peace in external

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:09.290
relationships until we
have peace in the internal

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:11.300
relationship with ourself.

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:16.980
And I think that there is this
idea, this scientific idea--

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.760
what is this self?

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.170
This is not scientific.

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:21.190
We can't prove it.

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:22.340
You know, what is this?

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.870
And there's rejection of spirit,
this rejection of the soul,

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:29.120
this rejection of the
deeper part of the self,

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:33.560
which is extremely
unscientific to just reject

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.970
this aspect of experience.

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:38.170
And so people don't
have tools, they

00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:41.840
don't have vocabulary
to speak to this kind

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.320
of inner dislocation
that they experience,

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:51.280
because there's nothing
rational or replicable about it.

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:57.090
And yet, people suffer deeply
internally because they cannot

00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:58.800
rest in themselves.

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.200
And one of the reasons they
cannot rest in themselves is

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.160
because they look around them.

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.380
There's so much violence.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.600
There's no place
to rest externally.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.300
They go inside themselves.

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:10.250
They haven't been able
to develop resources

00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.340
because everyone says there's
no such thing as spirit,

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.506
there's no such thing as
soul, there's no such thing

00:58:14.506 --> 00:58:15.335
as the deeper self.

00:58:15.335 --> 00:58:17.640
And so they're left
with this emptiness.

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.480
Right?

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.420
So there's my attempt
to answer that question.

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.370
And I would imagine
that most of those teens

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:28.300
were walking somewhere along
in this field of experience

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.020
that I've just described here.

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.870
RUCHIKA: Thank you,
Isa for coming down

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:34.410
today and answering
our questions

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.780
and sharing your wisdom.

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.820
Isa will be here for lunch.

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:42.020
So if you want to join us or
ask questions if some of them

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.930
were not answered,
please come up.

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:47.760
And join the
mindful-parenting group.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.070
Right now I'm announcing
it to GPause [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:52.560
on Parents Network.

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.280
But I'm sure not everybody is
a parent or interested in it.

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.450
So we'll start communicating
to mindful-dash parenting group

00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:01.520
more about these
conversations and talks.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:06.820
So if you have passion for
this field, just write to me.

00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:10.550
And we can organize events and
classes here together as well.

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:11.580
So thank you for coming.

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:15.070
And thanks to everyone who
joined our live stream as well.

00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:16.820
And we'll look forward
to seeing you soon.

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:17.320
Thanks.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.170
