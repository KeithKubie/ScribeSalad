00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:03.283
(music}

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:04.739
Samantha: We're here in
the Paper Study Center

00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:09.726
with Léon Bakst's "Costume design
for the ballet The Firebird".

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:12.737
Born Lev Rosenberg in
Belarus. the Russian artist

00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:15.403
Léon Bakst is best known
for his stage designs

00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:18.361
for the Ballets Russes,
the pioneering company

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.488
founded by impresario
Sergei Diaghilev in 1909.

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:24.827
In the 1910s and 20s, the Ballet Russes

00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:27.778
was instrumental in
fostering collaborations.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:30.875
The company was responsible for the 1913

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.944
Succès de scandale, The
Rite of Spring, whose

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:37.317
dissident music by Igor
Stravinsky and equally modern

00:00:37.317 --> 00:00:41.652
choreography by Vaslav Nijinsky
shocked Parisian audiences.

00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:44.405
This costume designed by
Léon Bakst was for the ballet

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:48.261
The Firebird, which
premiered in Paris in 1910.

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:50.738
Léon Bakst was apparently so enchanted

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:54.208
by this magical character
drawn from Russian folktales,

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.570
that he made several
designs for her costumes,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.852
including this one dating from 1913.

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:02.402
The very finished, elaborate
look of this drawing

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:04.569
suggests that rather than a real working

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.404
study for a costume, this
was more a finished work

00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:10.153
in which Bakst immortalized
the look of the character

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.876
that meant so much to him.

00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:14.611
Bakst is generally
associated with symbolism,

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:17.818
with its sinuous lines
and opulent exoticism,

00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:20.126
the very stylized posed of the figure

00:01:20.126 --> 00:01:22.811
and the silver touches of metallic paint.

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:25.642
In a yellow and orange
arabesques that emanate

00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:28.336
from the firebird's skirt,
these forms are repeated

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:30.753
in her headdress and
in the peacock feathers

00:01:30.753 --> 00:01:32.586
that adorn the costume.

00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:35.087
At the same time, there's
a freeze-like flatness

00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:38.105
to the picture, as if this
figure were compressed

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:40.270
in the two dimensions
of the picture plane.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.654
This effect is heightened
by the flat, decorative

00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:45.184
pattern of the firebird's
skirt and this pattern

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:47.641
comes from Russian folk
art, which makes sense

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:51.642
considering the ballet source
material and Bakst's heritage.

00:01:51.642 --> 00:01:54.541
But we might also think of
this flat, geometric quality

00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:57.267
as being influenced by
avant-guarde aesthetics

00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:00.475
in Paris at the time, particularly cubism.

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:03.477
Bakst had been visiting Paris
since the early 20th century

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.725
and settled there permanently in 1912

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.141
when he was exiled from St. Petersburg.

00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:11.142
Critics of the day noted
Baskt's use of color

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:12.892
and they referred to his palette as

00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:16.639
"violent, shrieking orgies of color."

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.392
This drawing then, speaks
to the close relationship

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:22.670
between mere decoration
and real radicality

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.920
that existed at this transitional
moment for modernism.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.920
