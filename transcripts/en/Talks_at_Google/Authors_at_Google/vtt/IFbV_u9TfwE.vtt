JILLIAN: Linden Schaffer
is a wellness travel

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.460
expert and consultant.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.760
Early on in her fashion career,
she realized the way she worked

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.160
was turning her into a
tightly wound ball of stress

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.680
and tension, which I'm sure
many of us can relate to.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.500
So before every
business trip, she

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.680
conducted hours of research
planning her own self-care

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.230
in her few precious
hours of downtime.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.910
And it changed her life.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.850
Today, Linden leads
travelers around the world

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.360
on wellness vacations via
Pravassa, the first wellness

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.610
travel company.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.290
Linden has been recognized
as a leader in her field

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.820
and as a winner of the
prestigious British Airways

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.150
Face of Opportunity contest.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.670
She contributes to columns
in the "Huffington Post"

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.670
and "mindbodygreen," where she
writes about wellness, travel,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.840
and lifestyle.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.920
She is a regular
speaker at conferences,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.580
including the "New York
Times" and "Los Angeles Times"

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.750
travel shows.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.780
Her first book, "Living Well on
the Road, Health and Wellness

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.540
for Every Traveler," became
a number one best seller

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.830
upon release.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.434
And here's Linden.

00:01:05.434 --> 00:01:08.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:13.600
LINDEN SCHAFFER: Good afternoon.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.810
Thank you, Jillian, so
much for hosting me.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.660
Thanks to Google.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.900
Thank you guys for spending
your lunch time with me.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.130
I'm really excited to be
here today and talk to you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.310
about living well on the
road, or what I also call,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.250
how to plan a business trip
that doesn't kill you--

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.130
very important in the day
and age that we work in.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.330
So who am I?

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.990
And why am I here to talk
to you about this today?

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.060
I am the girl who,
at 16 years old,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.527
had my first international
travel experience.

00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:43.110
And it's something
that stuck with me.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.060
I was able to go to Australia.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.400
And ever since
then, my wanderlust

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.010
and my idea of wanting
to explore the world

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.710
was deeply seeded
and rooted in me.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.270
I spent 15 years in the fashion
industry in New York City.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.802
And my time there, I would
go in for my job interviews.

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:01.260
And we'd have this
great interview.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.450
We'd talk about what
I was doing or about

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.770
to do with this company.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.870
And at the end, the
interviewer would say, hey,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.953
do you have any questions?

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:09.210
And I would say yes.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.200
How much is this a
work travel situation?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.570
And how much vacation
time do I get?

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.890
So you can imagine, these
interviewers were like,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.170
wait a second.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.600
Your biggest concern
about this job

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.880
is how much time you get
to spend out of the office?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.770
OK, let's think about
this a little bit.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.992
So luckily enough,
throughout the career

00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:30.450
that I had in the
fashion industry,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.860
I was able to travel a lot.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.529
I would travel domestically.

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:34.820
I would travel internationally.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.040
I would travel for weeks on
end with no break in between.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.960
And there I was one
morning, waking up

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.160
in a hotel room in Italy and
having no idea where I was.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.960
So I'm sure that's
happened to some of you

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.310
in this room before.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.144
You had no idea
between the jet lag,

00:02:49.144 --> 00:02:51.060
between where you were
yesterday, where you're

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.347
going tomorrow, where are you?

00:02:53.347 --> 00:02:54.430
And I said, you know what?

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.187
I got to-- something
here has got to give.

00:02:56.187 --> 00:02:57.270
Something's got to change.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.470
I can't be stressed out.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.460
I can't be burnt out.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.900
I can't be productive
in this situation.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.230
So what is it that I can do
to change the way that I'm

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.580
living while I travel?

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.830
So what I did was I started
to just simply pool from tools

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.640
that I had used in my own life.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.390
So whether it was yoga
practicing or meditation

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.580
or eating healthy
at home, I figured

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.250
there's got to be a way
that I can implement this

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.210
while I'm on the road as well.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.990
So I started doing my own
little tips and tricks.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.259
And I would take
that circuit again.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.800
I would see the same people that
I was always traveling with.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.640
And they would look at me.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.430
And they would say,
you know what, Linden?

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.600
You seem rested.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.440
You seem happy.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.730
You seem healthy.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.230
What has changed?

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.380
And how do I get that?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.130
So I started to think
to myself, OK, there

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.180
must be something here.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.550
Everybody is stressed out,
burnt out, living on the road

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.800
when they travel for business.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.110
And they need to get
some sanity back.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.810
They need to get some
semblance of themselves back.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.070
And this led organically
to the launch of Pravassa,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.140
which is the wellness
travel company I run.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.090
It was the first wellness
travel company that

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.010
was created here in the US.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.812
And throughout that
time, the clients

00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:06.270
that I would take on the road
for these health and wellness

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.950
vacations wanted
more information.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.740
How do I implement
this when I get home?

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.087
Traveling with you is fantastic.

00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:13.920
But now I need to figure
out how to put this

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.120
into my own lifestyle, which is
how "Living Well on the Road"

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.870
came to be.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.079
It's the book you guys are
all getting a copy of today.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.480
That goes into
health and wellness,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.950
the science behind it,
why these things work,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.880
which is what we're going
to talk through a little bit

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.750
today.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.210
So one of the things I
think we can all agree on

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.630
is that travel is stressful.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.817
There is no way around that.

00:04:36.817 --> 00:04:38.400
And the first thing
that we have to do

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.610
is recognize that
and say to ourselves,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.320
why is travel stressful?

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.420
Because as humans,
we are hardwired

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.420
to avoid negative experiences.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.030
We've all had a bad
travel experience.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.030
We've missed the flight.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.200
We've run for a flight.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.420
We've had an altercation
maybe with the gate

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.180
agent who wouldn't get us on
that flight, whatever it is,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.780
right?

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.240
So those are the
experiences we internalize

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.550
and the experiences
that we remember.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.440
And so we start to
make our decisions

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.230
from this fear-based place
of I don't want to do that.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.680
I don't want to do that.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.550
So let's talk a little
bit about that fear base

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.340
and what it is
that it does to us.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.910
And then let's learn some
tools of how to deal with that

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.330
and move on.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.920
So when we're talking
about the stress of travel,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.220
the stress of travel affects
our whole mind/body connection--

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.860
the physical, the mental,
and the emotional.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.050
When it comes to
our physical selves,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.730
you can picture
yourself now, right?

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.275
You're running
through the airport.

00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:35.911
You're trying to
make that flight.

00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:37.410
You're the last
person on the plane.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.785
There's no room
for your luggage.

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:40.200
So you're trying to cram it in.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.510
You're trying to cram
yourself into the seat, right?

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.580
All of these things are
completely stressful

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.470
and take our body out of whack.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.740
We're disrupting sleep patterns
when we change time zones,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.850
even especially if we're doing
it for a short period of time.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.610
We're increasing our
sedentary behavior.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.020
You know, you guys
here at Google

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.290
are lucky enough to have
these great outdoor spaces

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.790
and these conference rooms so
you can get up and move around

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.540
a little bit.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.300
That's not the typical workplace
environment these days.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.730
So people are taking
themselves from sitting

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.510
behind a desk to sitting on a
plane for hours on end, right?

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.340
This is stressing
our physical system.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.030
When it comes to
our mental system,

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.910
we're also taxing our brains.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.370
We live in this day and
age, because we're so

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.950
connected all the time
with everything that we do,

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.860
we live in a constant state of
chronic stress on some level.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.540
We have moved away from being
in that nice relaxed place

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.610
to being in that place
where we're constantly

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.380
in our fight or flight mode.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.350
So add on top of that
business travel, right?

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.440
You have to make sure
you're working very well.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.540
But then you also have
to make sure, like, oh,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.190
how am I going to pack?

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.360
Am I prepping for my
meetings properly?

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.930
And then the anxiety
and the worry

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.390
that's added on
top of that when it

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.640
comes to all of these
things, so our brain starts

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.380
to work over time.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.060
And our emotional state, we
have anxiety around travel.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.220
There is a lot going
on in the world today.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.760
Whether it's where
we're traveling,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.000
whether it's going through
the airport itself,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.710
we start to get anxious.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.030
Am I going to make that flight?

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.010
Have I prepped for that
meeting really well?

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.070
Am I going to have an issue
when I land on the ground?

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.590
There's also a lot of
mistrust these days

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.180
in the travel industry.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.550
I'm sure we've all seen
the viral videos that

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.620
have come out in
the last few weeks,

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.390
even specifically, right?

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.600
So the clients and
everyone who is traveling

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.820
has an inherent mistrust
of these companies

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.030
that we are entrusting
our business travel to.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.700
And then fear-- so back
to this making decisions

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.690
from a place of fear.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.970
Some people are
afraid of flying.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.410
So that itself sets you
up in a negative space

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.820
before you've even taken off.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.440
So these are all
things that we have

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.810
to deal with when
it comes to travel.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.340
So why do we do it, right?

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.170
Why do companies
keep sending us out?

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.160
What is the benefit
of business travel?

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.740
And there are many benefits
to business travel.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.450
The biggest things
here are it builds

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.490
relationships and retention.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.940
And that is not only from
the client and employer side,

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.940
but also from the employee
to the employer side.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.220
So when you're able
to get on the road

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.230
and you meet your
clients face to face,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.090
it builds these relationships.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.750
It builds these relationships
between you and your client.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.840
You bond with your client
when you're in front of them.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.960
And it endears
you a bit to them.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.910
You build this
personal relationship.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.520
Also on the other spectrum
of that, employees

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.950
who like to travel
or who travel a lot

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.929
and have found ways
through these tips

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.840
that we're going to
walk through to make

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.270
it a little bit of a leisure
and enjoyable experience

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.450
at the same time, you will
stick with your company longer.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.700
So that's great for
the company as well.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.170
It increases productivity.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.850
When you have
face-to-face meetings

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.700
and you're able to
sit-in front of somebody

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.550
and talk through problems,
talk through solutions,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.580
it increases the
project productivity.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.790
I'm sure all of you, maybe
today, maybe tomorrow,

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.380
will be on a
conference call, right?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.620
So we thought, oh, when
conferencing gets big,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.000
when video
conferencing gets big,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.860
we're not going to need that
face-to-face meeting anymore.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.610
And actually, that
hasn't proved to be true.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.350
We are more productive
when we have

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.609
our person-to-person,
face-to meetings.

00:09:16.609 --> 00:09:18.150
So when you're on
a conference call--

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.710
I'm sure many of
you have done it--

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.070
the statistics are that 60%
of people on a conference call

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.840
are also doing something
else at the same time.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.350
So they're not really paying
attention to what's going on.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.995
And some of that's
because maybe you're

00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:31.620
on this big call with
all these people.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.330
And you're not needed
at that moment.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.620
So you're checking your email.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.500
You're figuring out what your
dinner plans are going to be,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.680
whatever it is.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.680
And other statistics that have
come out around the conference

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.970
call, right?

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.610
And I will tell you
right now, I have never

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.894
been one of these
people, that over 50%

00:09:49.894 --> 00:09:51.810
have admitted that while
on a conference call,

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.440
they've been in the bathroom.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.950
So I'm hoping that they
were on mute, right?

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.520
Because nobody
wants to hear that.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.490
[LAUGHS] But these
are the things

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.400
that when you have face-to-face
meetings, they don't happen.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.040
You don't get distracted.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.130
Getting up, moving, getting out
of your typical environment,

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.100
whether it's a
cubicle or an office,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.440
promotes out-of-the-box
thinking and creativity.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.240
It puts you in real
life situations

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.130
where you're taught
to think on your feet.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.780
And you're taught
to be flexible.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.780
So these are all
things that companies,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.060
in terms of why they want
you to business travel,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.130
makes it productive
and beneficial

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.950
for them as well
as for yourself.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.590
The statistics around the
spending for business travel

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.270
are huge.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.790
The global business
travel spend in 2015

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.370
was $1.2 trillion dollars.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.750
And it's rising every year.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.460
And it's also
something that actually

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.400
rises during a recession
because companies

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.860
have found that back to
these first three things

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.920
that we talked about,
relationships and retention,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.700
productivity and creativity,
are things that keep clients

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.810
around longer.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.550
So even in a
downturn, people are

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.140
spending on business travel.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.490
And why is this?

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.730
Because of what is invested,
the return is very high.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.690
So every dollar that's
invested, that a company invests

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:12.060
in sending you on the road,
they see an increase of $9.50

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.850
in their revenue
and $2.90 in profit.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.940
So that's why you're getting
sent on the road all the time.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.610
So how is travel changing?

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.320
Business travel has completely
shifted in the last 10 years.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.470
32% of millennials who
are doing business travel

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.360
and have some control
over their schedule

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.330
themselves are booking
directly on their phone.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.790
They're researching and
booking on their phone, which

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.790
has created this great
world for all of the apps

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.090
and all the ways that
are coming out now

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.520
that support business travel.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.890
Nontraditional
booking platforms are

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.710
becoming more acceptable
in traditional companies.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.920
So the shared economy of
things like Airbnb, Lyft, Uber,

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.510
they're creating
business divisions that

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.610
are partnering with
corporations and allowing

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.530
you to stay like this.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.750
What's really interesting
in terms of accommodations

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.180
and in terms of blurring
this line between business

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:11.130
and leisure, for 56%
of people who book

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.970
on an Airbnb-type platform
for your accommodations

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.420
on average book five-night
trips, whereas when

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.250
you're solely looking
at hotels, you're

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.900
booking three-night trips.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.470
So you can see, when it comes
to this idea of figuring out

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.840
how business travel
is working for you,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.690
this is something interesting
that comes into play as

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.550
far as that's concerned.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.530
Everything is ending
up on social media.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.800
This is a huge change that's
really exploded in the last two

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.760
or three years.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.950
And you can find this
stuff on any platform.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.330
It's not specific
to one or the other.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.720
So here's the thing about
business travel and people

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.450
posting about it
on social media.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.340
They post the good.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.740
They post the bad,
which we all know.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.450
But companies are also
interacting with their clients

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.150
when it comes to social media.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.220
And it's really become
an acceptable way

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.500
to get real time feedback.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.910
So I can give you an example.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.240
A few years ago, my husband
and I were in Columbia.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.680
And I was there on business.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.040
And we came at different times.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.130
And so we had
separate flights out.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.750
He was booked on
a JetBlue flight.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.280
And there was only one flight
a day and three flights a week

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.860
that were departing where
we were in Columbia.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.530
And he missed his flight
for whatever reason, right?

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.970
So there is nothing he could do.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.490
He couldn't get on another
flight with JetBlue.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.600
He had to figure
stuff out himself.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.580
But what he did
immediately was he tweeted

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.310
JetBlue about his problem.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:36.720
And they responded right away,
apologizing and giving him

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.570
a travel credit for everything
that he went through.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.020
So this goes back to, how is the
industry changing both the way

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.120
that we use it and the
way that the companies are

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.490
interacting with their clients?

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.280
The biggest change
in the last few years

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.370
when it comes to business
travel deals with perception.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.640
And this perception is
both how the employer

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.860
views business travel
and the employee as well.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.970
So businesses see people who are
willing to travel for business

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.130
as more valuable employees.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.910
And that goes back to that
productivity, creativity idea

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.950
that we were talking about.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.460
It sparks new ideas.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.710
It sparks partnerships.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.710
It sparks more loyalty when
you're working face-to-face

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.300
with other people.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.920
What's really
interesting this day

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.970
and age when it
comes to travel, 30%

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.190
of people who are
interviewing for new jobs

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.350
have said that they are
willing to take a pay

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.130
cut or a lateral move if it
means they're able to travel

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.170
for business more.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.760
So think about that, right?

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.730
It is becoming more acceptable
to be out of the office.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.510
It's becoming more acceptable
to work in different ways.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.480
And employers are
recognizing these benefits

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.280
and figuring out
how they can tie

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.000
that back to their companies
being more profitable.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.370
So now that you know that
it's time to travel, right--

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.900
we know what the benefits
are for the companies.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.920
And we know what the
detriments are to ourselves.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.660
How do we change
those detriments

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.480
into positives for
ourselves when we travel?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.060
How do we counteract
those physical, mental,

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.660
and emotional tolls
that are created

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.730
and so that we can function
optimally when we're traveling?

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.430
So what you need to do
is you need to create

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.470
some tools for yourself.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.370
So what I want to do here
today, a little experiment

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.106
to see how it works for you.

00:15:28.106 --> 00:15:29.730
We're going to do a
breathing exercise.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.771
So I want you to take
anything that's on your lap

00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:33.480
and shift it off.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.790
I want you to scoot
forward in your chair

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.190
so that you can feel
your feet on the ground.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.270
I want you to sit up straight,
rest your hands in your lap

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.910
so you feel comfortable.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.854
And then I want you to trust me.

00:15:49.854 --> 00:15:51.270
And I want you to
close your eyes.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:00.150
So take a second here just
to check in with yourself,

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.170
to take a pause.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.240
And I want you to breathe
in, take a deep breath in.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.760
And I want you to release
it out your mouth.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.280
So breathe in and
release your breath.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.810
[DEEP BREATH] Breathe
in through your nose

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.738
and release it out
through your mouth.

00:16:18.738 --> 00:16:20.080
[DEEP BREATH]

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.130
So now that you're centered
and you're feeling yourself

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.950
in the room right
now, I want you

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.980
to repeat in your
mind on your in-breath

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:34.540
the words I am and on
your out-breath, here.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.280
So breathe in, I am.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.680
Breathe out, here.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.360
Breathe in, I am.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.425
Breathe out, here.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.830
So do it a few more
times on your own.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.660
And now open your eyes.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:11.470
So hopefully that few seconds
of breathing that I just

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.720
taught you is the
first tool that you

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.839
can sort of put in your
business travel tool box.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.770
So what just happened?

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.790
We removed some of your
external stimulation.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.730
By closing your eyes and
by being in this room

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.040
where it's quiet, we
took away the visual

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.040
and the audiosensory
loads that we all

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.290
have these days, where
we're technically

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.660
overloaded on all that.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:39.640
Being able to take way outside
input and outside sensory,

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.980
it allows us to shift our
subconscious thinking.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.260
It brings us into
the here and now.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.090
By focusing your
mind on your breath,

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.419
by focusing your mind on
that I am here statement,

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:51.460
you're bringing yourself
into the present moment.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.751
You're not thinking about
something that just happened.

00:17:53.751 --> 00:17:56.290
You're not thinking about
what's coming up this afternoon.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.180
You're making yourself present.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.540
And all of this helps trigger
a relaxation response.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.790
So the idea by removing this
sensory input, by going inside,

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.620
even if it's just
for a breath or two

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.770
and focusing on yourself,
you're restricting

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.500
the flow of cortisol, which
is our stress hormone.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.820
And it's constantly producing.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.070
So if we can find a way to
reshift, not only our thinking,

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.670
but reshift the way the
chemistry is in our brain,

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.400
and we're taking ourselves
out of that survival mode,

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.100
out of that fight or flight
mode and into the present,

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.560
we can learn to relax.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.320
So some people may have
felt anxiety or discomfort

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.000
while we did that,
which is totally fine.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.450
This is how I felt the
first time I did it, too.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.280
I couldn't focus.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.552
My mind was everywhere.

00:18:43.552 --> 00:18:45.760
This was something that was
totally new and different

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.260
to me.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.010
And I was like, how
am I supposed to relax

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.330
when I'm doing this, right?

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.950
It takes practice.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.860
And that is just, you have
to put something into it

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.480
to get something
great out of it.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.240
And the reason this is, is
because what we just did

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.010
affects the prefrontal
cortex of our brain.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.250
We have all these
neurotransmitters in there.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.590
And they start
firing on high speed

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.690
when we're doing something
new and different and

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.280
uncomfortable.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.280
And immediately, our brain
says to us, warning, danger.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:12.930
Don't do that.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.120
Don't go there.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.060
So it takes some time for
us to retrain ourselves.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.810
It takes some time
for us to stabilize

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.520
these neurotransmitters
in our brain

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.230
and create these
new pathways that

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.000
will lead us to relaxation.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.450
So what's great about that
exercise, that first tool

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.920
that you now have
in your toolbox,

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.129
you can do it anywhere.

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:32.920
You can do it when
you're stuck in traffic.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.860
You can do it when you're in an
Uber on the way to the airport.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.930
You can do it when you're
sitting at the airport

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.414
and your flight was delayed.

00:19:39.414 --> 00:19:41.080
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.540
You can do it when you get
on the airplane, right?

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.360
So this is the first thing that
you can do to set yourself up

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.930
to have a positive
experience, to set yourself up

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.670
to change the
narrative and change

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.220
the story that you tell
yourself, that business

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.550
travel is stressful.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.950
So let's flip it around.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.820
Let's reorder the way
that our brain is firing.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.860
And let's say to ourselves,
we can start this

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.200
from a relaxed and
positive place.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.300
So let's get to some
practicalities here.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.040
What are you packing
when it comes

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.392
time for your business trip?

00:20:10.392 --> 00:20:12.100
I have some props in
the back of the room

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.500
that you can take a
look at on your way out.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.550
I prepack.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:20.590
I have a section of stuff in my
house in a drawer in my closet

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.390
that has all the
things that I know

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.570
through developing my travel
routine that are prepacked.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.120
And it's one less thing I
have to stress and worry

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.000
about when it comes time to
get ready for a business trip.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.520
For me, I focus
on five areas that

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.070
are going to affect my health
and wellness when I travel--

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.420
how I sleep, how I eat, how
I move, how to stay healthy,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.310
and how am I going to work?

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.800
And so there's easy things that
don't take up a lot of room

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.350
that you can keep prepacked,
even in your suitcase

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.850
if you want.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.080
So then you don't even have to
remember what drawer you put it

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.560
in, right?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.268
We want to take all
these choices and all

00:20:52.268 --> 00:20:54.970
of these decisions away and
make it easy for ourselves.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.500
We want to set ourselves up.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.850
We want to take out that stress
and make it into success,

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.520
so traveling with things
like earplugs or eye masks

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.710
for the plane.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.480
I pack nutrient-rich snacks.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.820
I have-- whether it's
almond butter or something

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.330
like this that is going to
keep me healthy and happy.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.220
And that way, if
I get somewhere--

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.242
we were just talking
before I came up on stage

00:21:18.242 --> 00:21:19.450
about how you land somewhere.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.100
And it's too late
to have dinner.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.900
And you end up
reaching for crap.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.360
Well, when you have stuff
packed with you that you know

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.700
is healthy and good
for you, then great.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.290
There is no decision there.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.210
You've cut all of that out.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.120
When it comes to movement, if
you can pack workout clothes.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.430
If that's too much for
you, take a jump rope.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.860
Take one of those
Thera-bands that you've seen.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.950
You can use props that
don't take up a lot of room

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.240
to keep yourself moving.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.640
And even if it's for 10
minutes, right, you can move.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.440
Get up and move on the plane.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.700
Or you can use these props when
you get to your hotel room.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.659
Staying healthy is a big one.

00:21:53.659 --> 00:21:55.450
When we're changing
all these environments,

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.600
we're meeting all
these new people,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.183
we're shaking hands,
things like that,

00:21:58.183 --> 00:21:59.710
aside from washing
your hands, what

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.770
can you do to stay
healthy when you travel?

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.900
Drink a lot of water, more water
than you would normally drink.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.330
I would say reach for
that as the first thing.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.910
Things like coffee and
alcohol dehydrate you.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.000
So if you're going to be heavy
on the coffee and the alcohol,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.160
think about that
and purposely drink

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.460
more water to counteract
those effects as well.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.520
I travel with these
amazing wipes that

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.960
are these essential oil wipes.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.700
They smell like
lavender, which is great.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.320
Because they smell good.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.300
And lavender is relaxing.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.130
And it also has
anti-bacterial properties.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.680
So the first thing
I do when I get

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.150
onto a plane or
the first thing I

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.090
do when I get into a hotel room
is I break open those wipes.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.670
And I wipe everything
down to make sure

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.440
that I am cleaning
it for whatever

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.150
was there before me, right?

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.700
There is a woman that I saw
on the plane coming here,

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.770
out to LA actually,
who had this awesome--

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.770
I hadn't seen it before.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.350
It was sort of like a
fitted bedsheet that

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.310
was made for her plane seat.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.499
So she pulled that whole thing
out and just covered it up.

00:23:00.499 --> 00:23:02.040
So there's things
that are coming out

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.010
into the marketplace that
make it easy for you.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.730
So you keep these things packed.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:10.140
When it comes to work,
chargers, adapters, USB cords,

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.450
business cards, these are
things that we probably

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.770
have two or three of, right?

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.920
So take a pile of that and
put it in your suitcase.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.720
Put it in your pre-travel pack.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.120
And you take out that stress
as far as that's concerned.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.990
What about your
pre-travel routine?

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.240
So this is something that's
going to take you a little

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.100
while to cultivate
and develop because it

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.470
is going to be specific to
what you like and how you live.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.420
It took me a long time
to cultivate my routine.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.190
It's a 24-hour
routine of self-care.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.060
And I extend it.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.030
I extend it to 48 hours if
I'm going away for a long time

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.100
or if I'm going really far.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.310
And for me, this is what
has set me up for success.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:55.720
This-- by sticking to this
routine, if you land and you

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.720
have meetings or if you
land and you immediately

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.150
have to go to a business
dinner or a conference

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.130
or whatever it is,
you already know

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.336
that you're starting off from
a place of health and wellness.

00:24:05.336 --> 00:24:06.960
So what this means
for me-- oftentimes,

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.850
I'll take red-eye flights.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.930
So my 24-hour self-care
routine starts by the way

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.180
that I sleep the
night before I leave.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.940
So for me, that's seven to
eight hours of quality sleep.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.640
And the first thing that I do
when I wake up the next morning

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.635
is work out.

00:24:21.635 --> 00:24:24.960
And that workout can be anything
that is good for you, anything

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.460
that you like to do.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.180
I try all these different crazy
workout routines to experiment

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.740
and see what I like.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.430
This is one of my favorites,
doing some aerial work here.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.910
Hanging upside down gets
all of your lymphatic system

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.110
moving, your organs moving.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.550
So it doesn't have to be a
traditional workout routine.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.229
Get yourself moving.

00:24:44.229 --> 00:24:46.020
Because you know you're
setting yourself up

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.660
to be on a plane
for a little while.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.870
You can move through
this whole routine

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.090
and use this as a
guideline for yourself.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:55.230
I drink my veggies.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.080
I want to make sure I'm getting
all the vitamins and minerals

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.430
and nutrients that I need.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.420
And I'm not sure what I'm
going to eat when I land.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.620
So I sort of
pre-game it that way,

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.320
right, making sure I get
all the things that I need.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.650
I move throughout the day.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:12.300
So I'll have walking meetings
if I'm meeting people somewhere.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.760
I will get up and I
will walk and get lunch

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.920
instead of eating it at my desk.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.360
I will consume extra water.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.536
I always have a portable water
bottle with me wherever I go.

00:25:22.536 --> 00:25:23.910
You can fill it
up in the airport

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.160
as well before you even get
on the plane, which is great.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.060
I have what I call a
nutrient-rich last meal.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.770
So I don't eat on the plane.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:32.760
I fast on the plane.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.635
And I'm going to talk
about that in a second.

00:25:34.635 --> 00:25:37.260
So in order to set
myself up to do that,

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.510
I need to make sure that
that last meal that I'm

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.830
eating before I fly for 16
hours, let's say to Asia,

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:48.561
is something like salmon and
quinoa or farro with spinach.

00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:50.810
So I want to make sure I'm
getting these healthy fats.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:54.240
I. Want to make sure that I'm
getting something with protein,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.360
again, something that's nutrient
rich that will keep me full

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.360
and keep me healthy
before I get on the plane

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.510
so I'm not tempted to reach for
M&amp;M's or something like this.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.560
I pack snacks, which
we talked about,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.800
which are great for if you
get hungry on the plane

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.170
or when you land if it's
something that you need.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.060
And then I also
plan my plane time.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.150
A lot of people, you'll say,
like, oh, I hate flying.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.210
Because it's this dead
time for me, right?

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.950
Flip that story in your mind.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.070
What can you do with
those hours of travel?

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.040
For me, I love to not be online.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.870
I know you can pay
for Wi-Fi these days.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.280
But I'm like, forget it.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.860
I'm connected all
the rest of my life.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.170
The time on the plane is
for me to do things my way.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.404
So whether that for me
is writing in my journal,

00:26:40.404 --> 00:26:41.820
whether it's
watching a movie I've

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.320
been wanting to
see, whether it's

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.450
trying to get some extra
sleep, whatever it is.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:46.740
It could be work.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.260
That's fine.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.060
But plan your time so you
can use it effectively.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.720
And again, it's all
about setting yourself up

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.170
for success.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.320
So how are you
healthy on the go?

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.190
We've talked about what you
need to have packed and waiting.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.050
We talked about your
pre-travel routine

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.850
that you need to
set up for yourself

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.074
that's going to work for you.

00:27:07.074 --> 00:27:09.240
So now that you're ready,
now that you're in the air

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.790
and on your way, how
do you stay healthy?

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.530
So technology--
you gotta love it.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.990
Because people are coming up
with all these amazing ways

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.930
to stay happy and
healthy when you travel.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.840
These are three categories
that I look at a lot

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.450
when it comes to the
technology that I have

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.760
on my phones and my tablets.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.430
So food, hotel, and
wellness are big areas.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.220
There are some great
food apps out there,

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.580
one called Grab So if you
do a lot of domestic travel,

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.920
download this to your phone.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.340
And what it is, is it
gives you, in major cities

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.400
around the world,
their airport menu

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.131
layout for all of
the restaurants

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:47.130
that are in the airport.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.294
So you can search through.

00:27:48.294 --> 00:27:50.460
You already know what's
going to be in the terminal.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.090
You already know where it is.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:56.250
Bonus, you can
pre-order your food.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.600
So this way, there's
no waiting in line.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.980
There's no wasting time figuring
it out, where you want to eat,

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.020
what you want to
eat, is it healthy?

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.300
So it's a great app
that does that for you.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.040
Happy Cow, if you've
ever heard of it,

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.610
is a vegan vegetarian app
that's actually worldwide

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.100
and recommends restaurants
around the world.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.730
Hotel apps, Dayuse is
one of my favorites.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:21.390
So there is this trend that
started a few years ago where

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.570
hotels realized, look, we
had these empty rooms, right?

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.790
Even if we're 90%
occupancy, which

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.410
is a great number
for a hotel, there

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.290
are still a number of rooms
at each hotel every day

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.550
that go unused.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.400
They've decided to target
to the business traveler.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.630
So this Dayuse app lets you rent
a hotel room for a few hours,

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:41.640
which is awesome.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.440
Because what can
happen is, let's say

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.240
you're in town for a day.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.200
And you arrive early.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.210
But you don't have a
meeting till late at night.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:52.680
You can pay for-- find a great
hotel for a few hours using

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.700
this app.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.930
And you can shower.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.250
You can have a nap.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.110
What's even better,
you get access

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.060
to the amenities of the hotel.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.550
So the first thing I do
is head to the steam room

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.990
or the sauna, right?

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.370
That is a treat.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:09.027
And that is something that is
going to reset and refresh you,

00:29:09.027 --> 00:29:10.610
especially after
being on an airplane.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.540
And it's a good
use of your time,

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.000
where you're not necessarily
sitting in an airport lounge.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.840
So check that out.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.750
That's a great piece
of travel technology.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.520
And of course, there's
new wellness apps

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.520
that come out every day.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.339
Headspace, if you've heard
of it, it's a meditation app.

00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:26.880
Headspace is actually partnered
with some airlines out there.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.790
So you can have this
access to this app in plane

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.960
as well on the screen
in front of you.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.140
And Train is a great
sleep cycle app

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.900
that was developed with
the University of Michigan.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.670
And it helps you sort
of retrain yourself

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.180
when you're trying
to get over jet lag.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.160
And so on the plane,
this is the big thing.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.284
So you have all these apps.

00:29:45.284 --> 00:29:46.920
You have these
ways to set you up.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.045
You're ready when you land.

00:29:48.045 --> 00:29:50.040
But on the plane
itself, especially when

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.426
you're on the plane
for this long time,

00:29:52.426 --> 00:29:54.300
how do you optimize your
health and wellness?

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.780
The first thing is really easy.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.380
You just want to smile
at everybody when you're

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.270
going through the airport.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.120
We talked about how
detrimental travel can be.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.281
And most travelers out there
are operating from that space,

00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:06.780
right?

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.990
So it takes a simple smile
to make somebody's day.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:14.940
It also endears you to the
staff of the airplane, right?

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.610
You're angling for that upgrade.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:21.210
You're angling for whatever
it is, that extra blanket.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.510
Smile at everybody.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.730
There's no harm in it.

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:27.810
It only sets you up to
be in a happy place.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.140
We talked about wiping it
down, the wipes or the seat

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.870
cover that will
keep you healthy.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.190
This is the big one--

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:39.420
skipping the food and beverage
that's offered on the plane.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.640
And I know some
people, like, OK,

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.070
the food in business class
and first class is the best.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.420
Why would I skip that?

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.480
I have to tell you that both
Gordon Ramsay and Anthony

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.510
Bourdain have sworn that they
will never, ever, ever eat

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.770
airplane food.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.600
So that should
tell you something.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.570
They understand the food
process, number one.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.180
So they know what that
whole back end looks like.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.980
And they won't touch it.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.830
In general, what happens
scientifically when we travel,

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:08.880
the airplane pressure in the
cabin plays with our taste buds

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.170
and with our texture.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.570
And so to counteract
that, the airlines

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.940
have had to develop food
products that taste good.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.080
So how did they do that?

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.970
They pick high
calorie, high fat,

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:24.900
high sugar items that will
counteract the dampening

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.340
of our taste and our texture.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.360
So the bottom line is,
whatever kind of food

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.940
that they're feeding
you, it's not healthy.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.590
So it's healthier to not eat.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.560
Or it's healthier to bring
your own snacks on the plane.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.380
When it comes to beverages, we
talked about alcohol and coffee

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.030
and how they dehydrate you.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.480
Your atmosphere in that plane,
in that air cabin pressure,

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.410
dehydrates you.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.970
So you're just
adding to the mix.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.710
You're compounding
that dehydration

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.407
when you drink alcohol
and coffee on the plane.

00:31:52.407 --> 00:31:54.240
The other thing that I
should warn you about

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.020
is they don't wash those
coffee pots very often.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.610
So think about
that the next time

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.770
that you want to have
coffee on the plane.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.000
Maybe that will deter you.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.190
And you'd rather wait till
you land and pick it up

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.930
with your Grab app instead so
it's waiting there for you.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.110
And then return to that
breath exercise we just did.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.820
Return to that I am here.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.070
You can just
breathe if you want.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.950
But use this as a
time to kind of tune

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:23.360
out everything around you
and tune into yourself.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.370
The number one
travel hack that I

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.850
can recommend if you don't have
it already is Global Entry.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.330
Does everybody here
have Global Entry?

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.830
Yes.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.190
No.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.680
Yeah.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.010
No.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.250
OK.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:35.041
You want to get it.

00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:38.480
It's $100, the best
$100 I've ever spent.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.007
And what it does is it
gives you TSA pre-check

00:32:41.007 --> 00:32:42.590
so you don't have
to wait in line when

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:43.280
you get to the airport.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.863
You don't have to
take your shoes off.

00:32:44.863 --> 00:32:47.060
You don't have to
take your laptop out.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.980
You get through the
line really quickly.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.650
And then on the back end
from international travel,

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:55.790
when you come home,
I have timed my entry

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.770
into the country from
the moment I step off

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:01.820
the plane to the moment that
I am at the curb outside is

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.590
eight minutes on average.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.200
Granted, I only take
a carry-on, right?

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.400
But eight minutes, right--

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.234
I have just skipped a
whole lot of stress.

00:33:10.234 --> 00:33:11.900
So whether I'm coming
back from business

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.566
and I want to go home
and get some sleep

00:33:13.566 --> 00:33:15.370
or whether I'm coming
back from vacation,

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:18.710
you hold on to that
more zen vibe, right,

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.320
when you're not immediately
assaulted with these things.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.350
So Global Entry,
highly recommend it

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.592
if you don't have it already.

00:33:25.592 --> 00:33:27.800
So all of these things that
we've been talking about,

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.300
all of these tools, we're
using to increase our success.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.130
We're taking those
detriments we talked

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:38.002
about in the beginning, those
lugging around suitcases, those

00:33:38.002 --> 00:33:40.460
worrying about your flight,
worrying about what you packed,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.590
worrying if jet lag is
going to affect you.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.920
And we're finding new
ways to allow ourselves

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:51.080
to optimally function, to
enjoy this travel experience

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.750
a little bit more by putting
a little effort into it

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.650
at the time.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.150
You'll find more tips
on this in the book.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.630
But you have to really
dive into and find out

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.970
for yourself sort of what
the pressure points are

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.890
and what makes you
not enjoy travel

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:07.130
or what makes it hard to travel
and change that narrative.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.199
Change the way that you
think about those things

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.639
that you do for yourself.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.790
So now you're ready to
rock your trip, right?

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:14.710
You're all set up.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.280
You have a great
pre-travel routine.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.469
You've figured out how to
stay healthy on the plane.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.270
So how do you make
the most of your trip?

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.120
Because you know when you
leave, some of your time

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.350
is going to be spent on work.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.530
Some of it will be
personal time, especially,

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.409
again we're extending our
stays to add personal time

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.042
into our vacations in some way.

00:34:32.042 --> 00:34:34.250
So how do you take advantage
of all your surroundings

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:35.480
when you're doing this?

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.239
When it comes to work, these
are the three main things

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:40.550
that eat up our time when
we're business traveling.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.400
We're in these face-to-face
meetings which we talked about

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.790
because of that retention and
creativity that it sparks.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.380
We're dealing with our email.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.630
And we're in events, so
whether that's conferences,

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.969
whether that's team
dinners, whatever it is.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.699
So how do we change how
we approach these meetings

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:57.920
so that it works for everybody?

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.640
One idea is just to get out of
the office setting if you can.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.410
So I don't know if
you've heard of this,

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.120
but there is this
phenomenon that's

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.660
been sweeping some companies
called sweat sessions.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.190
Has anyone ever had a sweat
session with their client?

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.440
Do you even know what that is?

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.570
It's taking your meeting
out of the office

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.460
and taking it into a
healthy environment.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.340
So meet your client--

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.840
have you had this relationship
with your client for a while?

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.190
You know they love Pilates.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.600
You know they love spin class.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.610
You know they love to--

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.070
they have a favorite
healthy breakfast spot.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.510
Change your meeting there.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.080
Change your meeting to
a different environment.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.640
And you'll notice how,
again, it will bond you

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.870
to your client a little more.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.920
You've got more to talk about,
more outside of the office.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.980
And it sparks that
creative thinking as well.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.770
When it comes to email, if
you have the opportunity where

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.340
you are when you travel
more of a digital nomad,

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.860
set yourself up
for the opportunity

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.130
to focus on email
at segmented times.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:56.729
So what I can do,
especially here in LA,

00:35:56.729 --> 00:35:58.520
right, we don't have
the beach in New York.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.030
That's where I want to be.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.480
So I will set aside an hour,
let's say in the morning

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.440
or in the afternoon.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.430
I will go to the beach.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.160
I will take whatever
device I need.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.570
And that will be my email time.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.400
And I can get
everything banged out

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.680
in that hour in an
awesome environment.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.930
I see something more than the
four walls of my hotel room,

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.360
which can really be a drag.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.910
And it grounds me to
the space where I am.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:20.720
And it changes.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.620
It makes me happier.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.840
It makes me happier to
get out of the indoors.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.260
We spend 80% of our time inside.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.080
So if we can do a few
things to shift that and get

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.260
us outdoors more or get us into
a different environment more,

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.760
then go for it.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.520
When it comes to events
and entertaining,

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.950
see if there's a way that
you can sort of control

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.330
some of this.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.540
I can tell you that
in the last few years

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.260
of my job in the
fashion industry,

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.880
I would probably spend
five times a year in Vegas.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.270
And when we were there, we were
required to entertain clients

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.772
every night.

00:36:53.772 --> 00:36:55.730
So we'd have this full
day of working, full day

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.620
of standing up on my feet.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.610
And then I was expected
to entertain at night,

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.070
which is totally fine.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.590
But what I said to my boss
at one point is like, look.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:06.060
If I'm required to do this,
then I want to plan it.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.060
I want to be in charge of
how this goes down, right?

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.860
So luckily, there's
great options

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.840
in Vegas and in most
places in the world

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.030
if you do a little
bit of research.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:18.300
I was able to find restaurants
that had healthier foods.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.070
I was able to find
restaurants that really

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.720
cared about their ingredient.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.030
And it offered me
something as well as

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.440
it offered the client something.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.720
So you can have that
control over it.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.472
If you're in a conference,
talk to the conference planner

00:37:30.472 --> 00:37:31.430
and say, you know what?

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.660
I know you usually
serve lunch meats.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.090
But maybe we can get
something different this time.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.517
Maybe we can get something
healthy this time.

00:37:38.517 --> 00:37:40.350
You are very lucky that
the company that you

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.960
work at right now has
been a leader in this

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.010
and really cares about the
employees and their health.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.760
And so they go out of
their way to provide

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.676
some of these options.

00:37:48.676 --> 00:37:51.520
But that's not always the case.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.949
So we're working when
we're business traveling.

00:37:55.949 --> 00:37:57.240
But we also have personal time.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.314
We also have downtime.

00:37:58.314 --> 00:38:00.480
So that's something that
is really important for you

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.087
to remember.

00:38:01.087 --> 00:38:02.670
Just because you're
on a business trip

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.430
doesn't mean that
company owns you 24/7.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.940
You have to find a way to,
just like you would at home,

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.640
disconnect and do something
for yourself every day.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.450
So it's up to you.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.270
Figure out where you can control
your areas of your business

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.770
trip.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:17.700
Is it your schedule?

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.400
Are you able to push
meetings later in the day?

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.690
Is that when you work best?

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:25.170
Does that give you time to
use one of these hotel rooms

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.730
for a few hours and refresh?

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.440
Are you able to
control your food

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.540
or your fitness or your sleep?

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.590
Or how you recover--

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:35.190
are you able to plan on both
ends to extend your trip

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:38.340
so you make it more
interesting for yourself,

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.540
you make it more of
a discovery option.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.390
And then your
environment, right?

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:49.250
We talked about seeing the
four walls of your hotel room.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.630
I have to tell you, I
have a pretty good job.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:53.070
This is what my
environment tends

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.150
to look like when I travel.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:58.590
If anyone wants to join
me, I would love it.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.040
But because of this, I am able
to choose how I set myself up

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.510
when it comes to working, right?

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.260
So that first picture, whether
it's outside of a pool in Bali

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.630
where I'm overlooking
the ocean, I

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.180
can sit there for the
afternoon and do my email.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.390
I can book a room that
has my own private pool,

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:19.290
like this place in India
where I am able to, again,

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:23.280
at the end of every day, take
five minutes to be in nature,

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.440
to be by myself in nature.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.550
Or in this other
option here, doing

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:33.300
yoga first thing every
morning when I was in Vietnam.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.090
It's a good way for
me to start my day.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.650
And there's hotels
out there that are

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.300
offering all of these options.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.980
Same with healthy food, right--

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.830
there are so many choices these
days if you know where to look.

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:46.170
It does take a little
bit of research.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.060
But once you find the
places that you like,

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.880
especially if these are areas
that you travel all the time,

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.560
these are great resources
for you to just have.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.140
I started this
conversation telling you

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.730
that I was in a
hotel room in Italy,

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.140
and I had no idea where I was.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.931
Well, what's the first
thing that I started

00:40:02.931 --> 00:40:05.040
doing for the next few
days after that trip,

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.650
is I would get up a
half an hour earlier.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.170
And I would completely
ignore the breakfast that

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.480
was at my hotel with my team.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.342
And I would go out.

00:40:13.342 --> 00:40:14.550
And I would walk the streets.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.133
And I would find a
local place to have

00:40:16.133 --> 00:40:17.790
my cappuccino in the morning.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:20.490
Because that set
me up, like, OK.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:21.090
I'm here.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:21.750
I'm in Italy.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.640
I feel like I'm participating.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.340
And it made me happy, right?

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.330
And that's the key.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.850
You're going to work better.

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.540
And you're going to work
smarter when you set yourself

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.980
up in ways that work
for you and your body.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.290
So we've gone through
the whole trip.

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.990
And it's time to come home.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.600
What is it about business
travel or travel?

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.180
How can you create
these routines?

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.820
How can you live
well on the road

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.980
so that you can work smarter
and yield better results for you

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.380
in your personal life
and for the business

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.820
that you're taking care of?

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.620
So it's important
that you create

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.090
these pre-travel routines.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.300
It's important that you
work them and stick to them.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.562
They're going to change
throughout your time

00:41:01.562 --> 00:41:02.520
that you're using them.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.212
And that's OK.

00:41:04.212 --> 00:41:05.670
And what you need
to do is once you

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:09.330
find things that work for you,
you need to condition yourself.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.180
And you need to condition those
around you for your return.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.790
So what does that mean exactly?

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.320
Do you know, like, OK.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.850
I'm going to take a red eye.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.580
And maybe your company
offers comp time.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.960
So you worked on a weekend.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.171
You're taking a red eye.

00:41:23.171 --> 00:41:24.420
You're landing Monday morning.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.550
Are you expected to be
in the office right away?

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:30.210
If not, see if you can give
yourself a day to recover.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.160
Or if you are expected
to be in the office,

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.960
maybe you can plan
your week out.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.360
And you push all your
meetings till Wednesday.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.350
So you give yourself
time to recover.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.200
You give yourself
a little break.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.699
And it sets others up for
how they interact with you.

00:41:43.699 --> 00:41:45.990
What I love to do and I've
learned throughout the years

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:48.540
is my out-of-office
notification.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.020
So what I do is I place my
out-of-office notification

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:55.830
to go live a day before I leave
and not to end until a day

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:57.180
after I come home.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.130
And what's nice about
that is, again, it's

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:02.340
setting up others that I
might not be available.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.530
Of course, I have the
option to turn it off early

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:05.640
or go back to work early.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.160
But What this does is
it creates boundaries.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.940
And it creates expectations
for those around you

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.990
and sort of trains them on what
you found to work for you when

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.820
it comes to business travel.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.680
So thank you guys.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.960
It was a pleasure to be here.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.668
And I hope you learned
a little something

00:42:22.668 --> 00:42:25.440
that you can take with
you on your next trip.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.930
I'm thrilled that you're going
to get a copy of the book.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.360
And I hope that you can find
more tips and tricks in there

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.430
that will help you travel.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.680
And I mentioned to you,
I do run Pravassa, which

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.495
is a wellness travel company.

00:42:36.495 --> 00:42:39.120
And I'm thrilled to say that we
are actually part of the Google

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.470
Perks program.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.300
So if there is
ever an opportunity

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.990
that you guys want to take
a vacation, whether a group

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.510
setting or private
setting, because we're

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.320
part of the Google
Perks program,

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.810
there are some added
discounts in there as well.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.590
So hopefully I can see
you guys on the road.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:57.600
We do have a little
set-up for Q&amp;A

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.910
if anyone has any questions
that they want to ask.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.350
I'm happy to answer them.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.300
If not, that's OK.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.470
Any questions?

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.625
No, OK, cool.

00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:07.500
All right, thank you.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.820
I really appreciate it.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.260
It was lovely to be here.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:13.310
[APPLAUSE]
