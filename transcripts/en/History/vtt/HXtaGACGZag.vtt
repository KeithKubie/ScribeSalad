00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:03.670
DANNY KOKER: Man, when we got in

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.004
I love this car.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.548
And frankly, I really
wanted to keep it.

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:07.549
So can I have it?

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:08.883
But it's not mine, man.

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:10.343
It belongs to a cat
named Mark, brought

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.220
it in for a simple paint job.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.598
Well, simple is just something
we don't do very well here.

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.892
So I got with Ryan
and figured out a way

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.520
to add a little bit of
that Count's Kustoms flavor

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.272
to this gorgeous Chevy.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:25.358
Ryan did some amazing
pinstripe into this Chevy

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:28.778
that I'm really hoping is just
going to blow Mark's mind away.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.321
After you, Mark.
Thank you.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.948
DANNY KOKER: Now, on the
other hand, if he hates it,

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:35.285
I suppose I'll just be
forced to add a beautiful '55

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.412
Nomad to my collection.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:40.415
When you brought this car
in, she was beautiful.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.208
And that's always scary.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.294
Taking apart a beautiful
car and redoing it,

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.920
which always makes me nervous.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.505
You ready, brother?
- I'm ready.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:48.214
Are you ready?

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.215
I am ready.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:49.883
DANNY KOKER: Rock and roll.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:50.550
Here we go.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.760
Ryan!

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.011
Come on, man.
Bring out my Nomad.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.095
I mean, Mark's Nomad.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.513
[laughter]

00:00:55.513 --> 00:01:03.605
[instrumental music playing]

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.065
I'm gettin' chills right now.
Wow.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:09.861
Wow.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.532
That's the sound.
I remember.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:15.158
[laughter]

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:17.202
Woo, let me catch my breath.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.912
Soak it up, brother.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.497
Ryan, I know you know Mark--
- Mark, good to see you again.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:21.790
- Mark, I know you know Ryan.
- Good to see you, man.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.916
MARK: Wow.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.794
Man, that is just amazing.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.670
DANNY KOKER: We took
this classic 1955

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.132
Chevy Nomad from pale purple
to beautiful brandywine.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:32.967
I didn't think she could look
much better than she did,

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.344
but, man, was I wrong.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.055
The Tri-Fives beg for
that two-tone look.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.807
Other than the
addition of disc brakes

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:41.392
and a beautiful polish and some
re-chrome under the brightwork,

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:42.769
she was good to go.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.562
Mark had a great
car to begin with,

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:47.065
but we kept with his wishes
of keeping it simple.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.691
But we couldn't help
ourselves, and added

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:51.277
some subtle pinstriping at
the front nose and louvers,

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:55.156
to bring this baby to an
all-new level of cool.

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:56.241
Looking good?

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.742
MARK: You hit it
out of the park.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.744
RYAN: Luckily, you had
that million dollar body.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:02.038
We expected, you know,
a vehicle like this

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.289
to have rust all over it.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.666
Very little rust.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.669
The biggest task on this
was your engine bay.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.420
The engine bay--
- Well--

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.964
RYAN: --when you brought it in--
- --that was my next question.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.799
It looked like it had been
rolled with black paint.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.092
It probably was.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.134
Oh, bro you're--

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:16.344
Not anymore.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.512
DANNY KOKER: Are
you ready for this?

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:19.472
You notice anything?
MARK: Ugh.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.807
DANNY KOKER: We took a chance.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.601
I know you said, I
don't want pinstripe.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.061
I don't want to do
anything like that.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.188
But it just needs a little.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.356
I like it.
[laughter]

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:29.399
RYAN: You like it?
- Very classy.

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:30.692
The pinstriping is good?

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:31.901
No, I like it.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.194
It's old school
hot-rod right there.

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:34.237
- We can keep it?
- We're keepin' it.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.613
I don't have to take it off.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:36.239
DANNY KOKER: You don't
have to take it off.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.907
[laughter]

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.159
While you're liking that,
take a look at all your louvers.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.788
Each louver also has that
same color in the pinstripe.

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:44.956
You can hardly even tell.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:45.790
That is so subtle.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.958
DANNY KOKER: Yeah.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.251
You get this thing
out in the sun

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.836
and you'll notice
every one of those.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.963
Man, that is just amazing.

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:52.922
DANNY KOKER: Check this out.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:54.299
RYAN: This is the best.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.259
DANNY KOKER: You're
gonna love this, man.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.511
Bam.
RYAN: Brandywine and chrome.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.429
DANNY KOKER: Holding hands.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.139
MARK: Wow.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.683
Now, while we were in here,
OK, we pulled the engine out.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.602
We pulled everything out.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.062
So that Ryan and
his team could get

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:09.856
in this beautiful engine bay.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.233
And then, you can
see your new grille.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.192
All of the brightwork.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.611
All of the chrome.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.655
All that everything has
been redone on her, man.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:18.865
You feel good about it?

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.658
MARK: I feel really
good about it.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.410
She's just beautiful.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.411
DANNY KOKER: I don't have one.

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.662
I've always wanted one.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:25.580
- Oh, here we go.
- I was--

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.290
[laughter]
- I know.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.792
If you ever get to that point
in your life and you just go,

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.712
you know, I think I'm just
going to let the Nomad go,

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.006
I hope, I hope, I'm your
first number you call.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.758
MARK: You have--
DANNY KOKER: I love this car.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.176
MARK: --first right of refusal.
DANNY KOKER: You're beautiful.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.886
You're beautiful.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.262
I'm really gonna miss this car,
to be honest with you, man.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.097
I loved having this
thing in the shop.

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:44.098
I think, frankly, I might
need to go Nomad shopping.
