00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.550
so I'm told and I'm reading it and I
turned it and I I would turn to page 14

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
turned it and I I would turn to page 14
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.990
turned it and I I would turn to page 14
and I can tell you it's page 14 because

and I can tell you it's page 14 because
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.029
and I can tell you it's page 14 because
I was so astounded by what I found and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
I was so astounded by what I found and
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.800
I was so astounded by what I found and
it said we that oh it says objectivity

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
it said we that oh it says objectivity
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.490
it said we that oh it says objectivity
as found through rational thought is a

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500
as found through rational thought is a
 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.890
as found through rational thought is a
Western and masculine concept that we

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
Western and masculine concept that we
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020
Western and masculine concept that we
will challenge throughout this text yeah

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
will challenge throughout this text yeah
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.959
will challenge throughout this text yeah
right yeah yeah and I said it's too bad

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
right yeah yeah and I said it's too bad
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.760
right yeah yeah and I said it's too bad
it's too bad that you're shocked by that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
it's too bad that you're shocked by that
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.590
it's too bad that you're shocked by that
because the PC types have been saying

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
because the PC types have been saying
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.080
because the PC types have been saying
exactly doubts since the 1970s like that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
exactly doubts since the 1970s like that
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.330
exactly doubts since the 1970s like that
is exactly make no mistake about this

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
is exactly make no mistake about this
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.310
is exactly make no mistake about this
this is why McClatchy is wrong this

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
this is why McClatchy is wrong this
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.869
this is why McClatchy is wrong this
isn't this isn't something they're

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
isn't this isn't something they're
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.139
isn't this isn't something they're
secret again this is the dead statement

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
secret again this is the dead statement
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.439
secret again this is the dead statement
oh yeah this is that the whole notion of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
oh yeah this is that the whole notion of
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.869
oh yeah this is that the whole notion of
logic and coherence and empirical data

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
logic and coherence and empirical data
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.340
logic and coherence and empirical data
for that matter it's a very nature let's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
for that matter it's a very nature let's
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.410
for that matter it's a very nature let's
question let's question the definition

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
question let's question the definition
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.390
question let's question the definition
of evidence because the underlying idea

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
of evidence because the underlying idea
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.039
of evidence because the underlying idea
remember the underlying idea here is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
remember the underlying idea here is
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.620
remember the underlying idea here is
that all hierarchies are predicated on

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
that all hierarchies are predicated on
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.289
that all hierarchies are predicated on
power so if the reason that I put

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
power so if the reason that I put
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.969
power so if the reason that I put
forward something as evidence isn't

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
forward something as evidence isn't
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.310
forward something as evidence isn't
because it's evidence it's because it's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
because it's evidence it's because it's
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.420
because it's evidence it's because it's
evidence that I get to have that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
evidence that I get to have that
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670
evidence that I get to have that
position of power and so if you're a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
position of power and so if you're a
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.320
position of power and so if you're a
postmodernist and you say well I'm going

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
postmodernist and you say well I'm going
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120
postmodernist and you say well I'm going
to question your evidence what you think

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
to question your evidence what you think
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.740
to question your evidence what you think
you're saying is you're going to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
you're saying is you're going to
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.899
you're saying is you're going to
question my claim to that arbitrary

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
question my claim to that arbitrary
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.640
question my claim to that arbitrary
power the whole idea that there's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
power the whole idea that there's
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.800
power the whole idea that there's
evidence outside of claims of arbitrary

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
evidence outside of claims of arbitrary
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870
evidence outside of claims of arbitrary
power the post modernists dispensed

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
power the post modernists dispensed
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.289
power the post modernists dispensed
without in the 1970s that's Derrida

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299
without in the 1970s that's Derrida
 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.390
without in the 1970s that's Derrida
that's exactly what he said is all this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
that's exactly what he said is all this
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.039
that's exactly what he said is all this
time I've been trying to get samples of

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
time I've been trying to get samples of
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.600
time I've been trying to get samples of
thousands so that I could say you know

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
thousands so that I could say you know
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.060
thousands so that I could say you know
this is a little bit we can say

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
this is a little bit we can say
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.249
this is a little bit we can say
something not just in generalized no no

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
something not just in generalized no no
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.870
something not just in generalized no no
that just demonstrates how thoroughly

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
that just demonstrates how thoroughly
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609
that just demonstrates how thoroughly
entrenched you are in the reigning

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
entrenched you are in the reigning
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.800
entrenched you are in the reigning
patriarchal ideologies I guess and I was

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
patriarchal ideologies I guess and I was
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.899
patriarchal ideologies I guess and I was
just hoping to get beyond anecdotal

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
just hoping to get beyond anecdotal
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.209
just hoping to get beyond anecdotal
there's no beyond acne dude there's no

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219
there's no beyond acne dude there's no
 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.740
there's no beyond acne dude there's no
beyond anecdotal that's become a

methodology that's Otto experience it's
 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.300
methodology that's Otto experience it's
called Auto ethnography there's a

called Auto ethnography there's a
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.560
called Auto ethnography there's a
technical term for it and Auto

of in the last three or four years that
 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.220
of in the last three or four years that
these things have been happening I said

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
these things have been happening I said
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.530
these things have been happening I said
well where do they get this how do they

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
well where do they get this how do they
 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.009
well where do they get this how do they
how do they find these thoughts yes well

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019
how do they find these thoughts yes well
 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.600
how do they find these thoughts yes well
we do we don't we don't want to fall

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610
we do we don't we don't want to fall
 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.910
we do we don't we don't want to fall
into the mistake of making of making the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
into the mistake of making of making the
 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.860
into the mistake of making of making the
assumption that this hasn't been thought

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870
assumption that this hasn't been thought
 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.309
assumption that this hasn't been thought
through people are not just

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319
through people are not just
 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.750
through people are not just
misunderstanding what evidence is that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
misunderstanding what evidence is that
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.490
misunderstanding what evidence is that
isn't what's happening at all when they

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
isn't what's happening at all when they
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.470
isn't what's happening at all when they
say they want to question the definition

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480
say they want to question the definition
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.600
say they want to question the definition
of evidence that's exactly what they

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610
of evidence that's exactly what they
 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.460
of evidence that's exactly what they
mean when they say we want to question

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
mean when they say we want to question
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.440
mean when they say we want to question
the definition of evidence because the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
the definition of evidence because the
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.330
the definition of evidence because the
definition of evidence currently

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340
definition of evidence currently
 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.610
definition of evidence currently
supports the scientific power structure

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620
supports the scientific power structure
 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.080
supports the scientific power structure
in chemistry say and that's

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090
in chemistry say and that's
 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.030
in chemistry say and that's
fundamentally dominated by let's say

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
fundamentally dominated by let's say
 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.250
fundamentally dominated by let's say
white men we can go after the definition

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
white men we can go after the definition
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.289
white men we can go after the definition
of evidence itself and that's how we're

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299
of evidence itself and that's how we're
 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.089
of evidence itself and that's how we're
going to bring it down and so the next

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099
going to bring it down and so the next
 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.650
going to bring it down and so the next
people on the hit list are going to be

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
people on the hit list are going to be
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.120
people on the hit list are going to be
the biologists they're already under

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130
the biologists they're already under
 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.280
the biologists they're already under
attack the people that said that

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290
attack the people that said that
 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.559
attack the people that said that
mathematics is whiteness yeah yeah yeah

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569
mathematics is whiteness yeah yeah yeah
 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.160
mathematics is whiteness yeah yeah yeah
definitely I didn't know that

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170
definitely I didn't know that
 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.840
definitely I didn't know that
mathematics could have a race hmm yeah

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850
mathematics could have a race hmm yeah
 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.430
mathematics could have a race hmm yeah
but it's thinking the thing is there's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440
but it's thinking the thing is there's
 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.050
but it's thinking the thing is there's
nothing illogical about these claims

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060
nothing illogical about these claims
 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.599
nothing illogical about these claims
once you accept this central axioms the

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609
once you accept this central axioms the
 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.000
once you accept this central axioms the
axioms are straightforward the world is

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010
axioms are straightforward the world is
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.280
axioms are straightforward the world is
a battleground of power hierarchies

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290
a battleground of power hierarchies
 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.500
a battleground of power hierarchies
that's what it is there isn't anything

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
that's what it is there isn't anything
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.530
that's what it is there isn't anything
else outside of that and each power

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
else outside of that and each power
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.490
else outside of that and each power
hierarchy generates its own internal

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500
hierarchy generates its own internal
 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.559
hierarchy generates its own internal
narrative including rules for what

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569
narrative including rules for what
 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.960
narrative including rules for what
constitutes evidence that support and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970
constitutes evidence that support and
 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.090
constitutes evidence that support and
buttress the structure of that hierarchy

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100
buttress the structure of that hierarchy
 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.080
buttress the structure of that hierarchy
and because the hierarchies exclude then

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090
and because the hierarchies exclude then
 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.640
and because the hierarchies exclude then
it's in the best interests of the people

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650
it's in the best interests of the people
 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.680
it's in the best interests of the people
who are excluded to invert the hierarchy

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690
who are excluded to invert the hierarchy
 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.120
who are excluded to invert the hierarchy
and of course they also regard that as

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130
and of course they also regard that as
 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.520
and of course they also regard that as
just even though that's part of the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530
just even though that's part of the
 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.900
just even though that's part of the
incoherence of the entire argument

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910
incoherence of the entire argument
 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.610
incoherence of the entire argument
that's where they have to turn to to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620
that's where they have to turn to to
 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.949
that's where they have to turn to to
Marxism but make no mistake about it

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959
Marxism but make no mistake about it
 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.199
Marxism but make no mistake about it
this isn't this isn't accidental it

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209
this isn't this isn't accidental it
 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.910
this isn't this isn't accidental it
isn't people misunderstanding what

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920
isn't people misunderstanding what
 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.139
isn't people misunderstanding what
constitutes evidence not at all
