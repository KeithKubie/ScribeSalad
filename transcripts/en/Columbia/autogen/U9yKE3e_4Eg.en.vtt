00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:39.830 align:start position:0%
so so what I should do I know I guess
 

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.410 align:start position:0%
so so what I should do I know I guess
its<00:24:40.100><c> run</c><00:24:40.280><c> around</c><00:24:40.520><c> the</c><00:24:40.610><c> reservoir</c><00:24:40.760><c> and</c><00:24:41.150><c> then</c><00:24:41.270><c> go</c>

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:41.420 align:start position:0%
its run around the reservoir and then go
 

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
its run around the reservoir and then go
to<00:24:41.480><c> the</c><00:24:41.660><c> problem</c><00:24:42.650><c> to</c><00:24:43.370><c> combine</c><00:24:43.700><c> two</c><00:24:44.060><c> but</c><00:24:44.300><c> I</c>

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:44.330 align:start position:0%
to the problem to combine two but I
 

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.860 align:start position:0%
to the problem to combine two but I
guess<00:24:44.570><c> I</c><00:24:44.600><c> guess</c><00:24:46.120><c> have</c><00:24:47.120><c> you</c><00:24:47.210><c> been</c><00:24:47.360><c> I've</c><00:24:47.630><c> even</c>
