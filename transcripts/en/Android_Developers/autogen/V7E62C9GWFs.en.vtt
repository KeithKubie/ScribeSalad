architecture components is this like a

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550
architecture components is this like a
 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.150
architecture components is this like a
perversion of what like their their

what's the was there a debate about
 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.580
what's the was there a debate about
architecture components so the answer is

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590
architecture components so the answer is
 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.440
architecture components so the answer is
that basic it all still holds true as

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450
that basic it all still holds true as
 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.690
that basic it all still holds true as
far as the core platform is concerned so

far as the core platform is concerned so
 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.180
far as the core platform is concerned so
you can think of like and when I say I'm

it's very different because it's in the

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.790
new codecs and cake I think the
consensus is no thanks hey first of all

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800
consensus is no thanks hey first of all
 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.220
consensus is no thanks hey first of all
I just wanted to thank you all for all

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230
I just wanted to thank you all for all
 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.670
I just wanted to thank you all for all
your hard work then and everyone

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680
your hard work then and everyone
 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.640
your hard work then and everyone
actually so it's been a great i/o and I

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650
actually so it's been a great i/o and I
 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.990
actually so it's been a great i/o and I
think you've made a lot of progress and

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000
think you've made a lot of progress and
 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.280
think you've made a lot of progress and
just listening to the community it's

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.290
just listening to the community it's
 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.750
just listening to the community it's
been awesome

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760
been awesome
 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.690
been awesome
my question is gonna be about testing I

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:14.700
my question is gonna be about testing I
 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.430
my question is gonna be about testing I
know it's gonna really ill shock her

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440
know it's gonna really ill shock her
 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.980
know it's gonna really ill shock her
okay it's a question for you

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990
okay it's a question for you
 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.080
okay it's a question for you
somehow I so it's it's question

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090
somehow I so it's it's question
 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.950
somehow I so it's it's question
obviously for chat at the Android you

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960
obviously for chat at the Android you
 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.719
obviously for chat at the Android you
know two days ago

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:25.729
know two days ago
 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.089
know two days ago
Chet actually had two slides on testing

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:28.099
Chet actually had two slides on testing
 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:30.040
Chet actually had two slides on testing
one was something about fluent

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050
one was something about fluent
 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.589
one was something about fluent
assertions the other had a picture of a

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599
assertions the other had a picture of a
 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:36.520
assertions the other had a picture of a
drink with a straw in it it was about

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530
drink with a straw in it it was about
 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:42.249
drink with a straw in it it was about
the ability to mock final static things

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:42.259
the ability to mock final static things
 

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:44.409
the ability to mock final static things
in the android framework yep and then

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:44.419
in the android framework yep and then
 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:46.089
in the android framework yep and then
remain made an awesome comment he's like

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:46.099
remain made an awesome comment he's like
 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:49.450
remain made an awesome comment he's like
Chet looks confused you know

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:49.460
Chet looks confused you know
 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.680
Chet looks confused you know
and I actually I was also confused I

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:52.690
and I actually I was also confused I
 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.510
and I actually I was also confused I
don't know why you would want you know

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520
don't know why you would want you know
 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.390
don't know why you would want you know
to kind of you know not maybe give that

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400
to kind of you know not maybe give that
 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.740
to kind of you know not maybe give that
ability but highlight is there one of

00:07:59.740 --> 00:07:59.750
ability but highlight is there one of
 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.469
ability but highlight is there one of
the important things in testing because

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479
the important things in testing because
 

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:04.240
the important things in testing because
later in the testing talk and you know

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.250
later in the testing talk and you know
 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.339
later in the testing talk and you know
and we actually talked about the fact

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:06.349
and we actually talked about the fact
 

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:08.350
and we actually talked about the fact
that that's kind of undesirable we don't

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360
that that's kind of undesirable we don't
 

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.749
that that's kind of undesirable we don't
want to have people do that so could we

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759
want to have people do that so could we
 

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:13.060
want to have people do that so could we
get some comment on like what is our

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.070
get some comment on like what is our
 

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.080
get some comment on like what is our
official stance on being actually using

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.090
official stance on being actually using
 

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.510
official stance on being actually using
that very powerful and dangerous

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520
that very powerful and dangerous
 

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.820
that very powerful and dangerous
approach to testing what's your opinion

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:23.830
approach to testing what's your opinion
 

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.300
approach to testing what's your opinion
so official stance is probably a little

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.310
so official stance is probably a little
 

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.490
so official stance is probably a little
strong but I would say there are

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:30.500
strong but I would say there are
 

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.980
strong but I would say there are
probably more there are more better

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:32.990
probably more there are more better
 

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.199
probably more there are more better
approaches to testing such as the other

00:08:35.199 --> 00:08:35.209
approaches to testing such as the other
 

00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:38.230
approaches to testing such as the other
stuff that I talked about the the ADSL

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240
stuff that I talked about the the ADSL
 

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.719
stuff that I talked about the the ADSL
stuff that's in jetpack now espresso

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:40.729
stuff that's in jetpack now espresso
 

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.399
stuff that's in jetpack now espresso
testing frameworks that actually do

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:42.409
testing frameworks that actually do
 

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.800
testing frameworks that actually do
things correctly however you heard from

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:44.810
things correctly however you heard from
 

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.780
things correctly however you heard from
the audience's response to the ability

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:46.790
the audience's response to the ability
 

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.639
the audience's response to the ability
to mock the framework that sometimes

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:48.649
to mock the framework that sometimes
 

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:50.920
to mock the framework that sometimes
developers need for whatever purpose the

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:50.930
developers need for whatever purpose the
 

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.670
developers need for whatever purpose the
ability to do that and the framework is

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:54.680
ability to do that and the framework is
 

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.699
ability to do that and the framework is
really about providing the capabilities

00:08:57.699 --> 00:08:57.709
really about providing the capabilities
 

00:08:57.709 --> 00:08:59.319
really about providing the capabilities
that you need for your particular

00:08:59.319 --> 00:08:59.329
that you need for your particular
 

00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:01.660
that you need for your particular
situation so by providing the ability to

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:01.670
situation so by providing the ability to
 

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.269
situation so by providing the ability to
mock the framework specific methods more

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279
mock the framework specific methods more
 

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:06.730
mock the framework specific methods more
easily we're saying here is a facility

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:06.740
easily we're saying here is a facility
 

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.800
easily we're saying here is a facility
if it's important to you and necessary

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:08.810
if it's important to you and necessary
 

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.449
if it's important to you and necessary
for what you're doing it may not be the

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:10.459
for what you're doing it may not be the
 

00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:13.630
for what you're doing it may not be the
right general approach overall but if

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640
right general approach overall but if
 

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.310
right general approach overall but if
it's a piece that people feel they need

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320
it's a piece that people feel they need
 

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.139
it's a piece that people feel they need
there's a bit of plumbing for you I

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:17.149
there's a bit of plumbing for you I
 

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:18.160
there's a bit of plumbing for you I
don't know if anybody else had a

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.170
don't know if anybody else had a
 

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.329
don't know if anybody else had a
different take on this that helped I

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:22.339
different take on this that helped I
 

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:24.250
different take on this that helped I
mean I guess I could add a little bit

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:24.260
mean I guess I could add a little bit
 

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.770
mean I guess I could add a little bit
there's there's some

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:25.780
there's there's some
 

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.470
there's there's some
there's like philosophically like not

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480
there's like philosophically like not
 

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.780
there's like philosophically like not
having you know finals and stats and

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:30.790
having you know finals and stats and
 

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.170
having you know finals and stats and
stuff is fine you know the issue is

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:34.180
stuff is fine you know the issue is
 

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.120
stuff is fine you know the issue is
within the platform we have those you

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.130
within the platform we have those you
 

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.250
within the platform we have those you
know in the api's and for good reason

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:38.260
know in the api's and for good reason
 

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.010
know in the api's and for good reason
right yeah so but so that means that if

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:41.020
right yeah so but so that means that if
 

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.810
right yeah so but so that means that if
you do want to mock something in the in

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:42.820
you do want to mock something in the in
 

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.120
you do want to mock something in the in
the in the in the platform anywhere you

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.130
the in the in the platform anywhere you
 

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.530
the in the in the platform anywhere you
need to be able to do that and so like

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:46.540
need to be able to do that and so like
 

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.210
need to be able to do that and so like
we had actually discussion about like

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:48.220
we had actually discussion about like
 

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.950
we had actually discussion about like
getting these into mockito and there was

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:49.960
getting these into mockito and there was
 

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.510
getting these into mockito and there was
like no no no this is wrong you

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:51.520
like no no no this is wrong you
 

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.770
like no no no this is wrong you
shouldn't do this but you know like

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:52.780
shouldn't do this but you know like
 

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.030
shouldn't do this but you know like
we've kind of reached the agreement that

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.040
we've kind of reached the agreement that
 

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.160
we've kind of reached the agreement that
like well in this case it actually is

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.170
like well in this case it actually is
 

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.720
like well in this case it actually is
you know like it makes sense this is

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:57.730
you know like it makes sense this is
 

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.250
you know like it makes sense this is
like something we need to do so that's

00:09:59.250 --> 00:09:59.260
like something we need to do so that's
 

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.860
like something we need to do so that's
that's why for the freight word

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:01.870
that's why for the freight word
 

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.200
that's why for the freight word
developers all its for it well not for

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.210
developers all its for it well not for
 

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.000
developers all its for it well not for
framework developers but for anyone

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.010
framework developers but for anyone
 

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.590
framework developers but for anyone
who's writing tests where they want to

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600
who's writing tests where they want to
 

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.750
who's writing tests where they want to
mock out framework api's okay like you

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760
mock out framework api's okay like you
 

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.000
mock out framework api's okay like you
have you know like a context that you're

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.010
have you know like a context that you're
 

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.410
have you know like a context that you're
the window manager from and you want to

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:16.420
the window manager from and you want to
 

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.330
the window manager from and you want to
mock out the window manager object to

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:18.340
mock out the window manager object to
 

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.950
mock out the window manager object to
see if you the correct calls happen on

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:19.960
see if you the correct calls happen on
 

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.110
see if you the correct calls happen on
it all right thanks a lot

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120
it all right thanks a lot
 

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.180
it all right thanks a lot
Thanks what's your current thinking

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:27.190
Thanks what's your current thinking
 

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:38.889
Thanks what's your current thinking
around Android tablets

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:38.899
 
 

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:44.030
 
they like them you still see it as like

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040
they like them you still see it as like
 

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.829
they like them you still see it as like
a device type within the base platform

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839
a device type within the base platform

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.590
 
so from a platform perspective we

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600
so from a platform perspective we
 

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.930
so from a platform perspective we
support tablets you know you know we we

purist on the Android team it's actually
 

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.950
purist on the Android team it's actually
a nice thing because it's the same apps

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:57.960
a nice thing because it's the same apps
 

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.890

concerned we support tablets there's a
 

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:25.550
concerned we support tablets there's a
lot of Android tablets you look like

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560
lot of Android tablets you look like
 

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.460
lot of Android tablets you look like
you're not done with all right we're not

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:28.470
you're not done with all right we're not
 

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.870
you're not done with all right we're not
happy with my answer it just seems

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880
happy with my answer it just seems
 

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.210

Chromebooks are still focus on web first

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220
Chromebooks are still focus on web first
 

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.510
Chromebooks are still focus on web first
yes they support Android but they're not

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:34.520
yes they support Android but they're not
 

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.510
yes they support Android but they're not
like they don't put it first so it's

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:38.520
like they don't put it first so it's
 

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.730
like they don't put it first so it's
like what's the story from the

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740
like what's the story from the
 

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.340
like what's the story from the
developers side okay I bought a pixel

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:43.350
developers side okay I bought a pixel
 

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.650

see you don't support anymore but it's

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660
see you don't support anymore but it's
 

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.590
see you don't support anymore but it's
like should we be buying Chromebooks and

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600
like should we be buying Chromebooks and
 

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.260
like should we be buying Chromebooks and
like detachable Chromebooks foot it to

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:51.270
like detachable Chromebooks foot it to
 

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.290
like detachable Chromebooks foot it to
vape on or I mean you should buy

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300
vape on or I mean you should buy
 

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.060
vape on or I mean you should buy
whatever spice you think it's good for

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.070
whatever spice you think it's good for
 

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.260
whatever spice you think it's good for
you to buy I use a pixel book by the way

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:00.270
you to buy I use a pixel book by the way
 

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.390
you to buy I use a pixel book by the way
I love it I think it's good and I've run

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:02.400
I love it I think it's good and I've run
 

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.110
I love it I think it's good and I've run
Android apps on it

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120
Android apps on it
 

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.490
Android apps on it
that's me personally but I think

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500
that's me personally but I think
 

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.170
that's me personally but I think
everyone should pick whatever product

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180
everyone should pick whatever product
 

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.640
everyone should pick whatever product
they want from from our perspective you

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:07.650
they want from from our perspective you
 

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.200
they want from from our perspective you
know as a platform operating system

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.210
know as a platform operating system
 

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.270
know as a platform operating system
provider it's important that android

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:11.280
provider it's important that android
 

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.070
provider it's important that android
supports tablets and has good tablet

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.080
supports tablets and has good tablet
 

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.650
supports tablets and has good tablet
apps and that's what we focus on all

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660
apps and that's what we focus on all
 

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.329
apps and that's what we focus on all
right folks

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:18.339
 
 

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:21.039
 
so I went to one of those sessions which

00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:21.049
so I went to one of those sessions which
 

00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:23.409
so I went to one of those sessions which
was the best practices for kind of the

00:13:23.409 --> 00:13:23.419
was the best practices for kind of the
 

00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:25.029
was the best practices for kind of the
current state of Android and you guys

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:25.039
current state of Android and you guys
 

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:27.159
current state of Android and you guys
went over the current way to do

00:13:27.159 --> 00:13:27.169
went over the current way to do
 

00:13:27.169 --> 00:13:29.439
went over the current way to do
constraint layouts and databases but I

00:13:29.439 --> 00:13:29.449
constraint layouts and databases but I
 

00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:30.909
constraint layouts and databases but I
was wondering you guys didn't really go

00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:30.919
was wondering you guys didn't really go
 

00:13:30.919 --> 00:13:32.979
was wondering you guys didn't really go
over what kind of you think we should be

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:32.989
over what kind of you think we should be
 

00:13:32.989 --> 00:13:34.629
over what kind of you think we should be
doing for networking I know a few years

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639
doing for networking I know a few years
 

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.460
doing for networking I know a few years
ago you guys were pushing volley really

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:36.470
ago you guys were pushing volley really
 

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.710
ago you guys were pushing volley really
hard but now I feel like there's volley

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720
hard but now I feel like there's volley
 

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.349
hard but now I feel like there's volley
and retrofit and 15 other libraries and

00:13:41.349 --> 00:13:41.359
and retrofit and 15 other libraries and
 

00:13:41.359 --> 00:13:42.519
and retrofit and 15 other libraries and
I know what kind of depends on what your

00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:42.529
I know what kind of depends on what your
 

00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:44.319
I know what kind of depends on what your
use cases but if you were gonna say for

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:44.329
use cases but if you were gonna say for
 

00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:45.939
use cases but if you were gonna say for
someone starting off what would you

00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:45.949
someone starting off what would you
 

00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:48.489
someone starting off what would you
recommend for the networking manager for

00:13:48.489 --> 00:13:48.499
recommend for the networking manager for
 

00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:50.139
recommend for the networking manager for
us to use an Android app recommend for

00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:50.149
us to use an Android app recommend for
 

00:13:50.149 --> 00:13:52.809
us to use an Android app recommend for
what for networking like making network

00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:52.819
what for networking like making network
 

00:13:52.819 --> 00:13:58.869
what for networking like making network
requests just a regular get request rep

00:13:58.869 --> 00:13:58.879

someone someone in the peanut gallery

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:00.410
someone someone in the peanut gallery
 

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.009
someone someone in the peanut gallery
says retrofit good you want to have a

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:03.019
says retrofit good you want to have a
 

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:05.889
says retrofit good you want to have a
vote on that yes okay

00:14:05.889 --> 00:14:05.899
vote on that yes okay
 

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:08.739
vote on that yes okay
yeah volley was the right thing for some

00:14:08.739 --> 00:14:08.749
yeah volley was the right thing for some
 

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:10.779
yeah volley was the right thing for some
things at the time I think that there

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:10.789
things at the time I think that there
 

00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:12.039
things at the time I think that there
are probably other more evolved

00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:12.049
are probably other more evolved
 

00:14:12.049 --> 00:14:13.150
are probably other more evolved
libraries out there that might be the

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160
libraries out there that might be the
 

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.979
libraries out there that might be the
right solution and I think all libraries

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:14.989
right solution and I think all libraries
 

00:14:14.989 --> 00:14:18.309
right solution and I think all libraries
do non-overlapping things so I I don't

00:14:18.309 --> 00:14:18.319
do non-overlapping things so I I don't
 

00:14:18.319 --> 00:14:22.239
do non-overlapping things so I I don't
think there's an exact match but they

00:14:22.239 --> 00:14:22.249
think there's an exact match but they
 

00:14:22.249 --> 00:14:23.979
think there's an exact match but they
said retrofit I certainly hear a lot of

00:14:23.979 --> 00:14:23.989
said retrofit I certainly hear a lot of
 

00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:26.769
said retrofit I certainly hear a lot of
good things about that like what one of

00:14:26.769 --> 00:14:26.779
good things about that like what one of
 

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:30.669
good things about that like what one of
the there we go one of the things that

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:30.679
the there we go one of the things that
 

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:32.889
the there we go one of the things that
we're doing coincidental with the

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:32.899
we're doing coincidental with the
 

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:34.449
we're doing coincidental with the
architecture components but it's it's

00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:34.459
architecture components but it's it's
 

00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:35.949
architecture components but it's it's
not necessarily the same thing is that

00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:35.959
not necessarily the same thing is that
 

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:37.960
not necessarily the same thing is that
when there's a good library out there

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:37.970
when there's a good library out there
 

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.219
when there's a good library out there
that we didn't happen to build we're

00:14:39.219 --> 00:14:39.229
that we didn't happen to build we're
 

00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:40.960
that we didn't happen to build we're
happy to recommend it that goes for

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:40.970
happy to recommend it that goes for
 

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.090
happy to recommend it that goes for
retrofit it goes for things like Picasso

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:43.100
retrofit it goes for things like Picasso
 

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.329
retrofit it goes for things like Picasso
for image loading Glide as well whatever

00:14:46.329 --> 00:14:46.339
for image loading Glide as well whatever
 

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:47.679
for image loading Glide as well whatever
the thing is like if that's a good

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:47.689
the thing is like if that's a good
 

00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:49.419
the thing is like if that's a good
library why should we reinvent that

00:14:49.419 --> 00:14:49.429
library why should we reinvent that
 

00:14:49.429 --> 00:14:58.500
library why should we reinvent that
thing in this case

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:58.510
 
 

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:07.330
 
all right all right maybe not retrofit

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:07.340
 
 

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.140
 
okay

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:08.150
okay
 

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.389
okay

are we done did you plan that I can add

00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:17.629
are we done did you plan that I can add
 

00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:20.710
are we done did you plan that I can add
we've been walking around and several

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720
we've been walking around and several
 

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.069
we've been walking around and several
people I've have talked with have asked

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079
people I've have talked with have asked
 

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:28.439
people I've have talked with have asked
if we can recommend more libraries

00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:28.449
if we can recommend more libraries
 

00:15:28.449 --> 00:15:31.360
if we can recommend more libraries
specifically outside of Google the ones

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:31.370
specifically outside of Google the ones
 

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.980
specifically outside of Google the ones
created by the community which that we

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:32.990
created by the community which that we
 

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.319
created by the community which that we
think work best and so I think that's

00:15:35.319 --> 00:15:35.329
think work best and so I think that's
 

00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:37.030
think work best and so I think that's
been great question and great advice

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040
been great question and great advice
 

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.699
been great question and great advice
it's always been our intention with

00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:39.709
it's always been our intention with
 

00:15:39.709 --> 00:15:41.949
it's always been our intention with
jetpack to have an opinion about the

00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959
jetpack to have an opinion about the
 

00:15:41.959 --> 00:15:43.360
jetpack to have an opinion about the
best way to do development because

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:43.370
best way to do development because
 

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.100
best way to do development because
several of you have said that saves time

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:45.110
several of you have said that saves time
 

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.809
several of you have said that saves time
you don't have to look at a bunch of

00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:46.819
you don't have to look at a bunch of
 

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:50.439
you don't have to look at a bunch of
things or six as Jonathan always tells

00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:50.449
things or six as Jonathan always tells
 

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:52.809
things or six as Jonathan always tells
me so I think it's it's been great

00:15:52.809 --> 00:15:52.819
me so I think it's it's been great
 

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:57.819
me so I think it's it's been great
feedback Thanks sir is this close enough

00:15:57.819 --> 00:15:57.829
feedback Thanks sir is this close enough
 

00:15:57.829 --> 00:16:01.749
feedback Thanks sir is this close enough
yeah so a lot of the examples we've seen

00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759
yeah so a lot of the examples we've seen
 

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:04.269
yeah so a lot of the examples we've seen
for code during i/o not not close enough

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279
for code during i/o not not close enough
 

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:06.939
for code during i/o not not close enough
a lot of the examples we've seen for

00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:06.949
a lot of the examples we've seen for
 

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:08.829
a lot of the examples we've seen for
code during i/o have been Kotlin code

00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839
code during i/o have been Kotlin code
 

00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:11.410
code during i/o have been Kotlin code
and I guess a question that I kind of

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:11.420
and I guess a question that I kind of
 

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.629
and I guess a question that I kind of
have is what's the long term things that

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639
have is what's the long term things that
 

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.970
have is what's the long term things that
developers can expect they have a large

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:15.980
developers can expect they have a large
 

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.269
developers can expect they have a large
code base that's still in Java right let

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279
code base that's still in Java right let
 

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.499
code base that's still in Java right let
me make sure the question was what

00:16:20.499 --> 00:16:20.509
me make sure the question was what
 

00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:21.759
me make sure the question was what
should developers expect if they have a

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:21.769
should developers expect if they have a
 

00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:23.769
should developers expect if they have a
code base in Java programming language

00:16:23.769 --> 00:16:23.779
code base in Java programming language
 

00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:27.759
code base in Java programming language
like long term support from some so when

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:27.769
like long term support from some so when
 

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:30.730
like long term support from some so when
we when we invest it in Kotlin we knew

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:30.740
we when we invest it in Kotlin we knew
 

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.990
we when we invest it in Kotlin we knew
that was going to be an investment for

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000
that was going to be an investment for
 

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.150
that was going to be an investment for
the long term so we're completely

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160
the long term so we're completely
 

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.670
the long term so we're completely
committed to the language we also knew

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680
committed to the language we also knew
 

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.309
committed to the language we also knew
and we invested in Kotlin day whenever

00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319
and we invested in Kotlin day whenever
 

00:16:39.319 --> 00:16:41.410
and we invested in Kotlin day whenever
it was May 17th that it meant that we

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:41.420
it was May 17th that it meant that we
 

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.210
it was May 17th that it meant that we
were doubling down on all of our

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:43.220
were doubling down on all of our
 

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.189
were doubling down on all of our
languages and a lot of you have also

00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199
languages and a lot of you have also
 

00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:47.379
languages and a lot of you have also
said that we needed to do more to

00:16:47.379 --> 00:16:47.389
said that we needed to do more to
 

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:49.540
said that we needed to do more to
support the existing languages we had so

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:49.550
support the existing languages we had so
 

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.759
support the existing languages we had so
the way we saw it was we're not choosing

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:51.769
the way we saw it was we're not choosing
 

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:54.429
the way we saw it was we're not choosing
a new language we're investing in all of

00:16:54.429 --> 00:16:54.439
a new language we're investing in all of
 

00:16:54.439 --> 00:16:55.809
a new language we're investing in all of
our languages and in fact you can see

00:16:55.809 --> 00:16:55.819
our languages and in fact you can see
 

00:16:55.819 --> 00:17:00.100
our languages and in fact you can see
that in C++ we've launched NDK build C

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:00.110
that in C++ we've launched NDK build C
 

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.960
that in C++ we've launched NDK build C
make we've significantly improved that

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:01.970
make we've significantly improved that
 

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.659
make we've significantly improved that
NDK we launched the new C++ profiler

00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:04.669
NDK we launched the new C++ profiler
 

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:07.210
NDK we launched the new C++ profiler
where we here the tool chain in the Java

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:07.220
where we here the tool chain in the Java
 

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.699
where we here the tool chain in the Java
programming languages we added Java 8

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:08.709
programming languages we added Java 8
 

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:11.169
programming languages we added Java 8
Java dot time is my personal favorite

00:17:11.169 --> 00:17:11.179
Java dot time is my personal favorite
 

00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:15.819
Java dot time is my personal favorite
and you should expect to see us continue

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:15.829
and you should expect to see us continue
 

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:18.970
and you should expect to see us continue
to invest in our languages it's really

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:18.980
to invest in our languages it's really
 

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.220
to invest in our languages it's really
important with such a large ecosystem

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:21.230
important with such a large ecosystem
 

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.980
important with such a large ecosystem
to support the ecosystem where it is at

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:23.990
to support the ecosystem where it is at
 

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.169
to support the ecosystem where it is at
the same time we've seen a tremendous

00:17:26.169 --> 00:17:26.179
the same time we've seen a tremendous
 

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:27.880
the same time we've seen a tremendous
interest in Kotlin I think we talked

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:27.890
interest in Kotlin I think we talked
 

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.909
interest in Kotlin I think we talked
about some of the statistics and so like

00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919
about some of the statistics and so like
 

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:33.640
about some of the statistics and so like

developers it's had 6x growth in one

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000
developers it's had 6x growth in one
 

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.580
developers it's had 6x growth in one
year so if you haven't looked at the

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:39.590
year so if you haven't looked at the
 

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.020
year so if you haven't looked at the
language we do think it's a good idea to

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.030
language we do think it's a good idea to
 

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.780
language we do think it's a good idea to
take a look but hopefully that helps in

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:43.790
take a look but hopefully that helps in
 

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.130
take a look but hopefully that helps in
select question in Twitter you are

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:45.140
select question in Twitter you are
 

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.710
select question in Twitter you are
saying that sway took us so long to

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720
saying that sway took us so long to
 

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.880
saying that sway took us so long to
support another language because you

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:48.890
support another language because you
 

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.590
support another language because you
know the community has been asking for

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600
know the community has been asking for
 

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.909
know the community has been asking for
different languages over the years and

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919
different languages over the years and
 

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:53.020
different languages over the years and
it's been 10 years since Android

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:53.030
it's been 10 years since Android
 

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.390
it's been 10 years since Android
launched but we wanted to make sure that

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400
launched but we wanted to make sure that
 

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.070
launched but we wanted to make sure that
whichever one we picked we would support

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080
whichever one we picked we would support
 

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.650
whichever one we picked we would support
truly and correctly without dropping the

00:17:59.650 --> 00:17:59.660
truly and correctly without dropping the
 

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.720
truly and correctly without dropping the
other one so we took our time we think

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:01.730
other one so we took our time we think
 

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:02.890
other one so we took our time we think
we made the right choice and we're going

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:02.900
we made the right choice and we're going
 

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.750
we made the right choice and we're going
to keep working on all three languages

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:04.760
to keep working on all three languages
 

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.260
to keep working on all three languages
that we support today I can tell this

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:08.270
that we support today I can tell this
 

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.850
that we support today I can tell this
app wants to say something so I'm gonna

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:09.860
app wants to say something so I'm gonna
 

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.250
app wants to say something so I'm gonna
toss a tools question over to them so

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:12.260
toss a tools question over to them so
 

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.789
toss a tools question over to them so
are there any plans for tools for build

00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799
are there any plans for tools for build
 

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:18.190
are there any plans for tools for build
speed profiling and optimizing I think

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200
speed profiling and optimizing I think
 

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.169
speed profiling and optimizing I think
the context of the question was not can

00:18:20.169 --> 00:18:20.179
the context of the question was not can
 

00:18:20.179 --> 00:18:21.700
the context of the question was not can
you make to build faster but if they see

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:21.710
you make to build faster but if they see
 

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.289
you make to build faster but if they see
their build is taking a long time as

00:18:23.289 --> 00:18:23.299
their build is taking a long time as
 

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:25.000
their build is taking a long time as
there are their tools or their

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.010
there are their tools or their
 

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.590
there are their tools or their
approaches that they can take to find

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600
approaches that they can take to find
 

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.450
approaches that they can take to find
out what it is that's taking time so

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:28.460
out what it is that's taking time so
 

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.000
out what it is that's taking time so
that they can optimize it yes yeah we

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.010
that they can optimize it yes yeah we
 

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.289
that they can optimize it yes yeah we
see a lot of developers having a lot of

00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:32.299
see a lot of developers having a lot of
 

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:34.120
see a lot of developers having a lot of
issues not being able to make that bill

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:34.130
issues not being able to make that bill
 

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.539
issues not being able to make that bill
faster and we did really want to help

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:37.549
faster and we did really want to help
 

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:38.890
faster and we did really want to help
there there's already a lot of resources

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:38.900
there there's already a lot of resources
 

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.460
there there's already a lot of resources
that you can use greater has Bill scans

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:42.470
that you can use greater has Bill scans
 

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.440
that you can use greater has Bill scans
that allow you to really get a lot of

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:44.450
that allow you to really get a lot of
 

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:45.730
that allow you to really get a lot of
insight into your build so you can

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:45.740
insight into your build so you can
 

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.980
insight into your build so you can
definitely use that but to realize that

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:47.990
definitely use that but to realize that
 

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.390
definitely use that but to realize that
having something integrated in studio

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400
having something integrated in studio
 

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.650
having something integrated in studio
would be extremely useful so it's

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:50.660
would be extremely useful so it's
 

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.750
would be extremely useful so it's
definitely something we're considering

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760
 
 

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.600
 
so I downloaded the Android P beta and

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:58.610
so I downloaded the Android P beta and
 

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.150
so I downloaded the Android P beta and
having a good time on it but my question

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:01.160
having a good time on it but my question
 

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.330
having a good time on it but my question
is white girl removed the clear-all on

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:04.340
is white girl removed the clear-all on
 

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:12.700
is white girl removed the clear-all on
the overview tab yes I asked that exact

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:12.710
the overview tab yes I asked that exact
 

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:17.230
the overview tab yes I asked that exact
question to the team about five or six

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240
question to the team about five or six
 

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.330
question to the team about five or six
weeks ago and they're just they sighed

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:19.340
weeks ago and they're just they sighed
 

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.560
weeks ago and they're just they sighed

are there are two answers one is you
 

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.360
are there are two answers one is you
know Android is managing the memory you

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:37.370
know Android is managing the memory you
 

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:38.740
know Android is managing the memory you
know as well as you can you don't need

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:38.750
know as well as you can you don't need
 

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.000
know as well as you can you don't need
to swipe things away for Android to be

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.010
to swipe things away for Android to be
 

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.100
to swipe things away for Android to be
able to reclaim that memory in order to

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.110
able to reclaim that memory in order to
 

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.620
able to reclaim that memory in order to
be able to run other things the second

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:44.630
be able to run other things the second
 

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.300
be able to run other things the second
answer is yeah sorry about that well

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:46.310
answer is yeah sorry about that well
 

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:54.100
answer is yeah sorry about that well
we're looking at bring it back I can

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.110
we're looking at bring it back I can
 

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.520
we're looking at bring it back I can
tell you I have a bill that's after beta

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:57.530

it's coming back weeks so in 2014 I was

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:10.820
it's coming back weeks so in 2014 I was
 

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.310
it's coming back weeks so in 2014 I was
at the Moscone Center and asked you guys

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320
at the Moscone Center and asked you guys
 

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.050
at the Moscone Center and asked you guys
a question if you were gonna keep

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:14.060
a question if you were gonna keep
 

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.000
a question if you were gonna keep
maintaining eclipse and I'm really glad

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.010
maintaining eclipse and I'm really glad
 

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.430
maintaining eclipse and I'm really glad
that you were not I'm 100% on the

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440
that you were not I'm 100% on the
 

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.130
that you were not I'm 100% on the
Android studio wagon now I still worry

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:21.140
Android studio wagon now I still worry
 

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.720
Android studio wagon now I still worry
about built-ins which was one of the

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:22.730
about built-ins which was one of the
 

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.210
about built-ins which was one of the
questions that I had then but my

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:25.220
questions that I had then but my
 

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.150
questions that I had then but my
question to you guys is if what are the

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:28.160
question to you guys is if what are the
 

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.070
question to you guys is if what are the
what are the warts that you wish you

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080
what are the warts that you wish you
 

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.320
what are the warts that you wish you
could redo from Android 1.0 so if you

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.330
could redo from Android 1.0 so if you
 

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.090
could redo from Android 1.0 so if you
could do Android 1.0 again what would

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:34.100
could do Android 1.0 again what would
 

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.750
could do Android 1.0 again what would
you change

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760
you change
 

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.030
you change
oh so many things

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:38.040
oh so many things
 

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:44.420
oh so many things
the UI Tokita graphics pipeline I did

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:44.430
the UI Tokita graphics pipeline I did
 

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:49.180
the UI Tokita graphics pipeline I did
some of that applications right settings

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:49.190
some of that applications right settings
 

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.120
some of that applications right settings
I've often thought that designing api's

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.130
I've often thought that designing api's
 

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.640
I've often thought that designing api's
is building future regret I have never

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:55.650
is building future regret I have never
 

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.250
is building future regret I have never
yet created an API that I haven't

00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260
yet created an API that I haven't
 

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.840
yet created an API that I haven't
regretted something about in the future

00:20:59.840 --> 00:20:59.850
regretted something about in the future
 

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:04.070
regretted something about in the future
I believe that they ran really fast they

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080
I believe that they ran really fast they
 

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.810
I believe that they ran really fast they
I was not there at the time at the time

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820
I was not there at the time at the time
 

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.640
I was not there at the time at the time
and therefore they were able to get it

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:07.650
and therefore they were able to get it
 

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.020
and therefore they were able to get it
out the door and now we have time to

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.030
out the door and now we have time to
 

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.520
out the door and now we have time to
actually fix some of those warts what we

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:10.530
actually fix some of those warts what we
 

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.770
actually fix some of those warts what we
can't do is remove methods and break

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780
can't do is remove methods and break
 

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.900
can't do is remove methods and break
applications right so we would certainly

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:14.910
applications right so we would certainly
 

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.510
applications right so we would certainly
we have been improving things hopefully

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520
we have been improving things hopefully
 

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.250
we have been improving things hopefully
and introducing new facilities and make

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260
and introducing new facilities and make
 

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.900
and introducing new facilities and make
things better but we can't actually get

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:20.910
things better but we can't actually get
 

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.220
things better but we can't actually get
rid of some of the things that we regret

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:22.230
rid of some of the things that we regret
 

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.420
rid of some of the things that we regret
because we don't want to break the apps

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:23.430
because we don't want to break the apps
 

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.370
because we don't want to break the apps
that are depending on it so there's that

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380
that are depending on it so there's that
 

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.870
that are depending on it so there's that
little bit of stuff that we can't quite

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880
little bit of stuff that we can't quite
 

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.180
little bit of stuff that we can't quite
totally fix but we can improve other

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.190
totally fix but we can improve other
 

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.560
totally fix but we can improve other
things along the way yeah there's

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:30.570
things along the way yeah there's
 

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:31.790
things along the way yeah there's
there's there's a number of things that

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:31.800
there's there's a number of things that
 

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.410
there's there's a number of things that
you find just like we did 10 years ago

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:33.420
you find just like we did 10 years ago
 

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.750
you find just like we did 10 years ago
and like today are like oh my gosh that

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760
and like today are like oh my gosh that
 

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.910
and like today are like oh my gosh that
is not scaling like one of the ones that

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:37.920
is not scaling like one of the ones that
 

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.500
is not scaling like one of the ones that
really stands out is that broadcast

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:39.510
really stands out is that broadcast
 

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:43.250
really stands out is that broadcast
we've gone through I our initial

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260
we've gone through I our initial
 

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.960
we've gone through I our initial
decision to say like by default when you

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:44.970
decision to say like by default when you
 

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.520
decision to say like by default when you
send the broadcast it just goes to any

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:46.530
send the broadcast it just goes to any
 

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.080
send the broadcast it just goes to any
manifest receiver that wants to receive

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.090
manifest receiver that wants to receive
 

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.230
manifest receiver that wants to receive
it was a really bad decision and we kind

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240
it was a really bad decision and we kind
 

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.880
it was a really bad decision and we kind
of we've learned this like over the last

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:52.890
of we've learned this like over the last
 

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.830
of we've learned this like over the last
few years as we've seen on devices like

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840
few years as we've seen on devices like
 

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.330
few years as we've seen on devices like
more and more applications waking up

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340
more and more applications waking up
 

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.790
more and more applications waking up
when just random things happening so we

00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:58.800
when just random things happening so we
 

00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.930

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.190
to more places we are certainly continue
to work on recycler view to integrate

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200
to work on recycler view to integrate
 

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.420
to work on recycler view to integrate
more of what people need in that

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:54.430
more of what people need in that
 

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.890
more of what people need in that
component we don't want it to be a

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:55.900
component we don't want it to be a
 

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.220
component we don't want it to be a
kitchen sink of all things but it is

00:25:59.220 --> 00:25:59.230
kitchen sink of all things but it is
 

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.910
kitchen sink of all things but it is
certainly possible to expand it into

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:02.920
certainly possible to expand it into
 

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.400
certainly possible to expand it into
more use cases that make sense for it I

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:05.410
more use cases that make sense for it I
 

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.020
more use cases that make sense for it I
don't know if somebody over there wants

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.030
don't know if somebody over there wants
 

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.320
don't know if somebody over there wants
to take it yeah Adam Adam UI toolkit

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:10.330
to take it yeah Adam Adam UI toolkit
 

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.100
to take it yeah Adam Adam UI toolkit
team so yeah I think that right now one

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:14.110
team so yeah I think that right now one
 

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.300
team so yeah I think that right now one
of the biggest things that kind of

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:15.310
of the biggest things that kind of
 

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.120
of the biggest things that kind of
impedes doing more of the integration of

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:18.130
impedes doing more of the integration of
 

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.680
impedes doing more of the integration of
recyclerview with some of the other

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:19.690
recyclerview with some of the other
 

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.420
recyclerview with some of the other
stuff in the framework is exactly some

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:21.430
stuff in the framework is exactly some
 

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.520
stuff in the framework is exactly some
of what Chet was saying earlier which is

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:23.530
of what Chet was saying earlier which is
 

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.550
of what Chet was saying earlier which is
that we can't do a lot of really key

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:26.560
that we can't do a lot of really key
 

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.840
that we can't do a lot of really key
changes to some of the stuff in the

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:27.850
changes to some of the stuff in the
 

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.100
changes to some of the stuff in the
framework there without breaking apps

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.110
framework there without breaking apps
 

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.500
framework there without breaking apps
and recyclerview is a conscious effort

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:31.510
and recyclerview is a conscious effort
 

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.750
and recyclerview is a conscious effort
to break from some of those existing

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760
to break from some of those existing
 

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.750
to break from some of those existing
api's at the time so those are

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760
api's at the time so those are
 

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.510
api's at the time so those are
directly one-to-one compatible so the

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520
directly one-to-one compatible so the
 

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.040
directly one-to-one compatible so the
stuff that's in the framework right now

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:40.050
stuff that's in the framework right now
 

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.750
stuff that's in the framework right now
is still going to be there

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760
is still going to be there
 

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.220
is still going to be there
in order to support the existing app

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:43.230
in order to support the existing app
 

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.700
in order to support the existing app
ecosystem but as we start building new

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:46.710
ecosystem but as we start building new
 

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.380
ecosystem but as we start building new
things I would expect to see a lot more

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:48.390
things I would expect to see a lot more
 

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.090
things I would expect to see a lot more
things built on top of recyclerview and

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100
things built on top of recyclerview and
 

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:55.390
things built on top of recyclerview and
other jetpack libraries like that Thanks

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:55.400
other jetpack libraries like that Thanks
 

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.050
other jetpack libraries like that Thanks
all right can you hear me closer is good

00:26:59.050 --> 00:26:59.060
all right can you hear me closer is good
 

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.240
all right can you hear me closer is good
so it looks like there is a shift

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:02.250
so it looks like there is a shift
 

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.460
so it looks like there is a shift
towards single activity applications I

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:04.470
towards single activity applications I
 

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.130
towards single activity applications I
was wondering to get some background on

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140
was wondering to get some background on
 

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.600
was wondering to get some background on
the decisions behind that and maybe the

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:10.610
the decisions behind that and maybe the
 

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.070
the decisions behind that and maybe the
when you should use a single activity

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080
when you should use a single activity
 

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.080
when you should use a single activity
application versus multi activity

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.090
application versus multi activity
 

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:19.100
application versus multi activity
application sure did you hear that

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:19.110
application sure did you hear that
 

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.790
application sure did you hear that
single single activity applications yeah

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:22.800
single single activity applications yeah
 

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.500
single single activity applications yeah
this is this is I well I'm gonna be the

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:27.510
this is this is I well I'm gonna be the
 

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.610
this is this is I well I'm gonna be the
first as I you know I don't have a

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620
first as I you know I don't have a
 

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.330
first as I you know I don't have a
strong opinion either way I'm but we

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340
strong opinion either way I'm but we
 

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.610
strong opinion either way I'm but we
definitely um you know as the UI

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.620
definitely um you know as the UI
 

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.050
definitely um you know as the UI
experience have gotten more

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:36.060
experience have gotten more
 

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.060
experience have gotten more
sophisticated it's definitely clear that

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:38.070
sophisticated it's definitely clear that
 

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.760
sophisticated it's definitely clear that
like you know like trying to like do

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:39.770
like you know like trying to like do
 

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.900
like you know like trying to like do
seamless transitions and all the things

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:41.910
seamless transitions and all the things
 

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.340
seamless transitions and all the things
you want to do between activities does

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:43.350
you want to do between activities does
 

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.930
you want to do between activities does
it doesn't it really doesn't really work

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:44.940
it doesn't it really doesn't really work
 

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.400
it doesn't it really doesn't really work
very well and there's really no need you

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:46.410
very well and there's really no need you
 

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:47.870
very well and there's really no need you
can think of activities as basically the

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880
can think of activities as basically the
 

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.520
can think of activities as basically the
only place you really need activities is

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:49.530
only place you really need activities is
 

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.020
only place you really need activities is
where you need main entry points into

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.030
where you need main entry points into
 

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.270
where you need main entry points into
your application right and so once

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:53.280
your application right and so once
 

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.440
your application right and so once
you're in the application whether you

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:54.450
you're in the application whether you
 

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.450
you're in the application whether you
use activity fragments or whatever else

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460
use activity fragments or whatever else
 

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.730
use activity fragments or whatever else
is kind of irrelevant to the operating

00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.010
is kind of irrelevant to the operating
system and we are leaning heavily on

don't I'm not profile your app

00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:25.809
 
 

00:28:25.809 --> 00:28:27.790
 
most of the stuff that you're building

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:27.800
most of the stuff that you're building
 

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.290
most of the stuff that you're building
at that point should be based on some of

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:29.300
at that point should be based on some of
 

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.850
at that point should be based on some of
the other lifecycle events as things are

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:30.860
the other lifecycle events as things are
 

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.260
the other lifecycle events as things are
coming and going is you're adding and

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:32.270
coming and going is you're adding and
 

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.970
coming and going is you're adding and
removing components from that single

be pretty similar whether that's a

be pretty similar whether that's a
 

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.400

another fragment thanks hi there so this

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:45.890
another fragment thanks hi there so this
 

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:49.840
another fragment thanks hi there so this
is close enough right my question is

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:49.850
is close enough right my question is
 

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:54.870
is close enough right my question is
about the new digital well being in

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880
about the new digital well being in
 

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.360

Android P so that was presented in the

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:58.370
Android P so that was presented in the
 

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.660
Android P so that was presented in the
keynote this option of actually defining

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:01.670
keynote this option of actually defining
 

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.840

a limiter in time for usage of
 

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:06.850
a limiter in time for usage of
particular apps so I was wondering

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:06.860
particular apps so I was wondering
 

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.980
particular apps so I was wondering
because they're already on the Play

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:08.990
because they're already on the Play
 

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.530
because they're already on the Play
Store for some years some apps that

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:11.540
Store for some years some apps that
 

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.870
Store for some years some apps that
actually offer this functionality like

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:13.880
actually offer this functionality like
 

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.610
actually offer this functionality like
did you did you guys base this idea for

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:18.620
did you did you guys base this idea for
 

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.030
did you did you guys base this idea for
those features based on AB suggesting or

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:22.040
those features based on AB suggesting or
 

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.830
those features based on AB suggesting or
some research particular some psychology

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840
some research particular some psychology
 

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.030
some research particular some psychology
research or something like that and is

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.040
research or something like that and is
 

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.270
research or something like that and is
there is there any API that third-party

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:34.280
there is there any API that third-party
 

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.930
there is there any API that third-party
apps can just use to contribute to this

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:37.940
apps can just use to contribute to this
 

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.370
apps can just use to contribute to this

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:42.380
digital well-being idea and operating
 

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.169
digital well-being idea and operating
system yeah I mean there's some great

00:29:44.169 --> 00:29:44.179
system yeah I mean there's some great
 

00:29:44.179 --> 00:29:47.290

apps on the Play Store you know not just

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:47.300
apps on the Play Store you know not just
 

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.640
apps on the Play Store you know not just
for this but also like headspace and

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:48.650
for this but also like headspace and
 

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:50.650
for this but also like headspace and
calm and sort of like a bigger area of
