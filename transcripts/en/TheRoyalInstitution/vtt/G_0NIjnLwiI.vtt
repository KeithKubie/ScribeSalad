00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.800
Now I've always been
particularly interested in faces,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.220
and the kind of messages
which we send out

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.520
through our faces all the time.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.080
But I would like to show you a slide or two.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.020
Now I acquired these slides
two years ago

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.140
when I first became interested in
this

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.320
and I wrote to a number of
department stores in London

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.000
and asked them to let me
take portraits of the teddy bears

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.140
in their toy departments.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.820
And it had an enthusiastic response
and given every conceivable facility.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.514
And I will show you
a very small selection

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.020
of what must be a unique collection
of these photographs which I've got.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.320
And I'll give you a character interpretation

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.600
of each of the pictures
which I see and you can tell me

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.060
whether you agree with me or not.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.200
Now he seems to me
to be a happy-go-lucky fellow,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.739
very nice as a friend to
go away on a holiday with.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.965
Perhaps a little lightweight
in terms of reliability and so on

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:08.040
but certainly fun
to be with as a friend.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.940
Now he on the other hand

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.260
and sex discrimination apart I think of
all teddy bears as being 'he's.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.380
Are there any she bears in the hall?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.200
Well you see a very very small number.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.420
The sex ratio amongst
bears must be such

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.320
as to put the the continuance of
the species into grave jeopardy.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.500
This is a this is a bear of entirely
different ilk.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.680
I always imagined him
to be a master butcher

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.440
in a small provincial town.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.420
A member of the Town Council,
an alderman maybe,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.840
Very reliable, not by any means
unconscious of his own importance

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.660
in his own world,
in the scheme of things

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.580
but a really solid,
and possibly stolid, citizen

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.540
of this small town.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.900
He on the other hand I think
is a bit naive.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.280
he hasn't been around a great deal

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.960
I wouldn't give much for his IQ

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.120
but maybe as he grows up
he will he will learn

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.680
the ways of the world a bit a bit better.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.940
He is just rude.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.660
And the last one
I've got a picture of

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.460
seems to me to be a very dangerous
sort of bear.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.160
Very headstrong, I always think
of him as my mafia bear

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.540
I don't think he's actually bright enough
to be in any sense

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.020
to occupy one of the
upper posts of the Mafia

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.530
but he might be a sort of
local boss of some local cells mafia.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.520
Now I'm going to have a look
at some of the bears

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.600
who have come to this lecture,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.800
and see if I can do a character analysis
of some of these.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.660
Could you just move over bear,
so that I can sit down.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.360
Right here this one here looks to me
like a quite an old fellow.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.120
I think he has a very definite
sense of humour,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.220
you can see this by the set of his eyes.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.940
Slightly wry smile on his face on
all the time.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.060
I think he's quite an old bear
and he's already seen life quite a lot

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.936
and I understand from his owner
he is in fact fifteen years old

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.000
so he has lived in the
family for a long time

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.880
I would have thought he was great fun
to have in a family

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.060
and that he's seen it all and
he knows it all.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.120
Now I've got another one here
and this one actually I'm informed

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.480
has signals from the interior.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.040
[BEAR MAKES GROWLING NOISE]

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.040
[BEAR MAKES GROWLING NOISE]

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.900
[BEAR MAKES GROWLING NOISE]

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.040
I think it's just as well that the ones
which I've been measuring on some of you

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.800
have had not to be elicited by
quite such a complicated method

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.440
Now he seems to me to be different sort of bear at all

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.040
I think he likes his gin

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.100
And I can just just imagine
him going along to the local,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.500
and with one foot up on the bar
holding forth on his experiences

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.960
when he was in India
to all the other admiring bears.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.900
And this is my last one, 
perhaps here, I'll have this one here.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.460
Now he looks to me really like
rather a stubborn bear.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.100
I would hate to change
his mind about anything.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.640
Stubborn and maybe narrow-minded too.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.800
But I would have thought
because of his stubbornness

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.000
and steadfastness,
he could be great comfort to a child

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.900
was perhaps a little
frightened of the dark,

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.740
and wanted somebody stout
and steadfast to keep company with.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.500
Now just for small fee, I would do
character analysis on any teddy bears

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.900
which might be submitted to me.
