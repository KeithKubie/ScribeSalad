RICHARD DOLAN: August 25,
1951, in Lubbock, Texas.

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:14.264
In the middle of the evening,
a lot of witnesses saw this.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:17.058
Some of the key witnesses
were these professors

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.519
at Texas Technical
College, and they

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.771
see this pattern of lights.

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:26.025
It's like bluish-green, and it's
second a boomerang formation,

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.862
going right over them, silently.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.449
And they are
astonished by what they

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.702
see there's no other way to put
this it just blew their minds.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.663
The Lubbock case was
unusual because of the caliber

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:42.250
of the witnesses and their
academic credentials,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.796
and I believe that's why the
case remained so prominent

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.548
in the [inaudible].

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:52.677
Fortunately, they were
photographed by a young man

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:56.639
named Carl Hart, who actually
took a series of photographs

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.018
that are very interesting and
have been studied quite a lot

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:03.146
by photo analysts
and UFO researchers.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:06.858
Edward Ruppelt was brought in
to what was then called Project

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:12.280
Grudge in 1951, and they
come up with this explanation

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.325
that these lights were birds.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.119
Late at night, getting
reflection off the underside

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.663
of their bellies by the
types of street lights,

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:24.334
or the lights that were made
in the city at the time.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.712
The problem with that is
that there were many observers,

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.298
and they had seen birds before.

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:35.011
So the idea that those were
simply a flock of birds really

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.138
isn't a good explanation.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:40.016
It could have been under
certain circumstances,

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:45.104
but in that particular setting,
it does not explain the data.
