00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.719
Alright. So i like this one, if you had to pick one

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.450
differential equation as the one that advance the study of physics the

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.720
most, which one would you pick?

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.560
Hamilton's equation for Classical Mechanics, Maxwell's

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.340
for Electrodynamics, Schrodinger equation for Quantum

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.405
Mechanics, Einstein Field Equations, or something else?

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:19.510
&gt;&gt; That's like asking me to choose between my children. I mean,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.910
they're not my children but that is like, they're all remarkable structures.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.235
Which one has changed the, the physics the most? Go back

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:30.250
[LAUGH]

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.356
give them to me again.

00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:32.110
&gt;&gt; Hamilton.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.750
&gt;&gt; Okay, so Hamilton's equations are the basic equations of classical

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.510
mechanics. They tell you how classical

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.910
mechanical systems. They have a predictive

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.590
equations for how particles move, or how anything changes with time. Obviously

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.750
they have had a enormous impact on Physics. And the impact

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.710
covers every area of physics, every area. They're

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.920
there in quantum mechanics, they're there in classical

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.876
mechanics, they're there in quantum field theory, they're

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:06.312
every where. Okay, what was the next one?

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:08.992
&gt;&gt; Next one is Maxwell's equations

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:11.030
&gt;&gt; Alright, Maxwell's equations are a little

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.480
more special. They're a little more special,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.070
they have to do with a specific

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.631
class of phenomenon. Electricity and magnetism, electromagna-, electromagnetic

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:24.110
fields. So they're a little bit narrower,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.570
but on the other hand, they did something

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.380
remarkable. They taught us what light is. Up

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.030
until Maxwell's equations, nobody knew what light was.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.940
So how do you compare something like Maxwell's

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.510
equations with. that other fellow, Hamilton's equations. Which

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.460
one is more important? It's a matter of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.650
taste. Do you think explaining light was more

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.890
important or less important than having a framework for, in

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.970
a sense, all of physics? It's a matter of taste.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.186
&gt;&gt; I like those t shirts that have the Maxwell's equation.

00:01:57.186 --> 00:01:57.834
&gt;&gt; Have the Maxwell's equation.

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:58.510
&gt;&gt; Let there be light.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.572
&gt;&gt; What was the third one?

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:03.868
&gt;&gt; next was Schrodinger's equation.

00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:07.950
&gt;&gt; Okay so Schrodinger's equation there, Schrodinger's equation

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.750
has different meanings to sometimes the physicists It

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.830
can mean a very general kind of equation

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.470
which tells you how the quantum state of a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.300
system changes with time. Or it can mean the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.460
very specific equation that Schrodinger wrote down. The very

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.710
specific equation that SchrÃ¶dinger wrote down had to with

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.180
again a special class of phenomena, motion of a

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.100
particle, quantum mechanical motion of a particle. But there's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.960
a, there's a generalization of it. There's a generalization

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.780
of it that has to do with how any quantum system behaves. In the sense it's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.730
as broad and as important as Maxwell's sorry,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.740
Hamilton's equations. It's, it is the quantum mechanics.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.140
What Hamilton's equations were to classical mechanics. So

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.260
extremely important. But I think in the end

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.342
you're going to have a hard time getting me to say I favor one over the other.

00:03:01.342 --> 00:03:03.196
&gt;&gt; What about what about the

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:04.320
field equations?

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.834
&gt;&gt; The Einstein field equations. Yes,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.614
They of course are the sort of

00:03:12.614 --> 00:03:17.230
quintessential deep, deep, equations about what space and

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.620
time are. They're like Maxwell's equations in

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.745
that they govern a special class of phenomena,

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:28.300
gravity, in this case. But, they're more

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.210
than that. They're telling us something extremely deep

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.690
about the nature of space and time, that it's curved, that it it that the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.370
geometry of space and time is not what Euclid thought it was. And how that

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.140
geometry responds to matter. So again its you, you certainly

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.034
picked what I would say are the four most important deepest favorite

00:03:56.034 --> 00:04:00.996
equations of a theoretical physicist for sure

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.080
I, I am going to refuse to pick between them. There are four of

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.280
them. I have four children, and never would I pick between my four children.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.860
[LAUGH]

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.590
&gt;&gt; When we get a theory that describes the encompasses all

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.895
of this, is it going to be described with a differential equation?

00:04:15.895 --> 00:04:19.750
&gt;&gt; Oh boy. Is it going to, is the final theory going to be

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.480
described by a differential equation? Okay. So

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.540
there're a lot of people And I'm not

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.010
going to place right now. There are a lot of people who think the

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.210
world is really discreet. Space and time

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.780
might be discreet. Comes in little elementary steps.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.610
If that's the case, then at that

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.500
level, at that, the smallest possible distances in the world. It might

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.570
mean that the mathematics of it is discrete mathematics, the mathematics of

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.730
little steps, indivisual, indivisible steps, and

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.860
not smooth continuous evolution. If that's the case,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.344
no, it won't be described by differential equations, but we don't know.

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:09.920
If, if I knew the answer to that, I would publish it.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.091
&gt;&gt; As in this classic model, the model phenomena, discretely. &gt;&gt;Yes.

00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:15.582
&gt;&gt; You have even with the underlaying assumptions that it's continued.

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:16.028
&gt;&gt; Exactly

00:05:16.028 --> 00:05:17.370
&gt;&gt; For the computer programs I'll have to

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.395
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:22.930
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so see that, that in many cases it really is not possible

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.925
to tell Whether a certain equation is

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:30.030
describing something which is truly continuous or whether

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.080
it's describing some discrete phenomena where the little steps occur fast enough

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.670
and one after another, too fast to be able to see. Okay, so we don't know what

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.580
the final theory of nature will be
