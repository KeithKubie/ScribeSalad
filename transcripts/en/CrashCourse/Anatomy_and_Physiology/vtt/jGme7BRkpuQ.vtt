00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
You know, we’ve been talking about a lot
of serious stuff here lately.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.200
Heart failure. Respiratory gas exchange. People
with holes in their stomachs.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.220
Nachos.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.850
Some might say I’ve even been flaunting
my ability to eat, digest, and enjoy a plate

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.540
of chips and melted cheese.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.199
And I wouldn't blame them if they did, because
sadly, nachos aren’t for everyone.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.609
In fact, I can safely say nachos are really
only a good idea for about a third of humans.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.099
For the rest, what may start as a party in
your mouth will surely end in gastric distress.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.929
Such is the fate of the lactose intolerant.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.570
Lactose is basically milk-sugar that can only
be digested with the help of a special intestinal

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.310
enzyme -- lactase -- which many adults do
not produce enough of.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.760
In fact, way back in the day, none of us did,
until about 7500 years ago, when a particularly

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.590
handy genetic mutation popped up in central
Europe.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.480
This so-called lactase persistence trait probably
spread as Neolithic groups trekked north and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.840
west through Europe. Today nearly 90 percent
of adult Britons and Scandinavians can chug

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.820
all the milk they want, whereas down toward
the Mediterranean, probably less than 40 percent

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.549
have lactase persistence, and fewer than ten
percent in Africa and Asia.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.719
Now technically, a lactose intolerant person
can still consume dairy at their own risk,

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.590
but since their own bodies can’t break down
lactose, the job is left to the three-pound

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.389
bacteria farm living in their large intestines
-- bacteria that try their hardest to make

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:23.429
something of those milk sugars, the results
of which are gas, and bloating, and diarrhea.

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.679
So, it turns out, nachos aren’t just a good
way to talk about how the digestive system

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.160
works, they’re also a good way to talk about
when it doesn’t.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.860
Remember how the stomach is great at obliterating
matter, but not so hot when it comes to actually

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.219
chemically digesting stuff, or really absorbing
much of anything?

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.109
You might say the stomach lacks subtlety.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.429
But luckily, it’s got friends in low places,
and the small intestine is more than happy

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.959
to pick up the slack and provide a cozy environment
where your food is at long last disassembled

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.709
and absorbed by your cells.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.090
Now there’s a lot of mechanical action and
peristalsis going on here, but there’s also

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.880
a ton of chemical digesting too.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.890
And while homebrewed intestinal juices help
digest the chyme that your stomach turns food

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.640
into, the real power actually comes from the outside
helpers -- the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.050
Now, the small intestine is called “small”
not because it’s short but because it’s

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.210
about half the diameter of the large intestine
-- the thing is actually like 6 or 7 meters long.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.440
Not only that, but whole deal is lined with epithelial 
tissue that has more folds than an origami octopus.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.360
These folds are lined with tiny hair-like
villi and even tinier microvilli, which create

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.900
a truly impressive surface area -- large enough that,
if it were unfolded, it would cover a tennis court.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.180
It’s this massive surface area, and the
countless capillaries just beneath it, that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.000
make the small intestine such a champion absorber
of nutrients.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.560
It shares the same four tissue layers seen throughout
the GI tract, and has three main subdivisions:

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.840
Straight outta the stomach and snuggled around
the pancreas, you’ve got the relatively

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.850
short and mostly immovable duodenum, which
is where most of the chemical digestion occurs.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.550
The middle section is the jejunum, where most
of the absorption takes place.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.460
And finally at the end, running into the large
intestine is the ileum, where important vitamins

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.980
like A, B12, E, D, and K are absorbed.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.700
But the duodenum is what you might call the
business end of the small intestine. It receives

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.190
chyme and gastric juices from the stomach
through the pyloric sphincter, but it also

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.080
imports bile from the liver and gallbladder,
enzymes from the pancreas, and creates its

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.200
own homegrown mix of enzymes.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.550
Some of the imported enzymes eventually pass
through your system on the wave of gooey chyme.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.710
But other enzymes are actually bound to cell
membranes in the intestinal mucosal layer,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.330
and they’re reusable.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.090
Enzymes are proteins, and proteins are expensive.
So these compounds -- known as brush border

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.010
enzymes -- can just sit around and process
food as it passes by, without your body having

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.940
to make new ones.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.110
And the lactase that so many of us don’t
have, is one of these.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.280
Now, the duodenum communicates with the stomach
in the last phase of gastric regulation that

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.790
we talked about in the last episode -- the
intestinal phase.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.760
This is where the duodenum lets the stomach
know, with hormones and nerve signals, when

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.510
and how much chyme to release so it doesn’t
get overwhelmed all at once.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.630
It’s also where stuff like bicarbonate from
the pancreas gets dumped, to help neutralize

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.959
the stomach acid before it burns a hole in
your guts.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.280
And this brings me to your crucial accessory
organs -- the things apart from the alimentary

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.690
canal that never come in contact with ingested
material, but still play an essential role

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.740
in digestion.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.780
First up: the liver.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.540
The liver is a massive, fatty, four-lobed,
and very important organ. It lives directly

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.710
under your diaphragm and -- fun fact -- it
can actually fully regenerate itself after

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.200
an injury or surgery, with as little 25 percent
of its original tissue.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.820
The liver serves tons of critical metabolic
and regulatory roles that we don’t have

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.440
time to get into right now, but its main role
in the digestive system is to make bile.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.600
Bile is the missing ingredient your body needs
to attack fatty foods, which is a tricky business.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.750
In part, that’s because fat isn’t water
soluble, and since your insides are mostly

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.260
water, fats will clump together, becoming
hard to digest.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.310
To keep fat from clumping, you need an emulsifier,
so bile comes in to keep big, hydrophobic

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.650
fat molecules from sticking together, which
allows lipid-hungry enzymes to move in and

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.130
break them down into fatty acids and monoglycerides
that you can then digest and absorb.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.090
But while your liver creates the bile, it
gets stored and concentrated in the neighboring

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.980
gallbladder, the thin, green sac cozied up
to the liver.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.570
It gets the signal when chyme slides into
the duodenum, which activates the enteroendocrine

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.820
cells to release a pair of hormones. Those
hormones in turn tell the gallbladder to contract

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.000
and squirt bile through the cystic and bile
ducts into the duodenum.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.750
Another crucial accessory organ is the pancreas,
a gland that looks like a fistful of cottage

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.810
cheese stuffed in a plastic bag.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.190
The pancreas also does lots of important things
for your body, especially related to your

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.600
endocrine system, but for our purposes today,
just know that it brews up a powerful enzyme

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.940
cocktail that is also triggered by those same
two hormones.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.389
Pancreatic juice is kinda like the Neapolitan
Ice Cream of bodily secretions -- it’s like

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.949
everybody’s favorite ingredients all put
together, and when you mix them, the result

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.330
is especially powerful.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.100
You’ve got trypsin and peptidase in there,
which break proteins down into amino acids,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.740
and you have lipases that turn triglycerides
into fatty acids and glycerol.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.360
Amylase, meanwhile, reduces carbs to glucose
and fructose, and nuclease busts the nucleic

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.199
acids that are in DNA and RNA into nucleotides.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.910
Once all of those macromolecules have been
dissembled into their monomers, the small

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.510
intestine’s epithelial cells can finally
absorb and transport them through your capillaries

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.449
and into the bloodstream, where they can travel
to pretty much to any cell in your body, and

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.120
be used to build collagen, or store fat, or
replace dying cells.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.120
The true purpose behind all the eating that
you do.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.280
So! Once the chyme has worked through your
small intestine, it passes through the ileocecal

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.510
valve and hits the cecum, the first part of
the large intestine, where, congratulations,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.949
your food is now officially feces!

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.340
The large intestine -- consisting of the colon,
rectum, and anus -- is relatively short, at

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.050
about one and half meters, and it provides
a nice little frame for the small intestine,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.780
here at the end of the alimentary canal.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.830
By now, your body has sucked up almost all
of the nutrients it can, and is basically

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.330
just pushing indigestible goo around, so the
large intestine doesn’t have a lot of hard

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.020
work to do.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.960
Its main functions are to absorb any remaining
water so you don’t have constant diarrhea,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.680
and to store the rest until it’s ready to
exit the body.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.389
It also plays host to hundreds of species
and trillions of individual gut bacteria,

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.199
which digest whatever chyme your body couldn’t,
releasing essential B and K vitamins, and

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.510
some short fatty acids, which the large intestine
can still absorb.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.960
In doing so, they also produce gases like
carbon dioxide and methane, sulfurous compounds

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.740
called mercaptans, and hydrogen sulfide, which
eventually...pass.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.110
OK, I know what you’re thinking now, you’re
like, “Hank, what’s up with the nachos?”

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.120
“Surely you’re not just gonna to bring
up nachos at the beginning of the episode

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.460
without explaining how they can turn on you?!”

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.360
Well, I’ve never disappointed you before,
have I?

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.520
Those of us who can’t produce the enzyme
lactase in our small intestine simply let

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.370
milk and cheese pass through the organ untouched,
leaving the digestion to these bacteria in

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.479
the large intestine.

00:07:55.479 --> 00:08:00.460
And those bacteria possess about 1000 different
kinds of enzymes of their own, including lactase.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.600
But their digestion process produces a whole
lotta extra gas, which is why nachos may leave

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.430
me feeling cheesy and satisfied, but leave
you bloated, and crampy, and malodorous.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.910
But enough farting around, let’s wrap up
this fantastic journey.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.020
Fecal matter keeps moving through in a couple
of different ways. Slow, segmenting haustral

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.509
contractions keep mixing and chopping it in
the large intestine, occurring every 30 minutes

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:24.040
or so and lasting about a minute.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.960
But most people also experience a few mass
peristalsis movements a day -- big, intense

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.390
contractions that clear out a large swath
of intestine at once, pushing feces into the

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.649
rectum. These often occur just after eating.

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:40.560
Once in the rectum, your poop stimulates stretch
receptors that tap the parasympathetic defecation

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:45.380
reflex, which signals the colon and rectum
to contract, and the internal anal sphincter

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.040
to relax.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.180
This forces the poop into the anal canal,
sending more messages to the brain that allow

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.430
us to decide whether to voluntarily open the
external anal sphincter, or just hold it for

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.680
a minute while we find a bathroom.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.230
And when that moment arrives, what was once
food says farewell to the alimentary canal

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.000
that temporarily held it, and passes back
into the light of day.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.420
And that, my friends, is the end of your digestive
system. Pretty cool, right?

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.880
And so it’s all over, but that doesn’t
mean you should forget about what we learned

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.760
today, which is that the small intestine performs
most of your chemical digestion in the duodenum,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.750
while accessory organs including the liver,
gallbladder, and pancreas contribute enzymes

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.270
that all but finish the job. Then your large
intestine, which is actually shorter than

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.240
the small intestine, tries to extract the
last bit of nutrition, including the occasional

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.910
attempt to turn nachos into energy, which
for most humans, ends in gassy failure.
