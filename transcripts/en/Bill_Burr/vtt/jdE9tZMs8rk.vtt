00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.670

And Ah,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.930
just checking in on you.
Um,
we're recording this thing.

4
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:14.100
I don't know where am I going to put this on?

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.740
I might just do a special episode because I'm now I'm already thinking that

6
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:17.880
people are going to be like,
well,

7
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.350
how come you didn't talk any Stanley Cup final fuck it.
Action here.

8
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:25.530
I have with me one of my,
uh,
one of my favorite people.

9
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.070
What am I a great friends in this business since the late fucking nineties.

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.340
He has a new documentary coming out on the all things comedy network about the

11
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:39.300
amazing Jonathan called always amazing,
the wonderful,

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
talented Mr Steve Byrne.
Thank you.
Thank you William.
He liked that.

13
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:47.300
Can you follow that intro?
Did I go too big?
I think you,

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.310
you hit the sweet spot and I got to tell you I was sick about this all the way

15
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.360
over.
You are part of the two greatest,
um,

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.950
events I ever had cause I grew up playing hockey and all right.

17
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.640
You and I played.
You can actually play.
I'm fun to skate around.

18
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:03.510
I make you look good out.

19
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:08.410
This play we played at the United Center together in Chicago.
Yeah.

20
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.010
Uh,
and we had the whole rink to ourselves.

21
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.330
And then you and I got to play in the Mario Lemieux fantasy camp.
Well,

22
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:19.350
back up Vince Vaughn set that up.
The Big Chicago guy.
Yeah.

23
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.410
And I'm in business with Vince doing F is for family short because of you

24
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.060
because you introduced me to Vince while I remember.
He um,

25
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.970
oh God.
I remember one.
I was just like,
when I,
I kind of moved,

26
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.500
I think you had just moved her something.
Yeah.

27
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.820
And it was down the Improv and he had come out to see your set and you actually,

28
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.100
most la people would try to hoard that connection.
Be like this,

29
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.940
this a list.
Movie Star is mine.
Right.
And you were like,
hey man,

30
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:53.640
I'm doing a spot tonight if you want to come down on the show.
You asked,

31
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.670
because I wasn't even on that show.
You said,
I'm bringing Vince down.

32
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:00.420
You should meet him and say hello.
Yeah.
And,
uh,

33
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.320
through that I took a meeting with them and that's when I was totally

34
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:05.340
disgruntled is weird.

35
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:08.940
I had moved to La and I was completely over Hollywood because I can never get

36
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:12.400
anything.
And you had just moved here?
Yes.
Yeah,
it did that,
that,

37
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.070
that didn't take too long.
That's me.
That's me.
No,
no,
no.
I was already over it.

38
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.791
I was just like,

39
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:21.210
I'm coming out here and I'm just going to do parts on other people's things

40
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.060
because my things do not get picked up.

41
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.590
And then you get into a deal and then they just take you,
they tee it,

42
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.020
takes you out of play.
Oh,
he's in a deal.
We can't,
he,
you know,

43
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:35.250
we would be second position to his project and no one wants to be that.

44
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:39.450
So then your pilot wouldn't get picked up.
You weren't in anything and you just,

45
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.930
you were another year older.
So I was just like,
fuck this.
Yeah.

46
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.620
So that's when I took the meeting with Vince's company with Peter Billingsley

47
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.530
and he goes,
what do you got?
And I go,
nothing.
What do you got?

48
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.660
And he was like,
all right.
I go,
dude,
none of my shit gets picked up.

49
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.350
Everything's considered misogynistic,
homophobic,

50
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:02.970
fucking else phobic or saying it.
They're probably going Ding,
Ding,
Ding.
Yeah.

51
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.560
Don't,
don't,
don't owe them.
You're in the club.
Yeah.

52
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.620
And it's just like every fucking thing that I do is like was labeled.

53
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:13.340
So unless I had a,
it's gotten to the point,
this is pre me too.
Sure.

54
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.260
Yeah.
It was like,

55
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.580
well what if I had a guy come out with his junk tucked between his thighs?

56
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.810
Okay.
We like that it was so fucking ready.

57
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:24.490
And this whole fucking thing that they say women don't have power in Hollywood.

58
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.350
I've,
I,
I never met him.
I met one or two male casting directors.

59
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:32.470
I never got to that level of,
you know,

60
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:35.620
the Harvey Weinstein Guy Wanting to watch you take a shower,

61
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.550
whatever fucking level that is.
I know what you watch him take a shower.

62
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.950
I never got to that level.
I never did,

63
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.270
<v 1>did cast him directly.
I'll tell you this,
this,
when I first moved here,</v>

64
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:48.990
I never forgot this cause I think you and I somewhat have a,
an Irish temper,

65
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.110
but I got,
Oh yeah dude,
I'm going to therapy for my temper right after this.

66
00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:56.310
I got a Korean and Irish too.
So the,
you know,
the Koreans are the Irish of Asia.

67
00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:58.820
I don't know if you've used that rail.
Yeah,
cause you know it's like it's,

68
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.060
we love Whiskey,
we love fighting,
we love,
we love booze and we love storytelling.

69
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:06.720
Where the funnest ones to hang out with in Asia,
we love potatoes and cabbage.

70
00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:07.750
We hate the sun.
It's like,
yeah,

71
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.480
<v 0>all the other Chinese and Japanese people agree with this.</v>

72
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.900
Do they have to give it up to the Koreans?
Yeah,
yeah.
K Pop.
Yeah.

73
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.960
<v 1>Tanners are always the big ones there.
You know,
it's all the Asian stars.</v>

74
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.650
Or would you say you have the most flavor as the young kid saying,

75
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.850
I can't even say that you Q can never like even like Timberland,

76
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:29.640
I cringe when I have to say that.
It's like,
can I just say Timberland?

77
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.500
But anyways,
when I first moved here,
I was driving to this audition and this,

78
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.070
this fucking bitch in this Mercedes would not like,

79
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.040
like let me through whatever.
And uh,

80
00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:44.580
finally we get to this light and she's jockeying for position.

81
00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:46.710
I'm jocking for position where get off the four or five.

82
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.770
We'd go to this light and I just wrote mine.
I went on,
I'm like,
fuck you,

83
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:54.510
you fucking page.
And she goes,
fuck you,
you music shit.

84
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.690
So we're 10 minutes later,
I,

85
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.080
I sign in the audition I signed and everything.
I opened up the door,

86
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.580
she's the cast and director.
Oh No,
you'll put up the door.

87
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:09.360
I just go have a good day.
And I just shut the door,
got my car.
And I was like,

88
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.150
did she recognize you?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
She knew.
She knew.

89
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:14.580
And I knew as soon as I open it,
I just like,
I just looked at it,
I was like,

90
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.200
fuck it.

91
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.841
<v 0>Yeah.
But she knows something.</v>

92
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.210
I love that you owned it and didn't fucking do the audition.

93
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.850
Cause my dumb ass would've done,
it will be like,
hi.

94
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.160
Then I would've,
I would've gone through with the wacky next door neighbor,

95
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.350
hey dude,
talk more about,
uh,

96
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.010
some of the like Asia stuff because it's never covered over here.

97
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:36.420
And I did some gigs over there and was like fascinated where I literally felt I

98
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:40.170
went to an alternate universe where you go over there,
there's first of all,

99
00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:41.430
there's way more people.

100
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.700
It's just entirely different part of the world that is doing just fine without

101
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:50.730
fucking western culture or any of that.
And when we never talked,

102
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:54.240
I go over their own airlines on doctors,
the whole fucking thing.
Like you,

103
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.550
you grow up like reading our history and you feel like in than less,
you know,

104
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:00.460
Europeans or yeah.

105
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.640
Or are white Americans or has somehow have their hand on it.

106
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.940
It either doesn't count or it won't work or whatever.

107
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:10.190
And I went over there and I fucking loved it.

108
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:12.890
I felt like I went to another planet.
Yeah.
It just,

109
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.270
the cars are a little smaller and the vending machines are a little shorter,

110
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:19.790
but they get,
but you go over there,
you know what,

111
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.380
this is like the perfect example,
right.

112
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.730
So Hollywood's been around forever and then they have crazy rich Asians.
Right.

113
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.080
And it's celebrated like it's a good movie.
Right,
right.
I don't think it's great.

114
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.720
Like the same way I think black panthers.
It's a good movie.

115
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:35.930
I don't think it's amazing.
It's not right.
That was doing a bit on that.

116
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.140
How it scared White Hollywood was that they nominated for best picture.

117
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.060
It's like all right,
it was good.
He Goes,
God,

118
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.890
I don't think that's up there with the godfather and raging bull.
It's no,
no.

119
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.860
So this,
this thing comes out and everyone was like,
oh my God,
isn't this great?

120
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.700
Didn't we do a good job?

121
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.120
And then you know where that movie bombed fucking China cause they're like,

122
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.780
yeah guys,
we do this shit all the time and have incredible movies over there.

123
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.430
Yeah.
Cause Bobby Lee,

124
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.750
Bobby Lee told me like I had to stop asking Bobby because Bobby League,

125
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.990
just watch his car.
He's the one that told me about old boy.
Old Boy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

126
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.440
And then the audition audition's Cree.
It's,
it's disgusting.
Itchy,

127
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.540
the killer and all that stuff.

128
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.380
It's almost not scary as much as it's just disturbing and yeah,

129
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:18.230
like you can't kind of shake it,
so don't,
if you're already fucked up,

130
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.940
they're there.
They're going to,
people listening are going to watch him play.
Um,

131
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.350
but this is how my little understand agent,

132
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.360
it seems like Japan is the white people of Asia where they feel like they are at

133
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.860
the top of the food chain and they are,
the,

134
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.480
everything that they do is the greatest.

135
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.050
And they tried to take everybody over but,

136
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:38.450
and that also seems because of them geographically,

137
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.360
they're on an island and they're kind of like,

138
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.710
they've kind of like they can't grow out anymore.
Yeah.

139
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.640
What's fucked up about them as do you know they had a war with Russia last

140
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.920
century in one and when they claim their land,
all the white countries like Nah,

141
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.540
Nah,
Nah,
Nah,
Nah,
give it back.

142
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.860
That's sort of the prequel to them.
Pearl Harbor on all of that.
Like,

143
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.180
cause anytime a white country would do that to another white country,

144
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.780
another way country,
you've got the spoils of victory and they won.
Yeah.

145
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.540
It was like they played for fucking USC with Pete Carroll and like,
Nah.

146
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.820
Gimme gimme gimme that Heisman trophy back.
Give me,

147
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.800
what are you talking about dude?
I fucking,
I ran photos.
Yards.
Nah,
Nah,
no,
no,
no.

148
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.910
Well I think like Koreans are,
cause I,
you know China like,

149
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.830
like we,
we think like,
you know,

150
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.920
we spent time in New York City obviously and you think Manhattan,
New York City,

151
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:34.310
you know,
if you can make it there,
you can make it,
you go to any of these cities,

152
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:37.820
like you go to Beijing,
you go to,
you know anything and it's like,

153
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.810
it absolutely dwarfs Manhattan.
Manhattan is absolutely,

154
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.800
it's almost like Manhattan becomes like a block comparatively to these other

155
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:47.240
cities.
So Hong Kong was like that.

156
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.420
You always driving to the airport and I was seeing clusters of Manhattan.

157
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:53.480
It seemed like that were apartment complexes.
Not Dude,
let's,

158
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.380
let's be honest here.

159
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.840
It's an environmental disaster over there as far as how many fucking people

160
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:01.860
there are.
Of course.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Great people.
Not saying anything bad about him,

161
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.790
but that you need to get rid of.
Like,
I don't know how many it's got.

162
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:08.190
The numbers got to come way the fuck down.

163
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.370
This is like when they had the Olympics over there and like China,

164
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:13.260
like nobody could move for three days.

165
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.940
So all the dust would settle me down and then they shut.

166
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.760
If they sent out those rockets to,

167
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.800
to like disperse the clouds so that you can have sun to,

168
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.220
to get rid of all the smog.
I was over there.
It was crazy.
Yeah.
And this is,

169
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.630
that's what,
well that's what the fuck.

170
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.070
But he hadn't spoken and leaving the car running and just like that Papa,
Papa,

171
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.830
Papa 70th truck,
you know the guy's smoking and stuff.

172
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:36.510
That's what it's gotta be a better way I think.

173
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:39.120
Eventually I think they're up against it and they're gonna figure it out.

174
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.960
That's what I'm hoping they're going to be forced to at some point.
Yeah.

175
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:45.150
I think at that point where if nobody couldn't lift,

176
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:49.260
you have to shut down a host city just to get a clear day.
You would think.
Now,

177
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.400
this is the thing that I heard about.

178
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:54.360
The reason I'll China's population got the way it was was because Chapin kept

179
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.700
attacking them and then whoever their leader was,

180
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.390
his whole thing is we're going to have so many people that no matter how many

181
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:01.021
you attack,

182
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:03.600
there's always going to be another 100,000 coming over the hill like this.

183
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.850
Never ending Braveheart.
And I was there just like fucking,

184
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:10.440
they're way too supremacy.
Like you can't fuck with us.
Now let me,

185
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.490
is there any truth to that?
And this is so ridiculous that you're American,

186
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:17.910
but because you have your half Asian,
but I feel like,
you know,

187
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:21.010
all of this stuff didn't go to Kent State University,

188
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.530
his escort in Ohio and studied like the history of Asia.
I,

189
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:29.160
I barely know what I know about my folks.
You know you went to school?

190
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.850
I went to Kent State.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Do they have like a little memorial shrine?

191
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:37.440
That's why those kids got a get shot,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was there for,
I forget,

192
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.660
I think it was like the 25th anniversary.
I don't know.

193
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.360
What did you ever have the balls to protest anything on that campus?

194
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:44.940
Did you just think,
oh no,

195
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.940
but did you feel like it's more like if you fly in this same airline that had a

196
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:49.950
plane crash the day before he like what are the odds?

197
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.820
Like what are the odds the national guard is going to come in and blow away some

198
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:55.590
more students here.
But I got bad luck.

199
00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.270
It would be like the odds are astoundingly incredibly against me.
Why is that?

200
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.940
I think it's,
I remember when you these law,
no,

201
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:04.770
but you will one of those fucking guys,

202
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.720
you do a late night set at the comic strip and everyone would have a tough time.

203
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.170
Yup.
But you somehow would have the crowd with a guy picks up the chair.

204
00:11:14.171 --> 00:11:16.650
I remember he threw it and hit you in the head.
You got cut.

205
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.700
Cause I remember they put staples in your head,
shot at the comic strip.
Make,

206
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:23.810
make it seem like you had stitches.
Yeah.
Then then,
uh,

207
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.200
somebody wrote underneath my head shot had said the chairman,
the chairman,

208
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.950
Steve Byrne.
Uh,
I don't know.
I remember that night I was at the,
uh,

209
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.360
I was at the comic strip and this is like another thing I do that's probably

210
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:40.770
stupid,
but I take the onus always on myself,
right.
And I always say,

211
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:42.750
what could I have done better that situation.

212
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:45.060
And what happened was I was my birthday dude,

213
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.290
it was my birthday and I'd worked on this spin.
I was so excited to,
you know,

214
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:51.480
it was like that at that time of your life where you just like,

215
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.000
I just got to try this bit out.
Right.
And what did the comic Strip,
11 o'clock,

216
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:55.834
late night.

217
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.200
And there's all these like Jersey moocs and they stand up and they were,

218
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.530
they're debating,
they're check while I'm doing my set in front of 10 people.

219
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.130
Yeah.
And uh,
I go,
guys,
come on.
Can we just keep it down?

220
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:08.470
I just want to go through this.
And the guy goes,

221
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:12.340
what are you going to do some Kung Fu?
Me,
I,
okay,
okay.
Here.
Oh,
we went,
ratio,

222
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:17.170
you went racial.
And then early I was like,
Yup.
At earlier,
it's always racial.
And,

223
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.290
and then I go,
well,
thank God the,
uh,

224
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:23.920
the Lincoln tunnel is open 24 hours and then his girlfriend starts piping in and

225
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.710
they're young by the lucky chance shit at me.
And Jackie Chan there,

226
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:27.700
call me Jackie Chan.

227
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.660
This is when I had my lego head hair when it was just grown out.

228
00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:35.950
And you guys were shitting on me at the cellar for this bouffant of like Asian

229
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.960
hair.
You were kind of asking for it.
I was asking for.
It was like,
yeah,

230
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.660
might as well go on stage.
Dressed like a leprechaun.
I mean,

231
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.160
so this girl starts piping up and she goes,

232
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.190
she said something about me being a I g I just go,
well,

233
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.270
somebody did somebody tell that cut to shut up.
I knew this.
And then this,

234
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.960
this barstool gets chucked,
Whiz Bang,
hit the back of my head.

235
00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.880
Just felt like hot tea running down my neck and eight staples in the back of my

236
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:05.110
head later.
And the cops came to visit me at the Ho at the hospital.
They're like,

237
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:10.000
you should press charges.
And I was like,
I did it.
I should've,

238
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.670
I should've handled it better.
It's my own amazing though.

239
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.040
Like how different that time,
what year was that?

240
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.160
That was probably 99 2000 how different the world is now where they would be all

241
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:25.180
of this video.
Oh yeah.
You would be considered this victim of racial hate.

242
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:26.760
I hate crime.
Yeah,
you,

243
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.460
your Twitter followers would have gone up by half a million.
You would be like,

244
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.740
you'd be an arena act.
But now I'm an outcast.

245
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:35.710
I get then back then,

246
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.240
back then it was just like if you were Asian,
you had to take the fact that,

247
00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:43.690
Hey Jackie Chair,
why don't you go fucking go run with the Rick Shaw?

248
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.290
You had to deal with all that and then,
and then,
and they throw a stool at you.

249
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.720
What you want to know this,
this happened at the comedy store.

250
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.030
It's always racial with the common story.

251
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.400
Remember the dark days at the store and nobody was going,

252
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.170
I don't know if you had been,
oh yeah,
no and,
and I gotta tell you something.

253
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.180
I'm all like,
cause everybody says New York.
If I can make it there,

254
00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:04.940
it can make it anywhere.
Yeah.
La is infinitely harder.
Cause you know,

255
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.850
the thing about New York was I felt I could escape the business where it was

256
00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:12.400
just like my neighbor was,
you know,
uh,

257
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.160
whatever was his financial bullshit or,

258
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.690
or worked at a gym or like my roommate,
like he,

259
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.780
he was into hockey and fucking worked at the rinks in,
in central park.

260
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:27.490
He was in a completely different fucking world is an Irish immigrant and he's

261
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:29.860
fucking doing construction over here.

262
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.810
It's just everybody is this fucking thing in this thing.

263
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:38.260
And then there was also like the hierarchy where it was like,

264
00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:39.490
as bad as New York was,

265
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.520
I wasn't competing with television and movie stars who were popping in and every

266
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.120
night and they would go in and have nothing to say and burned the light for 90

267
00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.890
fucking minutes as you sat bombing

268
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.590
<v 1>because,
because they had the TV credit,</v>

269
00:14:53.591 --> 00:14:58.591
I W I was at the store and again it was maybe 10 people there and this group of

270
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:02.000
Asian kids gets up and walks out.

271
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.340
As I'm walking onto the stage of being introduced,

272
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.450
and there's this dude in the back with four of his buddies is eating chicken

273
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:11.030
wings.
He brought his own wings in,
right?
[inaudible] he's,

274
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.180
and before I even hit the mic,
he goes,
hey,

275
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:19.040
your friends left funny.
He goes,
your friends left.

276
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.560
And as he says it,
he's eating chicken wings.
He doing that with a fingers,

277
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.310
look in a sauce off and fucking infuriated me.
I go,
you see,

278
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:31.790
you're saying my friends left because I'm Asian and they're Asian.
He goes,
yeah,

279
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:36.050
that's what I said.
I go,
well,
maybe I should go outside and catch up with them.

280
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:40.250
Maybe you should meet me.
He goes,
maybe I will.
So he gets up and I get up and I,

281
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:41.050
you know that,
you know,

282
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.850
the finishes said I didn't even start it item and tell one joke.

283
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.810
I get to the corner,
this is when I was,
I was,

284
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.830
I would get hopped up zero to 60 and I just fucking like drill this guy in the

285
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:54.800
face dropping to the ground and I just started fucking whale on.

286
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.650
Unlike Ralphie and a Christmas story,
I'm fucking beaten the shit out of us.

287
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.290
And this guy,
I didn't know this,

288
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.550
this guy picks up one of those tables in the back,
you know,

289
00:16:02.551 --> 00:16:06.980
I heavy those things are,
he goes to like swing and hit me with this table.

290
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.220
Thank God Bret Ernst saved my life.

291
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:12.980
I'd probably be eating out of a straw in a fucking wheelchair right now.

292
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.220
But he t he tackled the guy and took that guy out and then I think one or two

293
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:21.800
other comics came in and subdued their other friends.

294
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.890
And then they pulled me off the guy and the guy called the cops the next day and

295
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:28.790
was threatening to sue and everything for what exactly is in a fight.

296
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.690
And then Tommy said,
didn't you make fun of him for being Asian?
He's like,
yeah.

297
00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:35.440
And then he backed down so that,
that kind of happened too.

298
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.620
So that's always like weird ones.
Jesus man.
Yeah.

299
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.260
Well let's talk about your movie,
Steve.

300
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.660
Now I see why you went behind the camera here on this one.

301
00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:49.080
Give yourself a break from these,
uh,
MMA matches.
You had that blip.

302
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.450
I bet on the other end of things too,
but yeah.
Yeah.
Well I remember,
yeah,

303
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:55.340
you will.
You would having a cab drive,

304
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.160
you will get in a steak and cheese and next thing you know you had a broken jaw

305
00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.163
at a broken jaw.
Yeah.

306
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.290
And then they had to shut down Sullivan and son for like six months,
weeks,

307
00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.170
six weeks.
Anybody breaks their jaw.
I go six weeks and athletes,

308
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:07.663
Sidney Crosby broke his jaw.

309
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.930
Actually Sidney Crosby broke his jaw the day I broke my jaw.

310
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.800
And that's how big a penguins fan you are.
That kind of synchronicity.

311
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.210
It's like when women's periods lineup,
it's the same thing.
You and Sidney Crosby,

312
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:23.390
Bluetooth,
we're sinking up.
Yeah,
no,
the film is always amazing.

313
00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:28.100
It's his documentary I did about the amazing Jonathan,
great comic magician.

314
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.490
That was one of the first comics to pop off at comedy central when they did

315
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:35.800
those half hours and they were starting to really get some notoriety.
And Joel,

316
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.130
I saw that guy from way,
way back in the day.
Like he like I the,

317
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.770
I'm such a huge fan of that guy.
And,
uh,

318
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.100
if you never saw the amazing Jonathan,
he,

319
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.320
I felt like he was the first guy who really,
uh,

320
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.770
did that whole thing where he just kind of see the tree.

321
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.230
It wasn't about the trick necessarily was about the trick going bad and,

322
00:17:55.231 --> 00:18:00.231
but he added a whole new like sort of spin to that where he had like the whole

323
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:05.460
rock and roll look and a Freddy Krueger comedy and he looks really like,

324
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.550
he did look like you didn't know what the fuck was going to happen.
I loved him.

325
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:08.971
Yeah.

326
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:12.960
He's definitely like more of a rock star but definitely more of a comedian than

327
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:14.160
a magician.
And you're right.

328
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:18.360
Like everything he did you could almost kind of see it and then sometimes the

329
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.200
trucks would go bad,
but he just didn't give it like,
yeah,

330
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.650
he was just kind of like this makeshift kind of comic on the fly involved in

331
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:30.150
magic.
And I,
he was one of the,
when I,
when I first went on the road,

332
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.840
I did back to back weekends at Charlie Goodnight's back in the day.

333
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.870
And my first week was Brian Regan and the second weekend was he amazing.

334
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.320
Jonathan and I struck up a friendship with him and his road manager,

335
00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:43.860
Joel Osborne,
who's a huge oasis fan and we just bonded over that.

336
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:44.910
So every time I came out here,

337
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.150
my first TV quarter was Beatty's comic view and I crashed at Jonathan's house.

338
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.030
Few of those I did I think two or three.
But so when I think of my first TV set,

339
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:57.990
I think a common view and then celebrating with those guys.
And uh,
you know,

340
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.100
Jonathan went on Vegas headliner and he was given a terminal diagnosis due to

341
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:05.730
cardiomyopathy where it's a degradation of your heart breaking down in his

342
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:10.080
heart's operating I think at like 60 to 50% capacity right now.

343
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:10.920
So wow.

344
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.820
That combined with a lifelong drug addiction and the fact that he's still a drug

345
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:19.380
addict and diabetes compounded upon that,
Jesus was told,
you got,

346
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.510
you got to get your affairs in order.

347
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.490
That's enough to kill Jim Morrison a couple of times.
That's amazing.

348
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.080
He's still going.
Yeah.

349
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:30.290
So he basically retired from comedy and performing and hung it all up and

350
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.130
outlived expectations.

351
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:35.340
I think due to the fact that he's buying stem cells off the black market in

352
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:40.200
Mexico.
And he basically said F,
you know,

353
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:43.680
like a year ago,
two years ago that he wanted to see if he still had it.

354
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:48.210
He was getting tired of waiting around to die.
Can I still,
can I still perform?

355
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.170
Do I still have this?

356
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:52.680
And he made a return to stage and did three shows and I thought that's such a

357
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:54.690
great impetus to,
to,

358
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:58.140
to follow and what a great trajectory cause you get to tell the story of his,

359
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.120
of his,
um,
of his career.

360
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:03.300
But the heart can't wait to fucking see this thing.

361
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:08.040
Well the heart and soul of it really is about Joel Osborne.
See when

362
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.351
Jonathan Jonathan's the face of the dock,

363
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:13.710
the heart of the documentary is when he was touring worldwide.

364
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.720
He was like Kinda like a Russell Peters back in the day.

365
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:20.100
He was going everywhere and he met this,
this kid,

366
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:20.851
he's 12 years old.

367
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:24.330
He'd always be backstage and asking for autographs and sneaking in the shows and

368
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.960
you just saw this like desire or you know,

369
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.820
fascination with magic and comedy in this kid,
Joel Osborne.
And so he,

370
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.310
he basically took him under his wing and every year he came back to Australia,

371
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.310
Joe would get a little older and he'd give them a little more responsibility and

372
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:40.590
eventually he was,
he was like,
uh,

373
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:44.580
like his road manager in Australian and publicizing all the events and putting

374
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:45.720
posters up everywhere,

375
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.210
Ma and getting a cut of this and selling the magic kit in Australia.

376
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.400
And eventually when Joel turned 18,
he said,

377
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:53.530
you want to be my road manager in the states?
And Joel said,
yeah.

378
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.810
And eventually Joel,
Joel is a guy that's doing meditation.
He doesn't drink,

379
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:00.250
he doesn't do drugs in this kid.

380
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:04.780
It comes out to Vegas and his negotiating million dollar deals with these

381
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:08.560
casinos and Jonathan's as drug attic and throwing this 18 year old kid in the

382
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:12.700
middle of this crazy fucking scenarios and just trolls.
Like,
you know,

383
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:16.060
he tells me this is beyond a dock,
this is a good movie.
He goes,

384
00:21:16.061 --> 00:21:18.380
you go to the golden nugget and you tell those mother fuckers,

385
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.620
Jonathan wants 2.5 you tell me,

386
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.340
shove it up your fucking ass and walk out and slam the door.
And Jill's like,

387
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.550
I guess so.
And so Joel goes in and,

388
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.680
and Joel's very diplomatic and he got everything Jonathan wanted in a very

389
00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:36.430
serene kind of way and so to people on paper should never be in each other's

390
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:38.710
lives,
developed this great fraternal relationship.

391
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:44.310
And Joel basically became this like caretakers song through a suicide attempt.

392
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:49.210
He saw him through drug addiction and he basically got Jonathan in a great place

393
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:50.920
in his life and eventually said,
okay,

394
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.050
I'm going to go off and become a comedian on my own.

395
00:21:53.051 --> 00:21:58.030
And Joel went to Australia and became a comic and this is about these two

396
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:01.390
reuniting for one last tour and being on stage together.

397
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.660
And this is on all things comedy.
This sounds like it's going to win an award.

398
00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.030
Well,
I,
you know,
we,

399
00:22:06.031 --> 00:22:10.180
we've gone through the gauntlet with this thing and all things comedy and

400
00:22:10.181 --> 00:22:14.500
soapbox had been nothing but kind to us and helps us in terms of two to make a

401
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:17.770
film like this.
It takes a lot of money.
And I did it all out of my own pocket,

402
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.930
quite a bit.
Money,
quite a lot of money in a hole on this thing.
But Soapbox said,

403
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.060
you know,
I talked to the guys at all,
things calmed me,
they said,
hey,

404
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:28.540
maybe we can help you get the finishing funds for this and,
and finish the film.

405
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.960
And so they sweeten it for us with color and sound.
Got It together.

406
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.120
And when we were looking for a distribution partner,

407
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:37.890
we thought let's go to all things comedy and it up perfectly.
So beautiful.

408
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.050
It's just,
I think it's a perfect platform for it given the content.

409
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.440
<v 0>Nice companies think you're a great guy.
Wife's over there.
She had an idea.</v>

410
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.430
She shooting something right now shooting a pilot.
Yeah,
I went over there.

411
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.050
So it was actually a good,

412
00:22:50.051 --> 00:22:53.320
she was doing that cause we had a little dust up last night as we do.

413
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.660
But you know,
it's funny.
He goes right.
Nah,

414
00:22:55.661 --> 00:22:59.230
she came walking in and she was wearing this purple sweater and she looked

415
00:22:59.231 --> 00:23:02.380
beautiful and I was just saying that that's,
that's how we ended up with her.

416
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.250
I could just never break even in my fantasy of breaking up with her.

417
00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:09.400
I would say when she walked away I would get sad and I would still get a,

418
00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:10.660
I'll get back in here,

419
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.820
<v 1>come back.
Oh maybe no,
she's,
you know,
whatever.</v>

420
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:18.800
I was right though last night and I was right.
But you know,

421
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:20.830
that day,
Monday when

422
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.550
<v 0>you're right,
dude,
here come the tears.
Did you then,
if it's gone wrong,
yeah,</v>

423
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.300
I'm probably not a good thing to say.
You know,

424
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.440
in those moments like can you get your emotions in check?
You know those,
yeah.

425
00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.950
It's probably not good to go fucking bud grant head coach on them at that point.

426
00:23:36.951 --> 00:23:41.890
But I am learning things.
Yeah.
I'm learning things.
Um,
so anyway,

427
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:43.580
sorry,
we got off track there.
Um,

428
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.420
how long have you been working on thing cause he sings like it takes the thing

429
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:52.070
take forever.
Well the,
the thing for me is I was doing two at the same time.
I,
I,

430
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:57.020
I basically did this just to do it just to,
I'd never done a doc.

431
00:23:57.021 --> 00:24:00.260
I love docs,
but I knew enough about story narrative that I was like,

432
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.830
I think I could tell the story and I know these guys so well and I know exactly

433
00:24:03.831 --> 00:24:04.760
the story I want to tell.

434
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.960
So when I did the interview is who was six to eight hours with Jonathan and 68

435
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:11.780
hours with Joel.
But I knew exactly what to ask them.
You know,

436
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.550
getting the content was different,

437
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:17.060
getting all the archival footage and converting the archival footage.

438
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.290
That's a whole nother process.

439
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.590
So you was expensive and you were doing this while you were writing that movie?

440
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:25.910
I did a partner for you last year.
Yes.
And that things coming out like,
dude,

441
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:28.250
who's working harder than you?
Well,

442
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.990
no wonder I haven't seen you in the clubs and the men even buried in a writer's

443
00:24:32.991 --> 00:24:35.100
room in,
in the editing.
Huh?
Yeah.
I,

444
00:24:35.101 --> 00:24:39.050
I basically wrote the feature on the road while I was kind of,
Eh,

445
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:42.080
I'd come back Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
edit the documentary,

446
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.820
go on the road Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday and write this feature film just to,

447
00:24:45.821 --> 00:24:50.180
as an exercise to see if I could do it and then do shows at night and do shows

448
00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:54.320
at night because I basically thought I had Sullivan and son on the air.

449
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.820
I was the second Asian American ever to have a sitcom and nobody gives a flying

450
00:24:58.821 --> 00:24:59.270
fuck.

451
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.320
What was the first Margaret Margaret show shows and there wasn't another one.

452
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.220
Yeah.
After that,
after that I was a second one,
then came like fresh off.

453
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.900
Then came Dr Ken and fresh off the boat.

454
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.420
I know what that is cause hers didn't work and they were like,

455
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:16.160
you say yeah to hell with these 10 million billion people.

456
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.240
Exactly.
Oh that is what happened with red heads being leads in movies.

457
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.660
That guy from fucking Nyp de Bleu after one season walked and he did Jayden one

458
00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:29.000
other movie and they didn't do well and they would just like say,

459
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.110
this is why the red head male will never be a lead in a fucking movie.

460
00:25:33.111 --> 00:25:37.270
Ruined everything for you.
He put us on the bench.
Yeah,
he,
he put us,

461
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.860
he put his back into a Richie Cunningham world.

462
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.270
Guy from billions is bringing you back.
Who's that guy?

463
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.760
The dude from billions.
He's red hair.
He's a ginger.
A like a UK actor.

464
00:25:49.761 --> 00:25:53.390
He was in the a band of brothers who's one of the leads and band of brothers.

465
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.030
Hey,
I'm not talking ensemble cast.

466
00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:59.180
I'm saying the fucking film is on your freckled shoulders.

467
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.180
There is a certain,
you know what you know I call,
I call it Hollywood head.

468
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.150
Every once in awhile I'll see that guy has,
he has a Hollywood head,

469
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.820
hits the fucking brown of jet black hair with the cow lick the superman haircuts

470
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.980
.
Look with the square fucking jaw.
If you had blue eyes in that,

471
00:26:16.981 --> 00:26:21.110
that fucking guy is a loser.
I don't care if he can act.
He's a fuck.
He will be.

472
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.720
Listen,
I just want to run my food truck.

473
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.370
I can't tell you dude.
It was so big.

474
00:26:28.371 --> 00:26:31.640
Facial features to those people look weird in real life.
Yeah.

475
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.060
You know what I mean?
They got giant sucking head.
They look fucking don't they?

476
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.790
They look like they were drawn.
They look good on on screen.

477
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.560
You look good on screen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got a big enough head.

478
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.200
I just didn't have the right payment do I can't tell you like back in the day it

479
00:26:45.201 --> 00:26:47.970
was fucking hilarious when I first,
first time I came out here,

480
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.670
this is way back when they had black and white head shots,

481
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:53.090
which I remember you're one with the staples and it was black and white.

482
00:26:53.091 --> 00:26:56.590
So I don't even act like you're fucking not as you said Billy Bird didn't it?
Uh,

483
00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.080
it's I went by William at first.
Yeah.
Then bill,
then Billy,

484
00:27:01.081 --> 00:27:04.020
then back to bill.
I finally just said that like,
cause I was trying to find,

485
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.820
cause everyone was saying like he got a weird last name.

486
00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.890
You've got to think I got sucked into that show Biz thing.

487
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.780
And then finally is just like my is bill,
fuck it.
So,
um,

488
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.130
but I don't mind if you call me bill Billy A.
William,

489
00:27:15.131 --> 00:27:18.030
as long as you fucking call me,
I don't give a shit as long as I'm working,

490
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:22.230
I'm fine.
So,
um,
I ended up like,

491
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.760
I would have like the black,
the black and white headshot.

492
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.630
So with the Moose in the hair in the mid to late nineties,

493
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.100
it looked like I had hair color,
like somewhere between yours and Mirena.

494
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.490
So it looks like brown hair.
So initially on low budget shit,
they,

495
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:36.810
they would try me out,

496
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.360
they would just look at my credits and not look at my tape or whatever.

497
00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:40.500
And they would,
they would say,
okay,

498
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:43.080
maybe we'll give this guy shot at the lead and dude,
you know,

499
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:46.860
prepared three scenes and I would walk in and the second they saw me,

500
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.490
they'd be like,
um,
we're just gonna do the first scene.
And I knew what it was.

501
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.890
It was just like,
I fucking knew it.
I knew it.

502
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.060
It says it was this fucking like,
unwritten rule out here.

503
00:27:57.061 --> 00:28:01.710
But I always found it funny because I've always looked at shit like that going

504
00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:04.750
like I know where I'm going.
I I,
this is just,
you know,

505
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:08.940
like when you back in the day Lucian [inaudible] have enough white guys and then

506
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:11.370
I was just like,
I know what he's saying.
I know what he's saying.
I would just,

507
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.320
I would just be your first headshot I used to see at stand up.
No work.

508
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.510
You never saw my first test shot.
Not your first official one,

509
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.980
but you were tilted sideways.

510
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:23.520
You were smiling and you had this great smile on your face.
And I always,

511
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.340
I always thought cause I,
cause I knew you off stage.
I was like,

512
00:28:26.341 --> 00:28:30.360
I bet it pained him to like smile to do that headshot because I can't picture

513
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:34.170
you like,
cause now your picture see me like that Steven,

514
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:35.790
now your pictures are like,

515
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.440
they're like you where you're more kind of like well this is what you saw in

516
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:44.850
that headshot was the smiling me was who I thought I was.
Right.

517
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.420
I didn't realize,
see I have this theory that your twenties is all about.
Like,

518
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:51.510
I would say this in the podcast that your twenties you just basically taking

519
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:53.580
your childhood out on people.
Yeah.

520
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.940
If it was a good one or a bad one and you don't even know what you're doing.

521
00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.110
Okay.
So if you were raised right,
you're doing something good.
Okay.
But if you're,

522
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.670
you know,
a little off or whatever,

523
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.150
then you're hurting people and somewhere in your thirties you stop blaming

524
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:09.060
people and you start working on yourself or whatever and then then your 50,

525
00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:12.210
almost 51 you're still in fucking therapy.
So,
um,

526
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.980
what that was was that was prop.
That's who I was.

527
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:21.660
Believe it or not,
that smiling kid who was,
who the fuck I was when I felt safe.

528
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.480
All right.
But when you saw me around there,

529
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.300
this whole fucking guarded thing that you see,
that's all it is.

530
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.530
That's just like stories.
Cause Cause I get asked this when I go,
you know,

531
00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:34.800
every now and then like people know I'm pals with you or start in New York with

532
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:38.750
you and you'd go do these radio shows.
I love it.
A couple of Fellas,

533
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.390
you do the radio shows and they're like,
what's,
what's burl like,
what's Bro?

534
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.260
And I always say that we used to go to Yankee Games together.

535
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.730
We'd go to sporting events together.

536
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.580
I went to a million Yankee Games and I just sat there rooting against them.

537
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.310
You would go,
wow.
Appreciating what,

538
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:56.650
especially the 98 Yankees as best fucking team I ever saw.

539
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.430
So this is 2001 [inaudible] no,

540
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.500
this is probably 2000 I was 2001 game that night.

541
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.780
Never did it.
And I,
that to me,

542
00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.750
he gave me so much shit for doing that bus Gig that I,
I never,

543
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:15.260
I told him I didn't do it,
but I never gave you a name modeled.
I never told her.

544
00:30:15.261 --> 00:30:16.780
You were telling me you're like,
I will never,

545
00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.320
he said don't say that cause you'll get shredded for the rest of your life if

546
00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:25.300
you tell.
They did a headlining set.
It was old school.
45 minutes.

547
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.800
Yeah.
Upstairs at the seller,
Patrice,
Kevin Vos,

548
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.560
Norton,
Keith.
All the killers were there.
Yeah,

549
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:37.650
they did on a fucking hour on what my bus Gig was going to be like trashing me

550
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.680
and dude,
it was so fucking,
they crushed me.

551
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:45.730
So hard strangers we're listening and laughing or worse.

552
00:30:45.731 --> 00:30:49.240
There was a couple of women going,
oh cause they were looking at my,

553
00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:51.130
I had nothing.
I got fucking,

554
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:55.480
so you gave me this Gig to Gig was basically you go on a bus and like from

555
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.480
midtown to Yankee stadium you had to do standup comedy.

556
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.880
These guys from Atlanta had come up.
It was the Braves,

557
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:04.830
there was a second time the brace.
It was 99 is that right?
Nine.
No,

558
00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.350
no.
What the fuck will 2001 world series 2001 is Arizona.
This is also,

559
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.430
it was Arizona,
Arizona pitch.
Okay.
So the Arizona Diamondbacks,

560
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:15.620
he,

561
00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.690
so these are fans from Arizona and they had rented a party bus to go from their

562
00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:23.500
hotel up to the fucking Yankee Stadium and they wanted a comedian in that

563
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:24.281
fucking traffic.

564
00:31:24.281 --> 00:31:27.720
I can't imagine how much time he had to do to do stand up and in return you've

565
00:31:27.721 --> 00:31:31.930
got a world series tickets and I was just like,
dude,
I'll fucking cause up bomb.

566
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:35.080
I'll just sit there all I gotta do shit on the Yankees for an hour.

567
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.290
I can do that for fucking a day.
I'll take the ticket and I'll fucking leave.

568
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.000
But then you it and you couldn't do it.
You said,
here's the opportunity,
do it.

569
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:45.850
But don't tell anybody.
They teased me out of it.
You know what it was.

570
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.290
It wasn't even the trashing.

571
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:52.090
It was after the pounding that I took and they all left and I was just sitting

572
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:55.900
there like a punch drunk fighter and Patrice Zack down,

573
00:31:55.901 --> 00:32:00.430
what's next to me in this fatherly way.
He said,
Bill,

574
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:04.720
I will stand in front of that bus before I let you do that Gig.

575
00:32:04.721 --> 00:32:07.960
If you want to go to a world series,
buy a ticket,
you got the money.

576
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:11.200
And it was the first time I ever thought like,
wow,

577
00:32:11.201 --> 00:32:15.280
I think I've earned some sort of self esteem as a comedian because you come up

578
00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:16.451
every,

579
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:21.451
it's just one impossible situation after another that you start to get

580
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.460
institutionalized.
That dude,
I remember one time I went to,

581
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:29.260
I had to do this Gig at a,
it was called a birth,
a private gig birthday party,

582
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.830
I think Linda Rowe booked at or something.
I don't know.
She booked this fuck,

583
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.130
I love her.
She booked me at this thing.
I think it was her.
It was Roger Paul,

584
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.410
one of those too.
Yeah,

585
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.270
and I went there and what it was was it wasn't a birthday party.

586
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:46.220
There was a Irish guy getting deported because he got caught for fucking helping

587
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:51.221
out the IRA and I just remembered he went up first and I don't know who he was

588
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:54.980
talking about,
probably Margaret Thatcher,
one of the English cons.

589
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.700
And he was like,
I got fucking two words for them and it's not happy birthday.

590
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.430
And the whole place goes,
I goes nuts.

591
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:04.490
And they all marched up to the bar and started drinking.

592
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.270
And only the women where they're not paying attention.
I was standing there,

593
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.900
fortunate it was two other comedians bomb all those fucking prom shows that

594
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:14.480
stand up.
New York used to book and Dangerfield stage of us.

595
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.300
You have to do a half hour for the prom shows just for people who don't know
you.

596
00:33:18.301 --> 00:33:21.110
You would show up in these fucking kids in the prime of their lives.

597
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.860
They just want to have a good time on a boat and it was on a little boat cruise

598
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:28.040
around the island of Manhattan and they would have the dance music going.

599
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.880
They would cut the music and then you had to walk out into the middle of the

600
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:35.300
dance floor and start doing standup fucking comedy.

601
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.760
I did one crew,
one.
What was good?

602
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:40.370
They actually put them in a room and I had like a chance like,
dude,

603
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.800
I can't even remember the gigs.
They were that traumatic.

604
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.790
They just sort of like flashes and then you would bomb and then you're on this

605
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:49.520
boat.
You can't leave.
I put treats.
Would've stood in front of that boat,

606
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.070
said pill.
I know dude.

607
00:33:52.071 --> 00:33:55.250
I used to hide down by the engine room and then you had to make,

608
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.930
then you had to make the decision as the boat was pulling into,

609
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.110
I try to get first in line and feel them staring at the back of my head or do I

610
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:07.490
hide here like a rat and wait for him to get off.
And at one time I,

611
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:12.120
the first time I hit like a rat and right as I thought they'd all left,

612
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.390
there was just one of them walked off songs is black kid.

613
00:34:14.391 --> 00:34:17.210
I remember just looked at me,
I can't do the,
it's a face.
He just looked at me,

614
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.590
kind of pursed his lifts and just slowly shook his head as he was looking at me

615
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.240
and he was looking at me like,
man,

616
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:26.180
I dunno what the fuck you were thinking that you'd ever be good at this shit

617
00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.470
just so that's why I say yes to the buck cause I was just like,

618
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.940
I've already done gigs way worse than this bus story and I'm getting a world

619
00:34:34.941 --> 00:34:36.110
series ticket out of this.

620
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.330
I'm actually pissed at myself that I didn't do the Gig.

621
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:40.070
<v 1>I did it.
And thank you for it.</v>

622
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.790
Cause I got to see George Bush through the opening pitch out and it was when he

623
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:45.500
nailed it to he fucking nailed it.
Yeah.

624
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:50.420
Fucking after nine 11 it was like a euphoric kind of vibe in the stadium.

625
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:54.020
The rest of the world had had empathy towards us before.

626
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.200
He kinda liked us then and yeah,

627
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.450
felt we were victims and then I forget who,

628
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:03.140
but this pop fly comes up and this guy in this kid go for it.

629
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.880
[inaudible] and this guy catches the ball and this kid's kind of like still

630
00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:11.600
standing there and the guys turn around waving the ball and everybody in our

631
00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:15.950
section starts pulling this guy.
Boom.
Get the kid the ball,
give it to a kid,

632
00:35:15.951 --> 00:35:20.080
give it to a kid,
to a kid.
You start chatting.
I start Jack,
give it to the kid,

633
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.260
the whole sections,
give it to,

634
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.010
it's starting to spread all the sections neighbor and give it to the kid and

635
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.650
this guy's getting pounded.
People are not letting up.

636
00:35:27.651 --> 00:35:29.570
It's going on for two minutes,
three minutes.

637
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.310
And eventually the guy stands up and he turns around and he makes a fucking

638
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:38.190
production.
He holds the ball out so everybody can see any hands it to the kid.

639
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.790
<v 0>Right.
And the kid stands up,
everybody claps,
you go,</v>

640
00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.360
you're fucking caved.
You should've kept the ball.
But I started laughing.

641
00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:50.540
You go smoke this,
everybody else is smoking it.

642
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:54.160
And then everybody starts pounding this guy and you on their own.

643
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.070
It's about peer pressure is so fucking funny.
Everybody was dying laughing.

644
00:35:58.071 --> 00:36:02.780
It was the only time I saw comic get like laughs at a stadium from the crowd.

645
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.690
I've always killed at stadium money.
Oh,
I always killed the stadiums.

646
00:36:05.691 --> 00:36:10.040
And there was a,
there was a thing,
I had this one weird fucking,
this weird,

647
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.580
I would become a different person when I went to a game for awhile.
Yeah.

648
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.890
But if this was before I was known,
cause now they're like,

649
00:36:15.891 --> 00:36:18.440
oh let's set jerk off from comedy central.
So now it's not fun.

650
00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:23.140
But before anybody knew who I was,
I would go into a stadium,
dude,

651
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:27.050
I would be on the road.
I used to embarrass Paul Versey.
I,
one time I got,

652
00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:29.810
I don't know,
I would just become completely uninhibited.

653
00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.470
And it was just all about making my section laugh and trying to have like a good

654
00:36:33.471 --> 00:36:34.250
set.

655
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:38.960
And this is before all those flatscreen TVs came in and killed the class clown

656
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.740
at the sporting event because now everybody's just sits there staring at him.

657
00:36:42.741 --> 00:36:47.660
Cam.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I was at this,
this game,
uh,

658
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:53.540
it was the dolphins verse,
the Bank Bangles,
and I was yelling all of this shit,

659
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.700
you gotta be bored,
you gotta be on Shit during that game.
Right.
And I put,

660
00:36:56.701 --> 00:37:00.050
I want to go to all the stadiums,
so,
and which I basically have,

661
00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.780
I've got six left in the four major.
Um,

662
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:07.580
but then I found out some rich guys already done it,
the fucking cunt.
Um,
so,

663
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:12.140
uh,
I was trashing the dolphins because they were right in front of us and I was

664
00:37:12.141 --> 00:37:15.350
doing such a good job and they were all laughing around me.
And so he said,

665
00:37:15.351 --> 00:37:18.320
hey man,
get,
cause it was a close game.
Get on their kicker,
get on their kicker.

666
00:37:18.321 --> 00:37:18.860
So I just,

667
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:23.860
this guy carpenter and I just focused in on this guy and this at this point they

668
00:37:24.111 --> 00:37:27.890
had the flat screen TVs but it was the bangles who were like barely in the NFL,

669
00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.120
you know their stadium and shit.

670
00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:32.780
So it's just like they don't have like a lot of like crazy shit going on.

671
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.340
So I started in on this guy carpenter first.

672
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.750
He always starts at you're a liability and I had to make sure that he didn't

673
00:37:40.751 --> 00:37:43.990
curse cause it was kids around there and I just started with this guy and I

674
00:37:43.991 --> 00:37:48.670
swear to God I ability,
yeah I was yelling shit about him getting his,

675
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.500
it's not too late to get your real estate license.

676
00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:55.501
And I was talking about his career after football and I swear to God he picked

677
00:37:55.511 --> 00:38:00.511
up his tea in the net and he moved all the way down to the other side and I'm

678
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:06.010
convinced,
okay,
I want to believe it was because of the Shit I was talking.

679
00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:07.990
I mean the guy is the guy still had a great career then he went up.

680
00:38:07.991 --> 00:38:10.780
But it was funny cause I never forgot his name.
Then I saw him in like Buffalo.

681
00:38:10.781 --> 00:38:15.560
I'm like,
Oh my God,
I call versus he up there he is carpenter.
Um,

682
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.130
I did a couple of times I felt like I got to somebody.

683
00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:22.910
One time I went to a game at Old Tiger Stadium or Briggs Stadium as my dad would

684
00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:24.350
call it and I sat in,

685
00:38:24.351 --> 00:38:26.900
I wanted to say it was the only state that had an upper deck all the way around.

686
00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.060
So I sat in the upper deck,
the short porch out in right field and they would,

687
00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.030
there was an inner league game.
They were playing the pirates.

688
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.830
See now the center field and left field or play catch in the right field was

689
00:38:35.831 --> 00:38:38.410
playing catch with like a backup catcher or something.

690
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:43.150
So he was playing in the guy who had just the guy in right field had just hit an

691
00:38:43.151 --> 00:38:47.770
inning ending double play.
And I started in on him about how the,
you know,

692
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.740
you do shit like that.
That's how he gets sent down to the minors.

693
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.460
You're on the pirates,
you're barely into the league and the league and you know,

694
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:58.330
and it's the short porch from hanging over this guy yelling and dude,

695
00:38:58.331 --> 00:39:01.660
he threw his next pitch this next throat and I swear to God it's sailed like

696
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:06.250
eight feet over the guy's fucking head.
And then I felt bad.
Then I felt bad.

697
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.870
You're the cooler now.
It's just like,
hey dude,
I was just fucking with you man.

698
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.650
I mean,
I'm just trying to break it.
I don't even give a fuck about the tigers.

699
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:19.510
I'm just being an asshole.
Um,
I had a buddy of mine,

700
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:21.250
he got somebody at Fenway Park one time.

701
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.710
He was yelling at the relief pitcher and he was screaming,
yeah,

702
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:28.360
all of this shit at this guy.
And this guy is just stone faced.
Yeah.

703
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.570
Not acknowledging any of it.
And then finally just quiet,
got quiet.

704
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.620
Then my buddy just goes,
I know you can hear me right.

705
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.030
And the guy broke into a big smile and just started fucking laughing.

706
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.900
He just started fucking laughing.
And then the whole section laughed.

707
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:48.580
And like the guy that's,
you know,
that was,
it's actually comedians,
IRA proctor,

708
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:53.500
Boston go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know you can't hear me.
What am I favorite?

709
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:57.360
Something like that is,
um,
I did this college,
oh,

710
00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:02.710
years ago in screech was just coming on the comedy scene.
Diamond,
right?

711
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.460
Screech.
Yeah.
Dustin diamond dust and diamond and use with Michael Diamond.

712
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.330
I got booked at this,
um,
you know,
this college campus.

713
00:40:10.331 --> 00:40:13.510
And so we were double booked.
So they're like,
you know what,
Steve,

714
00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:17.750
why don't you open and screech will Dustin diamond?
We'll close the show.

715
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.670
What fucking time it is.
I can make sure I don't miss this shit.
It's only 1235.

716
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.540
Well,
we're fine.
Oh,
we started early.
Okay,
we're good.
We're fine.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

717
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.980
So I go,
yeah,
I don't give a shit.
That's fine.
Yeah.
You know,

718
00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.790
this is a good payday.
There's colleges back in the day.

719
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:35.350
So they put us in this big campus theater,
whatever.
It's like 5,000 kids.

720
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:39.670
And I go up and I'm like,
I'm like,
you know,
if doesn't diamonds going after me,

721
00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:41.350
I'm going to bury this fucker.
So I just,
I,

722
00:40:41.351 --> 00:40:44.650
I pull out all the 4th of July fireworks,
you know,

723
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.330
do 20 or like my best,
like hard hidden sellers stuff.

724
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.860
And he goes right to bury a childhood child star.

725
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.170
That was just kind of like pissed at the time.
Mike,
I was still kind of like,

726
00:40:56.171 --> 00:41:00.610
you know,
you would take in your childhood out on them on safe money ever enough,

727
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.060
you know,
with,
you know,
his residuals,
he's not making shit.
It's so you,
you,
okay,

728
00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:06.230
so you tried to bury [inaudible].

729
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:10.060
What happens when you're a little younger and this guy's coming off the TV

730
00:41:10.061 --> 00:41:14.830
credits?
It's like fuck it.
Okay.
So,
so yeah,
you're probably right.
But anyways,

731
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:19.420
I go up to my thing and in screech goes up and I,
you know,

732
00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:24.580
used to get that grace applause five minutes it starts to dissipate and

733
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.610
eventually it's just silent.

734
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:30.610
And it's like that scene in Andy Kaufman's movie,

735
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.310
the Jim Carrey one was doing that college and slowly people are walking out of

736
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:38.600
the amphitheater and stuff.
I kind of felt bad and I was going to say then,

737
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:41.210
how'd you feel Steve?
I felt really bad.
I felt bad.

738
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:45.380
We all have those moments and it's silent.
It's quiet.
He just did the joke,

739
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:49.040
the POVs and just absolute pure silence.

740
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.940
Just you could hear a pin drop and then just way in the back from a rafter in

741
00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:57.941
the back of just your fuck you screech and I fucking couldn't stop laughing.

742
00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.540
I don't think I've ever laughed harder cause it echoed,
you know,

743
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:07.541
and it was just so quiet and it was just way up and I was fucking in tears

744
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:10.160
crying so hard.

745
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:14.450
It was one of the worst like moments where somebody just says something at the

746
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:16.970
right time,
it's crushing,
it's fucking soul crushing.

747
00:42:16.971 --> 00:42:18.860
And then you see all that shit that he ended up doing.

748
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.900
Then he's got to grow the beard.
He's got to try to seem edgier,
kind a good dude.

749
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:27.020
He did porn.
That kid probably drove him to porn.
He did Paul Preach,

750
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.250
I bet.
Still echoes in his head to this day.
And it made them do porn.

751
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.770
And this is the thing that was actually respect.

752
00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:38.210
He just wanted to be the guy I yelled,
fuck you screech,

753
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.170
screech.
That's what it becomes.
It's just,
that's his Twitter handle.
Hey,

754
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:46.490
speaking of that,
did you,
uh,
as far as like,
dealing with like,
uh,

755
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:51.090
people know when,
who you are,
did you see that documentary on Bill Murray yet?
No.

756
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.980
Is this documentary,
this kid made about a hills bill?
About boomer?
Yeah.

757
00:42:54.981 --> 00:42:58.760
Like seeing,
it was all these urban myths about,
you know,
hey,

758
00:42:58.761 --> 00:43:00.890
we were playing kickball and all of a sudden Bill Murray showed up.

759
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.870
They played three innings and then he was just disappeared.

760
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:06.410
Or he showed up at our house party started French fry.
No one will believe this.

761
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.090
Yeah.
Yeah.
All of that shit.

762
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:10.250
So he was investigating it and all this type of stuff.

763
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.870
But like when you watch it,

764
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:15.650
it's just this fascinating thing to see.

765
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:20.651
It's a combination of him like living in the moment and then also,

766
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.660
uh,
dealing with how famous he is.
I feel that it's just like,

767
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:30.800
I'm going to go on the offensive here and be like,

768
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.370
so open and normal.
It's going to freak you out.

769
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.850
And then we're gonna meet in the middle where I'm just a guy named bill.

770
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.740
It's fucking fascinating.
Anyway,
mental judo.
He flipped it on you?

771
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:47.000
Yeah.
And actually taught you something and then by the time you figure it out,

772
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.980
he's gone.
And then you realize I didn't even ask him for an autograph.
Yeah.
Yeah.

773
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:54.320
So he actually gets like,
like,

774
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:58.160
I feel like this is what he does so he can have a normal existence.
You know,

775
00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:02.800
one time I was flying on a little fucking puddle jumper over to uh,

776
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:07.280
South Carolina and he's a part owner in a minor league team there.

777
00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.660
And he was on my flight and dude,
he,

778
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.530
I missed him by one seat.
Oh yeah.
I was in the opposite row,

779
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:17.330
opposite of the aisle,
the two seater.

780
00:44:17.331 --> 00:44:20.300
And he sat on the other side of the two seat on the window,

781
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.630
so I couldn't hear what he's saying.
But he talked to that other guy,

782
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.560
the whole fucking flight.
Oh,
that's awesome.
And I was just like,
fuck,

783
00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:33.660
I always almost there.
Do you ever want to be that guy?
I never,

784
00:44:33.661 --> 00:44:36.240
I always hated that.
And like,
I never want to like,

785
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.050
like if I was sitting next to bill,
I don't know if I'd say anything,

786
00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:44.850
I might be like,
you know,
I might sound,
I never,
I know,
you know what it is.

787
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:48.690
What I've found with people at that level is if you somehow know what they're

788
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.140
hobbyists,
they'll talk to you all fucking day long.

789
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:56.820
But if you go at them and talk to them about what it is they,

790
00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:00.190
they've done press junkets around the fucking world.
Yeah.

791
00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.920
The same 20 questions and variations of them and it's just like,

792
00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.470
you know how perfect reference groundhog day.

793
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:12.480
And like usually he made that movie.
So,
um,
yeah,
like Isley,

794
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.530
you know,
and I also have no,

795
00:45:13.531 --> 00:45:16.990
I don't have a desire to get to that level of being known.
Yeah.

796
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.250
Where you're just like,
his life is just constantly,

797
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.750
this is such a weird thing to say,

798
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:26.610
but being bombarded with complements that you can't get on it and then you can't

799
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.370
leave you,
you know,
you don't undersell.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
No,

800
00:45:29.371 --> 00:45:32.790
you don't understand.
You don't understand.
It's just,
this is just,

801
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:37.230
they're not letting go of his hand and it's just like you get my aunt Vicky,

802
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.780
you don't,
yeah,
get it picks you.
Can you,

803
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:44.180
can you leave him a voice message on my phone?
Oh my stupid phone is not on it.

804
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.280
And then,
and then he walks another half of foot.
Oh my God.

805
00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:51.360
I'm the biggest and it just becomes that.
Yeah,
no,
it was on video.
Yeah.

806
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:55.110
Fuck yeah.
No,
and you see it and you see those.
Whenever I see those people,

807
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:57.520
there's this sadness I'll do.

808
00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:00.450
Do you know what's cause they're walking around that it's like they're like this

809
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:04.260
fucking,
they're like a monument.
It's like you become like a thing.

810
00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:08.260
You're not even like a fucking person anymore.
Zoo.
You're zoo exhibition.
Yeah.

811
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.190
When I go out with Vince and like,
especially when we're in Chicago,

812
00:46:11.191 --> 00:46:15.780
we walk around,
I'm the guy.
People just hand a camera too.
Yeah.

813
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.800
Just go take this.
And then he handles it really well.

814
00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.580
He was really good at it.
He's good at,
he's great but,
but then they,

815
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.280
but he likes people.
I think there was like people,

816
00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:30.210
I think you have to like people,
but if you're like,
you're fucking curmudgeon,

817
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:34.380
like me,
I don't think I,
yeah,
I like,

818
00:46:34.381 --> 00:46:37.230
I'm acting like this is an option to get that fucking big,
but I just,

819
00:46:37.231 --> 00:46:39.510
when I look at it like that's something,
when you get into the business,

820
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.830
you think,
oh,

821
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:44.190
I want to win an Oscar and I'm going to direct the fucking movie and I'm going

822
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.680
to fucking a,
and I'm going to do this.
I'm gonna do all that.
And then you,

823
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.900
when you get in,
and first of all,
you see how fucking hard it is.

824
00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:50.820
And then secondly is you,

825
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:54.890
when you actually start to see what that thing is you kind of,
I looked at,

826
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:59.520
I was just like,
oh,
it's creepy.
Yeah,
you can't eat.

827
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.450
You can't one that now.
Now with those fucking like everybody's,

828
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:05.880
it's like j Edgar Hoover,
everybody's got like a fucking camera now.

829
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.050
Like I was saying with your dude,

830
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.850
the fact that they came at you and could just stay,
fuck you jaggy chair,

831
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.610
you fucking Asian,
blah blah,
blah,
blah.
And then to a chair,
you,

832
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:19.560
there is no evidence of it.
And then they just walked out and Nathan happen.

833
00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:20.460
Nothing happened.

834
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.370
But like these days they'd be fired from the night shift at best buy.
You know,

835
00:47:23.371 --> 00:47:27.300
it's like that's,
yeah,
like Oh,
shots fired there.
I saw what he just did there.

836
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:32.200
I saw what you did that,
that,
that would be like the,
the thing.
But um,

837
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:36.820
well Jesus,
you know what Steve,
I don't know.
This has been fucking great.

838
00:47:36.821 --> 00:47:40.720
Just to go back.
It's funny how we go down memory lane and there was like,
no,

839
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.140
they were just all brutal stories.
That's what I always thought.

840
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.750
That's what I always the worst story that ever happened to me.

841
00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.100
You always said it's the meanest thing you've ever seen.

842
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:56.830
Bobby [inaudible] Bobby.
Ah,
that's the worst.

843
00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:59.160
I think if we,
if we close it out,
you know,
we,

844
00:47:59.161 --> 00:48:04.100
we tell people that years ago that Patrice O'Neal roast,
it was a pretty tree.

845
00:48:04.101 --> 00:48:04.841
So Neal rose,

846
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:09.841
which was the purest and greatest fucking rose I ever saw in fortunate.

847
00:48:10.461 --> 00:48:15.160
I got to be a part of it because it wasn't for anybody else.
It was for us.

848
00:48:15.161 --> 00:48:17.800
I know now,
I think there's tapes of it,
you know,
everything ends up online now.

849
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:19.390
But like,
uh,

850
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:24.540
it was at the old Boston comedy club and the amount of people that showed up

851
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.480
cause they finally want to see somebody shut Patrice up.

852
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:32.380
Cause he had trashed all of industry there.
Everybody was.
Yes.

853
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.550
And they wanted to see what happened.
So Bobby,

854
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:41.410
when you can tell this what the stores I,
I got,
I was married,

855
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.320
I was just about to get mad on some level that would tell them this story
though.

856
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:48.220
I was managed by Barry Katz at the time.
I don't want fuck Bobby last time.

857
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:49.450
I love Bobby by the way.

858
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.870
There's no way not to love Bobby cause you always get to a fuck Bobby.

859
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.120
And then he just out of these enormous you,

860
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.170
the last time I saw him in New York City I was wearing,
my boss had,

861
00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.750
Bernard did see to the bottom,
he goes,
take your ball cap off.
I go,
okay.

862
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.090
And he goes,
oh he's still got hair.
And he walked away.

863
00:49:04.091 --> 00:49:06.550
He was upset that at my age I still,

864
00:49:06.551 --> 00:49:10.540
he wanted me to be bald and then he'd be happy.
Like that's,
that's who Bobby is,

865
00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:14.800
you know?
I know.
But you have to understand the sadness behind that.
So anyway,

866
00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.370
very guts manages me.
He's like,
Hey I got you.

867
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.990
Was this before or after you became a dad?

868
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:23.140
Cause he's a different guy now before I know now he's now,

869
00:49:23.141 --> 00:49:27.160
he's like Bobby saw Bobby now he's good,
Balmy Santa Claus box.
The Bobby.

870
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:29.890
We always want,
we always Bosley knew he could be.
Yeah.

871
00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.830
Cause I will say this about Bob.

872
00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:38.610
He has been 11 different people since I've met him and each in each version has

873
00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:43.210
been a better Bobby's it.
Yeah.
He never went in a worse direction.

874
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:47.280
You definitely may be stylistically with clothes for awhile during morning he

875
00:49:47.281 --> 00:49:51.820
moved out to la and he was starting to look in a little Cholo.
Yay.
Yeah.

876
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.480
I don't know what happened.
He came out here and he,

877
00:49:54.481 --> 00:49:57.820
he lost use performing at Kinston years for a good year.
I think

878
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:05.170
so.
Can,
I remember Keith said that he said,
Bob,
move on to La as a Puerto Rican.

879
00:50:05.171 --> 00:50:06.580
He came back a fat Mexican,

880
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.420
we got bail,
we gotta get them out of La.
It's killing them.

881
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.390
Cats gets me this like audition at SNL,
but,

882
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.390
but not like the audition where you go,
you've got to put yourself on tape.

883
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:24.040
So there's three characters,
three impersonations.
This is like again,

884
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:27.260
probably like late nineties early two thousands cell phones are not out.

885
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.100
Nobody has

886
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.850
<v 1>that tech.</v>

887
00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:29.200
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

888
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.470
I remember that was a cattle call to try the next to find the next young hot

889
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:36.440
talent to be on SNL.
And you had to put yourself on tape.

890
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:38.240
So you borrowed Bobby Kelly's

891
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:40.290
<v 1>camera video camera.</v>

892
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:44.060
He's very tech savvy and I borrowed his camera and I put it,

893
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:47.270
I put a DV tape in there and let it run for an hour.

894
00:50:47.271 --> 00:50:50.720
I just sat in front of the camera and just let it run instead of stopping and

895
00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:52.790
starting.
And I was like,
I'll just edit out.

896
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.610
I'll just edit the and get the best parts and that'll be my tape.

897
00:50:56.210 --> 00:51:00.320
So I give Bobby that the camera back and I give them,
I leave the tape and I go,

898
00:51:00.321 --> 00:51:03.860
feel free to tape.
You forgot the tape was in?
No,
you left.

899
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.020
I left the tape in there.
I go just tape over it.

900
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:08.180
Cause those are kind of expensive at the time.

901
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.810
<v 0>Jesus Christ.
Steve,
you know what you would dealing with?
I'm a trust.</v>

902
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.810
You have thought you forgot it was in there?

903
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.810
<v 1>No,
I'm a trusting person so I,
I gave him,
it was like a three pack,</v>

904
00:51:18.811 --> 00:51:20.400
so I gave them two extra tapes.
I said,

905
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:25.640
<v 0>so Bobby Kelly invented the dark web.
You,
he's the man.</v>

906
00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:29.630
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whenever they do the documentary on the dark.
Yeah.
He's like a,

907
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:34.430
he's like a,
a cataclysmic moment in the dark web.
And you've left that so you,
oh,

908
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:37.910
I always thought,
I thought you forgot it was in there.
No,
no,
no.

909
00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.600
I left it in there.
I go.
Just,
I just am having less sympathy.
You knew who he was.

910
00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:47.390
So he,
what he does is at the Patrice Roast,
he doesn't even prepare months.
No,
no,

911
00:51:47.391 --> 00:51:49.640
no.
You gotta wait.
You just tell him this too fast.

912
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:52.700
He fucking uploaded to tell you.
Yeah.
Okay,
good.
Yeah.

913
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:56.120
Onto this computer and then kept it.
Oh yeah.

914
00:51:56.121 --> 00:52:01.121
I kept all of it for like a year waiting for the perfect time to unveil it.

915
00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:05.580
<v 1>Yeah.
And then he,
he edited together the worst,</v>

916
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.760
the absolute oars.
Me Talking to myself,

917
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:12.240
the most embarrassing things you singing Donka Shane.

918
00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:17.560
I was doing Wayne Lukas.
Yeah,
Bud lite commercial at the time it,
dude,

919
00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.720
let me tell you some,
even the best version of that was probably horrific.
Yeah.

920
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:26.580
The worst version of it was absolutely abysmal and probably an insured.

921
00:52:26.581 --> 00:52:30.180
Why never worked in New York City?
Probably after that.
But he took it,

922
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.591
edited together,

923
00:52:31.591 --> 00:52:36.591
this awful presentation of my as audition and instead of doing material,

924
00:52:36.901 --> 00:52:41.901
he wheeled out a TV with the videotape and put the VCR tape in and you were

925
00:52:42.511 --> 00:52:43.344
there.

926
00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:47.760
<v 0>This is what he did.
He went up and he tried a few jokes.
Oh,
that only did okay.</v>

927
00:52:47.761 --> 00:52:49.470
And he was like,
fuck yeah,
you might have back.

928
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.550
And then he started telling his story of how you left this tape in and you have

929
00:52:53.551 --> 00:52:58.110
to see it.
It's so bad.
And it made no sense because you weren't there.

930
00:52:58.111 --> 00:53:00.150
I was emceeing at the comedy cellar so I can go.

931
00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:03.510
We weren't roasting you and then he put it into it.

932
00:53:03.511 --> 00:53:08.511
It was so fucking bad that the meanest people in stand up.

933
00:53:08.741 --> 00:53:11.490
I remember sitting next to Lake Great Greg Giraldo and we were going,

934
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:15.780
shut it off,
turn it off,
Bobby,
shut it off.

935
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:20.040
And that was the end of his set.
And I remember,
dude,

936
00:53:20.041 --> 00:53:24.480
I came over to the seller,
people I,
and I saw you.

937
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:29.910
I saw you dude.
Shoulders slumped.
And I came over.
I said,

938
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:35.010
I go,
hey man,
I apologize.
Said sorry about that.
And you said,

939
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.070
I'll never forget it.
You look,

940
00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.930
you barely looked at me like I'm surprised you're even talking to me.

941
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:46.050
And I tried to tell Bobby afterwards,
now this is Bobby.

942
00:53:46.051 --> 00:53:49.710
Five versions ago,
the new Bobby knew Bobby wouldn't do this.

943
00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:53.340
Bobby is like a fucking iPhone.
Daddy.
Bobby wouldn't do this.
Yeah,
not,
not Daddy,

944
00:53:53.341 --> 00:53:57.450
Bobby.
Yeah,
but this is,
this is,
this is post Cholo Bobby,

945
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.630
he's like an iPhone.
Every version gets better.
I'm telling you,

946
00:54:00.631 --> 00:54:03.540
he's a better person than I am right now.
And I'm not just saying that like,

947
00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:08.190
he's a fucking amazing dude now.
But back then he was dark,
wet,
dark web.

948
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:13.410
Barb.
I tried to explain to him going and me fucking crazy.

949
00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:18.540
He'll have to explain.
He was going,
is he?
He was like,
he was,

950
00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:21.810
but I think going back,
that may be,

951
00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:24.600
it was starting to enter that he did something fucked up.

952
00:54:24.601 --> 00:54:25.500
But the thing about Bobby,

953
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:30.770
so is you just talked to him and you hear how he was brought up and it's just

954
00:54:32.131 --> 00:54:35.220
like,
oh now I get it.
Cause he was the,

955
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:40.260
Bobby Kelly was the first guy I ever met who's line was further down the street

956
00:54:40.261 --> 00:54:43.110
than mine because you know that thing,
you know,

957
00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:45.900
all the black comics tried to teach the white comics how to sit around and you

958
00:54:45.901 --> 00:54:47.810
know,
bus Paul's,
as we called it,

959
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:53.130
like I remember me and Bob where we lived in that game.
Never got to laugh.

960
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:57.420
People like God damn Jesus Pill Shit.
They would just make funny your shirt.

961
00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:02.160
And we lived in,
yeah.
At least my mom isn't dead.
Yeah.
Like,
and it's just,

962
00:55:02.161 --> 00:55:04.890
there wasn't a joke.
It was just,
it was fucking mean.

963
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:09.300
And he was the only guy I met Sunday mean Bob has to do with fucking,

964
00:55:09.301 --> 00:55:11.510
I might do a poll,
I'm back there,
this,
this,
uh,

965
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:15.090
summer if I get a chance to go out and do his podcast.
Oh,
with Bobby.
Yeah,

966
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.540
the shed.
If we talk about when we were actually roommates,

967
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:23.910
two of the most damaged fucking lunatics.
However,

968
00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:25.860
we still had a ton of fun.
Do you know what he did one time?

969
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:30.180
This is so fucking funny.
And I was so fucking mad at him now,

970
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:33.690
but I just think of how like why did I care?
This is so funny.
He had,

971
00:55:33.691 --> 00:55:35.820
first of all,
he was like,
you know,
he was a street kid,

972
00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.790
so if anybody left anything on the fucking sidewalk,

973
00:55:38.791 --> 00:55:41.760
he would bring it in like couches.
I was like,
Bob,

974
00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:45.870
this probably bedbugs and fucking like fucking HIV on that.

975
00:55:45.871 --> 00:55:49.350
They get this thing to fuck a fucking steam cleaning.

976
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:55.190
So somebody had left like the prototype for a stairmaster on the sidewalk,

977
00:55:55.891 --> 00:55:56.160
dude.

978
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.490
And when I tell you this thing was bear like you ever see like you know you have

979
00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:01.580
looking at work a really old car.
Yeah.

980
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.980
Where where like you open the hood and you look down and you can see your

981
00:56:04.981 --> 00:56:09.780
driveway.
You know what I mean?
There's like this just bare minimal parts.

982
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.090
This was the stairmaster version of this.

983
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:16.170
So we were in this thing where we were trying,
we would like having this war.

984
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:16.620
Yeah.

985
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:20.310
Which is so dumb to do this with Bob because Bob's going to win and it was just

986
00:56:20.311 --> 00:56:23.740
basically he fucked with my computer.
I fucked his computer.

987
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.560
He fucked with my food.
I'm fucking with his food and whatever I did,

988
00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:29.620
I've gotten him last.
Yeah.
These fucking practical jokes.

989
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:34.710
And we're doing this in a railroad apartment where I had a walkthrough bedroom

990
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:37.690
and he slept in the living room.
That's where we lived.
It was like fucking,

991
00:56:37.691 --> 00:56:38.151
you ever see those?

992
00:56:38.151 --> 00:56:42.000
Those things really stick a tiger and a lion in a pit to see what happens.
Yeah,

993
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.020
they just kill each other.
That's what the fuck happened.

994
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:49.410
So he's on this fucking stair master and I had an audition for Conan O'brien,

995
00:56:50.141 --> 00:56:52.630
which I know bugged him.
Yeah,
I know.

996
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:55.840
Bugged him because no one was appreciating how funny he was cause he was

997
00:56:55.841 --> 00:56:58.120
considered crass or whatever the fuck it was.
Right.

998
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.160
So he was on this fucking stairmaster do.
Okay.
And it's a railroad apartment,

999
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.790
so where he is in the living room.
Okay.
Okay.
Then to the right,

1000
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.870
there was a little hallway that led into the kitchen and in that little hallway

1001
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:13.450
was adore also to the right that led into the bathroom.

1002
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.490
So I was on the same side,

1003
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:19.180
the same wall that he was on in the bathroom.
Got It.
Yeah.

1004
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:23.920
And he was on that fucking stairmaster and I got myself all dressed up.

1005
00:57:23.921 --> 00:57:27.580
I got the Moose in my hair that I used to have and I'm all ready to go do my

1006
00:57:27.581 --> 00:57:30.700
fucking audition at the comic strip for Conan O'brien.

1007
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.080
And he had spent sitting there with you.
Remember those racquetballs,

1008
00:57:35.081 --> 00:57:36.000
those blue racquetballs.

1009
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:39.520
He had one of those in his fucking hand and he was on this thing,
dude.

1010
00:57:39.521 --> 00:57:43.150
And when I tell you like Roger Clemens,
I'm coming out of the bathroom,

1011
00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:47.170
he can't even see me.
Like a pool shot.
Yeah.

1012
00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:51.550
Throws like a fucking 90 mile an hour heater.
Yeah.
It,

1013
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:56.140
I mean I heard was it hit the fucking wall and Doodie came right in and hit me

1014
00:57:56.141 --> 00:57:59.800
right in the mouth.
Really?
Oh my lip fucking split.

1015
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:03.140
And I was bleeding and he was on,
I remember he was on,

1016
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:07.450
he was on the stairmaster laughing and then he felt bad to my lips swelled up

1017
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:12.900
and
audition and I got like a piece of cheese.

1018
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.860
Yeah.
Did you get it?
I think I might've.

1019
00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.750
I don't think I did.
I don't think I did.

1020
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:23.260
I think it was suggested to them to know who I was.
Dude,
I literally,

1021
00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:26.980
I mean I tuck my shirt in like this is how much I gave a shit about this thing

1022
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:29.900
and Bobby,
like it's,

1023
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:33.310
it's one of the greatest things anybody ever did to me as far as like a

1024
00:58:33.311 --> 00:58:36.460
practical joke.
Dude,
if you just did the degree of difficulty,

1025
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.980
if he was standing flat footed,
could never do that again.

1026
00:58:38.981 --> 00:58:41.700
This guy was on a fucking was skinny Bobby.
He was on a stair mass.

1027
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:46.480
That's how skinny he was.
Yeah.
Did he this,
this,
this,
this was matinee idol.

1028
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:49.270
Bobby.
There was one time he told me he got the,

1029
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:53.110
this is a video cameras you could communicate like set it up.
I love of this.

1030
00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.840
It always ends up talking about what?
Shitting on Bobby.
Bonnie.
Yeah.

1031
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:57.900
We're not shitting on him.
Come on.
No,
no,
of course.
But,

1032
00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:01.120
but he got this little video camera that does what facetime does,
right?

1033
00:59:01.121 --> 00:59:03.250
It's facetime before facetime.
Right.
He's like,
dude,

1034
00:59:03.251 --> 00:59:06.340
you got gate when these cameras are great.
So he,
he shows it to me.

1035
00:59:06.341 --> 00:59:08.290
He's talking to Dane Cook on the thing and I was like,

1036
00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:10.600
I still have a mini disc player and one of these boxes.

1037
00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.180
Cause he told me that that was the latest thing and tells me to buy this thing.

1038
00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:17.110
I buy it.
He's the only one I know that has it.
I call them up,
I go,
Hey,
what's up?

1039
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:19.000
He hung up on me.
I never used it again.

1040
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.460
The great thing about being friends with 10 bucks.
Yeah.

1041
00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:29.030
But the great thing about being friends with him is like the,
the you just,

1042
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:32.390
if you just drafted behind him,
like if you were in a bike race.
Yeah.

1043
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:36.770
The amount of technology shit that he would just sell to you.

1044
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:40.060
Ah,
well you load,
he was like,
he was the king of that.
He would,

1045
00:59:40.061 --> 00:59:45.061
he would get something of fold up bike of fucking like the some James Bond level

1046
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:49.440
flashlight and then six months he hates it and he gives it to you and it's Kinda

1047
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.980
cool that he hated it.
He was just sick over it.
He know,

1048
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:55.580
he knows what the next thing is.
Yeah.
Cause he's constantly buying the new shit.

1049
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:58.010
This one time I was,
I was rollerblading,

1050
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.340
I was playing roller hockey in central park and some of broke my stick,

1051
01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:05.870
some rollerblading at the time in Hell's kitchen because Bobby and Norton lived

1052
01:00:05.871 --> 01:00:10.100
in Hell's kitchen and I'm coming down like ninth avenue or whatever.

1053
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:14.450
And I see Bobby and Norton walk out of a Starbucks and they look at me and they

1054
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:18.020
just start dying laughing cause they see me in rollerblades and they're fucking

1055
01:00:18.021 --> 01:00:18.930
howling.
They,
they're,

1056
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:21.530
they're not going to cross check them and they didn't see you.

1057
01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:25.670
So I come skate and down and I'm walking,

1058
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.930
they're walking towards me,

1059
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.960
I'm skating towards them and I'm going like I'm making my way through the middle

1060
01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:34.890
of them.
And they both had their coffees in each eye.

1061
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:39.680
I just smacked the coffees out of both their hand skating and then I turned

1062
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:42.140
around and they were both dying laughing.
So it was like,

1063
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.930
it's like those all those guys,
you know,
it's what they do.
I love those guys.

1064
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.980
Um,
is the only thing I miss about the east coast,
but you know,
something,

1065
01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:51.650
I go back and it's,

1066
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:54.500
it's not the same because not the same as where I went to the seller a little

1067
01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:58.160
bit ago and the sellers the same.
But the vibe upstairs is not the same.

1068
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:01.800
Somebody said it's like going into like a one of those coffee bean.

1069
01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.550
It's just like all of the every reason that you were afraid to go in there now

1070
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:11.780
is gone.
Yeah.
And what they don't understand is that we were all scared.

1071
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:15.170
Like what I can't stand is how soft people are running shit now.

1072
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:18.470
It's like it's not making it better to make everything.

1073
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.340
So if this is so fucked up,
dude,
I was just,
you know,
I had to go to the doctor.

1074
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:25.120
Right.
I got,
I didn't realize I got super dehydrated on this,

1075
01:01:25.121 --> 01:01:27.980
this fucking flight back from uh,
Israel.
Right.

1076
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.950
Like it was on a plane for like 24 hours and I'll just watch five movies and

1077
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:32.180
didn't drink anything.
Shit.

1078
01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:35.030
That was the next day I felt like I had the clap or something.
It was just like,

1079
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.630
just like I didn't fuck anybody.
I know what the fuck's wrong with me.
Yeah.

1080
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:42.980
And I just been drinking like pure cranberry juice for two weeks and I'm finally

1081
01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:44.360
better and,

1082
01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:46.850
but I had to go to the doctor just to make sure everything was all right.
Right.

1083
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:51.440
So,
uh,
there was a diner downstairs so I out of the old school diner has like the

1084
01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.450
fucking,
you know,
you can just sit at the,
uh,

1085
01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:56.990
at the little bar area or to some bacon and eggs and they had the sports

1086
01:01:56.991 --> 01:02:00.230
illustrated swimsuit issue.
Yeah.

1087
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.680
And like Tyra banks is on the cover.
Right.
Still looks fucking great.

1088
01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:07.520
Match crushing it,
right?
Yeah.
And uh,
I'm like,
all right,

1089
01:02:07.521 --> 01:02:08.930
so that's that little thing that you know,

1090
01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:11.360
now they can see that she's in her forties and we're progressive.

1091
01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:12.200
We put it on the carpet,
dude.

1092
01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:15.980
I opened the thing up and the first two thing is too fat chicks in like string

1093
01:02:15.981 --> 01:02:19.860
bikinis.
And I'm like,
all right.

1094
01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:22.320
They had to do that just to be like blah,
blah blah.

1095
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:25.680
And then I turned and there's a hottie then there's like an older woman who does

1096
01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.710
Palladia who looks good for her age,
but I mean,
you know.
Yeah.

1097
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:31.110
And then there was another one that was like another tune.
It's just like,

1098
01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:35.490
what the fuck?
I just laughed.
I'm like,
got the Trans in the rainbow.

1099
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.620
I didn't even see,
but it's just like,
get it.
I,

1100
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:41.250
it's just like one of those fucking things where I just stick.

1101
01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:44.850
It's so fucking funny.
Like,

1102
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:49.080
like why can't you just accept the fact that you're not attend the way I do.

1103
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:53.220
Like I,
I never looked at Brad Pitt in fight club and be like,
Whoa,
you know,

1104
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:56.430
we just created an impossible image for me to live up to.

1105
01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:00.540
Now I have to have a pack abs.
It inspired me to go to the gym.

1106
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.630
I know I'm never gonna look like,
but they don't have to put like,

1107
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.220
like on the cover of men's health,

1108
01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:08.760
they don't have to have some guy with like a beer belly wearing a half a shirt.

1109
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:12.810
So I can feel better about myself and feel safe enough to open the fucking

1110
01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:13.710
magazine Dude.

1111
01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:17.040
These people that are incredible shape and that are beautiful and everything,

1112
01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:17.881
should it fuck it,

1113
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:22.881
inspire you or whatever to to to do something with you fucking life.

1114
01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:23.700
Yeah.

1115
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.540
Because they never talk about the other side of being that good looking where

1116
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:31.380
it's just like those people's careers are over and they're fucking thirties
yeah.

1117
01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:33.480
Big.
That's why Tyra banks is so smart that she,

1118
01:03:33.481 --> 01:03:34.920
she did the whole thing where it's now,

1119
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:39.150
now I'm going to pick the next good looking,
whatever,
you know,

1120
01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:41.370
but model whatever the fuck it is that they do over there.

1121
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:44.580
Like when everybody's trying to appease everybody,
like when Mcdonald's,

1122
01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:48.720
after that dot came out and it's like,
oh,
we got to be healthy.
It's like,
no,

1123
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:51.270
you gotta be Mcdonald's.
It's why I like Carl's Jr calls you and you're like,

1124
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.960
do you eat like shit?
Then fucking come on down.
Right.
Cause we,

1125
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:59.060
we don't give a fuck.
We'll put a Taco and I've seen comedians do that.
Camino,

1126
01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:01.350
there's no jokes here.
And then they tried to be the series coming,

1127
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:04.370
not the fucking serious comic.
Don't be that guy on the list to do.

1128
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.140
This will be a whole nother hour for you.
This let's just,
let's say a,

1129
01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:09.510
the name of the documentary is always amazing.
It's amazing.

1130
01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:14.370

And then you and I,

1133
01:04:21.511 --> 01:04:26.100
you were gracious enough to come down and do a great role for us in the opening

1134
01:04:26.101 --> 01:04:27.380
act due to hook me up,

1135
01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:30.870

1136
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:32.970
year.
So everything,

Cause you're making your own opportunity out here in so many people just sit on

1138
01:04:36.211 --> 01:04:38.680
the couch and bitch and you're fucking work in your ad.

1139
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:42.090
I could tell by that inhale and exhale,
you just did how fucking tired you are.

1140
01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.250
Yeah,
no,
I totally respect what you're doing and you're,

1141
01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.690

you know,

1142
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:53.190
is invincible as you can be out here.
You got to bet on yourself,
dude.
So yeah,

1143
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:56.040
I'm proud of you,
Steve Byrne.
Everybody,
thank you so much for coming down.

1144
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.053
You got to bill.
Thanks for having.

1145
01:04:57.330 --> 01:05:00.010
<v 2>All right.
Is He advertising helix?</v>

1146
01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:05.490
Helux he lose sleep asleep quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use

1147
01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:10.510
the answers to match the body type and sleep preferences to the perfect

1148
01:05:10.511 --> 01:05:15.190
mattress.
Whether you're a side sleeper,
a hot sleeper,

1149
01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:19.480
like a plush or firm bread bed,
sorry,
with Helickson he likes,

1150
01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:22.960
there's no more guessing or compromising.
So just go to helix,

1151
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.830
sleep.com/bird take their two minutes sleep,

1152
01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:31.390
quiz gross and no match you to a mattress that will keep you,
uh,

1153
01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.750

For couples,

1154
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.590
he looks can even split the mattress down the middle,

1155
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.750

1156
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:49.240
Helic sleep was even awarded the number one best overall mattress pickup 20,019

1157
01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:50.080
by Gq.

1158
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:54.790
And why had magazine and CNN called it the most comfortable mattress they've

1159
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:57.940
ever slept on.
They also endorsed Hillary Clinton.

1160
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.250
Sorry that I mentioned them in a public bathroom reading this.

1161
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:06.250
That's why it's echoing the unknown.
I'm not taking a shit.
Uh,

1162
01:06:06.251 --> 01:06:11.251
they have a 10 year warranty and you get to try it out for hundreds for 100

1163
01:06:12.701 --> 01:06:15.610
nights risk free rouse.

1164
01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:20.230

1167
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:31.060
He likes sleep.com/.
Burn uh,
it's a long story.

1168
01:06:31.061 --> 01:06:34.000
Why I'm in this fucking bathroom than doing rehearsals in the other room.

1169
01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:35.910
And this is the only fucking quiet place and rights.

1170
01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.680
Don't give me any shit but shit box.

1171
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:44.110

<v 1>happy Memorial Day.

You should be out at a parade for the trues,

1204
01:09:12.831 --> 01:09:17.831
but you're just sleep it off a hangover because you are a fucking selfish con.

1205
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:24.200
You wave hello to the troops at the airport,

[inaudible] Hey,

01:09:34.961 --> 01:09:38.890

I'm in my bed too.
I notice you have racist.

1209
01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:42.430
I have braces too.
What's that line from?
Hi everybody,

1210
01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:47.440
The p for some butthead movie.
Oh boy.
Oh boy who took Tylenol pm last night.

1211
01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:52.420
I did.
I roofed feed myself.
Everybody you ever just really,

1212
01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:56.170
really,
really fucking tired.
Fucking tired.
Joe,

1213
01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:01.180
Joe and I slept like a fucking stone kit.
Um,

1214
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.360
I was really tired last night.
I was nodding off.

1215
01:10:04.361 --> 01:10:08.920
I was on my couch and I'm,
what the fuck was I doing?

1216
01:10:08.921 --> 01:10:11.530
I was dealing with my dog.
Who's afraid of the wind?

1217
01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:16.030
He's like the wind.
Am I going to sing this whole fucking podcast?

1218
01:10:16.031 --> 01:10:18.100
My dog does not like wind.

1219
01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:23.080
It freaks the fucking thing out and it eats it's way out of its cage.

1220
01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:27.280
I call it the cage.
The dog trainer calls it the Casa,

1221
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:30.790
which is Spanish for the cage.

1222
01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:38.320
No,
it is it.
Um,
I took two years of f ban.

1223
01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:44.570
Ya'll CBU play and Kartha means health for what he's suggesting as it's not a

1224
01:10:45.611 --> 01:10:46.090
cage.

1225
01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:50.890
Cage implies that it's something negative and you tell what?

1226
01:10:50.891 --> 01:10:55.570
I have a shut up.
You useless cunt.
All right.

1227
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.920
Go Trim your fucking bitch and stay out of my head.

1228
01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.780
All right.
It's a fucking cage.
The dog is in acute breaks out of a house.

1229
01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.990
You know,
you break into a house.
Oh my God,
it's so awesome.

1230
01:11:10.991 --> 01:11:15.600
I have to get in there and see what kind of they have you break into a house,

1231
01:11:15.601 --> 01:11:20.220
but when you break out of a structure,
um,
that's not a home.

1232
01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:21.690
Okay.

1233
01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:25.260
When you don't give a fuck that your gums are bleeding and you're scraping the

1234
01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:30.261
chest hair off of your torso so you can squeeze through a fucking porthole that

1235
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:35.460
your fat ass body can't fit through.
That's not a house.
That's not a Casa.

1236
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:39.420
That's not lemay,
Saul or whatever the fuck it is in French.

1237
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:46.410
Uh,
I can't think of what does it mean with a ch?
What is French for house?

1238
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:48.660
Chapeau was a fucking hat.

1239
01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.690
Sh lasha me's was a shirt.

1240
01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:57.190
I'll show me a young,
um,
no ma'am.

1241
01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.670
[inaudible] I go fuck yourself.
I flunked.
He know something.

1242
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.990
I actually took French one pass that then was to put,

1243
01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:08.190
was too dumb to go on to French too.
So they actually had French to a,

1244
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:12.920
the AAA of fucking French part da and a,

1245
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:16.080
I flunked so bad.
I flunked that class so badly.

1246
01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:20.310
My Dad made me go back to French one to get the basics.
And,
uh,

1247
01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:21.900
I then went back and flunked that.

1248
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:30.450
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
Still a little sick people.

1249
01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:32.760
If you wonder why I'm a comedian,
that little,

1250
01:12:32.761 --> 01:12:34.680
that little story I just gave you right there,

1251
01:12:34.681 --> 01:12:37.560
then I'll let you know right there.
Then I'll let you know.
You know,

1252
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:41.700
the fact that I could go back in time and do worse than I did the first time,

1253
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:47.190
you know?
Do you guys ever see back to the future when a Marty McFly goes back?

1254
01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:48.091
You know,

1255
01:12:48.091 --> 01:12:51.000
and he just starts writing all the rungs and when he comes back to the future,

1256
01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:54.090
he's got a Toyota four runner,
right?

1257
01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:56.460
And everything worked out and he got the girl of his dreams.

1258
01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:00.330
I did that in real life.
I went back in time,

1259
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.450
I went back to French one and I actually ended up doing worse.

1260
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:06.780
So because of that,
I never liked that trilogy.

1261
01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:10.650
Everyone else was just going along for the ride and I was sitting there going

1262
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.770
through this fucking bullshit.
All right.
He'd go back in time and,

1263
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.410
and he would do even fucking worse.
Um,
all right,

1264
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.520
let's move on here.
This is the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody,
um,

1265
01:13:23.521 --> 01:13:27.360
for those of you who enjoy the sound of my voice and feel like he can't get

1266
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:32.220
enough of it,
um,
just in case you missed it.
Last week,
I actually was on a,

1267
01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:35.610
the Adam Carolla podcast.
Uh,

1268
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.760
the most downloaded podcast in the history of podcasting.

1269
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.990
They even had the t shirts,

1270
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:47.490
some sort of Guinness Book of world's records that they set for a number of

1271
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:52.020
downloads.
I was on last week's episode and I had a great fucking time.

1272
01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:55.530
Um,
which one was recorded live at?

1273
01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.050
Jon Lovitz is a comedy club at Universal,
uh,

1274
01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:02.640
fucking strip mall,

1275
01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:06.330
whatever the fuck you call that thing is this big thing out here called

1276
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:07.183
universal.

1277
01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:11.290
I think they used to make movies and at some point they just made a left turn

1278
01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:11.771
and they were like,

1279
01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:16.690
let's just stick like 12 shitty restaurants next to each other and a big imax

1280
01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:21.190
theater.
And then we'll have some stupid rides.
And a,

1281
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:24.790
I got a fail in that.
A bunch of fat fucks in Hawaiian shirts will show up.

1282
01:14:24.791 --> 01:14:28.150
What do you guys think?
And they all went,
yeah,
let's fucking do it.
You know what?

1283
01:14:28.151 --> 01:14:30.940
They were right.
They were right.

1284
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:36.130
Punch of fatties walking around with this swollen feet.
You have a look,

1285
01:14:36.131 --> 01:14:38.500
you have a look down in fat people's feet.
You have a look at that shit.

1286
01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:42.880
You know they're already fat because they eat a whole bag of fucking m and m's

1287
01:14:42.881 --> 01:14:45.670
on the way over there.
One of those giant fucking bags,

1288
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:51.190
you know the kind of bag.
It's so fucking big that if you will,

1289
01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:55.120
making a brick wall.
If one of the bricks was just the bag of m and m's,

1290
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:58.300
you would,
there wouldn't,
it wouldn't compromise the structure.

1291
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:01.450
You could just concrete right over the fucking thing.
Well,

1292
01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.620
it's with the yellow brick.
That's a big bag of m and m sweetheart.

1293
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:09.150
My fat fucking uncle showed up with that and uh,

1294
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.920
I dropped it on the ground and uh,

1295
01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:16.510
he couldn't pick it up and we just sat there laughing at a,
I come on,

1296
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.260
I don't know how I'll be picking it up,
but we just sat there laughing at him.

1297
01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:24.970
You pick it up,
you fat.
Fuck,
c'mon.
Earn it.
Earn it,
Tommy.

1298
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:29.950
Hey,
look it up.
Go fairy.
Try to pick up his bag of M and.
M's.
Well,

1299
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:33.230
see the problem was there was a,
there was a bit of a,
a,

1300
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:36.370
I probably have 15% grade in my front yard,

1301
01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.340
so the fat fuck bends down and he rolled,

1302
01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.080
he fell backwards on his big toddler ass and I whacked his head off the curb.

1303
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.480
And,
uh,
I went to jail for eight months on a manslaughter charge.
And a,

1304
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:52.950
I also have to,
part of my community service is I have to,
uh,

1305
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:57.130
talk about the dangers of bullying,
but in a tribute to him,

1306
01:15:57.131 --> 01:16:00.610
we took that big bag of m and m's.
Then we,
uh,
we put it right in the wall there.

1307
01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.740
God rest his soul.
Um,
all right,
what the fuck am I talking about?

1308
01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.140
That and the Monday morning podcast has a donation button.

1309
01:16:08.141 --> 01:16:12.160
Everybody do you have a dollar?
You got 20 bucks,

1310
01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:15.070
just burning a hole in your pocket.
What are you going to do it?

1311
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:16.270
When are you gonna do with that money?
Huh?

1312
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.440
You're going to spend it on that fucking unappreciative cunt sitting across from

1313
01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:24.190
me right now who can't hear what you're listening to.
Huh?

1314
01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.010
You can listen to it on your iPod and she sitting right across from her.

1315
01:16:27.011 --> 01:16:31.690
Look at her.
Look at that stupid fucking side of her face.
Yeah.

1316
01:16:31.691 --> 01:16:34.600
You married that.
You're legally bound to that.

1317
01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.780
What are you going to do spending on a 20 bucks on her?

1318
01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.710
Getting her some sort of fucking,
I dunno,
appetizer at Applebee's.

1319
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:45.760
Is that what you're going to do?
Is that what you're laughing right now?

1320
01:16:45.761 --> 01:16:48.040
Aren't ya?
This is worth the 20.
She isn't,

1321
01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:52.510
she's not going to give a fuck what she doing right now looking around the room,

1322
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.900
you know,
looking for,
for a fucking a different deck with the,

1323
01:16:56.901 --> 01:17:00.670
with the bigger dollar sign on it.
Uh,
you know,

1324
01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:04.030
you wouldn't know that this was a holiday with the amount of meanness that I'm

1325
01:17:04.031 --> 01:17:06.100
spewing here.
I'm a little frustrated.

1326
01:17:06.101 --> 01:17:10.340
I'm still trying to get over this fucking cold that I've had all God damn week.

1327
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:16.130
And I'm also frustrated because I've been going on stage going off in support of

1328
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:19.940
Lance Armstrong and I'm really beginning to realize how few people give a shit

1329
01:17:19.941 --> 01:17:21.080
about bicycle racing.

1330
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:24.223
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1331
01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.930
<v 4>You know,
I actually got to be honest with you,</v>

1332
01:17:25.931 --> 01:17:28.600
I actually put that out there and somebody connected with the tour,

1333
01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.880
sent me an email and uh,

1334
01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.230
said he thought that the shit I said last week was fucking hilarious when I was

1335
01:17:35.231 --> 01:17:37.540
trashing that fucking cunt,

1336
01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.640
that piece of shit.
Tyler Hamilton,

1337
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:47.850
Tyler Hamilton,
you want,
you guys understand first of all,

1338
01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.910
those of you are actually keeping up on the Lance Armstrong story.

1339
01:17:50.911 --> 01:17:53.610
All four of you.
Um,

1340
01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.780
do you understand that he's not going to get caught.

1341
01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:02.620
The guy took fucking 500 Goddamn test.

1342
01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.150
He passed them all.

1343
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:09.490
So now all they can do is just get people to say that they saw him do it.

1344
01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:11.380
That's not going to hold up in court.

1345
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:16.590
And not to mention the people coming forward are fucking known cheats.

1346
01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:22.550
You know,
Tyler Hamilton,
this fucking cunt.
This is his background.

1347
01:18:22.551 --> 01:18:25.910
The falls or this guy,
American cyclists.

1348
01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.320
Tyler Hamilton announced his retirement Friday.
This is a an article.

1349
01:18:30.321 --> 01:18:35.150
October eight I'm sorry,
April 18th,
2009 Oh,
I did research this week.

1350
01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:36.513
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1351
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:39.230
<v 4>Okay.
Now it's just retirement Friday.
Why?</v>

1352
01:18:39.231 --> 01:18:42.560
Because he had accomplished everything he could accomplish in that wonderful

1353
01:18:42.561 --> 01:18:47.240
sport.
No.
He retired Friday after testing positive for this steroid,

1354
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:48.380
d,
h,
e,

1355
01:18:48.381 --> 01:18:53.381
a which he said he knowingly ingested in an over the counter herbal and anti

1356
01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.770
depressant.
All right,
here's a guy.

1357
01:18:57.771 --> 01:19:00.230
He's on antidepressants and he's taken steroids.

1358
01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:04.880
This is the guy that's going to bring it down.
A known fucking cheat.
He was just,

1359
01:19:04.881 --> 01:19:09.881
it was the second doping offense for the veteran writer who tested positive for,

1360
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:16.650
no,
I don't want to offend gay people here.
He tested positive for Homo logo,

1361
01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.040
a lot of blood transfusion.

1362
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:23.630
You've got a big bag of semen evidently shot into his fucking veins to add to

1363
01:19:23.631 --> 01:19:28.520
the testosterone.
Jesus Christ out of fucked any win that year,
a Houma Globe,

1364
01:19:28.710 --> 01:19:29.420
Glue,
Glue Bolus,

1365
01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:34.010
blood transfusion 2004 and served a mandatory two years suspension even as he

1366
01:19:34.011 --> 01:19:36.650
disputed the test results through two rounds of arbitration.

1367
01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:40.010
These are the kinds of people who are coming up.
All right,

1368
01:19:40.011 --> 01:19:44.570
this guy's life's over.
He rode a bicycle until he was 30,
you know?

1369
01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:48.110
Do you realize how big a hole that is in your resume when you try to get back

1370
01:19:48.111 --> 01:19:50.810
into the real world and try and get a desk job?

1371
01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:52.140
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1372
01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:54.150
<v 4>Gee,
you know,
it's weird.
Um,</v>

1373
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:59.550
do you have any sort of job experience?
Um,

1374
01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.720
I wrote a bicycle from age eight to 30.

1375
01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:08.310
Yeah.
And um,
did I got fired?

1376
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:13.500
I got fired from riding a bicycle and now I would like a management position.

1377
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:19.200
Hey Tyler,
why don't you go fuck yourself?
So then what does he do a lot?
Jesus,

1378
01:20:19.201 --> 01:20:24.120
what do I do?
Do I write up book?
I don't want to write a book.
That's work.

1379
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:28.120
What else should I do?
What if I just go on 60 minutes and I ran out?

1380
01:20:28.121 --> 01:20:29.110
Lance Armstrong,

1381
01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.510
you piece of Shit Douche bag or the fucking month.

1382
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:41.520
This fucking guy,
Tyler Hamilton.
You Bill.
I just can't believe that shit.
Okay.

1383
01:20:41.521 --> 01:20:45.510
First of all,
people,
I'm going to tell you this right now.

1384
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.760
You can't ride a bicycle.
I said it last week.

1385
01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:51.380
You can't ride a bicycle 30 miles a fucking hour up a god Damn Mountain.

1386
01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.100
All right.
For a month.

1387
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:57.500
You can't do that without being on drugs.
All right,

1388
01:20:57.530 --> 01:21:02.180
so get your fucking heads out of Santa Claus Ass.
They're all on drugs.

1389
01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.320
Okay?
They're on drugs.
Yes.
All of them.
So what are you gonna do?

1390
01:21:08.321 --> 01:21:11.140
You gotta take it away from Lance and give it to the other drugged up guys,

1391
01:21:11.230 --> 01:21:12.460
this is fucking stupid.

1392
01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:17.290
This is the 2004 red sox versus the 2004 Yankees are roided up guys.

1393
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:20.140
Beat your,
wrote it up guys.
He wants seven in a row.

1394
01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:26.940
He wants seven in a row.
Case closed onto the next one.

1395
01:21:26.941 --> 01:21:31.380
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Voices in my head stopped bringing it up.

1396
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.040
God Damn it.
I've got to blow my nose.
Hang on a second.
I've got to hit pause.

1397
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:40.700
All right,
I'm back.
Jesus Christ.
I swear to God.

1398
01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:43.490
If this fucking cold last one more damn day.

1399
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.360
I'm shaving the mustache right out of my beer and I'm going to look like fucking

1400
01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:48.194
Abe Lincoln.

1401
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:52.880
Nothing worse than blowing your nose when you got a mustache.

1402
01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:58.160
It's like a four hour process.
All right.
So anyways,
back to the damn podcast.

1403
01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:02.570
Speaking of sports,
um,

1404
01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.290
how bout those Boston Bruins,
Huh?

1405
01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:11.180
All you fucking heinous.
Where's your team?

1406
01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:16.010
Huh?
Are there out there?
Little fucking charity.

1407
01:22:16.011 --> 01:22:19.640
Golf game raising money for cancer.

1408
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.680
That's what they're doing.
There's only two teams left.
People,

1409
01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:30.280
the Boston Bruins and the Vancouver Canucks.

1410
01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:37.210
The only professional sports team that throughout it's history has dressed worse

1411
01:22:37.781 --> 01:22:38.860
than Sinbad.

1412
01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.000
The ugliest fucking uniforms,

1413
01:22:46.001 --> 01:22:51.001
ladies and gentlemen known to fucking man known to all of sports for a good 20

1414
01:22:52.271 --> 01:22:55.690
fucking years.
Horrific apps.

1415
01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:00.720
They came out of the gate with one of the great uniforms of all fucking time.

1416
01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:03.340
And then what happened?

1417
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:08.440
What happened in the 80s they decided we need to switch it up a little bit.
See,

1418
01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:11.590
the problem is,
is not only are they in Canada,

1419
01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:16.360
they're way on the west coast way out.

1420
01:23:16.361 --> 01:23:18.580
They don't even know what the fuck's going on.

1421
01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:20.860
They don't know what styles are in.

1422
01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:26.640
So when the fucking early eighties they switched their goddamn uniform,

1423
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:29.350
something like that.
You know what it was,

1424
01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:34.351
was disco finally made it to Vancouver by 1982 and when everybody else was

1425
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:37.390
listening to the talking heads,
right?

1426
01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:42.970
The last couple of police albums,
they were still up there,
do a little dance,

1427
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.430
make a really rough,

1428
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.330
and then they came up with the ugliest fucking God damn uniform I've ever seen

1429
01:23:49.331 --> 01:23:53.440
in my life.
And uh,
the away jerseys were bad enough,

1430
01:23:53.441 --> 01:23:58.210
but the home ones,
I'm telling you where the ugly,
there's a picture of Cam Neely,

1431
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.540
I'm going to have it up on the f the man podcast.com,

1432
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:05.680
the official fan page of the Monday morning podcast of him in that uniform.

1433
01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:08.110
And I swear to God,
when you see him in that uniform,

1434
01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.720
you would actually consider dropping the gloves with the guy.

1435
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.700
That's how bad these fucking uniforms are.

1436
01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:18.210
So these douche bags and their little fucking mining town way on the west coast

1437
01:24:20.111 --> 01:24:22.570
to Canada and way out there,
you know,

1438
01:24:22.571 --> 01:24:26.140
they live on the other side of the fucking Rockies.
Okay.

1439
01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:29.980
Whey the fuck out there.
All right.
Like,

1440
01:24:29.981 --> 01:24:34.030
if you were in Seattle and decided that you were going to drive to Alaska,

1441
01:24:34.230 --> 01:24:37.600
there'd only be one little shit ass fucking town on the way there.

1442
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:42.260
And that town is called Vancouver.
And you know what's funny about those cons?

1443
01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.500
They actually think that they're cosmopolitan up there.

1444
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:48.400
They got a bit of an attitude.
People they think that they have this fucking,

1445
01:24:48.401 --> 01:24:52.510
Oh let's do some ecstasy.
We got a couple of nightclubs up here.
All right,

1446
01:24:52.511 --> 01:24:57.511
so what are these dumb cunts do after they for fucking years where the ugliest

1447
01:24:57.701 --> 01:25:01.090
fucking hunk of shit uniform I've ever seen in my life.

1448
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:04.510
I remember being in sixth grade when I saw that uniform going.

1449
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:09.370
That is fucking horrific.
You know,
I'm in sixth grade people,

1450
01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:12.850
I just stopped coloring.
I should have loved that uniform.

1451
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.550
That's what it looks like.
It looks like one of five-year-old number.

1452
01:25:15.551 --> 01:25:18.340
When you did that when you were five and you're grabbed every crayon in the box

1453
01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.310
and you just started writing letters,
you know,

1454
01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:25.270
cause you thought that would make the fucking girl look at you.
You know,

1455
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:28.240
cause you knew you wanted to do something to but you didn't quite know what

1456
01:25:28.241 --> 01:25:31.690
because there was no internet so he didn't know what fucking was yet because you

1457
01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:34.390
weren't allowed to have a childhood.
You know,

1458
01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.870
that's what those fucking uniforms look like.

1459
01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:41.320
And you know what's amazing is these motherfuckers,

1460
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.440
they finally admit that they made a fashion error and they go back to the

1461
01:25:47.801 --> 01:25:51.520
original good idea that they had.
And then what do they do?

1462
01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:55.150
They fuck it up.
They fucked it up.

1463
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.120
They went back to the blue and white with the little bit of green.

1464
01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:03.640
Then they got to see on their thing and then they got this fucking killer coming

1465
01:26:03.981 --> 01:26:08.981
out of the top of the seat looking like a fucking whale sent are terrific.

1466
01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.170
They just,
you know what it is.

1467
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:16.400
They just couldn't 100% admit that they made a fucking mistake.

1468
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.350
And you're just went back to the original,

1469
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:23.190
which is what the fuck they should have done.
Just like the jets
is dumb.

1470
01:26:23.191 --> 01:26:24.480
As those green cons are,

1471
01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:28.530
they realize that those uniforms they wore with Richard Todd and Freeman McNeil

1472
01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.770
wear a fucking machine steak.
Terrible mistake.

1473
01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:37.760
Bill Parcells came in right with his big fucking bunt pushing out as dockers and

1474
01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:44.160
he says,
listen,
we're going back to the original.
And they were like,
Whoa,

1475
01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.260
let's slow days because we want to win.

1476
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:50.010
Everybody out there is going to go out there dress like Joe Willie.

1477
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:51.710
You got a fucking problem with that.

1478
01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.860
Wesley Walker doesn't have a ring rest my case.

1479
01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:58.150
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:26:58.150 --> 01:27:02.300
<v 4>Actually I think he wore it early on.
I shouldn't have picked him.
Whatever.</v>

1481
01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:07.160
Marty Lyons never got a ring even though he looked like Merlin Olsen.

1482
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:10.670
Ah Fuck.
Hang on a second,
Jason.

1483
01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.190
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1484
01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:16.300
<v 4>All right,
I'm back.
Where was I?
Oh,
that's right.
Trashing the Vancouver Canucks.</v>

1485
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:17.660
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1486
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:21.740
<v 4>And that little mining town way out there on the west coast and British Columbia</v>

1487
01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:25.520
.
Yeah.
So they couldn't admit that they made a fucking mistake.

1488
01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:28.610
So now they've got this whale coming out of the letter C.

1489
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:33.210
I fucking hate it.
I went up there,

1490
01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.780
I went to a game up there and I wanted to get a fucking Jersey and I just

1491
01:27:36.781 --> 01:27:39.180
couldn't get myself to do,
you know,
I was like,
all right,

1492
01:27:39.181 --> 01:27:43.710
I'm living on the west coast now.
I need a west coast team.
I liked the Canucks.

1493
01:27:43.711 --> 01:27:46.350
I liked that they went back to their uniform and then I looked at it closely and

1494
01:27:46.351 --> 01:27:49.950
I saw that stupid whale coming out of there looking like when that fucking alien

1495
01:27:49.951 --> 01:27:53.010
thing comes out of that dude's stomach in that movie,
I can't remember.

1496
01:27:54.690 --> 01:27:57.390
You know that thing that comes out of the fucking alien,
you know?

1497
01:27:57.391 --> 01:27:59.580
Remember when the alien in that movie alien,
right?

1498
01:28:00.090 --> 01:28:04.530
Did I say alien enough times in that sentence when it opens its mouth and then

1499
01:28:04.531 --> 01:28:08.490
for some reason rather than using its big mouth,
it's uses it's little mouth,

1500
01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:10.010
that nibble thing.
That's what it has.

1501
01:28:10.110 --> 01:28:13.290
They have the whale version of that coming out of the letter c that just,

1502
01:28:13.291 --> 01:28:16.560
you know,
I don't fucking know.

1503
01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.070
Then they got to the fucking twins there.

1504
01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:24.920
You know who has brothers on the same fucking team isn't,

1505
01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:26.190
they'll have a rule against that.

1506
01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.350
I know you can't have all a bunch of brothers on the same battle ship because of

1507
01:28:31.410 --> 01:28:36.320
that time in the World War II when the boat got sunk and then some poor mom and

1508
01:28:36.321 --> 01:28:38.900
dad,
they lost five kids at the same fucking time.

1509
01:28:38.901 --> 01:28:40.610
Isn't that the same rule with sports?

1510
01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.130
Why do you got to blood relatives on the same goddamn tea?
Why is,

1511
01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.560
what is it like a mom and pop?
Fucking a
hard,
yeah.

1512
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:54.130
[inaudible] ah,
the motherfuckers,
I'm just trying to work up some hatred.

1513
01:28:54.131 --> 01:28:56.260
I really don't have any hatred for Vancouver.

1514
01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.720
I really don't even know shit about your city.
You know why?

1515
01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:02.400
Cause you never in the nose except once every fucking

1516
01:29:02.890 --> 01:29:06.960
<v 6>goddamn millennium.
You're hosting the Olympics.
You know why?
Why?</v>

1517
01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:11.970
Cause you got snow.
It's not because you got a good fucking city.

1518
01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:16.230
Hey cleo,
knock it off.

1519
01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.420
<v 4>God Damn dog might I have a pit bull that's afraid of the wind.</v>

1520
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:27.650
She's like the wind.
What does that song about?
She's like,

1521
01:29:27.651 --> 01:29:31.010
the weird is that about love last?
Do you know what?

1522
01:29:31.011 --> 01:29:35.960
I was watching a one of these goddamn these channels that shows,
um,
you know,

1523
01:29:35.961 --> 01:29:37.190
it's more Memorial Day weekend,

1524
01:29:37.191 --> 01:29:39.980
so they've given all their talking heads the fucking weekend off.

1525
01:29:39.981 --> 01:29:43.900
So they just showing a bunch of rock concerts.
And I saw though,
I,
here's,

1526
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:46.670
here's my underrated,
underrated overrated for the week,

1527
01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:51.410
underrated the who live concert video with the isle of Wight,

1528
01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:56.940
um,
best Keith Moon footage you're ever going to fucking see.

1529
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.760
I've never been that into Keith Moon.
I like the,

1530
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:06.070
I love the WHO I love,
they're recorded music,
but I've never seen good footage.

1531
01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:11.300
It's so he's always on TV like pretending to drum,
you know,

1532
01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.820
or like magic bus or something like that.

1533
01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:17.180
And he has a weird way of holding the sticks.
So just because of that,

1534
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:18.740
that never seemed like there was a lot of power.

1535
01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:22.850
And then there was that one where he blew his drum kit up and p towns in hurt is

1536
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:25.700
here.
And I always find that was something,
I always fucking hate it.

1537
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:29.640
I hated how they destroyed their instruments.

1538
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:35.090
If I didn't fucking I,
you know,
just watching,
you know,
watching peach,

1539
01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:38.300
smashing a guitar.
Whenever I watched it,
I was like,
dude,
just give it to me.

1540
01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.240
Give it to somebody in the crab.
Why would you do that?

1541
01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:46.830
There's a bunch of wannabe rock stars in the crowd that would kill for that

1542
01:30:46.831 --> 01:30:50.700
guitar.
Peter,
you put that guitar down,

1543
01:30:50.701 --> 01:30:52.950
young man to man,

1544
01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:57.660
to people teased you about your big fucking knows you're a rock star now knock

1545
01:30:57.661 --> 01:31:02.310
it off or they beat blows up that drum kit.
It just,
it makes you sick.

1546
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:06.790
Makes you fucking sick me.
Anyways,
so anyway,

1547
01:31:06.791 --> 01:31:10.260
so I never saw any good footage to that guy.
I already knew he was a beast.

1548
01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:11.363
That guy,

1549
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.160
that guy fucking without a doubt,

1550
01:31:18.210 --> 01:31:21.000
without a doubt.
One of the most original drummers of all time.

1551
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:26.540
Dare I say the most original rock drummer ever.
I love fucking John Bonam and,

1552
01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.190
and he lay down the blueprint.

1553
01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:35.140
But when I hear bond and play,
I mean he,
granted,

1554
01:31:35.141 --> 01:31:38.680
he put it put deep,
put a 20 years into the future,

1555
01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:45.080
but still I kind of could see some sort of like,
I,
I look at Keith Moon,

1556
01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:48.400
I don't see any link to what the fuck are you?
What do you do?
Watch Tito pointy.

1557
01:31:49.190 --> 01:31:50.960
It's like he was like a percussionist.

1558
01:31:52.130 --> 01:31:54.770
He should've been standing up with some Tin Balis away.
The guy was playing.

1559
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:58.160
It's just,
it's fucking mind blowing.
Absolutely.

1560
01:31:58.161 --> 01:32:01.750
My blown he spent in the stacks and he's doing this thing where he slaps it on

1561
01:32:01.751 --> 01:32:03.460
the snare and it goes flying up in the air.
I'm like,

1562
01:32:03.461 --> 01:32:05.320
that's what Tommy Lee got that shit.

1563
01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:12.520
So that's my underrated for the week.
Somebody actually has an overrated,

1564
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:16.870
uh,
what the fuck is it?
Here,
let me get,
let me,
let me overrate it.

1565
01:32:16.871 --> 01:32:21.580
The state of Florida's sports fans,
a Miami Heat band,

1566
01:32:21.581 --> 01:32:25.960
wagoners,
Florida Marlins,
uh,
Orlando fans,

1567
01:32:25.961 --> 01:32:30.070
Jacksonville jags are rumored to be moving at the beginning

1568
01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.010
of two years ago.
Florida panthers suck.
It's Cetera,
et cetera.

1569
01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:38.950
Though that is the most lazy overrated.

1570
01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.220
You started off where you're actually making some points and then you just threw

1571
01:32:43.221 --> 01:32:47.500
out a bunch of topics.
He just putting it on my shoulders.
I got to bring it home.

1572
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:49.421
That's what you did.

1573
01:32:49.421 --> 01:32:52.780
You just started a project like some broad and then you're like,
can you just,

1574
01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:57.540
can you come in here honey,
can you come in here for a second?

1575
01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:04.250
What?
I thought you said you were cleaning the kitchen.
Yeah,
I know.
I just didn't,

1576
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:08.290
I wanted to do behind your refrigerator.
It just move for a second.

1577
01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.860
No,
you fucking move it.

1578
01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:12.670
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1579
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.920
<v 4>This is what I'm talking about.
Uh,</v>

1580
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:20.000
that's what you just did to me in that overrated there.
I got to go off of that.

1581
01:33:20.001 --> 01:33:24.020
Let me tell you something.
I hate to tell you this.
Every sports franchise,

1582
01:33:25.190 --> 01:33:29.300
Everybody's bandwagon.
Alright,
go look at footage of one.

1583
01:33:29.301 --> 01:33:31.700
Your team sucked.
You know,

1584
01:33:31.701 --> 01:33:36.701
you think I was watching the Bruins after fucking Ray Bourque left and we sucked

1585
01:33:37.161 --> 01:33:40.490
a big bag of dicks for like three years to be honest with you.

1586
01:33:40.491 --> 01:33:43.400
I had a lot to do with that clutch and grab fucking awful shit.

1587
01:33:44.150 --> 01:33:47.720
Just a terrible period for hockey,
you know?

1588
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:50.750
No wonder Tampa one a fucking God.
Damn.
I mean that,
that's,

1589
01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:53.150
that's why they had this strike.
They were like,

1590
01:33:53.151 --> 01:33:56.930
how fucking bad is our league that the Tampa Bay lightning just won a Stanley

1591
01:33:56.930 --> 01:34:00.440
Cup?
Did you see that Stanley Cup parade?
There was like eight people there.

1592
01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.950
You know,
I thought it was a fucking spit town.

1593
01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:05.883
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1594
01:34:07.230 --> 01:34:09.630
<v 4>Yeah.
So I would say everybody,
you know,
that,
that you know,</v>

1595
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:12.510
you've got Bandwagon for Yankee Fans are bandwagon fans.

1596
01:34:12.511 --> 01:34:17.511
If you watch highlights of them in the eighties or when Roger Maris broke Babe

1597
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.320
Ruth's fucking home run record.
I mean,

1598
01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:22.290
you could have fucking walked up to the gate and bought a stack of fucking 20

1599
01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:25.980
tickets all next to each other out in the Goddamn outfield.

1600
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.560
You know?
Fuck it.
There was nobody at Bruins games.
Nobody had Celtic games.

1601
01:34:31.561 --> 01:34:32.281
When we suck that,

1602
01:34:32.281 --> 01:34:34.620
we get the big three and then all of a sudden everybody's there.

1603
01:34:34.621 --> 01:34:35.940
Everybody's got bandwagon fans.

1604
01:34:40.190 --> 01:34:40.200
<v 5>MMM Man.</v>

1605
01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.920
<v 4>I also think Jacksonville's moving out because it's Jacksonville.
You know,</v>

1606
01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.970
what do they got one radio station out there and no one gives a fuck about them.

1607
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:52.790
I Dunno.
I don't think the state of Florida has bad sports fans.

1608
01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.990
They got fucking unbelievable college football,
the hurricanes,

1609
01:34:57.650 --> 01:35:01.430
Seminoles.
Who else they got?

1610
01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:03.170
They got the Florida fucking gators.

1611
01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:07.580
Maybe if they're fucking college sports where it's so great,
they,
they,

1612
01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:11.360
they would actually show up to a program.
I don't know,
other than a Tampa.

1613
01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.890
Tampa just sucks man.

1614
01:35:12.891 --> 01:35:17.840
They got the Buccaneers right who just sucked every year.

1615
01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:22.340
But one,
why am I still picking on them?
There were the rear view mirror.

1616
01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:27.320
Congratulations.
What a fucking play off series that was.
I'm just,
by the way,

1617
01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:29.780
I'm just breaking balls by the way,
for all you dumb cons.

1618
01:35:29.781 --> 01:35:33.170
Who actually take this seriously?
My Belper hates Tampa.

1619
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:36.620
He doesn't like Vancouver.
Uh,
no.

1620
01:35:36.621 --> 01:35:41.150
My teams are playing you guys and uh,
my team is not as good as your team.

1621
01:35:41.151 --> 01:35:45.140
So what I do is I just trash your city and if you're dumb enough to take the

1622
01:35:45.141 --> 01:35:49.760
fucking Bait,
I get a nice debate going.
Cause if you want to argue facts,

1623
01:35:50.730 --> 01:35:51.190
<v 7>okay.</v>

1624
01:35:51.190 --> 01:35:53.170
<v 4>All you had to do was a lightning fan is just say,</v>

1625
01:35:53.171 --> 01:35:55.670
well we want it know for you fucking dump content.

1626
01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:58.210
And that would've been the end of it.
But you were too stupid to do it.

1627
01:35:58.630 --> 01:36:03.010
You sat there defending houseboats for some unknown reason.
So anyways,

1628
01:36:03.011 --> 01:36:04.330
the Stanley Cup finals this year,

1629
01:36:04.331 --> 01:36:07.570
is this a Boston Bruins versus Vancouver Canucks in case you haven't figured

1630
01:36:07.571 --> 01:36:12.571
that out and we haven't won it since 1972 and the Vancouver Canucks have never

1631
01:36:13.091 --> 01:36:16.840
won it.
So if you ever wanted to get into hockey,

1632
01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:21.670
this would be the series to watch because the fans are going to be ridiculously

1633
01:36:21.671 --> 01:36:26.620
excited because one group of fans have been waiting for 39 years and the other

1634
01:36:26.621 --> 01:36:30.770
group had been waiting their entire hockey lives.
All right,

1635
01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:34.180
so predictions for this series.

1636
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:36.790
I'm doing exactly what I did the last time.

1637
01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:41.770
I'm picking the other team and maybe I'll jinx him.
I think once again,

1638
01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:46.140
the other team has too much fire power.

1639
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:48.040
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:52.870
<v 4>With Henrik sending in whatever his fucking brother's name is.
Ah,</v>

1641
01:36:52.871 --> 01:36:56.890
Ryan Kessler.
And then they got Lou Longo Longo.
You can rattle though.

1642
01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.810
You know,
Casel is just a pretty boy now.
You know,

1643
01:37:01.811 --> 01:37:03.430
he took all his anger out of the game.

1644
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:08.200
They start the fucking play off series versus
the San Jose Sharks.

1645
01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:12.280
Joe Thornton goes,
you want to fight any.
And he didn't,
he didn't do anything.

1646
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.380
He just took the face off,
skated away with is shredded j.
Crew bloody,

1647
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:19.780
you know,
it's like,
what are you doing dude?
You play playing hockey.

1648
01:37:19.781 --> 01:37:22.600
You're trying to be an underwear model.
I don't understand what you're doing.

1649
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:26.380
Ryan Kessler.
All right.
So,
but he is an American,

1650
01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:32.580
so I do like that aspect of them is sendings are actually a direct descendants

1651
01:37:34.690 --> 01:37:38.940
of um,
Nazi SS soldiers.
You know,
not,

1652
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:42.460
not just some fucking regular guy worked in a fucking warehouse and then he got

1653
01:37:42.461 --> 01:37:45.160
put in a guard tower.
Hey,
I'm just doing my job.
I'm not,

1654
01:37:45.161 --> 01:37:49.870
I'm talking about people who executed that horrific final solution.

1655
01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:53.960
All right.
So you know,
if you're rooting for the Canucks out there,
people,
you're,

1656
01:37:53.970 --> 01:37:56.310
you're,
you're saying thumbs up to the Nazis.
I'm just,

1657
01:37:56.311 --> 01:38:00.990
I'm just putting that out there.
Just blowing the lid off that one people.
Nah,

1658
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:03.620
I think it's going to be a great fucking series.
Um,

1659
01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:08.660
I got to feel in the Bruins are gonna win game one and just scare the shit out

1660
01:38:08.971 --> 01:38:12.410
of that little mining town up there.
I really,

1661
01:38:12.411 --> 01:38:17.090
I really got a feeling I got to fill in.
Shower is going to score a goal,

1662
01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:22.720
you know against all odds because he loves taking a fucking slap up when there's

1663
01:38:24.371 --> 01:38:26.890
no one in front of the net from the fucking red line.

1664
01:38:27.130 --> 01:38:29.410
And He loves to shoot right at their pancreas too.

1665
01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:32.830
But I've got a feeling it's going to fucking get in between his goddamn elbow

1666
01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:36.160
and the side.
And then the one guy goes going to get rattled.

1667
01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:38.680
He's going to get pulled in the second period.

1668
01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:44.470
Lou Chichi has got to have a goal to shut up all you Boston cons who are

1669
01:38:44.471 --> 01:38:47.880
trashing him.
You dumb fucks.
Shut your faces.

1670
01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:52.530
How many stars are we going to run out of town because they have a bad couple of

1671
01:38:52.531 --> 01:38:57.230
weeks.
I guarantee you at the end of the season,
Joe Cruz,
off author,

1672
01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.470
whatever the fuck his name is,

1673
01:38:58.910 --> 01:39:03.180
he's going to fucking George the animal steel are fucking coach for the Bruins.

1674
01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:08.430
Claude Julian is going to fucking say a that Lou Cheetahs is,

1675
01:39:08.431 --> 01:39:11.340
has a lower body injury.
That's what I'm guessing.
All right.

1676
01:39:11.341 --> 01:39:14.850
He's just not going to say it because there's piece of shit out there who would

1677
01:39:14.851 --> 01:39:19.080
actually go after the injury.
But I,
I dunno,
I think we're gonna win.

1678
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:21.720
We gotta win the Cup.
Oh,
would that be glorious?

1679
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:27.520
That would be enough to knock me right out of my sobriety.
You know,

1680
01:39:28.210 --> 01:39:31.600
I went to a fucking party yesterday and I actually showed up with a rack of blue

1681
01:39:31.601 --> 01:39:35.770
moon and handed it over and I watched other people drink it and I was just,

1682
01:39:35.771 --> 01:39:38.560
I really questioned my citizenship at that point.
Like,
am I,

1683
01:39:38.590 --> 01:39:42.910
am I still a citizen of this country that I just fucking did that this is how

1684
01:39:42.911 --> 01:39:43.691
bad I want to drink.

1685
01:39:43.691 --> 01:39:48.460
People actually get no conversation about booze at this party.

1686
01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.920
And somebody brought up Fredericksburg,
Texas,

1687
01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:54.910
which is an hour and a half outside of,
uh,

1688
01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:00.580
Austin,
Texas.
Never directly.
It's an old German town.
Speaking of Nazis.

1689
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:04.990
Okay.
Now,
I don't know if you guys realize this,
but I'm actually mostly German.

1690
01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:06.520
I've mentioned this before.

1691
01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:11.020
That's why I have a jaw line and I don't have that 100% Irish potato face.

1692
01:40:11.650 --> 01:40:12.483
Okay.

1693
01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.600
I don't look like I fucking woke up face down in a plate.

1694
01:40:18.701 --> 01:40:22.990
A fucking mash potatoes,
like a lot of my Irish brothers too.

1695
01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:27.160
Okay.
I don't look like that.
I don't look

1696
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:30.760
like,
you know,

1697
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:36.160
I never knew my dad because he got so drunk and he fell face first into a

1698
01:40:36.161 --> 01:40:40.990
shepherd's pie.
And a,
is that actually English?
I don't fucking know.
Um,
anyways,

1699
01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:45.040
let's plow ahead here.
So there's this town called Fredericksburg,

1700
01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.330
which is actually my middle name,
William Fredericksburg Burr.

1701
01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.790
I don't know if you guys ever do that.
Um,

1702
01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:55.180
and it's this all German town and evidently when you drive into town,

1703
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.170
just like one,
one fucking street main street.
Right.

1704
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:02.290
And this is where it was described to me at the party.
You know,

1705
01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.380
I barely was listening.
I was just staring at the bubbles and the guy's beer.

1706
01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:06.730
That's how bad I want to drink.
Now.

1707
01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:12.063
Um,

1708
01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:17.460
and the first half of it is a bunch of antiques for the ladies and the second

1709
01:41:19.211 --> 01:41:24.010
half though is just a bunch of Oktoberfest type bars and a,

1710
01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:25.570
I was thinking like,
God damn it.

1711
01:41:25.571 --> 01:41:29.140
I want to go to that tab and drink out of one of those big things.

1712
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:32.470
We got to press it down with your thumb and have the little fucking crown open

1713
01:41:32.471 --> 01:41:34.420
up.
What?
The Beer Stein.

1714
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:39.820
That's how bad I want to drink now people.
So I want to ask people,
people,

1715
01:41:40.210 --> 01:41:44.260
people of of of the podcasting world who are listening to this thing,

1716
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:49.600
um,
what's,
what's the deal with Fredericksburg,
Texas.

1717
01:41:50.110 --> 01:41:52.990
I want to know is it worth the trip from in Austin?

1718
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:56.820
<v 2>What am I going to go down to the c section again down there.</v>

1719
01:41:56.821 --> 01:41:59.820
I've done that a zillion times.
I want to drive up to Fredericksburg,

1720
01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:04.560
get absolutely shit faced and then drive home drunk back to Austin.

1721
01:42:04.561 --> 01:42:07.830
Get pulled over by some fucking Goddamn Coppin.
A horse.

1722
01:42:08.690 --> 01:42:11.390
<v 4>You are staying on what state you're in is Texas.</v>

1723
01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:16.220
Don't mess with Texas that are,
I know how to sweet.
Talk my way out of that.

1724
01:42:16.221 --> 01:42:19.880
Right.
I just unbutton a couple of buttons from my button down.

1725
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:27.020
<v 2>Show off a little bit of red chest there and I just start complimenting his,</v>

1726
01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.070
his sidearm.

1727
01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:33.340
<v 4>Is that a six shooter?
You,
you know all ideas.
Who is sick humor.</v>

1728
01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:34.753
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1729
01:42:35.130 --> 01:42:39.300
<v 2>I could put this on Ebay in,
get over a hundred grand for it,</v>

1730
01:42:39.301 --> 01:42:43.180
but I got from my daddy.
You got it from his Daddy,
his daddy,
his daddy.

1731
01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:45.780
I just drive away.

1732
01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:48.740
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1733
01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:49.311
<v 2>Did I met you?</v>

1734
01:42:49.311 --> 01:42:52.970
We have a donation button on the [inaudible] podcast.com did I mentioned that.

1735
01:42:52.971 --> 01:42:54.140
I always forget to mention that.

1736
01:42:54.141 --> 01:42:58.520
So just donate whatever the fuck you can donate and uh,
I swear to God,

1737
01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.940
<v 4>if you guys donate this week,
I will,</v>

1738
01:43:01.941 --> 01:43:06.941
I will donate $5 towards the United Nations Fund for curing the common cold.

1739
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:14.450
Do you know the common cold doesn't kill over 7 billion people every year?

1740
01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:16.100
Do you realize that?

1741
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:17.740
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

1742
01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:21.670
<v 4>but it makes over 4 billion people.
Unbelievably uncomfortable.</v>

1743
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:25.450
And in some extreme cases,
even in the month of May.

1744
01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:31.000
So please give a dollar,
gives seven,

1745
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:35.930
do whatever you want to fucking do.
Oh,
by the way,
I'm going to be on the,
uh,
on,

1746
01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:41.440
uh,
Nhl live today.
Nhl Live at a two,

1747
01:43:41.441 --> 01:43:43.150
10:00 PM Pacific Time.

1748
01:43:43.151 --> 01:43:46.930
They're going to be calling me on my cell phone and they're going to be a go.

1749
01:43:46.931 --> 01:43:49.530
What do you think about the playoffs?
You know,

1750
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:52.040
<v 2>[inaudible] brewers.
I gotta</v>

1751
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:56.360
<v 4>be thinking,
uh,
can't wait.
I cannot wait.</v>

1752
01:43:57.620 --> 01:43:58.130
Um,
all right,

1753
01:43:58.130 --> 01:44:03.130
last week I told you that I read that story about that debt fucking Douche who,

1754
01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:07.610
uh,
brought in the ringer wasn't playing this guy's kid.

1755
01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:11.120
And then when he complained,
the parent complain,
you know,

1756
01:44:11.121 --> 01:44:12.650
they kept the kid on the bench

1757
01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.070
and then the next year dies kids on another team and then he's playing against

1758
01:44:19.071 --> 01:44:20.990
this douche coach.
And at the end of the game,

1759
01:44:21.110 --> 01:44:26.110
his kid didn't shake his hand and this fucking fag went to the Goddamn league is

1760
01:44:26.481 --> 01:44:30.710
now is saying that this kid has to shake hands.
So the dad's like,

1761
01:44:30.711 --> 01:44:32.780
what do I do?
What do I do?

1762
01:44:32.781 --> 01:44:35.090
So I was trying to think of a country way for this kid,

1763
01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.570
something he could do to this guy.
So this is a solution.

1764
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:39.651
Summit came up with said,

1765
01:44:39.651 --> 01:44:43.670
tell that kid to shake that coach's hand for an awkwardly long time.

1766
01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:48.080
I actually really liked this idea holding on when the coach tries to pull his

1767
01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:53.060
hand away and the whole time smiling,
maybe throw a wink in there too,
you know,

1768
01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:58.100
a passive aggressive fuck you love the podcast.
But I think that's great.

1769
01:44:58.490 --> 01:45:00.950
I would actually clasp it with both hands.

1770
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:04.550
Like you just signed some sort of monumental peace treaty.

1771
01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.770
Like do you know it'd be great.
Have have,

1772
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:10.520
have the d you're his dad come down.

1773
01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:14.660
Do you remember when and when Jimmy Carter got,
um,

1774
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:19.880
was that Anwar Sadat instead begging guy to shake hands,

1775
01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:24.800
a sign,
a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel or something like that.

1776
01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:29.330
And they both shook hands and then Jimmy Carter made it like a handshake

1777
01:45:29.331 --> 01:45:31.100
sandwich with using his hands.

1778
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:34.880
Is the bond standing basically perpendicular to them?

1779
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:36.620
So I think that that's what should happen.

1780
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:40.040
I think he should shake the guy's hand,
clasp it with both hands.

1781
01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:44.600
And then you hire a Jimmy Carter look alike to fucking sit there and you just

1782
01:45:44.601 --> 01:45:49.601
smile and you don't let go until that guy finally pulls his hands free and you

1783
01:45:50.631 --> 01:45:55.490
never stopped smiling and you never stop looking in the guys.
I how's that?

1784
01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:58.820
I liked that.
You guys liked that solution.
I do.

1785
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:03.440
Um,
does anybody else have any more stories about that?

1786
01:46:03.441 --> 01:46:08.150
That seems to be an overwhelming,
not overwhelming.
That's the wrong word.
Jesus.

1787
01:46:08.151 --> 01:46:11.870
Bill,
Jesus Christ.
The whole podcast was going great.
And then once you do,

1788
01:46:11.871 --> 01:46:15.650
you pick the wrong fucking word.
The fuck is wrong with you.

1789
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:19.850
Read the God damn copy.
Did I ever tell you guys,
you guys always think that this,

1790
01:46:19.851 --> 01:46:23.050
this show is imp improvised.
It isn't.
I actually write it out and I,

1791
01:46:23.051 --> 01:46:25.610
I spent $15,000 on my own,

1792
01:46:26.170 --> 01:46:29.630
a professional grade camera and teleprompter right now.
I'm reading all of this,

1793
01:46:29.631 --> 01:46:31.910
including this right now.
It's just scrolling right now.

1794
01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:37.370
You know that whole I'm bad at reading out loud is it's all just an act.
Um,

1795
01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.280
anyways.
Does anybody else have any stories about that?
Uh,

1796
01:46:40.281 --> 01:46:43.460
that type of behavior rather than overwhelming?

1797
01:46:43.461 --> 01:46:47.450
I know it's a reoccurring theme.
That's what I was trying to say.

1798
01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:52.590
You know,
somebody becomes a coach and uh,
you know,

1799
01:46:52.591 --> 01:46:56.790
they're getting to live out this Vince Lombardi fantasy and then they start

1800
01:46:56.791 --> 01:46:57.271
thinking,
well,

1801
01:46:57.271 --> 01:47:01.170
I sucked as an athlete or I wasn't good enough to make it to the pros.

1802
01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.370
And then when they start coaching,

1803
01:47:02.371 --> 01:47:06.240
just immediately that competitive thing kicks in again and they forget that

1804
01:47:06.330 --> 01:47:09.390
they're coaching a bunch of fucking eight year olds and they start walking

1805
01:47:09.391 --> 01:47:12.840
around like fucking Mike Ditka,
you know,
chewing gum.

1806
01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:17.580
Like they just got done finishing a fucking eight ball of coke in case you

1807
01:47:17.581 --> 01:47:22.470
thought I was talking about pool.
I had to say of coke.
All right.
I'm sorry.

1808
01:47:22.471 --> 01:47:26.490
People a little congested.
Does anybody else have any stories of that?
I actually,

1809
01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:29.670
uh,
I had good coaches when I was grown up,

1810
01:47:30.650 --> 01:47:33.540
stuff on my football coach I've ever used to kick me in my fucking legs.

1811
01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:38.910
<v 2>I only played one year of football.</v>

1812
01:47:39.010 --> 01:47:42.240
My parents didn't like it cause I came home with all these bruises and they

1813
01:47:42.241 --> 01:47:46.440
showed up at practice and they saw the coach kicking me in my legs.
Uh,

1814
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:49.680
I remember I used to move on when we were doing leg lifts cause that's what you

1815
01:47:49.681 --> 01:47:53.820
want third graders to do leg lifts to make sure they get that 12 pack.

1816
01:47:54.090 --> 01:47:57.150
So we're doing these leg lifts and uh,
you know,

1817
01:47:57.151 --> 01:48:00.210
whenever your legs would come down he come over and kick you in the in the side

1818
01:48:00.211 --> 01:48:01.320
and give you like a Charlie horse.

1819
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:05.130
So I used to move my thigh pads over there over to the side.

1820
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:09.390
This was the 70s people when you could kick kids,
not only could you kick them,

1821
01:48:09.391 --> 01:48:12.930
you can kick up in front of their parents.
It was fucking great.
Um,

1822
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:15.390
does anybody have any stories that just some,
some uh,

1823
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:19.260
coaches just go and totally over the top?
Uh,

1824
01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.890
here's a new sound for you guys.
See if you guys can guess what this sound is.

1825
01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.650
All right.
And it's not me blowing my nose on the mic.

1826
01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:31.420
<v 5>Ah,</v>

1827
01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:33.370
<v 2>what was that?
What was that noise?</v>

1828
01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:39.090
<v 4>You hear that?
That might sound like me wiping up my mustache.
Yeah.</v>

1829
01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:40.140
Fucking disgusting.

1830
01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:46.100
I'm playing hockey tomorrow and I wear a full fucking shield and I have a runny

1831
01:48:46.101 --> 01:48:47.990
nose.
Dean were understand what I'm going to look like.

1832
01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:53.380
I don't want to be looking like I'm fucking almost set the summit of Mount

1833
01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:54.980
Everest by the,
by my second shift.

1834
01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.060
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:01.360
<v 2>Is that icicles in your mustache?
What is going on?
No,</v>

1836
01:49:01.361 --> 01:49:06.280
it's just not all right.
Now that I got rid of the ladies on the podcast,

1837
01:49:06.850 --> 01:49:07.683
um,

1838
01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:10.960
<v 4>speaking of ladies,
um,
there's,</v>

1839
01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:16.020
there's a little downtime between the eastern and western conference finals and

1840
01:49:16.571 --> 01:49:17.404
the finals

1841
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:21.420
<v 2>in,
uh,
the Stanley Cups.
So I had four fucking days of,
Oh my God,</v>

1842
01:49:21.630 --> 01:49:24.720
how am I going to fill up the time?
And I don't know what happened.

1843
01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:30.230
I put on ESPN and I've somehow got into the ladies' softball fucking world

1844
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:31.074
series.

1845
01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.960
<v 4>I love it.
I absolutely love it.</v>

1846
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:37.700
I want to face one of those fucking pitchers

1847
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:42.120
<v 2>you got,
you know,
a lot of,
a lot of guys out there.
They laugh at that shit.</v>

1848
01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:45.450
Gungko right?
Fucking,
I fucking put it in the cheap sheets.

1849
01:49:45.451 --> 01:49:48.010
If I ever flogging the dead giant them Paul,

1850
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:51.220
<v 4>first of all,
they pitch the ball from like four feet away</v>

1851
01:49:52.890 --> 01:49:57.180
and it comes under hand cause they don't take and they do it so fast,

1852
01:49:57.181 --> 01:50:00.990
it looks like it's coming right out of their baby maker.
You know,

1853
01:50:00.991 --> 01:50:05.160
like some sort of fucking a Nolan Ryan meets some hoary stripper,

1854
01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.760
you know and you know the ones that shoot the ping pongs out of their twats
this,

1855
01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:11.880
it looks like the softball.
It's just coming at this weird fucking handle.

1856
01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:17.800
I would love to do it because they are,
ballparks are really small

1857
01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:22.460
so if you actually made contact,
they pitch it so fast,

1858
01:50:22.461 --> 01:50:25.580
it's going over the Goddamn wall and then he gets to run around.

1859
01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.420
You get to run around the bases but you don't get it.
You don't,

1860
01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:32.870
you're not going to get winded because I think it's like 45 feet to each base.

1861
01:50:32.871 --> 01:50:36.530
It's ridiculous.
Basically,
if there's no leading,

1862
01:50:36.531 --> 01:50:40.100
I think in women's softball because once you take a lead,

1863
01:50:40.101 --> 01:50:43.850
you're basically at second base or all you have to do is just,
you know,
fall down

1864
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:47.060
and you're,
you're safe at second.

1865
01:50:47.061 --> 01:50:52.061
Actually there is leading all right before some fucking bulldog of a woman

1866
01:50:52.221 --> 01:50:54.410
fucking starts giving me shit about it.
I understand.

1867
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:57.290
And a dude speaking of roids okay.

1868
01:50:57.291 --> 01:51:01.910
If you're going to tell me those women in ladies' softball,
like there's just,
uh,

1869
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:06.800
there's enough women built like that to fill up fucking like nine different

1870
01:51:06.801 --> 01:51:10.250
teams.
Uh,
I'm not buying it.
Okay.

1871
01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:15.710
Those girls I'm telling you right now would run me the fuck over.

1872
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:21.290
Nah,
that damn batteries ran out again in the memory was full.

1873
01:51:21.291 --> 01:51:25.400
I don't know what the fuck happened,
son of a bitch.
All right.
What the fuck was,

1874
01:51:25.410 --> 01:51:29.930
I was talking about those God damn softball ladies.
I'm telling you man,

1875
01:51:29.931 --> 01:51:32.450
those girls,
they did the old packer sweep,

1876
01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:35.180
pitched it out to any one of them where they'd fucking,

1877
01:51:35.181 --> 01:51:38.180
they could run over Ray Lewis.
But I'm telling you,

1878
01:51:38.181 --> 01:51:42.170
it's a great goddamn sport.
And,
uh,
you know what,

1879
01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:47.000
in Molly took a couple of seconds for you to listen to me.
You know,

1880
01:51:47.690 --> 01:51:50.720
go from what I was just talking about too,
what I'm talking about right now,

1881
01:51:50.721 --> 01:51:51.501
but in my world,

1882
01:51:51.501 --> 01:51:54.170
that was like five minutes and I can't remember what the fuck I was talking

1883
01:51:54.171 --> 01:51:58.100
about.
So that's going away.
Oh,

1884
01:51:58.101 --> 01:51:59.630
it's so frustrating.

1885
01:51:59.631 --> 01:52:04.340
I was really enjoying what he was saying about those fucking Goddamn bulldogs to

1886
01:52:04.341 --> 01:52:08.240
play fucking softball.
They're actually not bulldogs is some from or a couple.

1887
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:12.920
They're kind of cute.
You know,
I like some fucking thick thighs.

1888
01:52:12.921 --> 01:52:17.660
I'll take it down,
you know,
even with that grease under your eyes.
Um,

1889
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:23.990
AH,
Jesus.
Alright.
Um,
by the way,
we have a new video,
everybody.

1890
01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:28.730
We have new video up on the Mlm,

Remember,
uh,
not last week,

1891
01:52:28.731 --> 01:52:33.731
but the week before I was hyping the cage versus cons MMA event where they have

1892
01:52:34.191 --> 01:52:35.960
cops fighting ex cons,

1893
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:39.980
MMA style in the octagon at the La sports arena.

1894
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:43.280
Well,
the Monday morning podcasts,

1895
01:52:43.730 --> 01:52:48.560

nick and John Camp,

1898
01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:59.980
an era [inaudible] is a in the name of the podcast is called men are talking.

1899
01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:06.770
So anyways,
he was out there.
He covered the event for us with a Sam Tripoli,

1900
01:53:07.230 --> 01:53:08.750
another hilarious comedian and a,

1901
01:53:08.751 --> 01:53:11.370
they made a really great video if you want to see what it was like.

1902
01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:14.360
It was looked like it was a fucking great time.
Um,

1903
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:19.390
definitely the crowd was way more for the cons then a was for the cops and a lot

1904
01:53:20.931 --> 01:53:21.710
of tattoos.

1905
01:53:21.710 --> 01:53:25.580
We're gotten a lot of weed was smoked and I think you guys ought to check it
out.

1906
01:53:25.581 --> 01:53:28.100
It's a great video.
It's on the Mlm,

right underneath the Facebook fucking icons.
Check out that video.
Also,

1909
01:53:35.991 --> 01:53:38.630
I did a,
I got another video is going to be up later on this week.

1910
01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:43.250
I did another one of my famous internet tours of the city.
I did a tour of new,

1911
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:47.380
uh,
New York City that's going to be up.
And,
um,

1912
01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:51.350
I actually ran into somebody not to get all Hollywood on you.

1913
01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:52.580
I'm not going to name a name,

1914
01:53:52.581 --> 01:53:56.840
but I was out at an Italian restaurant and as I was walking out there was

1915
01:53:56.841 --> 01:53:57.531
somebody,

1916
01:53:57.531 --> 01:54:02.270
a famous sitting there who hosts a talk show.

1917
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:07.210
And I,
I,
and,
and it wasn't Conan and,
uh,

1918
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:11.960
it wasn't that guy from Scotland.
Um,
and I said,
hey,
what's up to him?

1919
01:54:11.961 --> 01:54:14.270
And he mentioned that he saw my feet,
fucking watched,

1920
01:54:14.271 --> 01:54:17.600
the one that I did a the tour of La and I got a big kick out of that.

1921
01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:22.880
Go only look at the Goddamn Internet.
Famous people are on the Internet too.

1922
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:26.660
I didn't realize that.
I always thought like famous people that are on TV,

1923
01:54:26.661 --> 01:54:30.830
so they,
they don't,
they don't watch it.
They like read books or a,
you know,

1924
01:54:31.670 --> 01:54:35.960
go out and go buy like a fucking Ferrari or something.

1925
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:40.130
It's always just blown my mind.
Whatever we got.
We got this great video up there,

1926
01:54:40.131 --> 01:54:44.090
the cage versus cons,
and I'm going to have won a tour of New York City,

1927
01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:45.530
my tour of New York City,

1928
01:54:45.531 --> 01:54:49.280
which I did when I was just starting to catch this coal that was in a miserable

1929
01:54:49.281 --> 01:54:53.120
fucking mood.
Uh,
so might come off a little more angrier than usual,

1930
01:54:53.121 --> 01:54:55.190

1933
01:55:03.681 --> 01:55:06.860

That means I got 15 minutes to go.

1934
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:10.820
So it's gotta be time for the advice section.

1935
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.800
And if I was actually,
if I had some sort of a production quality on this,

1936
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:17.810
we would have gotten into some music right there.

1937
01:55:18.110 --> 01:55:23.110
It's time for advice with your hose Billy Burger.

1938
01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:30.310
And I'm ripping off this melody from somebody else.
All right,

1939
01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:35.390
dear bill,
I am 34 years old that had been married to Linda.
Ah,
cheesy names.

1940
01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:37.250
The name right out of the gate.
Oh,

1941
01:55:37.251 --> 01:55:41.390
the lovely Nia comes walking in right as I'm about ready to do advice.

1942
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:44.940
What are the odds of that?
Why don't you go grab yourself a microphone?

1943
01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:49.590
It's in the closet.
My closet.
All right.

1944
01:55:49.591 --> 01:55:51.450
And don't go snooping around in there.

1945
01:55:51.451 --> 01:55:53.770
I got some fucking incriminating evidence in there.

1946
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:58.260
God Damn fucking brides can ever keep their faces.

1947
01:55:59.970 --> 01:56:02.640
Adia Shit.
Let me see if I can put this in here.
Here we go.

1948
01:56:02.641 --> 01:56:04.350
We're going to get this going right here anyways,

1949
01:56:04.351 --> 01:56:05.910
while I'm reading the first one without you.

1950
01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:08.083
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1951
01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:11.250
<v 4>I'm 34 years,
34 years old and been married to Linda,</v>

1952
01:56:11.251 --> 01:56:16.050
my wife for about five years.
We met on an online dating website.

1953
01:56:16.590 --> 01:56:17.430
Isn't that amazing?

1954
01:56:17.431 --> 01:56:21.000
They met online and they've already been married for five years.

1955
01:56:21.570 --> 01:56:25.260
How long has the Internet been around?
Isn't that fan?
That's really phenomenal.

1956
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:26.400
Starting to feel old.

1957
01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:28.773
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1958
01:56:31.810 --> 01:56:35.420
<v 4>Um,
Nah.
Jesus.
Chris,
can you tell I hit pause again?
People fucking con.</v>

1959
01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:38.800
What am I doing here?
All right,
here we go.
Uh,
dear bill,
I'm 34 years old.

1960
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:41.650
He said that shit.
He's been online for fucking five guy there in years.

1961
01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:47.140
And we met on an online dating website.
Immediately felt a special bond.

1962
01:56:47.170 --> 01:56:51.700
We dated for three years,
but I knew she was the one.
Wait a minute.

1963
01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:55.360
Did I read this last week?
Oh yeah.
I read this one last week.

1964
01:56:55.361 --> 01:56:59.650
I'm on the wrong fucking page.
Jesus.
Yo.

1965
01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:02.260
Hey Shang on a second.
All right.

1966
01:57:02.261 --> 01:57:05.980
Where are the fuck are we alright advice dear bill,

1967
01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:10.360
I've got a few shitty things going on in my life right now that I need to vent

1968
01:57:10.361 --> 01:57:14.110
about.
Also,
I would like to hear your advice.
Okay.

1969
01:57:14.111 --> 01:57:16.120
You guys don't need to have fucking interests like that.

1970
01:57:16.121 --> 01:57:18.730
Just ask me the advice cause then I'll read them and sound like a shithead.

1971
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.170
First thing's first.

1972
01:57:20.230 --> 01:57:24.280
I live in South Carolina and I think you can guess that that pretty much blows.

1973
01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:31.150
I'm 22 years old and I just graduated from college with a degree in psychology.

1974
01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:36.130
My job outlook is pretty bleak right now and I just got laid off from my shitty

1975
01:57:36.131 --> 01:57:40.660
delivery job.
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is going on in this country?

1976
01:57:40.661 --> 01:57:44.050
This tooth has a degree in psychology and he's delivering fucking intimates

1977
01:57:44.051 --> 01:57:47.520
cakes to supermarkets and he gets laid off.
Um,

1978
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:50.920
because I must have applied for at least 30 jobs at this point and I've stopped

1979
01:57:50.921 --> 01:57:55.540
applying for the ones that I'm underqualified for.
And I've started,
sorry.

1980
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:58.030
And I'm still unemployed.

1981
01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:02.890
I don't understand why the access of entry into the restaurant industry is so

1982
01:58:02.891 --> 01:58:03.910
fucking high.

1983
01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:09.180
I can't even get a job serving because they keep telling me we only hire people

1984
01:58:09.991 --> 01:58:13.140
with two years of experience.
Well,
it's the law.

1985
01:58:13.170 --> 01:58:16.620
It's the laws of supply and demand.
You know,
if the,

1986
01:58:16.621 --> 01:58:18.420
if that we weren't in the middle of a recession,

1987
01:58:18.421 --> 01:58:22.170
you could walk in there with the coming out of prison and they'd let you work

1988
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:26.250
the Goddamn Musky grill.
Um,
yeah,

1989
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:28.730
I worked in a restaurant.
This is a bunch of fucking drugs.

1990
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:32.010
It was such a good economy.
It was like 1987.

1991
01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.900
Wait a second.
That was right after black Monday.
I Dunno.
Maybe it was a south.

1992
01:58:36.901 --> 01:58:37.651
I have no idea.

1993
01:58:37.651 --> 01:58:42.100
I worked at this place called the sable cafe and Cary North Carolina,
way

1994
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:44.740
<v 2>back in the day.
And,
uh,</v>

1995
01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:49.750
we used to have this Douche who you see came in,
he was on work release,

1996
01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:53.560
he was in prison and they wouldn't let him out so he could wash dishes and work

1997
01:58:53.561 --> 01:58:56.740
his way back.
Now Watch this is,
he actually worked the fucking cooking light.

1998
01:58:56.990 --> 01:59:01.540
He was above me,
right?
I was a busboy slash grill chefs slash,

1999
01:59:01.541 --> 01:59:04.600
dishwasher because the restaurant was slowly going out of business.

2000
01:59:04.601 --> 01:59:08.980
And that's lash,
Hadi.
As a people,

2001
01:59:09.070 --> 01:59:12.160
as people gradually,
gradually quit,
they would fucking,
uh,

2002
01:59:12.190 --> 01:59:15.730
they would just give me their jobs and an extra 50 cents an hour.
And I was like,

2003
01:59:15.731 --> 01:59:19.030
whoa.
Oh,
I'm raking in the dough because I sucked at math.

2004
01:59:19.031 --> 01:59:22.120
I didn't realize that they would pay me three 50 an hour and a grill guy,

2005
01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:23.200
$5 an hour.

2006
01:59:23.410 --> 01:59:28.300
So they went from paying a 50 an hour for two guys to paying me $4 an hour for

2007
01:59:28.301 --> 01:59:33.190
fuck Emma.
Dumb fucking moron.
So anyways,
there's this douche used to come in.

2008
01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.910
And I remember one time I came walking in the back and I'm doing three fucking

2009
01:59:36.911 --> 01:59:41.080
jobs.
We were slammed and I said,
oh my God,
I go,
we're out of glasses.

2010
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:44.770
The fuck we're out of glasses.
And then this guy had worked,
release goes,
well,

2011
01:59:44.771 --> 01:59:49.090
why don't you wash some ah,
a novel idea.

2012
01:59:50.110 --> 01:59:54.280
That's what he said.
Like he was just fucking get renaissance man.
Really,

2013
01:59:54.430 --> 01:59:58.440
really the Shashank the fuck are you doing after work?
Huh?

2014
01:59:58.690 --> 02:00:01.720
Fucking carbon and God there,
hey,
watch all the steak knives.

2015
02:00:01.721 --> 02:00:05.650
Make sure county over here doesn't take them back with your felon beard.

2016
02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:09.840
You're this stupid fucking almond brothers facial hair.

2017
02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:13.720
If I fucking cut it still bugs me because I didn't say anything to them cause I

2018
02:00:13.721 --> 02:00:16.000
got intimidated even though I thought I could take the guy,
but I was like,

2019
02:00:16.001 --> 02:00:19.540
this guy has been in prison,
you know,
he's gonna beat me up and then rate me.

2020
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:24.670
Fuck it.
I think I'll watch some glasses.
So anyways,
um,

2021
02:00:25.570 --> 02:00:27.880
he goes,
if I can struggle through four years of school,

2022
02:00:27.881 --> 02:00:32.620
then I think I can get the hang of slinging tater skins and onion rings in a few

2023
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:35.130
weeks.
What is,
what is there to learn?
Uh,

2024
02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:39.400
all these guys trying to get a cooking job.
We'll do a serving job.

2025
02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:41.800
Well I thought he meant like being a waiter,

2026
02:00:41.801 --> 02:00:44.140
but now it sounds like he's talking about actually cooking.
Yeah.
Dude,

2027
02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:49.000
he can't learn on the job at a restaurant.
No,
you owe us.
Was that under dot.

2028
02:00:49.001 --> 02:00:51.340
I'm sorry.
They're not coming.
Really?

2029
02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:53.160
<v 8>Oh he's a,
nobody's talking about cooking,
isn't it?</v>

2030
02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:55.770
Cause I thought he said he was having a hard time getting a job as a server

2031
02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:57.570
because that you can learn in like two seconds.

2032
02:00:57.620 --> 02:00:59.050
<v 2>No,
that's what,
that's what he said.</v>

2033
02:00:59.051 --> 02:01:02.110
But now all of a sudden he's talking about slinging tater skins and onion rings.

2034
02:01:02.250 --> 02:01:03.790
<v 8>I think he just means serving it.</v>

2035
02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:08.590
<v 2>Slinging doesn't slinging me in the,</v>

2036
02:01:08.730 --> 02:01:09.620
<v 8>yeah,
but there wasn't,</v>

2037
02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:12.900
didn't you say earlier that he's trying to get a job as a miniature already

2038
02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:16.190
disagreeing with me.
Then I say earlier that he was try

2039
02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:19.730
<v 2>and get a job.
What is it a learning,
let me get back to this.</v>

2040
02:01:19.731 --> 02:01:23.480
What is there to learn in the second year of restaurant experience that you

2041
02:01:23.481 --> 02:01:24.580
can't get in the first year?

2042
02:01:24.590 --> 02:01:28.340
Even the first six months is I agree with how in the hell am I supposed to get a

2043
02:01:28.341 --> 02:01:33.110
job.
I'm also being cut out from financial support of my family who helped put me

2044
02:01:33.111 --> 02:01:33.944
through school.

2045
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:37.280
If I can start paying bills that I'm going to have to move back in with my

2046
02:01:37.281 --> 02:01:40.130
parents and a shitty small town that is about an hour

2047
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.881
<v 4>away from the city.</v>

2048
02:01:40.881 --> 02:01:44.720
I live in job outlook there is even worse than I would hate to move away from my

2049
02:01:44.721 --> 02:01:47.510
friends and girlfriend.
Me and my girl don't live together,

2050
02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:52.660
but she's offered a lot of needed support and most importantly she supports me

2051
02:01:52.731 --> 02:01:53.900
pursuing comedy.

2052
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:58.520
It's my dream to become a comedian and I can only go so far while I live in

2053
02:01:58.521 --> 02:02:01.040
South Carolina.
Um,

2054
02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:04.730
now what is it that he can only go so far living in South Carolina?

2055
02:02:05.070 --> 02:02:09.460
The fuck you become on the next guy.
Damn cable guy.
Dude,

2056
02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:12.230
this people this.
I've guarantee you in South Carolina,

2057
02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:17.000
there's a guy there who's the king of South Carolina and we've never heard of

2058
02:02:17.001 --> 02:02:21.590
them.
Every state I've been to.
Yeah.
And they fucking make six figures a year.

2059
02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:22.850
I'm not,
I don't understand what he's saying.

2060
02:02:22.851 --> 02:02:25.310
Obviously he doesn't want to be the king of South Carolina was get it in movies

2061
02:02:25.311 --> 02:02:28.460
and TVs become a nationally headlining act.
I understand what you're saying,

2062
02:02:28.461 --> 02:02:30.770
but I'm just saying you can make fucking money there.

2063
02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:36.050
There is money to be made with those drug fucking idiots there all you gotta do

2064
02:02:36.051 --> 02:02:40.760
just do a ric flair impression.
That'll be a closing bit.
You'll be fine.
Um,

2065
02:02:40.761 --> 02:02:42.320
I would,
uh,
he lives out there.

2066
02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:45.650
I would like to move to New York City but won't be able to do that if I'm not

2067
02:02:45.651 --> 02:02:46.850
able to save up money.

2068
02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:50.810
And I definitely won't be able to do that anytime soon because I am awaiting a

2069
02:02:50.811 --> 02:02:53.930
trial for a Dui.
I got back in January,

2070
02:02:53.931 --> 02:02:57.200
he was getting like unraveling more and more.

2071
02:02:57.201 --> 02:03:01.730
Every sentence it becomes as something else.
That's why country songs is so sad.

2072
02:03:01.731 --> 02:03:05.720
These people live it
laminated South Carolina.

2073
02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:11.560
I love my girls vagina and I can't get a job washing dishes.

2074
02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:14.330
Did you just run Kara?

2075
02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:18.350
And I don't know why.

2076
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:21.800
Because the cop was even drunk girl and me

2077
02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:25.910
and the song should be called.

2078
02:03:25.911 --> 02:03:30.911
I know I'm not ric flair cause I know I ric flair and I know auto bleach my

2079
02:03:33.621 --> 02:03:35.960
hair,
but I got a dream.

2080
02:03:35.961 --> 02:03:39.090
And would you help me get your hand off you go.

2081
02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:43.060
And I'm starting to get scared that run with hair.
All right,
go fuck yourselves.

2082
02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:44.031
Um,
anyways,

2083
02:03:44.031 --> 02:03:48.710
the trial is this September and if I lose my license,

2084
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:53.600
I will only be set further back from my goals.
Yeah.
You think I'm trying to,

2085
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:58.430
not to mention our growing weed in my apartment.

2086
02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:02.270
It's a one bedroom with bay windows that I think my neighbors are starting to

2087
02:04:02.271 --> 02:04:07.220
catch on a,
I am trying to hone my skillset.
No.
Oh Jesus.

2088
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:11.270
Somebody went out late last night.
I'm trying to hone my skills here,

2089
02:04:11.271 --> 02:04:12.290
but I can't afford,

2090
02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:14.600
<v 9>uh,</v>

2091
02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.400
<v 4>to keep driving to open mikes that are at at least an hour away across the
state,</v>

2092
02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:19.760
North Carolina,
by the way.

2093
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:23.570
I've stopped drinking irresponsibly and I'm sorry that this email ran a little

2094
02:04:23.571 --> 02:04:28.300
long respectfully.
So itself gotta love have the politeness of the cell.

2095
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:30.670
This is a respectful,
yeah,
praise.
What else?

2096
02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:34.670
Plantation Kentucky Fried Chicken ties on holding onto his lapels.

2097
02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:37.970
That's a forced call her Sam or years.
Yeah.
That's how they,

2098
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:41.010
<v 8>that's how they get you with the polite and the state gets with the politeness</v>

2099
02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:44.280
and they do,
that's the ad.
See,
you know as someone who grew up in the south,

2100
02:04:44.281 --> 02:04:47.500
I know.
Yeah.
That's,
you know what that's called?
That's called hospitality.

2101
02:04:47.670 --> 02:04:50.310
It's masking so much.
Yeah.

2102
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:53.930
<v 2>Do you know what that is?
That's called the old,
uh,
it's called the old stonewall</v>

2103
02:04:55.690 --> 02:04:57.870
Jackson Bill.
They'll stonewall Jackson.
He come in high.

2104
02:04:58.040 --> 02:04:59.750
You are surely would lock down.

2105
02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:02.710
<v 4>You don't you look party today.</v>

2106
02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:06.310
I ain't trying to be disrespectful.

2107
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:09.640
<v 2>Right.
And then you fucking turned the corner.</v>

2108
02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:14.680
We tell you something about that board,
that board fuck mud.

2109
02:05:14.681 --> 02:05:18.130
If he thought a rock was on her,
a fucking snake.
Well,

2110
02:05:18.131 --> 02:05:20.960
what's going on with the thing here that bought fucking rock of started?

2111
02:05:20.970 --> 02:05:21.870
Snake was onerous.

2112
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:26.550
<v 8>So what is,
what is he asking?</v>

2113
02:05:27.150 --> 02:05:31.850
<v 2>He's asking me how the fuck he gets out of,
uh,
all this bad shit.
Right.</v>

2114
02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:35.800
You live in South Carolina.
Let,
let's,
let's recap.
Shall we,
yeah.

2115
02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:36.883
In South Carolina,

2116
02:05:36.990 --> 02:05:41.640
there's a South Carolina can't get a job slinging fucking tater tots to fucking

2117
02:05:41.641 --> 02:05:43.560
fatties who are wearing overalls.

2118
02:05:43.561 --> 02:05:45.970
And somehow the crack of the Ras is still hanging out of it.

2119
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:48.690
He got a Dui.

2120
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:52.500
He's going to have to move back home with his parents and hour away where the

2121
02:05:52.501 --> 02:05:57.030
job shit is even worse than it is where he is right now.

2122
02:05:57.180 --> 02:06:00.540
And he got,
he,
uh,
Jesus Christ and he wants to live his dream.
I mean,

2123
02:06:00.630 --> 02:06:03.780
I always see one solution here other than hitting the lottery,

2124
02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:07.920
you got to start dealing weed.
I mean,
yeah,
right.

2125
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:11.550
He's in South Carolina.
Can't he grow some Tabacchi yeah,
just start.

2126
02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:15.210
Just start selling a wacky tobacky yeah.
Anything,
wait a minute.
Wait,
wait,
wait.

2127
02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:20.070
There's something going on with this fucking the sound here.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

2128
02:06:20.071 --> 02:06:22.020
See people,
this is why I need you to hit the donation button.

2129
02:06:22.021 --> 02:06:26.820
We here at Bill Barr PBS here.
I think I need a new mixer or some new wires.

2130
02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:29.850
And you say something about being a psychology major or something.

2131
02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:34.410
Aren't you supposed to do some sort of internship at a place he doesn't do you

2132
02:06:34.411 --> 02:06:37.350
do school and he doesn't have time for that.
Get entry into a job.

2133
02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.330
He doesn't want to do that.
This guy wants to be a comedian.

2134
02:06:39.331 --> 02:06:43.140
So what do you want it to be?
Yeah.
So,
so what he needs,

2135
02:06:43.650 --> 02:06:47.490
he needs some sort of hustle to get them out of this shit.
All right dude.
This,

2136
02:06:47.730 --> 02:06:48.690
this will make you feel better.

2137
02:06:48.691 --> 02:06:51.420
Guess what happened to me right before I became a standup comedian,

2138
02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:56.370
I lost my license for drinking and driving and uh,

2139
02:06:56.400 --> 02:07:00.210
I didn't get,
I didn't get to start at the battery's going low on this thing.

2140
02:07:00.211 --> 02:07:01.290
Hello?
Hello?

2141
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:04.663
<v 3>Mm.</v>

2142
02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:09.380
<v 2>Hello.
There we go.
Oh,
the thing got a plant</v>

2143
02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:15.280
that's not a bad ass when it starts to come out.
This is like,
oh,
take me to,

2144
02:07:17.690 --> 02:07:18.523
<v 3>mm,</v>

2145
02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:22.400
<v 2>sorry.
All right,
here we go.
I'm back.
What did I do?</v>

2146
02:07:22.401 --> 02:07:25.010
I just had a fucking button here.
Now this other things lit up,

2147
02:07:25.011 --> 02:07:29.150
which was never lit up before.
Ah,
you fucking whore.
All right,
let's,

2148
02:07:29.151 --> 02:07:32.160
let's wrap this thing up.
This is what you gotta do,
Dude.
You gotta walk,

2149
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:35.270
you gotta get through your Dui.

2150
02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:37.213
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2151
02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.513
<v 2>MMM,</v>

2152
02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:39.240
<v 5>yeah,</v>

2153
02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:40.330
<v 2>yeah.
I don't know what to tell you,
man.</v>

2154
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:42.790
You got to somehow try and find a fucking job.

2155
02:07:44.430 --> 02:07:45.340
<v 5>Ah,
fuck.</v>

2156
02:07:45.970 --> 02:07:49.000
<v 2>I lived at home with my parents.
I had a day job and then I,</v>

2157
02:07:49.001 --> 02:07:52.630
and I did comedy at night and I saved every fucking dime.

2158
02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:56.560
I drove a piece of shit car and when it died,
rather than get a new one,

2159
02:07:56.770 --> 02:07:59.440
I just had him throw a new engine in my old one.

2160
02:07:59.590 --> 02:08:04.210
So I only went like 1500 and debt rather than 15 grant.
That's what I did.

2161
02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:07.990
So listen,
if you want to be a fucking comedian,

2162
02:08:08.290 --> 02:08:10.630
you want it bad enough,
you're going to figure out how to do it.

2163
02:08:10.631 --> 02:08:15.190
You're in a hell of a situation there.
You got to get a fucking job,
dude,

2164
02:08:15.191 --> 02:08:18.940
I would open.
I take any fucking job.

2165
02:08:18.941 --> 02:08:22.660
You can take landscaping,
anything you can do,

2166
02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:28.060
um,
get through this fucking Dui horseshit.
And uh,

2167
02:08:28.090 --> 02:08:29.860
despite the fact that you work all day,

2168
02:08:29.890 --> 02:08:34.120
you can still gotta go out and you still have to do those open mikes.

2169
02:08:34.121 --> 02:08:38.350
You gotta do it and uh,
is hard as it's going to be.

2170
02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:39.550
It's gonna.

2171
02:08:39.550 --> 02:08:42.820
It's gonna make you tough and that's what you gotta beat and make it in the

2172
02:08:42.821 --> 02:08:45.250
world.
You gotta be tough.
You got to get up,
but you know what?

2173
02:08:45.251 --> 02:08:46.630
You've been knocked on your ass.

2174
02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:50.800
You flat on the back flat on your back and you gotta get up.

2175
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:52.310
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2176
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:55.880
<v 2>Right?
The refs over you right now,
six,
seven,</v>

2177
02:08:56.150 --> 02:08:57.890
most people just lay there.

2178
02:08:57.891 --> 02:09:00.980
I'm going to go fucking lay between my mom's titties and just say,

2179
02:09:00.981 --> 02:09:03.440
I quit in life.
You're not going to do that,
are you?

2180
02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:05.150
You're going to pick yourself up.

2181
02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:10.610
You should've seen the look she just gave me.
I'm trying to inspire him.

2182
02:09:10.611 --> 02:09:14.240
This kid is in a fucking hole,
but he can get out of it.

2183
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:17.380
How it's going to suck it up.
How would you get out?
I said,
oh,

2184
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:18.950
would you get out of it?
I would do like yesterday.

2185
02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.690
I have to take any job that I could get,

2186
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:25.730
but I'm a subtext so maybe I could get no,
I was thinking babysitting.

2187
02:09:25.731 --> 02:09:30.520
You pervert.
You'd whore yourself out.
No,
I wouldn't want,

2188
02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:35.440
my name is Nia.
Boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.
And I got some high heel do dude.
Who Do,

2189
02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:39.560
who wants to fucking hit this?
I'm going to be a comedian.

2190
02:09:39.770 --> 02:09:43.100
You wouldn't sell your ass if you,
Oh,
if you had to sell your ass,

2191
02:09:43.730 --> 02:09:46.580
can you stop saying sell your ass.
You had to do it.

2192
02:09:48.230 --> 02:09:49.063
Thank you.

2193
02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:53.660
If you had need to become a lady of the evening,

2194
02:09:53.770 --> 02:09:58.430
a lay of the evening,
I had to do it.
I wouldn't go out on the street,

2195
02:09:58.431 --> 02:10:00.860
that's for sure.
How would you do it?
I would set up a,

2196
02:10:00.861 --> 02:10:04.670
like a website or something.
I'd be one of those high class broads.
Oh yeah.

2197
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:08.950
And meet you in like the lobby of a hotel.
I'd be making it classy.
Classy.

2198
02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:11.540
Well what would be the theme song and your Website Dude?

2199
02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:19.220
[inaudible]
lolicon

2200
02:10:20.750 --> 02:10:23.260
little man.
Okay.
I don't even know that song,

2201
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:25.790
but I wouldn't be interested in that.
And let's see if you hit,

2202
02:10:25.791 --> 02:10:28.760
but if you had that song and you were wearing a veil,
that would freak me out.

2203
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:32.330
Why would I wear a veil?
Just that's what that song just made me think of.

2204
02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:35.360
Whatever.
No new ones.
No,

2205
02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:39.320
they just have this veil and you're doing this really bad dance and it just

2206
02:10:39.321 --> 02:10:43.610
cancels out your hotness.
Um,
they've already,
you ever heard of the guys yet?

2207
02:10:43.611 --> 02:10:46.010
We had that.
You ever have a girl?
Just do something so weird.

2208
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:48.590
It cancels out like how good looking she is.

2209
02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:51.230
Maybe a laugh like puke cause she's so drunk.

2210
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:55.100
I was thinking more like hammer toes coming out of some fucking,
you know,

2211
02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:59.310
Paris sexy shoes when you're going to get the shoes with the red sole on it so

2212
02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:02.720
you can make all those other whores jealous.
You buy me a pair,
bitch,

2213
02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:07.190
your birthday is coming up and I can tell you right now,

2214
02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:10.010
I don't know what you're getting,
but I can tell you what you're not getting.

2215
02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:14.750
What do you mean overpriced horseshoes?
And yet,
you know I do it last second.

2216
02:11:14.751 --> 02:11:18.620
You've seen the birthday cards I give you ah,
over the one I gave you last year.

2217
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:21.680
That had to do it.
We had to do with golf and I just sort of scribbled it out.

2218
02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:24.500
They were out of birthday cards

2219
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:30.380
now I told you this year that I wanted to get and the purse.
So you had all that.

2220
02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:33.560
Oh,
that's gay.
They didn't have the purse.

2221
02:11:33.561 --> 02:11:36.560
I went to the place that didn't have the personnel.
We didn't ask for it.
Right.

2222
02:11:37.450 --> 02:11:42.320
But anyway,
to ask for it,
right
purse.
Can I have,
are you lying?

2223
02:11:42.740 --> 02:11:45.860
Am I lying about what did you actually get in?
And you're going to surprise me.

2224
02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:49.250
No.
You know what the reality is?
No,
I never went there.

2225
02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:52.213
I didn't go.
I was,

2226
02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:58.250
I was saying what is wrong with you now you're wearing yes,
I was.

2227
02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:02.690
I'm still sick.
I've been coughing and blowing my nose on the head.
That's why.

2228
02:12:02.691 --> 02:12:07.010
You know what?
I can tell you where to go in La to get it.
We're getting,

2229
02:12:07.011 --> 02:12:09.860
we're getting off at here.
Yeah.
You know why?

2230
02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:12.650
Because you're exposing the spoiled little Brat that you are.

2231
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:15.020
This is halted that mine

2232
02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:19.910
cause I went out and I would buy you stuff that you want and thinking that that

2233
02:12:19.911 --> 02:12:23.190
would shut you up.
That's not why y'all got it.

2234
02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:28.430
Why?
Because you love me.
Yeah.
And what do you do?

2235
02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:31.010
I love most about what you,
as you shut your trap.

2236
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:35.240
That's what I like best about you when you're not running your yet.

2237
02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:39.770
And he just fucking rubbing my head as I watch sports.
That's what I like.

2238
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:41.290
That's all I need out of uni.

2239
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:45.170
All those stupid shows where they go fucking way to a man's heart is through his

2240
02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:47.420
stomach.
No,
it isn't.
Shut your trap.

2241
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:51.950
Rub My head as I'm watching the game in order a pizza right then and then at

2242
02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:58.220
the end of the night or the night of no sexual favor cooking for you.

2243
02:12:58.221 --> 02:12:59.840
You love that?
Yeah,
I do love that.

2244
02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:02.000
Can you tell me when I wasn't here for a couple days,

2245
02:13:02.001 --> 02:13:05.780
you felt like at a loss because you're so dependent on me.
That's ridiculous.

2246
02:13:05.781 --> 02:13:09.450
And I,
you and I were walking around the apartment like woo way

2247
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:16.100
I did was pathetic,
you know,
you know,
I felt like the male Stepford wife,

2248
02:13:16.910 --> 02:13:19.850
I was just like,
how do you know how to pay bills and do any?

2249
02:13:19.851 --> 02:13:24.050
Now I know how to pay bills.
You take that back lady.
I take it back.

2250
02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:26.420
I'm just fucking with you though.
I don't know why.
I don't know how to,

2251
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:29.900
I used not a cook.
He used to cook shit.
I,
there was,

2252
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:33.240
there was food and I would cook it and it would make an,
it tastes delicious,

2253
02:13:33.241 --> 02:13:36.660
but back in the day I made Lasagna was great.
Yeah,
it's fucking delicious.

2254
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:41.060
Make the salmon too.
And that I to make that I had,
I had the beef stew,
right?

2255
02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.490
A big piece of Bailey's.

2256
02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:46.350
The set it and forget it to make a rotisserie style chicken.

2257
02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:50.820
Set it and forget it.
Yeah.
Underrated,
underrated.

2258
02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:54.420
That thing.
I don't know why.
I think I threw that thing out.
That why?

2259
02:13:55.170 --> 02:13:59.670
Because what those big weird rubber,
right gloves
handle the chicken,

2260
02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:06.660
those things where like the fucking sex offender was so fucking crazy.

2261
02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:14.520
They came with these,
these big rubber gloves that they didn't move.

2262
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:18.030
That was a thing.
They were like,
they were like form to some murderers hands,

2263
02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:21.660
and you just had to slip your heads into them because they're so worried about

2264
02:14:21.661 --> 02:14:22.980
getting,
you get burned.

2265
02:14:23.010 --> 02:14:27.090
They didn't want to get sued and went all the way up to your elbows like Jackie

2266
02:14:27.090 --> 02:14:31.850
Kennedy,
but they were these big fucking Herman Munster gloves.
Oh,
and they were,

2267
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.760
they were this all white.
Yeah.
They look worse.
Color.

2268
02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:40.200
They look healthy before we even got them.
But getting back to the Senate,

2269
02:14:41.370 --> 02:14:46.090
every get it's right studio audiences yell.
That thing was the shit,
that thing.

2270
02:14:46.110 --> 02:14:49.030
I made a pretty good chicken.
I made a great chicken.
Yeah,

2271
02:14:49.090 --> 02:14:50.650
they had it down and it came out.

2272
02:14:50.690 --> 02:14:54.810
It was Golden Brown and he had fucking lunch meat for the fucking week.
Right.

2273
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:57.700
The old thing that sucked was on top of the way they claimed the heat with

2274
02:14:57.701 --> 02:15:00.970
somehow steam the vegetables.
That shit didn't work.
Oh No,
no.

2275
02:15:01.210 --> 02:15:04.510
So I took out my walk and that was it.
Hey,
by the way,
Aww.

2276
02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:07.890
How sweet is that guitar I bought?
It's beautiful.
I finally,

2277
02:15:08.010 --> 02:15:11.830
I bought the Best God Damn Guitar.
Uh,

2278
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:15.130
I s I and that's all I've been doing for life.
You know,
I had,

2279
02:15:15.190 --> 02:15:17.210
I had that brutal couple of weeks right there with Nia.

2280
02:15:17.211 --> 02:15:21.270
I was on fucking six flights and 15 days.
I caught a code.
Yeah.

2281
02:15:21.550 --> 02:15:25.360
I caught a cold.
I did those two episodes of glee.
Yeah,
right.

2282
02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:29.200
And uh,
the one episode,
sorry,
shot on two days and then a,

2283
02:15:29.201 --> 02:15:31.660
and I was did DC and I did New York in the middle of that.

2284
02:15:31.930 --> 02:15:36.850
So every once in awhile I will actually go out and I'll spend a little money on

2285
02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:39.250
myself.
And uh,

2286
02:15:39.251 --> 02:15:44.251
