00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.683
Here's a question for you. Say, it takes roughly the same amount of time to

00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:08.927
compute the lighting at a vertex as it does per pixel. You're trying to get some

00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:12.290
idea of how much more expensive it is to draw objects using the material

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.151
evaluation, using fragment shading instead of vertex shading. In other words,

00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:19.900
Phong shading instead of Gouraud shading. Say your object and application has

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.237
the following characteristics. Each vertex on the mesh is squared by an average

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:28.698
of 5 triangles. That is, any vertex where we compute the materials color can be

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:33.809
shared among 5 triangles. On average, each triangle covers 60 pixels. Don't

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.920
worry about visibility. Assume the pixel shader is evaluated for all of these

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.153
pixels in a triangle. So, the question to you is how many reflection evaluations

00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:48.973
are needed for, per pixel versus per vertex shading? In other words Phong versus

00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:49.915
Gouraud Shading.
