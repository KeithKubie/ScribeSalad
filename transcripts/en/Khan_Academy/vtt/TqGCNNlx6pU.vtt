00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.000
We want to find the
derivative with respect

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.920
to x of all of this
business right over here.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.880
And you might guess-- and this
is definitely a function of x.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.130
x is one of the
boundaries of integration

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.660
for this definite integral.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.170
And you might say,
well, it looks

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.080
like the fundamental theorem
of calculus might apply,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.150
but I'm used to seeing
the x, or the function

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.320
x, as the upper bound,
not as the lower bound.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.120
How do I deal with this?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.550
And the key realization
is to realize

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.000
what happens when you switch
bounds for a definite integral.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.730
And I'll do a little bit
of an aside to review that.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.610
So if I'm taking the definite
integral from a to b of f of t,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.260
dt, we know that this is capital
F, the antiderivative of f,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.710
evaluated at b minus the
antiderivative of F evaluated

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.035
at a.

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.100
This is corollary to
the fundamental theorem,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.808
or it's the fundamental
theorem part two,

00:00:55.808 --> 00:00:58.500
or the second fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.910
This is how we evaluate
definite integrals.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.819
Now, let's think about what
the negative of this is.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.610
So the negative of that--
of a to b of f of t,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.770
dt, is just going to be equal
to the negative of this, which

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.160
is equal to-- so it's the
negative of f of b minus f

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.020
of a, which is equal to capital
F of a minus capital F of b.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.930
All I did is distribute
the negative sign

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.750
and then switch the two terms.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.170
But this right over here is
equal to the definite integral

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:41.430
from, instead of a to b, but
from b to a of f of t, dt.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.370
So notice, when
you put a negative,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.980
that's just like
switching the signs

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.160
or switching the boundaries.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.701
Or if you switch
the boundaries, they

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:49.340
are the negatives of each other.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.880
So we can go back to
our original problem.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.730
We can rewrite this as being
equal to the derivative with

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.460
respect to x of--
instead of this,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.950
it'll be the negative of the
same definite integral but with

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.479
the boundaries switched-- the
negative of x with the upper

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.950
boundary is x, the lower
bound is 3 of the square root

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.700
of the absolute value
of cosine t, dt,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.130
which is equal to--we can
take the negative out front--

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.600
negative times the derivative
with respect to x of all

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.410
of this business.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.420
I should just copy
and paste that,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.000
so I'll just copy and paste.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.690
Let me-- and paste it.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.270
So times the derivative with
respect to x of all that,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.360
and now the fundamental theorem
of calculus directly applies.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.699
This is going to be equal to--
we deserve a drum roll now.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.490
This is going to be
equal to the negative--

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.410
can't forget the negative.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.900
And the fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.490
tells us that that's
just going to be

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.440
this function as
a function of x.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.240
So it's going to be
negative square root

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.580
of the absolute value of
cosine of not t anymore, but x.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.860
And we are done.
