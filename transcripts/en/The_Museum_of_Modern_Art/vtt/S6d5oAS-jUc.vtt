00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:03.458
(modern music)

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:04.556
- [Peter] The frame shop here

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:07.456
at the Museum of Modern
Art is actually unique.

00:00:07.456 --> 00:00:10.443
We do most of the framing
for the collection,

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.363
for exhibitions and traveling exhibitions.

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:15.270
Anything that is wood is made inside.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.710
We have a small woodworking shop.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.572
We have seven people
working at the department

00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:20.792
but we produce a
tremendous amount of work.

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:22.312
In the case of Cristina's World,

00:00:22.312 --> 00:00:24.112
it can't be too modern.

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:26.652
It has to fit with a certain context.

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:29.005
Ultimately the best frame is the one

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:31.625
that doesn't call attention to itself.

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:34.025
The frame has a way of
pushing and pulling.

00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:36.965
Normally if you had a landscape,

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:38.212
it would be what is called a cove,

00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:41.788
a frame that comes out and
creates a window into the work.

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:43.068
This works in reverse.

00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:44.531
This one the painting come forward

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:46.651
and the frame goes back.

00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.891
The first thing I wanted
to do was to understand

00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:51.513
why the frame was not working.

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:53.073
What is it about the frame

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:55.713
that could be improved upon?

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.713
It was not original to the work.

00:00:57.713 --> 00:01:01.860
Framers talk about frames
in terms of weight,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.472
not necessarily in terms of look.

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:06.032
The frame could be too
light, it could be too heavy.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.352
The frame that it had
was a little bit light.

00:01:08.352 --> 00:01:09.972
A little (mumbles) even though it

00:01:09.972 --> 00:01:11.575
had a gold band on the inside.

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:15.465
The gilded liner of the
frame was actually touching

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:17.284
the chimneys of the house.

00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:20.644
Wyeth spent a great
deal of time and effort

00:01:20.644 --> 00:01:22.744
coming all the way too the edge.

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:25.685
So what's important that
we see the entire panel.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.320
This painting actually is floating.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140
There are two frames in one here.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.150
It's not damaging or causing any pressure.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.276
Many of the frames that Wyeth selected

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.846
for his work were painted

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:42.979
and he always wanted to pick
a color from the painting

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.398
and use that color in the frame.

00:01:45.398 --> 00:01:47.218
If the artist does it it's one thing,

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:49.138
but a framer should not be doing that.

00:01:49.138 --> 00:01:52.178
I picked what I thought
would be a very natural wood

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.558
and basically set the
painting within the frame

00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:56.718
as a beautiful little jewel.

00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:00.019
The whole frames is made
from one single piece of wood

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.020
so that the grain just continues.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.200
We knew from the beginning that we

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.220
were going to have a gold band.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.340
I decided to put a cove on the inside

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.887
to separate the gilding.

00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:13.011
The next step is to design the panel.

00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:15.520
One element that would justify angling

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.638
the panel to the outside
is the roof of the house.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:22.100
Then you have to decide how
that panel is going to end.

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:25.188
This is an abrupt stop.

00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:27.128
It has another angle to the back.

00:02:27.128 --> 00:02:30.066
The frame will appear
almost floating on the wall

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.606
because when you light it

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:33.588
it's going to cast a shadow behind it.

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:34.888
After you make the frame

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:38.269
then you start thinking
about the different stains.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.901
Once you put a stain on the
panel you can't take it off

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:42.988
and that's where you come in.

00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:45.308
We're making as many samples as possible

00:02:45.308 --> 00:02:48.109
using the exact same piece of wood.

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.769
You can see the difference
if you put them next to it.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.209
These are very very minor variations

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.449
that ultimately you
don't pay attention to,

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.310
but in terms of the framing
it's rather important

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.641
and it has a way of affecting
how we see a painting.

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:07.103
