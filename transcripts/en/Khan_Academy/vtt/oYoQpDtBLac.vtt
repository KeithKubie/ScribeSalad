00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.420
If I were to come over to your
place and say, name this

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.260
molecule, the first thing you
would do is you'd say, well,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.410
look, we have a double
bond, So we're

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.550
dealing with an alkene.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.140
We have four carbons in
the longest chain.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.590
There's actually
one chain here.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.220
So it's one, two, three,
four carbons.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.770
So the prefix will be but-, and
regardless of which end

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.830
you count from, the double bond
starts at the number two

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.700
carbon, so this is but-2-ene.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.880
I'd say, well, that's very
good, and that is correct

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.870
based on everything
we've learned.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.190
But what about what about
this molecule?

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.840
What about the molecule
that looks like this?

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.160
And you'd go through
the same process.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.740
You'd say it has
a double bond.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.850
It's an alkene.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.960
Our longest chain has
four carbons:

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.110
one, two, three, four.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.590
Regardless of which end you
start counting from, the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.150
double bond starts at the number
two carbon: one, two,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.370
three, four.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.880
So once again, you say, hey,
Sal, that's also but-2-ene.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.710
And I'd point out that these
are each fundamentally

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.790
different molecules.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.880
And the reason why they're
fundamentally different

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.180
molecules is because this double
bond can't rotate.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.690
It's got that pi bond there
for that second bond that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.460
keeps this carbon-carbon
bond rigid.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.450
So it's not like the molecule
can switch configurations

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.390
between this-- it's not like
it can switch conformations

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.940
between this and that.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.540
It cannot rotate around this
double bond, so these are

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.290
different molecules.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.530
These are different molecules
that will behave different

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.840
chemically.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.070
And because they behave
different, we have to have

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.630
different names for them.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.390
Now, there's two different
naming conventions.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.570
One is the simpler naming
convention, and it works when

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.750
we have one functional group on
each of the carbons in the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.470
double bond.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.630
And then in the next two videos,
we'll talk about the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.250
slightly more advanced naming
scheme that will work when we

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.280
have more than one
functional group.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.160
So the first way to name
it is if you have

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.080
your functional groups.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.860
So let me circle the
functional groups.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.640
So in this top one, our
functional groups are on

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.370
opposite sides.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.080
They're apart.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.770
They're on opposite sides of the
carbon-carbon double bond.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.130
This is on the top, This
is on the bottom.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.480
In this molecule right here, our
functional groups are on

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.210
the same side.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.720
So when our functional groups
are on different sides, we

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.400
could call it trans.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.670
We could call it trans,
literally, I believe, Latin

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.760
for, apart, or Latin
for opposite.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.160
I'm not a Latin scholar,
so forgive me.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.010
But the functional groups
are apart, so we call it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.260
trans-but-2-ene.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.100
The other convention to use
comes from the German forepart

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.760
and there we call it entgegen.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.360
And instead of writing out
entgegen, we write E in

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.200
parentheses.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.990
So we would call them-- let me
just use different colors

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.120
since this molecule
down here is blue.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.095
So we would call this
(E)-but-2-ene.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.560
These mean the same thing.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.190
(E)-but-2-ene.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.130
But this is now kind of the
standard convention.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.140
We'll see this notation where
you use entgegen, or (E), is

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.300
actually more powerful.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.600
It can extend to when we have
more than one functional group

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.510
on each carbon.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.020
Let me just make it clear that
the (E) stands for entgegen,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.250
which is German for apart, or
at least I believe it is.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.260
I can't speak German so I'll
just have to take people's

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.280
words for it.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.870
Now, in this situation where our
functional groups are on

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.970
the same side, you could call
this cis-but-2-ene.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.940
Cis, I believe, comes from the
Latin for together, or you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.190
could call it (Z)-but-2-ene.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.310
And you could imagine
this (Z) comes from

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.820
the German for together.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:20.910
And it stands for zusammen,
which is German for together.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.190
And that's all you have to do.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.060
And in the next few videos,
we'll do a bunch of examples

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.010
here so we can really figure out
whether to label something

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.060
with either an (E) or a (Z).

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.960
But I wanted expose you to the
cis- and trans- naming scheme,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.490
because that's sometimes used
for simpler molecules where

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.550
you only have one functional
group on each side.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.880
But I want you to realize that
they're really trying to make

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.760
the same differentiation.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.190
They're really just trying to
decide whether the functional

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.340
groups on one side of a double
bond and on the other side of

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.460
a double bond, whether they're
on the same side, cis-, or

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.860
(Z), or zusammen, or on
different sides, trans- or

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.110
(E), or entgegen.
