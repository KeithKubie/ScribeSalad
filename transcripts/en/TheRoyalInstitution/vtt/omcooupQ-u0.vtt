00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.150
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.470
I like to think of the London
Underground as being like the

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.000
veins and arteries
of the capital.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.030
Subterranean plumbing that's
taking everybody where they

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.170
need to go.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.530
Even the timetable feels
like a pulse.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.200
Our hearts pump the nutrients
that we need in order to

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.860
survive around our body--

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.370
sugars, fats, the amino acids
that are the building blocks

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.232
of proteins.

00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:35.960
But it's not all good though.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.980
It also takes cholesterol.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430
Now, we all need a bit of
cholesterol, we use it in our

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.515
cell membranes.

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:43.850
But too much of it
can be dangerous.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.710
Low Density Lipoprotein, or
LDL as it is known, is a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.690
particularly dangerous
form of cholesterol.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.510
It can build up in our
arteries, leading to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.920
cardiovascular disease,
a leading cause of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.420
death in this country.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.020
A gene in chromosome 19 codes
for the LDL receptor, a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.510
protein that binds LDL and
takes it out of the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.410
bloodstream.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.960
If you've got something wrong
with this gene then you

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.840
develop familial
hypercholesterolemia, this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.110
means that the cholesterol stays
in the arteries and can

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.140
lead to cardiovascular
disease.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.770
It's like when the escalator is
broken, people can't leave

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.070
the station fast enough.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.130
And so congestion starts to
build up, and congestion can

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.710
lead to trouble.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.130
When the blood can't flow,
the body starts to die.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.740
My father has genetically high
cholesterol, but he knows

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.050
about it so it's no big deal.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.130
He just has to watch what he
eats that bit more carefully

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.360
than the rest of us.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.290
Forewarned is forearmed.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.200
If we understand how our genes
and our body work, then we can

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.340
avoid any trouble.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.920
I think this weekend I'm just
going to take the bus instead.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:02:04.759
