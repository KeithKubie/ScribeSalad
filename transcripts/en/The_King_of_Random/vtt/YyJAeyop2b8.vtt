00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Hey, what's up guys; welcome back. For this video, I've teamed up with Gillette to do something a little bit different

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.740
You might even say

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.840
Something a little bit super with the new Justice League film hitting theaters November

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.950
17th Gillette has challenged me to have a day in the life of Batman and

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.740
Cyborg so I can give them some feedback if they were to develop a razor fit for a superhero you already know Batman

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
He's gotham city's greatest vigilante and cyborg is from gotham city as well

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.630
Okay

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.570
So there are three parts of this video first of all we're gonna unbox this VIP

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.420
Justice League gift pack that just came in the mail for me today

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.218
and you can actually purchase one yourself right now in stores or online then we're heading out on a

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:43.079
Superhero adventure to try Aussie style repelling MMA fighting and hang gliding then we'll be assessing the conditions that Batman and cyborg may be exposed

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.659
To in an average day of crime-fighting so we can make some recommendations

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.760
To Gillette on how to make a razor fit for the big black bat and the bionic man alright

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.090
Let's tear into this package from Gillette and see what this Justice League gift pack has got we got a Gillette pro shield razor

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.300
There's some shaving gel some body wash some clear gel deodorant and of course the Justice League branded box

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.820
Which you could keep as a collector's item cool stuff

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.409
But that is not all Gillette is also providing fans with exclusive Justice League virtual reality content that you can download at Gillette.com/vrapp

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.029
RPP that's Gillette dot com slash VR app check it out

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.290
And you can see what it feels like being one of your favorite superheroes and on that note

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.299
I think it's time to head out on an adventure of our own

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.619
As a guardian of Gotham City Batman has constantly rappelling off buildings dropping the dark alleyways and using his grappling hook to make quick escapes

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.240
So for my first experience

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.170
I've come to the mountains to try Aussie style rappelling so we can get a taste of how that must feel

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.689
So we've got all of our ropes and our gear rigged up

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:45.679
We've just done our safety checks

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.299
And I am literally standing at the top of the cliff right now about ready to jump off. I guess

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.779
This is the moment that we find out what it feels like to be a superhero here we go

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.509
That was actually pretty cool, woo yeah

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.909
Woo doggy we did it aussie style rappelling is in the bag. We're moving on to hand to hand combat

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.339
Being highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat is a must for any

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.270
Superhero because you never know when or how you'll be attacked so for our next adventure

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.800
We're headed to a training arena to get a few pointers from some of the best in mixed martial arts

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.320
Now it seems to me that being a superhero. What's really gonna

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.109
give you the cutting edge is how you perform in tactical hand-to-hand combat so I've come out here to an MMA training gym today to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.619
Learn some close-proximity power moves for taking down the villains today

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.920
We're going to work on superhero fighting tactics one of the biggest things

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.040
I want to work on is power knockout punches big Slams throws and fight finishing tactics

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.399
So now that we've learned some superhero power moves we're gonna

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.580
Do what some of the best heroes are known for we're gonna take to the skies and learn to fly

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.860
Leaving the ground and soaring high through the air is a dream that mortal men and women have fantasized about since the dawn of existence

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.849
The fact that superheroes like Batman have gadgets and wings to help them do it is

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.229
Relatable enough that I figured hang-gliding might be the way to go so for one final adventure

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.209
We're rising high above the cityscape to the tops of the mountains so we can spread our wings and hit the skies

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.750
So we got our hang glider assembled

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.440
We're just doing our final safety checks, then we're going to buckle in and run straight off the side of this mountain

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.079
Keep your hands on me. Yep

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.180
We're gonna step back here

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.930
As we get running the glider will lift up when you duck your head inside the triangle next to me all right here

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.020
We go this is the moment of truth it is time to fly

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.360
Can you tell me something; what you're thinking? yeah, so we're doing pretty good

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.420
basically clearing this obstacle with decent height which we're doing that's the main goal

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.280
Pretty perfect afternoon nice job nice job

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.880
Beautiful flight

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.930
absolutely

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.040
Guys we just got finished our flight absolutely incredible experience

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.420
I wasn't nearly as nervous or full of adrenaline as I thought it would be it was actually very very peaceful

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.749
Soaring around the mountains kind of like on the wings of an eagle

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.750
Gives me a lot more insight to help Batman must feel soaring through the sky scrapers of Gotham City that was incredible

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.450
So we are back from our adventures

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.529
And it's time to formulate some theories and now based on my experience is running down rock faces

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.989
I can see how Batman might be exposed to hazards like dirt exposure to the Sun wind debris

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.529
Acidic pH levels in Gotham City from acid rain as well as possibly falling and bruising himself on the way down now

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.649
Fighting in the MMA arena was a big wake-up. Call I definitely felt sore muscles a little bit of bruising a headache

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.619
Dehydration and fatigue and because Batman and cyborg had skin muscle and tissues these are all conditions

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.280
They'll most likely be suffering with as well now hang gliding was just plain cool

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.540
And we had the perfect day to fly

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:02.239
but there are certainly risks of extreme air currents lightning cold air and hail wind burn and

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.310
Verga the rain that comes down from the clouds

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.269
but doesn't hit the ground so based on these experiences based on my thoughts here is my

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.620
Conclusion for Gillette if Gillette we're gonna design a razor for Batman and cyborg

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.620
it would need at least three things an

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:22.099
ultrasonic stimulator would penetrate deep into the tissues relaxing knots healing bruises and curing sore muscles on contact a tachyon

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.799
Rejuvenator to accelerate the healing of chapped burnt

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.380
Or damaged skin and the cellular invigorator to moisturize soothes and repair the body on the cellular level

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:37.549
Restoring hydration curing fatigue suppressing headaches and essentially restoring the superheroes body the peak physical condition once again

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.169
But that's just my theory and I'm sure there are a lot of things that I've missed or haven't even considered at all so this

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:46.819
Is where you come in comment down below or get on facebook Instagram or Twitter to share your theories on
