00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.890
Scientists may have just figured out how to
roll back climate change, the only catch?

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580
It could cost as much as 5 trillion dollars
and use more steel than the United States

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.719
produces in a year.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.460
Hey there freezing fans, Jules here for Dnews!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.410
Climate change is very real, and one of its
biggest victims is Arctic sea ice.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.220
Since the 1980s, the amount of ice has, on
average, dropped by more than 13 percent each

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.220
decade.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.220
But fear not!

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.531
Because according to a paper just published
in the journal, Earth’s Future, scientists

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.570
may have an ingenious solution.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.309
It involves ten million pumps.

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.850
The plan is to “refreeze” ten percent
of the arctic ice cap by using giant wind-powered

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.460
pumps to cover the existing caps with salty
seawater..

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.800
When the seawater is sprayed on top of frozen
ice and surrounded by the -40 degree celcius

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.379
air, it freezes into new ice.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.199
According to the paper, it would take 10 million
wind-powered pumps, outputting roughly 16.5

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.569
pounds of water per second, to add 3 feet
of ice over ten percent of the Arctic Ocean.

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.390
For every 4 feet of water pumped onto the
surface, the ice will become roughly 3 feet

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.670
thicker, a plan that, if it works, will postpone
the loss of the ice caps by about 17 years

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.280
for every year they do this.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.030
As the researchers say, quote “Implementation
over the entire Arctic in the early 2030s

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.210
… would reset the clock to the present day.”

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.560
That’s great news because at the current
rate, scientists estimate the polar ice caps

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.410
will be entirely gone by 2030.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.340
Of course, the plan isn’t easy, or economical.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.020
Each wind turbine used to power the pump will
need to be roughly 19 feet across, and use

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.640
roughly 22,000 pounds of steel.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.520
The paper also states that ten million pumps
would only really cover ten percent of the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.990
Arctic Ocean’s roughly 4 million square
mile size; to cover the entire area would

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.770
take 100 million pumps, and roughly 100 million
tons of steel each year.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.640
The US alone currently produces about 80 to
90 million tons of steel a year, so covering

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.690
just 10 percent of the Arctic ice would use
around 13 percent of U.S. steel production.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.480
The total cost would be 50 billion dollars
per year, or 500 billion over 10 years -- and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.929
again, that’s if you only cover 10 percent
of the Arctic.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.680
To cover the whole thing would be a whopping
5 trillion dollars.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.090
But not all efforts to save the Arctic ice
caps are so costly.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.849
Another leading solution is called solar-radiation
management, where sunlight is reflected away

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.989
from the ice, instead of being absorbed by
it, leading to slower melting.

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.020
One method of doing this is to inject reflective
aerosol particles, particularly chemicals

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.319
like sulfates, into the stratosphere.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.209
In nature, volcanic eruptions scatter sulfate
particles high into the air as part of an

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.659
ash cloud, and it has been observed that these
particles reflect solar radiation back into

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.310
space and lead to cooling of the earth below
it.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.200
So if we could do this artificially, it could
have the same effect.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.611
In fact, a 2008 study found that if we could
decrease the sunlight reaching the Arctic

00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:55.099
area by about 21%, it would allow the ice
to remain even if the amount of CO2 in the

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.099
air doubled.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.719
But this solution leads to many other environmental
concerns, such degradation of the ozone, which

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.060
sulfates are known to do.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.129
It could also lead to a warming of the stratosphere,
as the reflective particles would absorb some

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.359
of the heat and disperse it in the surrounding
atmospheric air.

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.689
Both of these could ultimately lead to a worsening
of climate change conditions.

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.279
And the aerosol in itself is air pollution,
of the kind that leads to asthma and other

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:18.300
health problems.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.489
Ultimately, there is no simple, elegant solution.

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.150
The paper itself admits that technology alone
won’t solve our problems.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.900
The world is still warming, the ice caps are
melting, and the sea levels are rising.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.540
Without the ice caps reflecting light away
from earth, the ocean will absorb even more

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.920
solar radiation and heat, which could influence
global warming.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.900
Worse yet, the more ice is melted in the Arctic,
the more methane, a greenhouse gas, will be

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.810
released into the atmosphere.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.279
Currently that methane is trapped under the
permafrost, and as that thaws, it could speed

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.040
up the effects of global warming.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.939
While setting up 100 million pumps, or shooting
sulfates into the sky may sound crazy, those

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.769
may not be as crazy as the alternatives.
