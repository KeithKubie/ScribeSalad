00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.140
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases
known to man.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.580
In fact, if someone with measles coughs in
an elevator, 90% of the people who use that

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.260
elevator after will catch the disease.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.540
Unless of course you’ve been vaccinated.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.440
Then you’ll be completely fine.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.720
This is the measles virus, it’s been around
for thousands of years and has been responsible

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.720
for the deaths of millions of people.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.050
Now, on the surface, measles symptoms seem
fairly innocuous.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.019
But the real damage, the damage that can lead
to death, happens on a cellular level.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.669
Hi I'm Roberto Cattaneo.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.840
I'm a Doctor of Philosophy and Professor of
Molecular Biology at the Mayo Clinic.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.380
I'm studying the measles virus since about
35 years.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.640
Measles uses the trachea
as a trampoline.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:53.510
It is in the ideal position in the body to
get expelled and to get aerosolized dispersed

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.000
in the air in small particles very efficiently.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.020
When someone with measles coughs or sneezes,
these droplets contain the measles virus,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.640
and because measles is a respiratory disease,
all someone needs to do is breathe in that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.020
infected air in order to contract measles.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.340
Unless, of course, they’ve been vaccinated.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.940
When the measles virus reaches the lungs,
it is met by a type of white blood cell called

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.320
a macrophage.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.020
Usually, macrophages seek out and destroy
dangerous pathogens like viruses.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.500
But the measles virus tricks the macrophage
into not seeing it as a danger and instead,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.049
safely transports the virus into the body’s
lymph nodes.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.960
It’s here that the virus begins to replicate
and spread throughout the entire lymphatic system.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.500
Yea, I mean the macrophages thinks to have a
system in which they basically get rid of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.760
the virus and the virus is.

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:40.670
And measles can stay there.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.980
So not only it is invisible but it begins
to make damage to these cells.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.520
The task of these cells is also to go out and fight infection,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.740
but instead of fighting infection, they go out with the virus and distribute it to the body.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.039
Now, as the virus starts to spread, it enters
immune cells that express a protein named

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.039
SLAM.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.859
These cells are “memory” immune cells,
meaning that they remember other pathogens

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.020
that previously infected the host.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.970
Measles attacks and kills these SLAM-expressing
memory cells and once those memories of past

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.060
infections are erased, the body will be in
a much weaker position to fight off future infections

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.180
This is why measles is so deadly.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.680
But even though the virus has tricked your
immune system to helping it, that doesn’t

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.920
mean your immune system has given up.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.240
Well, at some point the immune system will notice
and will secrete cytokines and attract other

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.510
immune cells.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.000
So at some point the enemy will be identified
and taken care of.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.820
But for the viruses in fact it is only necessary
to get out of the host and find a new host.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.320
So it's in fact better not to kill the host.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.480
That’s right, it’s in the best interest
of the virus not to kill you, that’s some

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.280
other diseases job.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.240
The job of the measles virus is to find a
new host, which brings us to another protein

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.130
the virus expresses: nectin4.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:10.440
And we discovered nectin 4as the epithelial receptor
or host exit receptor for measles virus.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.680
As measles spreads throughout the body, it
also enters cells that express the protein

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.690
nectin4.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.200
This protein is expressed very preferentially
in the trachea.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.800
And the more the virusit replicates in the trachea,
the more cells it kills there.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.220
This dead cell build up actually causes the
human host to cough or sneeze, helping spread

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.680
it into a new human host, bringing us right
back to where we started.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.100
Now, the good news is that once you get the
measles, your body learns how to defeat it

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.060
and you probably won’t get it again.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.100
This is similar to how the vaccine works,
but the difference is you’re given a weaker

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.840
dose, so you can become immune without getting
sick or damaging your immune cells.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:52.460
So the vaccine causes the host to remain immune
to measles we think for life long or almost

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.080
life long time.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.460
And without measles, other diseases, the ones
that actually do the killing, have gone down.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.860
Basically the number of hospitalization has
been reduced considerably sometimes to about

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.960
half for several different infectious diseases.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.960
So, if you haven't been vaccinated...

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.760
Yea, the vaccine works beautifully.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.140
maybe think about it?

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.240
Measles may be the enemy of the immune system,
but researchers, including Dr Cattaneo, are

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.900
working on ways to alter the measles virus
so it kills cancer cells.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:34.860
For me, a reason to continue study measles
is to make it into a friend, making an old

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.560
enemy into a new friend by modifying it genetically.
