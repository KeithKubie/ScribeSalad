00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.460
At the end of the previous video we ended at the following iteration

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.260
with the following paths forward.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.870
We started with a vague question.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.780
How popular were the different brands of candy?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.160
And we considered the two possible metrics, interselection time and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.190
total number of selections for quantifying this question.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.040
We ended up choosing as an initial guess interselection time.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.730
Now that we have a metric interselection time that we

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.940
feel captures what we're interested in, we must use it

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.060
to cast the above question as a problem of a statistical inference.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.970
So there are many options for doing so.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.310
One is point estimation, in which we explicitly try to create a estimator for

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.570
our quantity interselection time.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.890
Another is confidence sets, in which we try to create an interval,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.620
which traps the true value of inter selection time with some confidence level.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.750
Classification, in which we choose various descriptive classes which may

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.020
not be ordered.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.900
And try to classify interselection time into one of those classes.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.510
So for example in contrast with point estimation in which we explicitly try to

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.710
come up with an estimator for the actual value of interselection time.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.000
In classification we may choose just broad categories like short or

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.810
long and try to match the actual quantity to one of those classes.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.400
Hypothesis testing in which we for example, might try to determine if

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.790
two different collections of inter selection time values came from two different

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.750
probability distributions and how much confidence we have in that being true.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.840
Or lastly, parameter estimation in which we try to do things like.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.240
Find the parameter of a Poisson distribution,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.530
or find the bandwidth value on a kernel density estimation.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.640
Which we'll talk a lot more about, in a later lesson.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.600
Depending on the outcome of later phases, we may return to the question phase,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.860
to recast the same problem as a different statistical inference problem.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.640
For example, we may find the regression estimator we create has

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.320
a very high variance, thus poor performance but

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.140
can be recast as a classifier with a very high accuracy.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140
Let's state this problem more formally.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.750
Our goal is to build a regression estimator, r.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.940
R will tell us its estimate for an interselection time for

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.140
a candy, c, at any given turn.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.750
Our data points are just the candy selections and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.278
the order in which they were selected.

00:02:15.278 --> 00:02:18.290
With the inter-selection time written beside them.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.330
In other words, given the list of candy selections, and

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.190
the number of turns since each candy had last been chosen.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.930
We are going to build an estimator, R, that will tell us at a given turn for

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.960
a given candy how long it has been since it was last selected.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.020
Let's consider our next possible paths for analysis.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.270
At this stage really our only options are to proceed with

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.370
the regression estimator.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.260
Which means identifying features or revisiting an earlier stop.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.010
In the next video we'll proceed with feature selection.
