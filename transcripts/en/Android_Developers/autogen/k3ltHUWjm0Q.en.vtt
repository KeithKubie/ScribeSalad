is you know it's really all you've ever

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
is you know it's really all you've ever
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.060
is you know it's really all you've ever
known

and I've found I think the degree to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
and I've found I think the degree to
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.539
and I've found I think the degree to
which it is changing is directly tied to

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549
which it is changing is directly tied to
 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.670
which it is changing is directly tied to
how much experience pre digital pre

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
how much experience pre digital pre
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.750
how much experience pre digital pre
mobile pre-social you have

so when it comes to our audience which

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
so when it comes to our audience which
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.320
so when it comes to our audience which
is quite young so kids and teens we can

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
is quite young so kids and teens we can
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.910
is quite young so kids and teens we can
see that they're really the pro users

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
see that they're really the pro users
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.760
see that they're really the pro users
and they're digital natives compared to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770
and they're digital natives compared to
 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.730
and they're digital natives compared to
users close to my age for example they

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740
users close to my age for example they
 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.040
users close to my age for example they
can really use all the nitty-gritty

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
can really use all the nitty-gritty
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.830
can really use all the nitty-gritty
details of the tools we provide to them

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
details of the tools we provide to them
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.920
details of the tools we provide to them
so definitely when it comes to these

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
so definitely when it comes to these
 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.470
so definitely when it comes to these
younger generations you can see that

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480
younger generations you can see that
 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.290
younger generations you can see that
they're much more mobile first and much

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300
they're much more mobile first and much
 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.030
they're much more mobile first and much
more digital native compared to the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
more digital native compared to the
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.050
more digital native compared to the
older generation yeah so we talk now

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060
older generation yeah so we talk now
 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.000
older generation yeah so we talk now
about the older people though our app of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010
about the older people though our app of
 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.450
about the older people though our app of
course has also younger ones but

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460
course has also younger ones but
 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.770
course has also younger ones but
regarding the old people you know we

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
regarding the old people you know we
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.410
regarding the old people you know we
have this aging population in general in

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420
have this aging population in general in
 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.650
have this aging population in general in
society and in Germany for example 20%

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660
society and in Germany for example 20%
 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.230
society and in Germany for example 20%
of the population of 65 years old or

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240
of the population of 65 years old or
 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.960
of the population of 65 years old or
older and you need to imagine that by

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
older and you need to imagine that by
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.920
older and you need to imagine that by
2030 every third German citizen will be

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
2030 every third German citizen will be
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.340
2030 every third German citizen will be
65 years old or older so the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350
65 years old or older so the
 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.790
65 years old or older so the
demographics are changing a lot and

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800
demographics are changing a lot and
 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.260
demographics are changing a lot and
these guys are different than these

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270
these guys are different than these
 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.510
these guys are different than these
young hipsters that we have right now a

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520
young hipsters that we have right now a
 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.160
young hipsters that we have right now a
lot of times in the apps so with them

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170
lot of times in the apps so with them
 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.660
lot of times in the apps so with them
for example there there's two things

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670
for example there there's two things
 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.420
for example there there's two things
that I think are a lot different so one

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430
that I think are a lot different so one
 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.130
that I think are a lot different so one
thing is perception the other thing is

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140
thing is perception the other thing is
 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.340
thing is perception the other thing is
understanding computer interfaces so for

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350
understanding computer interfaces so for
 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.550
understanding computer interfaces so for
perception of course as you age your

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560
perception of course as you age your
 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.340
perception of course as you age your
ability to see things to perceive things

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350
ability to see things to perceive things
 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.430

is not as strong anymore as it was when

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440
is not as strong anymore as it was when
 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.580
is not as strong anymore as it was when
you were young so that for example for

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
you were young so that for example for
 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.270

with a company yet provided rent rest
houses rest homes so there we had to

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470
houses rest homes so there we had to
 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.470
houses rest homes so there we had to
take care of the visuals for example

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480
take care of the visuals for example
 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.110

some colors cannot be perceived as good
 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.540
some colors cannot be perceived as good
so you have to take care not only of

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550
so you have to take care not only of
 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.850
so you have to take care not only of
increasing font sizes but also changing

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860
increasing font sizes but also changing
 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.480
increasing font sizes but also changing
the assets of your app and that's that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490
the assets of your app and that's that
 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.690
the assets of your app and that's that
some things that that we look at so it

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700
some things that that we look at so it
 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.980
some things that that we look at so it
sounds like everyone here should

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990
sounds like everyone here should
 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.050

demographics and age that talks with
 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.570
demographics and age that talks with
them almost every day so we get a lot of

them almost every day so we get a lot of
 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.909
them almost every day so we get a lot of
feature requests from from our beta

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919
feature requests from from our beta
 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.900
feature requests from from our beta
testers and and the sometimes we bring

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910
testers and and the sometimes we bring
 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.500
testers and and the sometimes we bring
new features and they fine-tune and they

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510
new features and they fine-tune and they
 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.080
new features and they fine-tune and they
give us some insights that we don't

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090
give us some insights that we don't
 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.890
give us some insights that we don't
really knew beforehand and also we look

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900
really knew beforehand and also we look
 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.440
really knew beforehand and also we look
at how they use the existing features of

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450
at how they use the existing features of
 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.680
at how they use the existing features of
our app and we get ideas to make certain

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690
our app and we get ideas to make certain
 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.740
our app and we get ideas to make certain
parts more efficient or bring new

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750
parts more efficient or bring new
 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.370
parts more efficient or bring new
features based on what they actually do

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380
features based on what they actually do
 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.680
features based on what they actually do
so it's really the constant

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690
so it's really the constant
 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.450

like to look at how they're using the
app but the second part though was the

app but the second part though was the
 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.659
app but the second part though was the
seed change and realizing that you know

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669
seed change and realizing that you know
 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.450

you are as the product manager you are

you are as the product manager you are
not building something for yourself you

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830
not building something for yourself you
 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.180
not building something for yourself you
are a servant of the company and its

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190
are a servant of the company and its
 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.730
are a servant of the company and its
customers and you truly have to listen

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740
customers and you truly have to listen
 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.290
customers and you truly have to listen
to these people who even if they are

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300
to these people who even if they are
 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.439
to these people who even if they are
younger than you they don't have all the

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449
younger than you they don't have all the
 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:58.400
younger than you they don't have all the
degrees that you do or the life

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410
degrees that you do or the life
 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.140
degrees that you do or the life
experience you do they have an

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150
experience you do they have an
 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.740
experience you do they have an
experience that is every bit as valid in

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750
experience that is every bit as valid in
 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.480
experience that is every bit as valid in
the case of this particular product more

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490
the case of this particular product more
 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.330
the case of this particular product more
valid and more important so I think

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340
valid and more important so I think
 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.159
valid and more important so I think
those two chunks are what you have to

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169
those two chunks are what you have to
 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.590
those two chunks are what you have to
deal with and focus on the most right

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600
deal with and focus on the most right
 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.140
deal with and focus on the most right
yeah what we look at in addition to of

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150
yeah what we look at in addition to of
 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.150
yeah what we look at in addition to of
course the data and what's interesting

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160
course the data and what's interesting
 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.460
course the data and what's interesting
to us is what our customer care teams

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470
to us is what our customer care teams
 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.850
to us is what our customer care teams
tells us so we their people call us and

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860
tells us so we their people call us and
 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.580
tells us so we their people call us and
then they have questions on the product

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590
then they have questions on the product
 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.070
then they have questions on the product
and in these cases you get this

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080
and in these cases you get this
 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.900
and in these cases you get this
qualitative feedback while you listen

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910
qualitative feedback while you listen
 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.840
qualitative feedback while you listen
how they talk and you want you see that

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:32.850
how they talk and you want you see that
 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.850
how they talk and you want you see that
they for example the old people they

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860
they for example the old people they
 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.980
they for example the old people they
really don't understand the computer

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:36.990
really don't understand the computer
 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.750
really don't understand the computer
interfaces this is not natural to them

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760
interfaces this is not natural to them
 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.060
interfaces this is not natural to them
for example you would listen to

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070
for example you would listen to
 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.339
for example you would listen to
something like you would ask them so

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:43.349
something like you would ask them so
 

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:46.100
something like you would ask them so
what is your browser how do you how do

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110
what is your browser how do you how do
 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.159
what is your browser how do you how do
you open up your website and then they

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:49.169
you open up your website and then they
 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:53.240
you open up your website and then they
would say what is the browser so then

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.250
would say what is the browser so then

00:11:36.369 --> 00:11:36.379
goes into dementia assessment so as you
 

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:37.929
goes into dementia assessment so as you
can see this is a natural conversation

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:37.939
can see this is a natural conversation
 

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:41.290
can see this is a natural conversation
it's not a strange computer interface so

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:41.300
it's not a strange computer interface so
 

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.989
it's not a strange computer interface so
we hope a lot in natural language

00:11:43.989 --> 00:11:43.999
we hope a lot in natural language
 

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:46.389
we hope a lot in natural language
processing so that we can replace this

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399
processing so that we can replace this
 

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:48.910
processing so that we can replace this
kind of things with assistance that can

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920
kind of things with assistance that can
 

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.410
kind of things with assistance that can
then lead the conversation with the

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:50.420
then lead the conversation with the
 

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.189
then lead the conversation with the
patient and assess this risk in dementia

00:11:54.189 --> 00:11:54.199
patient and assess this risk in dementia
 

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:56.829
patient and assess this risk in dementia
and on top of that it will be even more

00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:56.839
and on top of that it will be even more
 

00:11:56.839 --> 00:11:59.199
and on top of that it will be even more
reliable because right now for some

00:11:59.199 --> 00:11:59.209
reliable because right now for some
 

00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:01.869
reliable because right now for some
tests in dementia assessment one out of

00:12:01.869 --> 00:12:01.879
tests in dementia assessment one out of
 

00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:04.179
tests in dementia assessment one out of
ten times the doctor calculates it wrong

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:04.189
ten times the doctor calculates it wrong
 

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:07.689
ten times the doctor calculates it wrong
yeah so that's quite important to do

00:12:07.689 --> 00:12:07.699
yeah so that's quite important to do
 

00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:09.369
yeah so that's quite important to do
this right and to offer the right

00:12:09.369 --> 00:12:09.379
this right and to offer the right
 

00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:13.119
this right and to offer the right
interface to the old people great and so

00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:13.129
interface to the old people great and so
 

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:13.990
interface to the old people great and so
there's growing awareness that

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000
there's growing awareness that
 

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.720
there's growing awareness that
technology has the power to do good and

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:16.730
technology has the power to do good and
 

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.869
technology has the power to do good and
also to do bad and so of course do you

00:12:19.869 --> 00:12:19.879
also to do bad and so of course do you
 

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:21.759
also to do bad and so of course do you
feel that you have a real responsibility

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:21.769
feel that you have a real responsibility
 

00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:24.069
feel that you have a real responsibility
towards being mindful of your users and

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079
towards being mindful of your users and
 

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:28.629
towards being mindful of your users and
their overall well-being yeah so when it

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639
their overall well-being yeah so when it
 

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.579
their overall well-being yeah so when it
comes to especially for kids and teens

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:30.589
comes to especially for kids and teens
 

00:12:30.589 --> 00:12:33.490
comes to especially for kids and teens
we try to make the community as safe as

possible and you know suitable for their
 

00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:43.660
possible and you know suitable for their
age we have a lot of tools internally

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:43.670
age we have a lot of tools internally
 

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.569
age we have a lot of tools internally
that we use to moderate against for

00:12:46.569 --> 00:12:46.579
that we use to moderate against for
 

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:48.879
that we use to moderate against for
example bullying something that I

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:48.889
example bullying something that I
 

00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:52.090
example bullying something that I
learned also after I found that this

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:52.100
learned also after I found that this
 

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.799
learned also after I found that this
company was bullying was a big problem

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:53.809
company was bullying was a big problem
 

00:12:53.809 --> 00:12:58.689
company was bullying was a big problem
in this demographics so we have both

00:12:58.689 --> 00:12:58.699
in this demographics so we have both
 

00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:01.059
in this demographics so we have both
community powered tools where people can

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:01.069
community powered tools where people can
 

00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:03.759
community powered tools where people can
flag up certain comments or you know

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:03.769
flag up certain comments or you know
 

00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:05.799
flag up certain comments or you know
certain profiles and we have internal

00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:05.809
certain profiles and we have internal
 

00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:11.259
certain profiles and we have internal
people looking at things for like adult

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:11.269
people looking at things for like adult
 

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:13.419
people looking at things for like adult
content was we thought was going to be a

00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:13.429
content was we thought was going to be a
 

00:13:13.429 --> 00:13:14.430
content was we thought was going to be a
big problem

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440
big problem
 

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.790
big problem
we had all these tools to filter those

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800
we had all these tools to filter those
 

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.590
we had all these tools to filter those
out but that didn't turn out to be as

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600
out but that didn't turn out to be as
 

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.889
out but that didn't turn out to be as
big as a bullying problem so definitely

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:22.899
big as a bullying problem so definitely
 

00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:25.800
big as a bullying problem so definitely
I mean people nowadays this is where

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:25.810
I mean people nowadays this is where
 

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.769
I mean people nowadays this is where
they spend most of their time right so

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:27.779
they spend most of their time right so
 

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:31.139
they spend most of their time right so
and then we see all these reports where

00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:31.149
and then we see all these reports where
 

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:32.759
and then we see all these reports where
when they get a bad comment from a

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:32.769
when they get a bad comment from a
 

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:35.550
when they get a bad comment from a
person that they don't know they feel

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560
person that they don't know they feel
 

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.860
person that they don't know they feel
down we get comments from their parents

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:37.870
down we get comments from their parents
 

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.139
down we get comments from their parents
that's now their kids are you know

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:40.149

crying or you know not feeling bad so
 

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:45.119
crying or you know not feeling bad so
there is all these and they're not still

00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:45.129
there is all these and they're not still
 

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:46.860
there is all these and they're not still
there yet there's a lot of things to

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:46.870
there yet there's a lot of things to
 

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.660
there yet there's a lot of things to
still to do but definitely I think as

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:48.670
still to do but definitely I think as
 

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.850
still to do but definitely I think as
app developers we have this

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:50.860
app developers we have this
 

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.509
app developers we have this
responsibility to protect our yeah have

00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519
responsibility to protect our yeah have
 

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:59.509
responsibility to protect our yeah have
a safe environment I absolutely think

00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519
a safe environment I absolutely think
 

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:02.790
a safe environment I absolutely think
that we as company's legal behind them

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800
that we as company's legal behind them
 

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.670
that we as company's legal behind them
have a responsibility to be you know

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680
have a responsibility to be you know
 

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.249
have a responsibility to be you know
custodians of our users time and

00:14:08.249 --> 00:14:08.259
custodians of our users time and
 

00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:12.019
custodians of our users time and
responsible for their quality of life

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:12.029
responsible for their quality of life
 

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:15.360
responsible for their quality of life
especially with the younger ones because

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:15.370
especially with the younger ones because
 

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.179
especially with the younger ones because
again they're just coming into digital

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:18.189
again they're just coming into digital
 

00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:20.699
again they're just coming into digital
technology in life and anything we do is

00:14:20.699 --> 00:14:20.709
technology in life and anything we do is
 

00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:23.309
technology in life and anything we do is
gonna play a much stronger role in

00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:23.319
gonna play a much stronger role in
 

00:14:23.319 --> 00:14:25.199
gonna play a much stronger role in
determining how they go through life and

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:25.209
determining how they go through life and
 

00:14:25.209 --> 00:14:27.240
determining how they go through life and
it would force a someone in their their

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:27.250
it would force a someone in their their
 

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:31.139
it would force a someone in their their
40s or thirties or 50s you know sort of

00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:31.149
40s or thirties or 50s you know sort of
 

00:14:31.149 --> 00:14:33.410
40s or thirties or 50s you know sort of
a great power great responsibility thing

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420
a great power great responsibility thing
 

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.379
a great power great responsibility thing
and within that though I think it isn't

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:37.389
and within that though I think it isn't
 

00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:39.780
and within that though I think it isn't
necessarily against yourself interest to

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:39.790
necessarily against yourself interest to
 

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.579
necessarily against yourself interest to
do so it's not just you know the right

00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:41.589
do so it's not just you know the right
 

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.590
do so it's not just you know the right
thing to do I think it's also in most

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600
thing to do I think it's also in most
 

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.569
thing to do I think it's also in most
cases the best thing to do for your

00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:45.579
cases the best thing to do for your
 

00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:48.079
cases the best thing to do for your
business you know if you pursue

00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:48.089
business you know if you pursue
 

00:14:48.089 --> 00:14:50.490
business you know if you pursue
pointless vanity metrics like the number

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:50.500
pointless vanity metrics like the number
 

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.110
pointless vanity metrics like the number
of minutes somebody spends in your app

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120
of minutes somebody spends in your app
 

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.210
of minutes somebody spends in your app
then yeah you'd optimize to just try to

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:54.220
then yeah you'd optimize to just try to
 

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.100
then yeah you'd optimize to just try to

always distract them always get them at
the most vulnerable point and try to get

00:14:57.449 --> 00:14:57.459
the most vulnerable point and try to get
 

00:14:57.459 --> 00:14:59.160
the most vulnerable point and try to get

00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.170
them in which might be great for that
 

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.439
them in which might be great for that
metric but it's not great for them and

maybe it's not great for more important

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.130
maybe it's not great for more important
 

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.069
maybe it's not great for more important
metrics like how much they convert to

00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079
metrics like how much they convert to

right it's definitely not Monday morning

00:15:21.299 --> 00:15:21.309
right it's definitely not Monday morning
 

00:15:21.309 --> 00:15:24.840
right it's definitely not Monday morning
and it's we build around that and I

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:24.850
and it's we build around that and I
 

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.030
and it's we build around that and I
think we found that even if you if you

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040
think we found that even if you if you
 

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.930

opposed to just the most engagement
 

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.720
opposed to just the most engagement
possible you'll have an experience that

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:33.730
possible you'll have an experience that
 

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.600
possible you'll have an experience that
is you know you know better for you and

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:36.610
is you know you know better for you and
 

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.580
is you know you know better for you and
your bottom line and also better for

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:38.590
your bottom line and also better for
 

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.210
your bottom line and also better for
them and the society that we all live in

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220
them and the society that we all live in
 

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.950
them and the society that we all live in
yeah well I also think we're responsible

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:43.960
yeah well I also think we're responsible
 

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.440
yeah well I also think we're responsible
of course especially as coming from a

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:46.450
of course especially as coming from a
 

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.100
of course especially as coming from a
health company and so we should not give

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:50.110
health company and so we should not give
 

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.440
health company and so we should not give
users like should not help them build

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:52.450
users like should not help them build
 

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.630
users like should not help them build
unhealthy habits yeah of course we take

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:54.640
unhealthy habits yeah of course we take
 

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.730
unhealthy habits yeah of course we take
the time offer users but it should be

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:56.740
the time offer users but it should be
 

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.760
the time offer users but it should be
reasonable and right now of course the

00:15:59.760 --> 00:15:59.770
reasonable and right now of course the
 

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.970
reasonable and right now of course the
incentive for us developers is to more

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:02.980
incentive for us developers is to more
 

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.190
incentive for us developers is to more
short term take the maximum amount of

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:05.200
short term take the maximum amount of
 

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.920
short term take the maximum amount of
time that we can and this can lead to

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:07.930
time that we can and this can lead to
 

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.060
time that we can and this can lead to
establishing unhealthy habits however if

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.070
establishing unhealthy habits however if
 

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.210
establishing unhealthy habits however if
really AI is going to reverse

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220
really AI is going to reverse
 

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.830
really AI is going to reverse
revolutionize health and if there will

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:16.840
revolutionize health and if there will
 

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.690
revolutionize health and if there will
be massive amounts of data and user

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:18.700
be massive amounts of data and user
 

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.900
be massive amounts of data and user
tracking then what if the future AI

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:21.910
tracking then what if the future AI
 

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.600
tracking then what if the future AI
assistant actually will be able to

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.610
assistant actually will be able to
 

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.770
assistant actually will be able to
reveal unhealthy habits to users so

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:27.780
reveal unhealthy habits to users so
 

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.900
reveal unhealthy habits to users so
helping them to see where they are

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:30.910
helping them to see where they are
 

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.540
helping them to see where they are
actually maybe spending too much time if

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:33.550
actually maybe spending too much time if
 

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.610
actually maybe spending too much time if
this works out then of course we

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:35.620
this works out then of course we
 

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.370
this works out then of course we
developers will have more incentive to

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:38.380
developers will have more incentive to
 

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.190
developers will have more incentive to
help them build like an establish a

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:41.200
help them build like an establish a
 

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.410
help them build like an establish a
healthy relationship with us and not an

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:43.420
healthy relationship with us and not an
 

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.230
healthy relationship with us and not an
unhealthy one yeah and I fully agree I

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240
unhealthy one yeah and I fully agree I
 

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.240
unhealthy one yeah and I fully agree I
think having that user centric approach

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:48.250
think having that user centric approach
 

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.460
think having that user centric approach
to design is not only good of course for

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:50.470
to design is not only good of course for
 

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.890
to design is not only good of course for
your users but even more so for your

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:52.900
your users but even more so for your
 

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.950
your users but even more so for your
bottom line as well and so what would be

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:55.960
bottom line as well and so what would be
 

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.840
bottom line as well and so what would be
your number one piece of advice to

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:57.850
your number one piece of advice to
 

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.400
your number one piece of advice to
developers on dealing with the

00:16:59.400 --> 00:16:59.410
developers on dealing with the
 

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:04.080
developers on dealing with the
generational gap I mean I cannot talk

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.090
generational gap I mean I cannot talk
 

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.940
generational gap I mean I cannot talk
with all the generations and

with all the generations and
demographics but I can only speak the

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:08.500
demographics but I can only speak the
 

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.410
demographics but I can only speak the
audience that I am very familiar with

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:10.420
audience that I am very familiar with
 

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.080
audience that I am very familiar with

which are these youngsters and they are
 

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:17.460
which are these youngsters and they are
you know digital natives they can use

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:17.470
you know digital natives they can use
 

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.860
you know digital natives they can use
your product in ways that you cannot

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:19.870
your product in ways that you cannot
 

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.990
your product in ways that you cannot
maybe imagined or you haven't imagined

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000
maybe imagined or you haven't imagined
 

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.780

before you've released it so try to keep
 

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.630
before you've released it so try to keep
it as flexible as possible and try to

get feedback very quickly they're very

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.190
get feedback very quickly they're very
 

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.950
get feedback very quickly they're very
eager to provide feedback and they feel

like engaged and they feel part of the

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.050
like engaged and they feel part of the
 

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.640

community so don't be scared to ask ask
 

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.840
community so don't be scared to ask ask
their feedback can be engaged with the

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:40.850
their feedback can be engaged with the
 

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.659
their feedback can be engaged with the
the app they as what we found was

00:17:43.659 --> 00:17:43.669
the app they as what we found was
 

00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:46.779
the app they as what we found was
they're more than willing to help help

00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:46.789
they're more than willing to help help
 

00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:48.159
they're more than willing to help help
the developer especially if they like

00:17:48.159 --> 00:17:48.169
the developer especially if they like
 

00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:51.460
the developer especially if they like
the app and if they like the product so

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:51.470
the app and if they like the product so
 

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:56.350

yeah great what about you Joe as

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360
yeah great what about you Joe as
 

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.560
yeah great what about you Joe as
succinctly as possible talk less and

00:17:59.560 --> 00:17:59.570
succinctly as possible talk less and
 

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:03.220
succinctly as possible talk less and
listen more being less distinct I would

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:03.230
listen more being less distinct I would
 

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.159
listen more being less distinct I would
say it is important to when you do talk

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:06.169
say it is important to when you do talk
 

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:09.610
say it is important to when you do talk
start with questions and make them

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:09.620
start with questions and make them
 

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.799
start with questions and make them
open-ended questions I think they're you

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:11.809
open-ended questions I think they're you
 

00:18:11.809 --> 00:18:14.259
open-ended questions I think they're you
know certain dynamics of you know age

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:14.269
know certain dynamics of you know age
 

00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:17.289
know certain dynamics of you know age
and and status and gender that if you

00:18:17.289 --> 00:18:17.299
and and status and gender that if you
 

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:18.580
and and status and gender that if you
start where the statement it can bias

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:18.590
start where the statement it can bias
 

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:19.899
start where the statement it can bias
what sorts of answers you're getting

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:19.909
what sorts of answers you're getting
 

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:22.269
what sorts of answers you're getting
from these people so I think it's very

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:22.279
from these people so I think it's very
 

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:25.149
from these people so I think it's very
important to when you are asking these

00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159
important to when you are asking these
 

00:18:25.159 --> 00:18:27.159
important to when you are asking these
questions make them questions make them

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:27.169
questions make them questions make them
 

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:29.919
questions make them questions make them
open-ended and you'll be you know

00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:29.929
open-ended and you'll be you know
 

00:18:29.929 --> 00:18:32.110
open-ended and you'll be you know
surprised where they go and glad you

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120
surprised where they go and glad you
 

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.759
surprised where they go and glad you
found out instead of developing it and

00:18:33.759 --> 00:18:33.769
found out instead of developing it and
 

00:18:33.769 --> 00:18:37.180
found out instead of developing it and
finding out the hard way yeah so what I

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:37.190
finding out the hard way yeah so what I
 

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.830
finding out the hard way yeah so what I
would suggest for the future is really

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840
would suggest for the future is really
 

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.090
would suggest for the future is really
to start start just understanding the

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:42.100
to start start just understanding the
 

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.289
to start start just understanding the
demographical change start understanding

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:44.299
demographical change start understanding
 

00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:45.850
demographical change start understanding
that these old people will come and

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:45.860
that these old people will come and
 

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.919
that these old people will come and
right now they're maybe at their desktop

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:47.929
right now they're maybe at their desktop
 

00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:50.710
right now they're maybe at their desktop
with the laptops using web applications

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720
with the laptops using web applications
 

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.330
with the laptops using web applications
but as as they grow more into mobile and

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:55.340
but as as they grow more into mobile and
 

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.039
but as as they grow more into mobile and
into whatever kind of technologies we

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:57.049
into whatever kind of technologies we
 

00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:59.019
into whatever kind of technologies we
will have it makes sense kind of to

00:18:59.019 --> 00:18:59.029
will have it makes sense kind of to
 

00:18:59.029 --> 00:19:02.230
will have it makes sense kind of to
learn how they think and how they what

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240
learn how they think and how they what
 

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.019
learn how they think and how they what
abilities they have and what kind of

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:05.029
abilities they have and what kind of
 

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:06.999
abilities they have and what kind of
interfaces for example natural language

00:19:06.999 --> 00:19:07.009
interfaces for example natural language
 

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:10.570
interfaces for example natural language
processing we can offer them to enable

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:10.580
processing we can offer them to enable
 

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.060
processing we can offer them to enable
also older people to use our products

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.070
also older people to use our products
 

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.879
also older people to use our products
great so that's it for my questions so

00:19:15.879 --> 00:19:15.889
great so that's it for my questions so
 

00:19:15.889 --> 00:19:17.830
great so that's it for my questions so
now I'd like to hand over to the

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840
now I'd like to hand over to the
 

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.930
now I'd like to hand over to the
audience to ask any questions as well

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:19.940
audience to ask any questions as well
 

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:27.779
audience to ask any questions as well
thank you

00:19:27.779 --> 00:19:27.789
 
 

00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:32.350
 
any questions guess we've solved

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360
any questions guess we've solved
 

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:42.129
any questions guess we've solved
everything yeah okay so judging from the

00:19:42.129 --> 00:19:42.139
everything yeah okay so judging from the
 

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.200
everything yeah okay so judging from the
fact that people who are 14 years old

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.210
fact that people who are 14 years old
 

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.899
fact that people who are 14 years old
are kinda still dunno who they gonna

00:19:46.899 --> 00:19:46.909
are kinda still dunno who they gonna
 

00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:48.759
are kinda still dunno who they gonna
become and three or in four years and

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:48.769
become and three or in four years and
 

00:19:48.769 --> 00:19:50.499
become and three or in four years and
the same happens with people when there

00:19:50.499 --> 00:19:50.509
the same happens with people when there
 

00:19:50.509 --> 00:19:52.360
the same happens with people when there
are 70 they don't know we're gonna be in

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:52.370
are 70 they don't know we're gonna be in
 

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.720
are 70 they don't know we're gonna be in
the five years how do you compute like

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:54.730
the five years how do you compute like
 

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.119
the five years how do you compute like
customer lifetime value in these

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:57.129
customer lifetime value in these
 

00:19:57.129 --> 00:20:03.700
customer lifetime value in these
circumstances so calculating customer

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:03.710
circumstances so calculating customer
 

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.340
circumstances so calculating customer
lifetime value for for like old people

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:06.350
lifetime value for for like old people
 

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.850
lifetime value for for like old people
this is both for young and for all I

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:09.860
this is both for young and for all I
 

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.680
this is both for young and for all I
guess it's just the general idea how do

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:11.690
guess it's just the general idea how do
 

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.629
guess it's just the general idea how do
you how do you deal with the uncertainty

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:13.639
you how do you deal with the uncertainty
 

00:20:13.639 --> 00:20:14.999
you how do you deal with the uncertainty
in in that age group

00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:15.009
in in that age group
 

00:20:15.009 --> 00:20:17.440
in in that age group
you mean the uncertainty that there will

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:17.450
you mean the uncertainty that there will
 

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:25.779
you mean the uncertainty that there will
be alive or like their retirement fund

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:25.789
be alive or like their retirement fund
 

00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:27.609
be alive or like their retirement fund
could go bust because of the bank and

00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:27.619
could go bust because of the bank and
 

00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:29.470
could go bust because of the bank and
people who are 14 years old they still

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480
people who are 14 years old they still
 

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.239
people who are 14 years old they still
don't have any money right now but they

00:20:31.239 --> 00:20:31.249
don't have any money right now but they
 

00:20:31.249 --> 00:20:33.820
don't have any money right now but they
will have it later well I can just tell

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:33.830
will have it later well I can just tell
 

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.799
will have it later well I can just tell
about the older people that these are

00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:35.809
about the older people that these are
 

00:20:35.809 --> 00:20:38.649
about the older people that these are
the most loyal ones actually because

00:20:38.649 --> 00:20:38.659
the most loyal ones actually because
 

00:20:38.659 --> 00:20:40.899
the most loyal ones actually because
once they are your customers they

00:20:40.899 --> 00:20:40.909
once they are your customers they
 

00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:44.109
once they are your customers they
actually they are not interested in

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:44.119
actually they are not interested in
 

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.690
actually they are not interested in
exploring all the different options that

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:46.700
exploring all the different options that
 

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.850
exploring all the different options that
they can do it's also a cognitive

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:48.860
they can do it's also a cognitive
 

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.330
they can do it's also a cognitive
overload of course so also we know that

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.340
overload of course so also we know that
 

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.129
overload of course so also we know that
old people are a lot more sticking to

00:20:57.129 --> 00:20:57.139
old people are a lot more sticking to
 

00:20:57.139 --> 00:20:58.570
old people are a lot more sticking to
their commitments to their own common

Trust is a lot more important to them so

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:01.490
Trust is a lot more important to them so
 

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.159
Trust is a lot more important to them so
once they find that you are a

00:21:03.159 --> 00:21:03.169
once they find that you are a
 

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:05.379
once they find that you are a
trustworthy partner you actually have

trustworthy partner you actually have
 

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.600
trustworthy partner you actually have
longer life term values with those then

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:07.610
longer life term values with those then
 

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.730
longer life term values with those then
the younger ones who just jump from one

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:09.740
the younger ones who just jump from one
 

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.039
the younger ones who just jump from one
app to the next that's what I can tell

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:12.049
app to the next that's what I can tell
 

00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:15.549
app to the next that's what I can tell
you about the older ones for the young

00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559
you about the older ones for the young
 

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:17.350
you about the older ones for the young
ones I think the customer lifetime value

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360
ones I think the customer lifetime value
 

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.889
ones I think the customer lifetime value
is a difficult thing to compute anyway

00:21:20.889 --> 00:21:20.899
is a difficult thing to compute anyway
 

00:21:20.899 --> 00:21:23.440
is a difficult thing to compute anyway
so I mean we basically use the same

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.450
so I mean we basically use the same
 

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.450
so I mean we basically use the same
techniques that everyone use so we don't

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:25.460
techniques that everyone use so we don't
 

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.139
techniques that everyone use so we don't
do anything specific for younger ones

00:21:28.139 --> 00:21:28.149
do anything specific for younger ones
 

00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:30.820
do anything specific for younger ones
but what Rajan mentioned about the

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:30.830
but what Rajan mentioned about the
 

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.690
but what Rajan mentioned about the
younger ones is quite true that they can

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:34.700
younger ones is quite true that they can
 

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.279
younger ones is quite true that they can
switch from different apps if they get

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:36.289
switch from different apps if they get
 

00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:39.100
switch from different apps if they get
bored so what we do is try to keep it

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:39.110
bored so what we do is try to keep it
 

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.270
bored so what we do is try to keep it
fresh

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.280
fresh
 

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.520
fresh
we try to make weekly releases try to

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:42.530
we try to make weekly releases try to
 

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.190
we try to make weekly releases try to
bring new content all the time so so

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200
bring new content all the time so so
 

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.900
bring new content all the time so so
that the younger ones they're always

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:46.910
that the younger ones they're always
 

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.810
that the younger ones they're always
thinking that the app is always fresh so

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:49.820
thinking that the app is always fresh so
 

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:59.020
thinking that the app is always fresh so
they don't switch that quickly

00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.030
 
 

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.090
