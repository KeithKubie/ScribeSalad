00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.750
Determine the domain and range
for the relation described

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.380
by the table.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.220
And so what they
want us to say, what

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.520
they want us to figure out,
when they say the domain,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.020
they're saying, what are all
of the possible inputs that we

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.050
could put into-- in
this case, a relation,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.342
and later we'll see into
functions-- and so over here--

00:00:19.342 --> 00:00:20.924
or I guess one way
to think about it--

00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:23.500
what are all of the inputs
that this relationship is

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.960
defined for?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.640
And so you can view
the x as the input.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.300
So when x is negative 1, y is 3.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.780
When x is 3, y is negative 2.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.210
When x is 3 again, now y is 2.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.610
And that's why we can't
describe this as a function

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.460
here, because we have two
different y values for a given

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.670
x value, but it
can be a relation.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.680
When x is 4, y is 8.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.170
When x is 6, y is negative 1.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.630
So to answer the
first part, when

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.660
they ask us what is the domain
of this relation, they're

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.590
really just saying,
what are all the inputs?

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.500
What are all the x values for
which this relation is defined?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.640
And they list the x
values right over here.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.310
So it is the set-- and that's
what these curly brackets mean

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.570
that I'm about to
describe a set-- it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.690
is a set of the numbers,
negative 1, 3, 4, and 6.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.260
So all we're saying
here is if we

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.340
say the domain of this
relation is these four numbers,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.180
it says that this
relation is defined

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.760
for any of these four numbers.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.290
If you give any of these
four numbers as an x value,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.340
there is a y, at least one
y value, associated with it.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.030
Now, when they talk about
the range of this relation--

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.380
and the idea also
applies to functions,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.900
which are a more specific
class of relations.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.670
You can view them as a
well-behaved relation.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.940
The range is, what are
all the possible outputs

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.910
that this relation can give you?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.810
Or given the inputs, what are
all of the possible values

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.500
that this relation can take on?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.360
So here you'll take a look at
all of the possible y values

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.790
that it can take on.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.365
So we can get-- and I'll write--
we could write them in order

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:05.630
or we don't have to
write them in order,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.270
but I'll write them in order
just for the sake of it.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.580
Actually, let's just
go straight this way.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.871
It doesn't have to be in order.

00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:11.760
A set does not imply
some type of order.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.320
It just means a
collection of things.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.730
So the range here, well, our y
value can take on the value 3.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.760
It can take on the
value negative 2.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.400
It can take on the value 2.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.260
It can take on the value 8.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.400
And it can take on
the value negative 1.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.780
And we're done.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.210
These are the x values for
which this relation is defined

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.330
that you can actually find an
association or relationship.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.160
And these are all the y values.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.460
These are all of the outputs of
the relation that it can take

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.100
on, and we just looked right
over here to find them.
