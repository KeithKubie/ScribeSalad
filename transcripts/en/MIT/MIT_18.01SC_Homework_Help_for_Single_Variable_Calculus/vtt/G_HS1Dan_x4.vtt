CHRISTINE BREINER:
Welcome to recitation.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.840
Today what I'd like us to do is
look at the inequality tangent

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.570
x bigger than x for the x-values
between 0 and pi over 2.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.160
We want to show that
that is definitely true

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.747
using the mean value theorem.

00:00:21.747 --> 00:00:24.080
And I want to point out that
this was actually something

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.560
that Joel used when he
was a graphing tangent x

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.580
and arctangent x on
the same xy-plane.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.220
He used this fact in order to
get the right-looking graph.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.740
So what I'd like
you to do, again,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.130
is I want you to show that for
any x between 0 and pi over 2,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.880
tangent x is bigger than x.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.620
And use the mean value
theorem to do it.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.980
I'll give you a little time to
think about it, to work on it,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.938
and then I'll be back
and we'll do it together.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.580
OK.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.790
Welcome back.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.400
So I'm going to take us
through how to do this problem.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.760
And what I want to do
is I want to point out

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.810
a few things initially.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.310
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.600
to remind us of the form
of the mean value theorem

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.590
that we need.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.490
And the form that
we need will be

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.610
f of x is equal to f of a plus
f prime of c times x minus a.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:29.420
And here, remember, c has
to be between a and x.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.700
So in this case, what we want
to consider is the region from 0

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.360
up to some x-value.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.680
So always, this is, if you
think about it, the a and the x,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.810
well, a will be 0 and x will be
the right-hand region, always

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.280
less than pi over 2.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.980
So what we need to
check is, I'm going

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.730
to consider f of
x equal tangent x.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.070
And what I need to
consider is, does tangent x

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.780
satisfy the hypotheses
of the mean value theorem

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.230
on the region of interest?

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.430
And so our region of interest
will always be a equals 0

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.390
and b is equal to x, which
is less than some pi over 2.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.990
And it is true, tangent
x is continuous between 0

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.860
and any value less
than pi over 2.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.990
And it's also
differentiable between 0

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.910
and any value less
than pi over 2.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.670
So I can apply the mean
value theorem to tangent x.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.680
So in order to do this
now, what I'd like to see

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.430
is what kind of things I
need for the right-hand side

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.520
of this equation.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.530
So I obviously need to
know what the output is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.795
at a, which is equal to 0.

00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:38.990
So let's recall f of 0.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.500
Well, tangent 0 is 0-- it's sine
of 0 divided by cosine of 0.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.830
And then I need to evaluate the
derivative somewhere between a,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.120
which is 0, and pi over 2.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.760
x can be any value
less than pi over 2.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.940
So let's evaluate what the
derivative is in terms of x.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.880
We did this, actually,
in another recitation.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.890
The derivative of tangent
x is secant squared x.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.020
And so now let's
plug in what we know

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.494
and then see what else
we need to do in order

00:03:10.494 --> 00:03:11.785
to finish solving this problem.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.890
OK.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.710
So what we have.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.820
f of x, I'm actually
going to write tangent x,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.380
so we can see what's
happening here.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.910
f of x is tangent x, and
then I have that that equals,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.650
well, f of a is 0, plus
f prime evaluated at c--

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:42.090
so that's going to be secant
squared c-- times x minus a.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.520
Well, a here is 0, so
this is just times x.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.322
So we're very close.

00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:49.780
We're very close
to showing tangent

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.230
x is always bigger than x.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.640
In fact, you can see very
easily what ultimately we

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.440
need to show.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.590
We just need to show that secant
squared c is bigger than 1

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.720
in our region of interest.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.345
And that would do
it, because then this

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.810
would be bigger than 1 times x.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.670
The right-hand side

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.170
would be bigger than 1 times
x, so that would be sufficient.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.940
So let's make sure
we understand what

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.180
secant squared c can look like.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.530
Or what the values can be.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.685
So we have c is between 0 and
x, which is less than pi over 2.

00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:22.430
Right?

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.350
That's where c is.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.090
So we always need
to remember what

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.910
values c could possibly have.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.150
And then let's think about
what we know about secant of c,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.650
there.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:39.400
Well, secant of c is equal
to 1 over cosine of c.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.910
So if you can't remember
what secant's values are,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.680
think about the values
of cosine in that region.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.490
So I'm going to draw a rough
sketch of the value of cosine

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.050
between 0 and pi over 2.

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:56.250
The value of cosine does
something like this.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.040
This is 0, this is pi over 2.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.070
This is a very rough sketch.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.310
But this output is 1.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.650
So between 0 and pi
over 2, cosine of c

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.880
is always less than 1.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.515
So 1 over cosine of c
is always bigger than 1.

00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:14.270
OK?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.120
Because we're taking
that reciprocal value.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.010
So again, cosine of c from 0
to pi over 2, not including 0,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.920
is always strictly less than 1.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.440
And so 1 over cosine c is
always strictly greater than 1.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.510
And so now I have
the information

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.987
I need to come back
and finish the problem.

00:05:30.987 --> 00:05:32.820
So again, we were looking
at the expression,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.930
we have tangent x is equal
to secant squared c times x.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.690
Well, now I know secant
c is bigger than 1,

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.150
so now I know this whole
thing is bigger than 1 times

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.220
x, which is just equal to x.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.080
So if you noticed,
on the left-hand side

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.850
we have a tangent
x equals something

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.860
which is bigger than x.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.510
So we've just shown that,
for any value of x between 0

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.290
and pi over 2, tangent
x is bigger than x.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.932
And I think we'll stop there.
