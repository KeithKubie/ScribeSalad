00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.105
Hi, I'm Mano Marks.

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:12.510
I'm developer advocate on the
Google Maps Developer

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.820
Relations team.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.070
I want to welcome you to this
week's Google Maps shortcut.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.640
In this episode, we'll be
talking about the Google Maps

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.080
SDK for iOS and, specifically,
I'll be talking

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.630
about indoor maps.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.380
Google Maps SDK for iOS allows
you to both add indoor maps to

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.830
your Maps application and
control what level is shown

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.300
within the building when you
are viewing the different

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.830
buildings in the SDK.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.580
This is a pretty exciting
feature and it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.020
could be pretty powerful.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.590
For instance, if you wanted to
have a application that showed

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.040
special offers in a department
store, then you could choose

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.060
which level to show somebody and
put a marker directly in

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.310
that location.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.710
I'm going to get into the app
in a moment, but I wanted to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.970
mention that at Google I/O in
2013 we did do a tech talk on

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.100
indoor maps and, specifically,
how we collect that data and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.890
how we locate people
within Google Maps.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.130
So you might be interested in
checking that one out, and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.580
here's a link to that video.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.940
OK.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.915
Let's take a look at indoor
maps in the SDK.

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.410
You can see here we've
got a list of demos.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.230
I'm going to select Indoor and
you'll see the indoor map.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.680
This is actually Moscone Center,
and you'll see this is

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.640
level one here.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.720
And as I move through it, and
the different levels in the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.160
level selector it changes
the floor.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.150
That's on by default.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.570
No additional code is required,
just as soon as it

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.160
gets close to a building it
decides that that is the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.900
building that's in focus,
then it will

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.250
turn on a level selector.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.560
OK.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.150
Let's take a look at
the Indoor with

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.130
Custom Level selector.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.300
So you can see here there's no
default selector, but there is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.570
this Custom selector here in the
application, in the demo.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:36.410
So as I, again, select different
points within the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.000
selector, it changes
the floors.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.640
And interestingly, as I move
to a different location,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.910
you'll see it's chosen
a different--

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.410
it now decided that a different

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.320
building is in focus--

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.870
it changes this level selector
here to reflect that.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.100
Let's take a look at the
code for how this

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.470
actually comes about.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.780
OK.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.140
You can see here I'm creating
my view controller.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.860
I've got the Customer Indoor
View Controller.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.340
And I'm creating
three objects.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.480
I'm creating the map view--
which you would do anytime

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.890
you're using the map.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.870
I'm using a UI Picker View.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.920
It's a standard one, it's
not the Google Maps one.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.490
A UI Picker View is a convenient
way to demo this.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.860
You can, of course, create
your own view if

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.140
that's what you want.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.760
And then I have an array,
levels, which is just the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.240
different floors of
the building.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.690
OK.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.640
So now on viewDidLoad I'm
creating my map normally and

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.840
setting it within the view.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.930
And you can see there
the camera position.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.930
Same camera position.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.190
And there's three lines
here that are

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.810
particularly important.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.130
The first one is I'm turning
the Indoor Picker off.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.610
That's because I don't want
to use the default one.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.620
I want to use the custom one
that I'm going to show you.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.030
And I am turning on Indoor.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.910
IndoorEnabled = YES.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.710
This is actually on by default,
but this is just to

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.540
show you that you can do
this programmatically--

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.420
turning on Indoor, turning
off Indoor.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.750
And then, importantly, I'm
setting the Indoor Display

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.370
delegate to Self.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.760
That's basically so that any
indoor events gets handled by

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.010
this view controller.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.930
OK.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.590
So here's what happens when the
active building changes,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.010
which happens as soon as the
view is instantiated, and then

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.450
also when you're
moving around.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.990
This is the
didChangeActiveBuilding event.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.590
This is what happens, this is
why we did the delegate.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.490
OK.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.420
So we create a levels mutable
array, and then we add objects

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.850
to that array from
building.levels, which is the

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.120
building comes along
with the event.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.130
When it gets fired, you
get building back.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.460
It's an object within the SDK.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.840
And that has levels as its
primary purpose there.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.400
And then we then take the levels
array that we created

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.720
at the beginning when we
instantiated the view

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.970
controller.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.320
We copy the levels
array into that.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.270
And then we have the picker
reload all its components.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.020
We basically are saying, there's
something new here,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.480
reload the picker.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.350
So that's particularly
the code that

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.600
you need right there.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.490
And then this here just shows
you how the picker actually

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.870
selects the level, the
text for the level.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.250
It's basically going through the
levels object row by row

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.850
and saying what's
the level name.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.660
Now you may have noticed that in
the default Indoor demo the

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.550
name of the levels was a short
name, whereas there is a

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:40.500
longer name in the custom
level picker demo.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.570
That's because each level has
a long and short name and

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.520
we're using-- by doing
.name, we're doing

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.210
the long name there.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.900
OK.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:56.200
So then the next thing that we
look at is how it sets the

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.870
active level.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.370
So when this is just an event
that fires when you select a

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.260
row in the picker, it
changes the level.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.150
So you're just doing
Set Active Level

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.400
on the Indoor display.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.360
And then finally, we have code
that, if you change the level

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.970
through some other means, it
will keep the picker in sync

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.140
with the current level.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.680
So that's not 100% necessary for
this particular demo, but

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.480
it's a useful thing to always
do just in case

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.280
something else happens.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.590
OK.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:40.040
So if you have any more
questions about the Google

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.130
Maps SDK for iOS, take a look
at the documentation.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:51.580
We also have a playlist of
videos from the Google Maps

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.700
SDK for iOS.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.420
This is from our Google Maps
shortcuts and other episodes

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.870
that we've been doing here on
"Google Maps Developers Live."

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.710
And of course, if you have any
additional questions, you need

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.510
any help, as always, go on
over to Stack Overflow.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.860
There's lots of people
there who can help

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.250
you with your questions.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:10.910
Thank you very much.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.160
That's all for now.
