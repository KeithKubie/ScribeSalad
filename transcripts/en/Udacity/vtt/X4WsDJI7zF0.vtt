00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.256
On the 23andMe website, there's a full service called DNA

00:00:03.256 --> 00:00:07.560
relative finder. That actually generates an IBD, or Identity by

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.400
Descent Score for you. And compares it to that of

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.170
other individuals in the database.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.530
Attempting to actually make family connections.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.480
Most people you find on a site like this will

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.820
be cousins. Many distant cousins, in fact. But you just

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.810
might find a closer relative that you didn't even know

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.710
you had. There's an added procaution on the 23andme site that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.880
asks, are you sure you want to opt in to see these close relatives?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.860
Can you think of a reason that you might not want to participate in finding

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.870
close relatives? Go ahead and think of a response and put it in the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.220
text box here. And consider checking out

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.240
the forums to see what your classmates think.
