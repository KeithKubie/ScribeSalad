00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.590
We can see how much all of this is impacting
positively on Africa. The confidence of the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.380
African people to think that now they will
be hosting the world already creating a positive

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.009
impact, and throughout the world whereby people
who have been pessimistic about Africa can

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.410
see that in Africa we indeed we've got the
capacity to organize, and run operations as

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.190
complicated as the World Cup. So this is a
great opportunity for Africa and African's

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.690
have embraced this opportunity with both of
their hands. Thank you.
