00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.770
A mutation in the non-coding region is the most

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.380
likely explanation for lactase persistence over time. Now, a mutation

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.810
in the coding region would likely alter the functionality of

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.880
the latcatse protein. And we know this probably isn't true,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.040
because this would happen in both the baby and

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.390
the adult. And here we know that the baby could

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.320
metabolize lactose, whereas the adult could not. A mutation in

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.950
the non-coding region would allow us to decrease the transcription

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.350
of the lactation gene without affecting

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.060
the overall functionality of the lactase protein.
