ROSHNI SUCHDE: Yes.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.750

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.490
We're doing seven cities
starting from New Jersey

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.625
this Saturday onwards.

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:34.370
So this coming Saturday,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.360
We're doing in New
Jersey, and then we'll

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.730
be heading out to Orlando
the following weekend.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.090
That would be Friday.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.590
Then after, we're
heading back to San Jose.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.160
Then we're doing L.A. and we're
going to Houston, Chicago,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.000

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.280
So yes, seven cities.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.150
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Wow.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.090
That's crazy.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.490
ARIJIT SINGH: But
I didn't know that.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.246
KUNAL AGGARWAL: I've been to
Arijit's concert before and one

00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:58.870
of the greatest
experiences of my life.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.560
I really highly recommend it.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.450
It's really, really good.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.420
ROSHNI SUCHDE: Thank you.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.970
KUNAL AGGARWAL: We also have

So you get 15% off.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.020
So, yeah.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.100
Definitely check it out.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.860
We have a GoLink to it, so
definitely check it out.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.490
I will send out a reminder too.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.557
ROSHNI SUCHDE: Thank you.

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:21.015
KUNAL AGGARWAL: So let me ask
the first question to Roshni.

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:21.770
ARIJIT SINGH: OK, yes.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.270
Please.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.870
KUNAL AGGARWAL: So
Roshni, how excited

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.630
were you where you first got
a chance to meet Arijit Singh

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.940
and to work with
him and to promote

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.920
this concert and his songs
and music here in the States,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.345
and especially with a lot of
Indian community here too.

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:39.970
ROSHNI SUCHDE: Like,
honestly speaking,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.719
it's like a dream come
true kind of thing,

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.180
because you hear him, right?

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.340
You see the fan
following that he has.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.702
His songs basically touch
your soul immediately.

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:50.285
So when you get to
meet him personally

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:52.810
and when you hear him, it's
a whole different experience.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.800
And that too, when you see
that you are working with them,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.425
it's a completely
different experience.

00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:58.056
Yes.

00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:59.180
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Definitely.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.410
Yeah, Arijit is one of the
greatest singers in Bollywood.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.760
So Arijit, how did
you get into music?

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.430
How did you know from
childhood that you wanted

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.530
to pursue this professionally?

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.167
ARIJIT SINGH: Well, this is
all in the Wikipedia, though.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.780
Well, my mom used to sing.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.060
And we had music in the family.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.810
So that's how I started.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.530
I don't even remember
when I started singing.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.970
I started in classical music.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.410
I practiced since childhood
and I've been practicing.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.890
But Bollywood is
a different thing.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.790
I started in 2005.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.010
I tried my luck in Bombay,
which is like, typically

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.710
Bollywood in India.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.590
And it clicked.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.129
And that's how I
went and moved on.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.170
KUNAL AGGARWAL: OK, cool.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.050
I know you actually competed
in several reality shows.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.440
One was "Fame Gurukul" and one
was "10 Ke 10 Ke Le Gaye Dil".

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.710
ARIJIT SINGH: Yeah, that's the
only reality shows I've done.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.690
In 2005, I came to
Mumbai and I did that.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.850
And then, I started
meeting people in Mumbai

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.580
and tried singing
a lot of scratches.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.710
I tried singing different tunes.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.000
And that's how it is.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.464
KUNAL AGGARWAL: And how did that
reality show affect your music?

00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:28.505
ARIJIT SINGH: It affects.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:29.004
It affects.

00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:33.460
What happens is because
you're from a place where

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.970
there's no industry,
and you come to Mumbai

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.380
and that's basically the
central of the music industry.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.520
And then that show
helps you to get

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.980
acquainted with the
musicians, the music

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.190
directors, and the
important people,

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.420
the VIPs in the industry.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.700
So that's how you move on.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.690
And you can think of the new
things, then you can plan.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.250
So of course, any reality
show or any performance based

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.190
show that you're in, that
effects totally in your career.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.490
So that's how we did it.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.567
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Definitely.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:11.150
I watched the European
"Gurukul" show.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.130
It's actually
really, really good.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.260
So any-- so let's
start with this.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.460
Who are your
biggest inspiration?

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.320
ARIJIT SINGH: In what?

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.540
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Singing,
getting into classical music.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.600
Anything.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.070
ARIJIT SINGH: OK.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.990
I've done classical music a lot.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.500
My inspiration was always my
teacher who used to teach me.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.575
And Salam and Ali Khan
who started [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:54.560
concept, all these minstrels
of classical music and my mom.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.760
I had several teachers
in Mumbai as well.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.470
So these are my inspirations.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.970
KUNAL AGGARWAL: OK.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.570
Cool.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.239
Cool.

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:04.780
Let's say if you
had a chance to work

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.765
with any legendary singer,
Kishore Kumar or any of those,

00:05:08.765 --> 00:05:09.640
who would you choose?

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.562
ARIJIT SINGH: Do you
have a time machine?

00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:17.020
KUNAL AGGARWAL: We
might build one.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.070
ARIJIT SINGH: Well,
Kishore Kumar is a legend.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.620
He's been my favorite.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.045
So of course, who wouldn't?

00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:31.920
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Nice.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.580
Nice.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.610
OK.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.320
Let's not talk about your songs.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.773
First, let's talk about--

00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:39.710
ARIJIT SINGH: Thank you.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.960
KUNAL AGGARWAL: --other songs.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.552
Who is your favorite
singer right now?

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:44.760
ARIJIT SINGH: There are many.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.490
There are many.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.170
I love-- in this lot?

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.415
Like, my generation?

00:05:50.415 --> 00:05:51.290
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Yeah.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.910
ARIJIT SINGH: I
like all of them.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.850
I like Papon.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.820
I like Beni.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.090
I like Shalmali.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.150
A lot of singers that
they're doing an amazing job.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.430
And indeed if you see
in the '70s to 2000,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.720
I have a list of
musicians that I like,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.080
which are mostly
music composers.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.610
R.D. Burman, S.D. Burman,
and then Nadeem-Shravan,

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.765
A.R. Rahman.

00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:23.646
All these guys,
they are fantastic.

00:06:23.646 --> 00:06:25.270
Spectacular music
they have been doing.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.061
KUNAL AGGARWAL: OK.

00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:27.280
Yeah, that's great.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.120
How about any
international singers

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.804
do you want to get in
touch with or perform with?

00:06:31.804 --> 00:06:33.720
ARIJIT SINGH: Well, I
don't know about getting

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.520
in touch with them.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.680
But I have like,
John Mayer, I like.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.780
I like Jason Miraz.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.480
I like M.J, Michael Jackson.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.750
That's been there forever.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.550
And then, I like Elton John.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.775
I like so many artists.

00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:56.450
I can't really remember now.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.000
It's lined up.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.900
KUNAL AGGARWAL: OK.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.400
Nice.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.900
Nice.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.880
So you've done a lot
about Bollywood music.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.040
I know you do a lot
of Bengali music.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.370
That's where you're from.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.820
So how different is it
singing for Bollywood

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.730
and then the place where you
live and other regional cities.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.790
ARIJIT SINGH: Well, I started
singing in Bollywood first,

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.060
because I didn't try in Bengal.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.300
I started singing Bengali songs,
original songs after I got

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.640
a chance to sing in Bollywood.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.480
It's not different.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.840
It's just a language.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.120
Music is-- it remains the same.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.470
The technicalities
are the thing that you

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.000
need to concentrate on, because
the industry has other aspects

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.470
as well in terms of if you see
production value of the music,

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.620
if you want to understand
the music production of it,

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.460
these things vary.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.130
But the basic tune and the
lyrics, all that process

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.930
of making music are the same.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.890
It doesn't make a difference.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.150
KUNAL AGGARWAL: So
Roshni, so you have

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.050
such a versatile singer, right?

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.180
You have so many
languages you can sing in,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.030
How do you prepare for a
concert with such magnitude,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.271
really, with such talent?

00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:15.520
How do you know you're giving
the best of Arijit Singh

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.902
to the audience?

00:08:16.902 --> 00:08:18.360
ROSHNI SUCHDE: See
firstly, I think

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.830
the way his songs are popular,
I get calls from people telling

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.290
me, asking me, will he
be singing original songs

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.860
other than Hindi?

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.010
I said, if I do that,
we are limited people

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.650
of regional listeners, right?

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.900
So I have to make sure that
one thing that he's sings,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.530
like Hindi, which
everybody is going to love,

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.090
eventually the people
who even speaks

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.539
Bengali understands Hindi more.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.630
So they'll be like, Yeah.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.340
Let's do that.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.100
Let's keep Hindi.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.064
So I think he does
justice to them.

00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:44.730
He makes sure, I think, he sings
at least one line or something,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.741
at least tailor to do.

00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:47.990
Just to as, that, OK, I'll
make sure and I'll sing it.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.950
So I think it's
all on the artist

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.830
that if you have
somebody like him,

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.720
you can easily pull
it off pretty well.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.200
KUNAL AGGARWAL: That's great.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.210
So Bollywood-- going
back to Bollywood--

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.800
they make about 150 movies--

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.414
ARIJIT SINGH: Films a year.

00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:07.080
KUNAL AGGARWAL: I
mean, it's outstanding

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.270
how many movies they make.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.720
ARIJIT SINGH: They
shouldn't, though.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.320
They should make good movies.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.770
KUNAL AGGARWAL: They
should make good movies.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.540
So you probably
have a lot of calls

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.770
to rehearse a lot of songs.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.490
And you might be put
in a situation where

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.440
you have to rehearse
a song very quickly

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.620
or rehearse multiple songs.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.350
ARIJIT SINGH: It's
always like that.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.960
The scene is like, I need
it yesterday every time.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.260
So you have pressure.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.110
And my manager
keeps troubling me.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:46.610
And he keeps because there
are too many songs happening.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.840
And it's really,
really difficult

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.530
to sing every other song for me.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.450
So I need to keep a balance
also, so I plan it that way.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.190
I skip a lot of songs.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.380
Which ones I like, I sing.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:03.290
Which ones I don't like,
I try to ignore politely.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.880
So that's how I've
been managing.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.345
I don't know in the future
how I'm going t o manage,

00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:08.387
but that's the way it is.

00:10:08.387 --> 00:10:09.303
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Right.

00:10:09.303 --> 00:10:09.840
Right.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.530
No, that's good.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.950
I mean, I've heard your songs,
and it's beautifully composed.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.080
ARIJIT SINGH: Yeah.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.160
I try to do good work to
my satifaction for what

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:21.660
I can bear.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.451
KUNAL AGGARWAL: No.

00:10:22.451 --> 00:10:24.260
But like your
songs, "Tum Hi Ho".

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.520
I mean, what a wide--

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.370
ARIJIT SINGH: That's
a brilliant song.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.578
KUNAL AGGARWAL: --wide range.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.390
Of course.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.740
So it's amazing how you
handle the pressure.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.420
So Is there any
song you would try

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.750
to do or try to sing differently
if you had a second chance?

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.790
ARIJIT SINGH: Every song.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.420
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Why is that?

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.620
ARIJIT SINGH: See it's
the, it's the mood of it.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.930
It's not like a
mathematical calculation

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.310
that this song has
to sung this way.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.230
It's basically your
interpretation every time.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.750
You know, what you feel
and how are you today?

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.500
That how you sing it.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.550
It's an expression.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.220
So if you're were to
sing one song again,

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.059
it's going to be--
you can't make it

00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:12.850
the same way, because
it's not a recording.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.080
It's Inside you.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.310
You sing one song every time,
it's going to be different.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.297
That's music.

00:11:20.297 --> 00:11:22.130
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Actually,
I wanted to segue.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.950
If you guys have audience
questions, we have two mics.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.857
Two microphones, so
feel free to come up.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.815
ARIJIT SINGH: Basically,
he's out of questions.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.850
KUNAL AGGARWAL: So we at
Google, a lot of our employees

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.730
are in the tech-- this
is a tech company,

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.300
right-- and Google touches a
lot of different industries

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.020
in the world, especially
music and singing.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:52.340
So how do you see technology and
Google products, like YouTube,

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:57.460
affect the music industry,
how you sing songs,

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.860
how has Indian music evolved?

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.650
ARIJIT SINGH: Well,
music has evolved a lot.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:11.890
But I was checking this
to 365 video of Google,

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.760
and I was thinking why
aren't they making something

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.400
with the sound.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.850
They're making so many
things with the video,

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.460
because of course,
sound has improved

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.370
a lot in all these years.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.190
And because of the
technology, the music

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.690
has evolved a lot
in terms of sound,

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.240
in terms of melody, everything.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.190
And the quality of it.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:39.630
So of course, technology
is an important thing

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.610
in every aspect.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.390
But Google should do
something sound-wise, I think.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.310
It will help a lot of
people to bring out

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:53.273
more of this
criteria, more-- what

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:58.690
do you call it-- more regions,
more opportunities in music,

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.260
because music has no limits.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.270
And technology
also has no limits.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.630
If it bonds together, it
can do miraculous things.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.840
KUNAL AGGARWAL: So one of the
things today in modern society

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.900
are singers use a
lot of Auto-tuners.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:20.540
ARIJIT SINGH: See, Auto-tuners,
Auto-tune is just one way.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.840
You have so many ways which can
completely modulate your voice

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.110
and transform any of the songs.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.490
What Auto-tune does is
it just perfects a pitch.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:34.900
That's the only thing it can do.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.230
But it's not-- I don't
know why it's so hyped.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.170
That's not much.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.910
Actually, what we do
when a singer is singing

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.850
and he's singing very nice,
but there are glitches

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.180
and a little bit of
imperfection in the pitch,

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.470
we put Auto-tune on it.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.380
That's great.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.094
If you put Auto-tune
it handles a lot

00:13:58.094 --> 00:13:59.260
of imperfection in the song.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.870
It makes more automated.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:07.440
That's nice, and of course,
any invention, either you

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.010
can make it perfect
or you can destroy it.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.150
You do whatever you can.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.660
Auto tune also has that aspect
that people are-- really

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.780
a lot of good singers
are really, really

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.300
angry at Auto-tune because
a lot of bad singers

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.310
are singing a lot of songs.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.350
But I think that depends
on how you're using it.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.160
Yeah, but it's not--
like, Salman Khan sang

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.810
and Akshay Humar sang.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.960
It was good though.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.148
I love it.

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:44.522
Sounds good.

00:14:44.522 --> 00:14:46.760
KUNAL AGGARWAL: You have
an audience question.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.087
AUDIENCE: What do you think
about Honey Singh's music?

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:50.170
ARIJIT SINGH: Honey Singh?

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.220
I love him.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.690
AUDIENCE: What are some of
your favorite songs by him?

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.870
ARIJIT SINGH: Well, I
like-- all the songs there--

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.670
I like, what song is that?

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.880
That single that came out that's
a long nine minute single.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.660
Which song was that?

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.580
He shot it in the US?

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.542
What song is that?
"Thousand Miles."

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:11.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, "Thousand
Miles" is one of the songs.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.190
It's their album.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.332
"Desi Kalakaar".

00:15:14.332 --> 00:15:15.790
ARIJIT SINGH: "Desi
Kalakaar", yes.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.520
Exactly.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.580
"Desi Kalakaar".

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.990
I love that song.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.620
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.870
ARIJIT SINGH: Yeah, thank you.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.030
Cool.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.970
Honey's brilliant.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.402
He's one of a kind.

00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:31.390
No.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:31.890
It's not.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.040
It's not.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.610
I know Honey from before.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.060
He's a music producer, and
he used to come to Pritam,

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.070
checking in with the studio.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.530
He's been singing now, and
I know him from before.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:44.870
So I know him very well.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:48.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.525
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:49.525 --> 00:15:51.900
So firstly, I've been following
you since "Fame Gurukul",

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.983
and still remember you
sang "Aashiq Banaya Aapne,"

00:15:53.983 --> 00:15:55.700
and it was brilliant.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.210
And I felt then that you
would have to be in Bollywood,

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.429
but we waited a little while.

00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:03.220
But I was glad to see
that you made it big.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.511
ARIJIT SINGH: What a wait, huh?

00:16:04.511 --> 00:16:06.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for sure.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.750
Secondly, I went to
your concert last year.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.930
Brilliant, so anyone who's
thinking about it, go.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.051
It's just amazing.

00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:13.800
The one thing I did
feel last year was you

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.180
sang other people's songs, too.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.740
Your songs are way better,
so sing your songs.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.215
I just had a baby
two months ago,

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.590
so I will not be
there this time.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.280
ARIJIT SINGH: Congratulations.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.710
AUDIENCE: But I will be there
next year if you come again.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:27.720
ARIJIT SINGH: Yes, of course.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.400
AUDIENCE: So I want to ask
you, what is your hardest

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.190
song that you sang,
because I know

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.300
you have such a range
of [INAUDIBLE], which

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.657
is super classical.

00:16:34.657 --> 00:16:35.990
And now, you have done "Kabira".

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.100
You just have this
amazing range.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.200
I think after Sonu Nigum
you are the first guy who

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.860
has such a range.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.160
So what is the hardest song,
number one and secondly,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.715
what's your favorite song?

00:16:45.715 --> 00:16:48.090
And I have to go back because
my 3-year-old wants to sit.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:48.965
ARIJIT SINGH: Please.

00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:50.940
Please.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.920
Hardest song.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.400
OK.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.570
Maybe the simplest song is
the hardest song to sing,

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.280
because you need to
express it properly.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.860
So any song which
is the simplest

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.339
is going to be hardest.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:10.589
And my favorite song
is definitely not mine.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.920
Sorry to disappoint you,
but my favorite song

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.280
would be-- there are a lot of
songs, but I can remember now

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.230
is [INAUDIBLE] from Jagit Singh.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.976
Yep.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.700
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Is
there another one?

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.533
AUDIENCE: Hi Arijit.

00:17:26.533 --> 00:17:28.210
Thanks for coming to Google.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.347
So just like the
lady just said, we've

00:17:30.347 --> 00:17:32.180
all been following you
since "Fame Gurukul".

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.700
I know my entire
family voted for you

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.533
and when you didn't
win, we were very upset.

00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:37.860
But I'm glad that you're here.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.187
My question to you is a lot
of us found out about you

00:17:41.187 --> 00:17:43.020
or rather, we started
hearing more about you

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.550
after "Tum Hi Ho", the
song from 2012 I guess.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.610
And since then there's
been hits after hits,

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.815
and we all just listen to you
every day most of the time.

00:17:52.815 --> 00:17:55.480
But I wanted to ask you,
when was that moment when

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.130
you realized you've arrived?

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.900
Like, you've been doing this
for probably these 10 years,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.310
but was there a time
during this journey

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.330
when you realized,
OK, I've arrived now?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.268
Or has that moment
still not come,

00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:07.892
which means we are
still probably going

00:18:07.892 --> 00:18:10.592
to get a lot from you?

00:18:10.592 --> 00:18:11.300
ARIJIT SINGH: OK.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.830
Nice question.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:22.610
Well, it's been always like--
see, I've been an athlete.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.603
I realize I don't
look like that.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.955
It's like, if you
put a goal, you

00:18:30.955 --> 00:18:35.360
put an ambition, like if it's
100 meters and then 200 meters,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.670
so you arrive every day,
but you never arrive.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:40.320
It's like that.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.350
So I have goals in my
life, and I had goals

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.250
not like I had to
reach something.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.070
But I have goals like
I need to sing this.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.920
I need to sing that.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.890
I need to sing all
the other aspects.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.200
So these were my goals.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.460
It's like a sport.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.130
So you arrive once
you sing that,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.740
and once you sing this,
and a lot of other things

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.410
that you can think of.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:10.380
So after that, the point comes
when you think of something.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.420
You imagine a genre.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.190
You imagine something
which you have never seen,

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.494
and then you look for it.

00:19:17.494 --> 00:19:18.410
That's also a journey.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.790
So I think that
journey has started.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.580
So it's going to be
this way until the end.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.480
ARIJIT SINGH: Thank you.

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:29.500
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.341
I'm Munji.

00:19:30.341 --> 00:19:31.340
I have a quick question.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:36.750
So before you were doing music
for yourselves as opposed

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.600
to now you're doing
it professionally,

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.770
how has it changed for you?

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.740
How do you think
about it differently?

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.230
Or has it not?

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.300
ARIJIT SINGH: It's
exhausting, because when

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:54.520
you do music for yourself, you
don't have any responsibility.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.720
You don't have to think
of any boundaries.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.620
Like, you have perform today or
you have to do this and that.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.880
You don't think, you just
sing and you do your work.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.040
The moment professionalism
comes you have responsibilities.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.610
So you need to think of
how you perfect your thing

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:19.140
and you work harder and harder.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:24.360
And you reach a point when you
start to feel scared about it,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.470
because people are going
to expect a lot from you.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.560
So all those pressures come.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.499
That's the only difference.

00:20:31.499 --> 00:20:33.540
AUDIENCE: Music-wise, you
feel anything different

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.890
that you could have
done differently

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.270
or if you had a chance you
would have done differently.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.460
ARIJIT SINGH: I told you
every song every time,

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.350
maybe, because it's a
never ending process.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.100
You can't really
calculate music.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.360
So I always think that
whatever I've done let's

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.020
just forget it and move
on to the next thing.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.770
That's the only way to go.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.100
Otherwise, I'll be frustrated.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.590
Thank you.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.090
KUNAL AGGARWAL: What we want
to know as Google employees,

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:09.010
a lot of people have a passion
for music and performing art.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.790
What advice do you have for
people in the technology sector

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.370
to follow what you do.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.660
ARIJIT SINGH: I'm wrong person.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.790
Technology.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.580
OK, I need to think.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:28.040
Maybe if it's much more
creativity, whatever you do,

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.350
whatever you discover, it's
always creative technique.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.180
Technology is filtrated
into any choice.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:37.015
But I think whoever wants
to do something technology,

00:21:37.015 --> 00:21:39.656
I think they should.

00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:45.160
I think they should find a way
to their imagination inside.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.247
That's the only way to go.

00:21:47.247 --> 00:21:48.330
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Thank you.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.270
ARIJIT SINGH: Thank you.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.550
ROSHNI SUCHDE: I think over
there somebody is waiting.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.170
AUDIENCE: If I may have one
last question, Love "Tum Hi Ho".

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.630
Love the unplugged version
even better in my opinion,

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.390
just because the
harmonic was great.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:06.330
When you're making music for
the movies, do you visualize?

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.950
Do they give you
a clue as to what

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.800
you should be aiming towards or
do you sort of make something

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.890
and then they work
with it eventually?

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.980
Or how does that
entire process work?

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.320
ARIJIT SINGH: Well, it depends.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.280
If you're scoring to a music,
like if you have a film

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.190
and you have to score for it,
then of course you have scenes.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.000
And you have proper
brief of the emotions

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.930
and how it's going to go.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:38.530
So that's easier, because you
have everything in front of you

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.330
and you can actually
sit with the director

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.900
and understand what's
the motive of the scene.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.619
And then you score
it, score the melody.

00:22:45.619 --> 00:22:47.160
And there is another
way of doing it.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.620
It is you don't have a film.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.350
You don't have a video of such.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.070
You just have a script.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.350
So you have to visualize it.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.460
You're the director this time.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.340
You have anything.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.510
You can choreograph.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.510
You become the director.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.860
You become the cinematographer,
the light engineer,

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.060
and whatever you want to be.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.410
You be that and you
imagine and score.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.340
And later on if
the music is ready,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.816
they'll do whatever after.

00:23:14.816 --> 00:23:17.331
AUDIENCE: Are you
usually satisfied

00:23:17.331 --> 00:23:18.580
with how everything works out?

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.329
ARIJIT SINGH: You're
never satisfied, bro.

00:23:20.329 --> 00:23:22.247
Trust me.

00:23:22.247 --> 00:23:23.080
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.580
Thank you.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.630
ARIJIT SINGH: Thank you.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.020
Thanks again for
coming to Google.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.110
So you've been know to be
a little shy as compared

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.290
to other-- I don't know.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.190
I was doing research on you and
that's my initial [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:45.340
So actually in my
research, I found out,

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.280
I read this article
in "Forbes" which

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.280
said you go to your
studio at midnight

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.710
to stay away from fans or
photographers or media.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.070
And then I read
another article where

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:01.150
you said that the
"Forbes" article was fake.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.430
So I want to hear from you.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.610
Which one?

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.530
Did it happen, not happen?

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.540
On what's your take on general--

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.409
ARIJIT SINGH: "Forbes"
was a fake for sure.

00:24:11.409 --> 00:24:11.950
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.242
They did a really good job.

00:24:14.242 --> 00:24:15.450
ARIJIT SINGH: Convincing you?

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:22.260
So what's your take
on the media in India

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.620
and the idolization
of superstars?

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.910
How has your life changed
now as compared to--

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:33.290
ARIJIT SINGH: I think we
have a huge population.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.350
That's the problem.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.440
Everyone is becoming
a part of the media,

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.710
and they are not studying media.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.430
And they have a camera and
they know how to talk bullshit

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.500
and then they blab about it.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.770
So that's when
the problem comes.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.800
Otherwise, serious media people,
they are really, really genuine

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.880
and they want to do best.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.780
With Bollywood, with the
whole music scenario,

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.930
all different scenarios, they've
been like page three every day.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.990
So you can't really
go with the media

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.670
at all, because
they talk anything.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.060
It's just random stuff they do.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.840
So I think it's better
that if you follow them

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.790
on Twitter, if you
follow them on Facebook

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.714
or whatever social
media they're in,

00:25:24.714 --> 00:25:25.880
that's the best thing to do.

00:25:28.182 --> 00:25:28.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:25:31.815 --> 00:25:32.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, Arijit.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.100
Thanks for coming.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.704
As it's been mentioned,
you're a wonderful singer.

00:25:36.704 --> 00:25:37.495
You play the piano.

00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:38.630
You play the guitar.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.690
I'm a particular fan
of your MTV Unplugged.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:44.200
ARIJIT SINGH: I don't play
it like a pro but I play it.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.140
AUDIENCE: So I play
the guitar as well,

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.240
and I appreciate how
prominent the guitar often

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.810
is in a lot of your songs.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.500
So I was just wondering is
there a particular instrument

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.380
that you have found to be most
effective in helping you convey

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.577
your emotion or
thoughts in a song,

00:25:58.577 --> 00:26:01.160
or is there another instrument
that you hope to learn and pick

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.340
up along the way that you'd like
to see in some of your newer

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.970
singles?

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:10.410
ARIJIT SINGH: Well, I
think, I love the piano.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:15.480
I think it's the most melodic
and purposed combination

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.410
of an instrument which is made.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.745
But that's still unfair
to a lot of instruments

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.640
because I don't know them.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.300
I would like to the learn-- it's
a very difficult instrument--

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.425
but I would like to
learn Cello, because it's

00:26:31.425 --> 00:26:33.875
a very scientific instrument.

00:26:33.875 --> 00:26:36.150
When I tried it,
it's I think not

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.050
my nature, not my lot
and not my cup of coffee.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.680
It's very difficult. It's very,
very difficult. It's fretless.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.530
It's heavy.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.340
It's like your grandfather.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:53.500
It's really difficult. I
think I would call off.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.220
KUNAL AGGARWAL: So I
have a question for you.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.970
What is life after music?

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.995
Are you into filming
or directing?

00:27:04.402 --> 00:27:05.110
ARIJIT SINGH: OK.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.810
I filmed something where
I thought I would--

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.580
It's like an
experiment that I've

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:21.180
done with 5D and the 1DC
camera lights and lenses.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.940
I've started shooting
things, and I've

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.390
made something
which came out nice.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.760
And I kind of like it.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.140
It's OK.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.230
It's not like film, but
it's a feature length film

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.190
that I've done.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.380
I'm still working on it.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.870
I'm still working on
the BGM and 5.1 mix.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:45.160
Most probably it will
be ready by this year.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.940
KUNAL AGGARWAL: Very good.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.880
ARIJIT SINGH: OK, which one?

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.470
Sir.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.970
Sir.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.170
AUDIENCE: OK, basically my
question is not from me.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.800
It's from my son, [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.470
He's your big fan, and
he is entering puberty.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:05.030
And he's asked me to
ask for your advice

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.600
as to how he should do the
vocal training during puberty.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.520
I can't help it.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.970
He asked me to ask.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.420
ARIJIT SINGH: Just tell
him to sing at the time.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.040
It's going to be fine.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.990
AUDIENCE: Any particular like,
you had your classical training

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.690
going on.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.482
So any particular
thing from that side.

00:28:30.482 --> 00:28:31.940
ARIJIT SINGH: Well,
I think I don't

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.190
have a one liner for this.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:40.330
I think he should be
happy and just let it go.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.190
It's OK.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.409
He'll be fine.

00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.950
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:43.730
I'll tell him.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:44.230
Thank you.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.230
ARIJIT SINGH: Thank you.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.830
Thank you.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.620
AUDIENCE: Well, first of all
I want to congratulate you.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.630
You're one of those
singers who really

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.450
knows how to carry himself
with great style and class.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.940
And you make all of
us very, very proud.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.900
One thing I will say that
your song like "Tum Hi Ho"

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.740
is literally the anthem.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.840
And I think in the
form of romance,

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.230
it's will carry that chart
for the rest of the world.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:18.050
This show that you're
presenting in the US today,

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.480
you've chosen very
selective cities

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.880
and it's very rare that we
see an Indian show coming

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.090
with a symphony orchestra.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.890
And you've been very selective
in doing just a few shows,

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:35.090
but you want to put your full
effort on this particular tour.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:39.180
Can you tell us
the grand symphony

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.070
that's performing
with you and how

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.780
this show is going
to be different

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.530
that only about seven cities
are going to be experiencing?

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:52.010
ARIJIT SINGH: Yeah, the symphony
thing is a little new for me

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.580
as well.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.150
It's first of all,
the Indian music

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.090
has nothing to do with
symphony because symphony

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.290
is purely Western classical.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:04.300
But we're blending it.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.061
People have been doing it in
[INAUDIBLE] from '70s and '60s

00:30:08.061 --> 00:30:08.560
actually.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.900
We had the Bombay Symphony
Orchestra in the past.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.500
But we don't have much
musicians in India

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.790
where they are not keen on.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.530
Basically, it's a propaganda.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:28.060
So we don't have
good musicians who

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.080
can play horn section and string
section, wood wind section.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.990
We don't have a good
instruments as well.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:38.980
So that was something
which we were lacking.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:46.060
And we tried to do a blend
of an alternating music

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:51.220
and symphonic music together so
that it doesn't get monotonous.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:56.902
And at the same time, you have
a classic flavor to your songs.

00:30:56.902 --> 00:30:58.610
I think [INAUDIBLE]
is the only guy who's

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.670
been really working hard at
this for a very, very long time.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.980
And he has worked on it so hard
that I think after five years

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.761
we'll get musicians who can play
symphonic structure in India as

00:31:10.761 --> 00:31:11.260
well.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.160
And certainly, he's doing it.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.020
So I think music will rise.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.180
For now, what our thing is,
if we want to do symphonic

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.240
we have to hire
people from outside.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.270
So I did Dubai gig
with symphony so we

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:29.370
have to book a symphony
orchestra from London.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:33.450
And then, we did London
and then we didn't Mumbai.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.980
But in Mumbai we only
had [INAUDIBLE] strings

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.170
and a couple of wood winds.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.680
So we had to compromise.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.780
This time, it's the
hub of symphony.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.962
Anyway, the US is like
the hub of, the central

00:31:43.962 --> 00:31:44.920
of symphony orchestras.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.620
We had good musicians
coming up, and we

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.390
gathered all the musicians.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:54.580
And it's like a
richness to your music.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.540
It gives a different
flavor to it.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.060
It has a different texture.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.400
It's very cinematic.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:05.190
And if you can imagine a film
with a [INAUDIBLE] orchestra

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.710
playing, a lot of musicians
playing, and giving you

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.040
a grandeur of it.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.420
So symphony would be sounding
like that in the show.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.840
But at the same
time, because as I

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.210
funk it up, because we have
two guitarist, one bassist, one

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.590
drummer, so we have an
alternative metal rock

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.660
kind of a band.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.880
That blending with
the symphony orchestra

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.680
is giving a different
flavor unlike it.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.340
So that's how we're doing it.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.320
And I'm really, really
not sure about how

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.800
it's going to sound,
because most of the time

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.300
I'm lost with the
symphony thing.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.020
It's so big and
it's so difficult

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.790
to handle all the musicians
and the technicals.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:44.850
You know, it was really, really
difficult for me on those days.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.580
But I'm hoping for the best.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.550
I have a lot of shows.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:52.700
I think the first two shows
and after that I'll be informed

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.420
and I can see everything
on stage, I guess.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.740
AUDIENCE: Well, I
will say one thing.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.250
I'm the promoter who's
doing the show in Houston.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.330
People are flying in
from different states,

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.680
in different cities, just
to be a part of that show.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.020
You've always been
a man of few words,

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:11.730
but the magnitude and the
quality that you always

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.681
focus on is the reason why
we are all here at the Google

00:33:14.681 --> 00:33:15.180
studio.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.190
And I really want to
congratulate you for that.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.606
ARIJIT SINGH: Thank
you very much.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.230
KUNAL AGGARWAL: I have
a question for you.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.360
So for the people who
want to learn singing,

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.130
would you ever consider
opening a school

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:34.330
to teach your style,
your technique,

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:37.660
teach music to other people?

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.550
ARIJIT SINGH: You
mean me teaching?

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.660
Yes.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.430
Not now, because
I'm still learning.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:51.820
I think I would be ready
by another 20 years.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.610
Like just ready to teach
a couple of people,

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.390
not everyone, because teaching
is a different art altogether.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.010
So I'm learning to do it,
because it's very, very

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:06.290
important to teach music
because it's not only

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.120
to understand that
if you know music

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.500
it's not necessarily you have to
sing in Hollywood or Bollywood

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.130
or any other platform.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.570
Singing is an art and you
can sing for yourself.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.409
Making it a career is
a different option.

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:25.150
So we need to understand
any performing art is not

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.480
commercial always.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.239
So that's the thing I think
I'm still struggling on it.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.489
I am still looking
for an answer where

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:37.380
I can understand myself of how
am I going to convince people.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:41.130
So that's going to take time,
and I have a plan for a school

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:41.980
later on.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.636
That's going to be kick ass.

00:34:43.636 --> 00:34:44.719
KUNAL AGGARWAL: All right.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:45.449
Cool.

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:48.830
So this concludes
our talk for today.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.620
But we would like to give
a huge round of applause

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.495
to Mr. Arijit Singh Thank
you so much for coming here.

00:34:56.495 --> 00:34:57.870
ARIJIT SINGH: It
was my pleasure.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:02.120
[APPLAUSE]
