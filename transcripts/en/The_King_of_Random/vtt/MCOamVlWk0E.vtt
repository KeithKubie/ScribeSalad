00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
A lot of food goes stale
or rotten when it's exposed

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.540
to air or moisture.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.020
What happens if they stay
in a vacuum chamber

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.580
where it doesn't have either one?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.120
[Captions by Y Translator]

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.600
YouTube user Grant Feltz asked
if food would get stale

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.700
in a vacuum chamber?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.180
Grant that is a great question

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.400
and we would love
to try that out.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.900
So today, we've got a variety
of foods that go bad

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.700
when they're left out.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.100
We've got some jars that we're going
to try and turn into small vacuum chambers

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.060
with the food in them
and see what happens

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.940
to that food after a couple of weeks.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.280
Here's what we're going to try.

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:35.400
We'll modify these jars so

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.500
they can hold a vacuum
with the food inside.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.300
We'll have some food
in the vacuumed jars as well

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.760
as keeping some food
out of the jars as a control.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.800
After two weeks,
we'll see what's happened.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.880
We've got five different foods
that were going to test,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.900
so let's take a look at them.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.612
First we have a couple of apples.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.840
We'll cut these into slices.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.180
One bunch of apple slices will go
into a jar with all the air sucked out,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.800
and the other batch of apple 
slices will still go in a jar

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.100
but we'll leave the lid off.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.800
Hopefully we can keep too
many fruit flies from finding it.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.340
We may end up putting
a thin cloth barrier

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.660
just to keep them out.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.740
We've got some milk
with an expiration date

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.000
of less than two weeks from now,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.240
and we're going to put some
of it in the jar in a vacuum,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.160
and some of it just leaving in the bottle,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.600
and let it sit for two weeks
and see what happens.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.800
Graham crackers are something that I think
get very noticeably stale pretty quickly.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.400
If they're fresh,
they break fairly easily,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.540
they're pretty crumbly and they
have a nice dry crunch to them.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.500
Normally if you leave them out,
they get really soft, almost mushy.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.060
You can't even really snap them.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.200
They almost bend.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.280
So we're going to try
some graham crackers in a jar.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.860
And some graham crackers
just sitting on a plate.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.480
Potato chips, famous for coming
in bags full of air will also go stale

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.160
if you leave them out.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.400
Now a lot of potato chip bags
actually come full of nitrogen

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.240
rather than normal air.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.400
And that's because the nitrogen
doesn't react as much

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.780
with the chips inside,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.200
and we're going to give a comparison
between storing chips

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.480
with nothing, not even nitrogen,
and just leaving the bag open.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.040
These aren't stale yet.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.432
Delicious!

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.600
Lay's that will be 1 million dollars.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.520
Lays?

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.260
Lays? Dang it.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.800
And finally we have some white bread.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.500
Bread if you leave it out,
it usually just gets really really dry

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.580
at least in this climate.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.640
We're going to see
if the same thing happens

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.980
in a vacuum chamber.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.400
We've got all our food laid out.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.600
So it's time to start
making our vacuum jars.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.700
And we've done something
similar to this before.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.100
We took some glass soda bottles,
drilled a small hole in the cap

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.400
and had a piece of rubber
that sat over that hole.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.240
We put the whole thing
inside our larger vacuum chamber.

00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:35.900
And the air is able to be get sucked out
of the jar when we put pressure back in,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.420
that rubber seal gets pressed up
against the hole,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600
keeping it nice and closed.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.060
So that's what we're
going to try doing.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.240
We've got some of these larger jars
so we can fit a good amount of food in it.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.500
Let's see how it works.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.500
Now we're using some electrical tape
to hold this rubber in place.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.220
We're not trying
to hold it down.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.500
We just want it
to not go anywhere.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.900
So I'm not stretching
the tape tight.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.440
I'm not pressing it down
over the whole thing.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.700
We still want air
to be able to escape out

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.360
past this rubber and then
have it kind of sucked down on

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.080
ones there's low pressure in the jar.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.660
Let's give this a test.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.100
Beautiful.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.900
We let the air back
into the main jar,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.512
but the rubber stopper prevented it
from filling the little jar.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.420
Now I think if we peel this 
stopper away, we'll hear the air

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.080
and watch the marshmallows collapse a little.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.960
Or a lot.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.040
Yeah.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.820
Yeah I'd say that's
working pretty well.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.280
Wonderful.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.100
All right we can fit whole
graham crackers into this jar.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.880
So I'm just going to throw
a couple in there.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.100
Whole slice of bread does not fit in
but I'll just cut it in half.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.100
And I think what'll be
the best test is

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.100
I'm just going to put half
of it into the jar

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.000
and leave half of it in the other bottle.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.080
That way there is
some air in the bottle.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.200
A good side by side.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.660
Don't expect graham crackers are going
to do a whole lot in a vacuum.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.840
That already has
moisture in it.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.700
The sides of that have started fogging up
and I'm pretty sure that is moisture

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.000
leaving the bread.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.200
Look at all that moisture cleared up too.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.700
Ooh. It is boiling.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.380
The juice seems to be getting
pulled right out of our apples.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.380
It's kind of hard to keep 
them in zero pressure

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.000
and keep all the juice in place.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.200
So, the results on the apples
may be a little strange.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.440
I think in the spirit of making
 everything as equal as possible,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.620
trying to eliminate variables we'll just
store the non vacuumed versions in jars,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.320
but with the lids off.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.700
Why it was pressurized?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.520
Why are they all pressurized?

00:06:50.302 --> 00:06:51.900
With the apples,
I am going to put a piece

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.360
of paper towel over the top.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.900
Maybe even tried poking
some holes in it.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.220
I want there to be good air exchange,
but I also don't want to fill the house

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.120
with fruit flies.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.700
Now we're going to set these
aside for two weeks

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.980
and see what has changed.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.600
The milk will be in the fridge.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.400
Both of them.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.420
Everything else will
just be sitting out.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.220
Time has now passed
and in fact more time

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.200
than we originally planned.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.700
We were going to go
for two weeks.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.300
And then we just got busy
with our schedule

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.200
filming other videos.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.920
So it's actually been four weeks
that we've let these things sit out.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.500
Which is plenty of time
for stuff to go bad.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.240
Let's see how things are.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.520
We're going to start
by just popping all of the seals

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.700
and we'll see it's possible that 
we haven't kept a perfect vacuum

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.580
on all of these.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.360
But we'll see how
much air seems to rush in

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.680
as we break the seals on them.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380
Side-by-side test.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.760
Graham cracker sitting open
in a jar for about a month.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.500
It does have a little bit
of snap left to it.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.760
Not much.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.180
And it definitely tastes
like an old graham cracker

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.100
that's quite stale.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.200
Don't really think of graham crackers is
something that started tasting bad

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.082
but that was really not pleasant.

00:08:02.652 --> 00:08:05.100
Much more crumbly as it snaps.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.960
Much crisper.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.060
And a lot more crunchy.

00:08:12.932 --> 00:08:15.000
You can actually hear
that when I squish it

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.120
and makes like crunching sounds
and this one just kind of mushes.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.700
This one snaps apart in the crumbs.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.940
So graham crackers
worked really well.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.920
Now the bread I already know
I'm not going to do taste tests

00:08:28.922 --> 00:08:30.700
because there's mold on both of them.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.500
However, the mold
on the open one, very minor.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.900
There's just a little bit
growing around the edges.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.100
The biggest difference of course 
is that this is basically croutons.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.780
The bread in our vacuum chamber.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.120
While moldy and not really
fit for consumption,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.300
is still completely squishy.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.600
Like there has been no loss
of any of the moisture.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.960
Not going to eat it
because of that.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.620
I'm also not going
to eat this one,

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.200
and that's not because of the mold so much
as it is because this is no longer bread

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.320
fit for human consumption.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.520
And this smells bad.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.160
That's going back in the jar.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.220
Potato chips sitting open in a jar.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.840
They're so stale.

00:09:17.402 --> 00:09:18.902
Vacuum chamber chips.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.640
Taste like you just opened the bag.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.900
I don't know if I can really show

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.400
the breakages different with a stale chip.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.900
I mean they both break but that one
is softer and taste bad.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.560
That one is much crispier
and taste delicious.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.440
Apples, right away you can see
that things have transpired

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.460
with the apples.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.700
The ones in this container
have obviously lost

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.360
a lot of moisture.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.000
There is some mold forming.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.000
The peels have become all shriveled,
the apple in general has just

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.900
become shriveled.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.200
It's dehydrated a fair amount
and there is some mold growing

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200
on all parts of it.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.060
Obviously not something that
we're going to eat.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.800
Our vacuum chambered apples don't look
like they've really lost much moisture.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.800
Maybe a little bit, we saw some
of it even getting sucked

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.300
out of the apple when we put it
in a vacuum in the first place.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.300
The other biggest difference is
that these have a lot more mold on them

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.560
and I think that's probably
because they still have

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.440
all of their moisture.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.200
The dried out apples,
don't get as moldy.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.220
The apples that just sit cut open
but have a lot of moisture in them.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.020
Mold central.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.400
Now we have milk.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.960
This jar has been sitting
open in the refrigerator.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.600
You can see that the level
of the milk has dropped.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.720
It's dehydrated that much whereas,
this one I don't think that's changed

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.520
its in the same spot that it was before.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.000
There's like lines on the walls
but that's from when I carried it

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.600
to the fridge and it just
swirls a little bit.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.060
So first test.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.100
That doesn't smell nearly as 
much as I thought it would.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.100
This is well expired milk at this point
and a lot of the time when milk goes bad,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.060
it smells terrible.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.420
You can smell it easily
and from a distance.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.580
But this,

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.960
really doesn't have a smell.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.300
Unfortunately, I am not brave
enough to try drinking that.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.580
You can see a little bit of stuff
 has formed on the surface.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.020
I don't know how to describe it
better than that.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.100
I think that's probably
some kind of mold.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.760
Maybe that's just the formation
of the the milk solids.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.300
How it happened to form up.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.520
All right.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.640
So this,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.800
actually has more smell
and it doesn't smell rotten.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.100
It just smells like milk.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.700
I'm going to try mixing
this up a little bit.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:32.780
All right.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.780
Trying and be brave here.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.440
It's not still good.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.940
Like it has a little bit
of that butter milk taste

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.160
if you've ever tasted buttermilk.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.220
It's maybe getting
just a little bit sour.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.600
If you've ever just
had milk that's gone bad

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.540
like you accidentally poured a cup of it
or in your cereal like it's disgusting.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.800
You want to spit it out
and maybe go vomit right away.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.980
It doesn't taste like that.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.660
But I'm impressed at how
well it preserved this one.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.700
That is about three weeks 
past expiration now.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.220
Grant Feltz what you asked

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.280
is if food will get stale
in a vacuum chamber

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.160
and I think that we have demonstrated
that in terms of just going stale,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.500
a vacuum does a really good job.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.620
Our graham crackers and our potato
chips taste like they're completely new,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.220
they haven't gone bad at all,
and I think that this is

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.700
a decent way to preserve them.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.200
I don't know that it's any better
than just keeping them

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.820
in a sealed Ziploc bag
or something like that,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.900
but this did work.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.200
The bread did not go stale.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.400
It did keep that from happening
but it did not prevent it from rotting.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.900
This has mold all over it

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.100
and is definitely not edible.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.400
Same thing with the apple.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.900
It didn't dry out
but it did go bad.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.840
It's moldy and you
can't eat that.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.900
The milk, I think it probably 
 preserved it somewhat.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.900
It didn't go bad as much
as this one which I admit

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.682
I'm not willing to taste because yuck.

00:12:52.232 --> 00:12:53.000
But it's still not good.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.040
So, keeping it
from going stale.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.000
Yes it does.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.872
Keeping it from going bad
in all situations,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.620
no it definitely does not.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.800
Grant thank you for your great idea
of something scientific we could try out

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.100
using our vacuum chamber.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.600
