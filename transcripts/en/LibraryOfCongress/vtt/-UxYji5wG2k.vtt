&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.826
&gt;&gt; In 2008 you know of course
that Jeff Smith is best known

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.833
as writer and artist of Bone.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.666
It's an award-winning adventure
about his three cartoon cousins lost

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.676
in a world of myth
and ancient mysteries.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.873
In 2008 Smith was the subject of a
documentary called The Cartoonist:

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.240
Jeff Smith, Bone and the
Changing Face of Comics.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.013
And besides Bone, Jeff has also
written some other books including

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.426
Shazam, The Monsters Society of
Evil and Little Mouse Gets Ready.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.516
So everybody get ready to put your
hands together for Jeff Smith.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.390
[Applause]

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.123
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Hi everybody
for everyone coming out today

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.613
in this unbelievable heat.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.760
Let's see.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.110
Now how do I write on this?

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.976
Is there like a pen or --

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.943
[ Sound effects ]

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.276
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible background question]

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.076
&gt;&gt; No I'm sorry.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.010
[Laughter]

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.890
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: This is
probably going to be pretty hard

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.596
for everybody to see,
but we'll do our best.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.730


00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.670


00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.736
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: I'm going to
draw just a few quick pictures,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.936
make a short presentation
and get right to questions,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.493
because I like to talk
to kids anyway, so.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.983
You know when I go to book
events like this, it's new.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.083
It's a new experience for me
to be considered a book writer,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.796
because when I started reading --
you know started drawing comics

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.423
and definitely when I started
reading them comics were --

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.850
they were not considered
really reading.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.700
I think it might have even gone
the other way and people thought

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.040
that comics caused illiteracy.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.980
And I'm not making that up.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.463
I even as a kid, even when
I was 7 years old I knew

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.230
that comics was reading.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.833
You read it just like a book.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.566
You know you go left to right, top
to bottom, just like a regular book.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.880
But there are certain kinds of
symbols and pieces of language

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.373
that are unique to comics.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.056
Surprisingly we all know them
you know like sweat flying

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.933
out of the head means
you're nervous or worried.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.663
A little cloud coming off the back
of your feet means you're running.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.163
These kind of symbols,
they're unique to comics.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.683
But they work together with
the words and the balloons

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.303
and the images are all part
of the storytelling together.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.650
So I want to just start by talking
about what it was that made me want

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.846
to go into comics and
into cartooning,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.086
just going to do something normal.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.226
But I think when I was
looking at comics as a kid,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.496
maybe I can pulled this closed.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.166
I gotta figure out how
I'm going to do this.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.900
I guess I'll say it
and then go draw it.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.100
One of these that interested
me like Snoopy or Donald Duck

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.550
or Bugs Bunny is that you could see
where the characters were looking.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.576
You could see their eyes or just
with the eyebrows or whatever

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.510
and you could tell what
they were thinking.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.110
So I'll draw Fone Bone and
then maybe I'll come back

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.730
and talk about it.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.643
[ Sound effects ]

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.630
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Okay,
so this is Fone.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.413
And he is -- if you're familiar
with the Bone characters,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.993
which most of you are,
he's the friendly one.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.233
He's the more curious cousin.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.320
He's the one that we
probably most all want to be

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.953
like or think we are like.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.413
But what's interesting, or I
don't know if it's interesting,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.026
but what I want to try to convey
is you see his body position.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.320
He's talking here to Ted the bug.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.786
And he's leaning forward
and he's smiling

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.420
and his eyebrows are
kind of up in the air.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.110
His one hand is back.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.576
It's all very unthreatening.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.243
He's interested in
what Ted has to say.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.243
This is part of the
language of comics.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.520
And also you probably
didn't notice that I do it,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.966
but when I drew Ted the
bug, I actually kind

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.796
of traced a little line, an
invisible line from his eyes

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.780
so I could tell where
he was looking.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.193
So now I'll draw a
different character.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.643
[ Sound effects ]

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.216
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: You
can't enough Urrgh.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.256
[Laughter] How did you
sign that by the way?

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.310
[Laughter] So here this is
Fone's cousin Phoney Bone

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.893
and he's a much -- well as you
can see he's a much crankier,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.380
angrier character and again
I use his body position.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.193
He's kind of hunched over.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.060
You can see his fists
are all balled up.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.726
He's got -- he's baring his teeth.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.710
His eyebrows are frowning and
of course, there's all sorts

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.810
of like lightening
bolts and there a plumes

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.480
of clouds coming off his head.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.946
And of course, the
famous word balloon

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.736
where we know what he's saying.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.670


00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.643
[ Sound effects ]

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.260
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: This is the
third bone cousin, Smiley Bone,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.606
so called because he smiles.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.610
And Smiley Bone, he's a
more whimsical character.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.533
And I've portrayed this by
having him play an instrument.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.253
His eyes are closed.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.120
His dogs hang out of his mouth --

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:45.973
his tongue hangs out of
his mouth like a dog.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.200
Sorry this is nervous
looking out here and seeing --

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.266
it makes me nervous seeing
all these people out here.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360


00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.306
So that's the three bone
characters, the three main cousins

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.753
and then I would just like to try
to do a quick demonstration here

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.383
of how you -- how I
as a cartoonist write.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.863
How do you write in cartoons?

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.163
And the basic -- the
smallest like element or piece

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.210
of writing in comics are unit.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.466
Sorry. Let me just say that again.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:28.036
The smallest unit of writing, in
comics, is any two given panels.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.723
So if you draw one panel where
Smiley Bone is standing there --

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.643
[ Sound effects ]

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.516
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: When someone's
running it always helps

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.383
to put a little shadow underneath
them and a little could of dust.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.600
So in this panel, let's
add one more thing.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.466
The little could of dust.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.733
Oh and let's add one more thing.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000


00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.433
[ Sound effects ]

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.316
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: The banana peel.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.316
Alright so, of course you probably
know what's going to happen

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.383
but it's crucial to like see it.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.883
[ Sound effects ]

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.840
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Alright there's
a couple important elements

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.506
that I need to add in.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.906
The swoosh line of his foot.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.240
Oh I need to put the banana peel.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.673
[ Sound effects ]

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.106
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: And there we go.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.383
And with these two panels
we now have an action.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.230
The reader whether he's a nine year
old kid or a fifty year old man

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.473
like me, that -- you may
make the action happen;

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:29.253
its two totally separate
pieces of art.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.160
And yet when you put the
two together it's that jump

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.903
from one panel to the next where
you can turn it into movement.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.810
I think we need a third
panel though.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.643
[ Sound effects ]

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.330
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Alright
so you get the idea.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.790
It's leaping -- this little space

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.703
between the panels
actually has a name.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:30.686
It's called the gutter and it's
actually jumping over the gutter,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.733
that actual magic or the actual
reading that really takes place

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.753
when you're doing a comic.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:43.980


00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.906
[Applause] That's it really.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040
That's it.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.040
Thank you.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.040


00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.410
[Applause] So what we'd like to do
now, if there's any kids or anybody

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.996
who wants to ask a question or
anything we have some microphones.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.270
If you could line up behind
the microphones we'll talk.

He's like, "What?"

Why don't we start over here?

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:57.970
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.970

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.503
&gt;&gt; My name is Collette.

&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Hi Collette.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.103
&gt;&gt; What gave you the idea of just
the whole setting like the --

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.770
like how was Fone Bone so
grumpy and like how did you make

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.230
up the whole dragon and all that?

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.890
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith -- I, I --
okay how do I explain that.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.010
[Laugher]

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.743
&gt;&gt; What gave you the idea?

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:24.466
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: When I was like
five I really wanted to make

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.286
up my own cartoon character.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.970
Back then Peanuts were
in the newspaper.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.363
Every Sunday night Walt
Disney used to be on TV.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.510
He was still alive then.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.310
And he would introduce
his character.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.400
So I knew that Walt Disney made
up Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.486
I knew that Charles
Schultz made up Peanuts.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.473
So I thought I want to make
up a cartoon character.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.406
I just kept trying.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.006
I made up all sorts of them.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.083
I made up dogs and worms and
birds and super heroes and things.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.730
But this little guy kind
looked kind of like a bone.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.720
You now he's got this
round head and his big nose

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.133
and he looks like a dog bone.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.553
He just kind of stuck with me and I
think the reason he stuck with me is

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:07.906
because of -- what I was talking
about a little bit here is

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.460
like I could see his
different emotions.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.580
I actually thought it was
fun to solve the puzzle

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:21.876
of what would it look like if you
turned his head around in space

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.056
and like saw him from the back.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.613
Or if he was angry or he was
tired, how would he look?

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.700
How would I draw it really?

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.233
So I drew those kind of
classic American big-nosed,

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:34.176
three-fingered characters
all my life.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:41.216
And then when I was in college there
was a magazine called Heavy Metal,

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.850
which we all know now and it's
kind of a cheesecaky magazine,

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.260
but back when it first came
out, it was very different.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.173
It was a bunch of European
cartoonists who did a fantasy,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:57.346
like a science fiction
fantasy for grownups.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.500
And it was really genius,
really well done.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:06.116
And I thought, "You know
what, if you take Bugs Bunny

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.696
or Mickey Mouse characters
and put them in this

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.896
like heavy metal fantasy world or
put Bugs Bunny into a real book

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.143
like Moby Dick or [Inaudible]
don't worry.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.026
[Laughter] I thought it would
be fun, so that's what I did.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:23.900
By the way, I see you're holding
the Bone one volume edition there.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.226
Are your arms getting tired?

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.026
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Can I
ask how old you are?

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.360
&gt;&gt; I'm ten.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.026
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: And you've
already read that whole thing?

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:37.960
&gt;&gt; No, but I actually
just got it today.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.160
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: And
you're still holding it?

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.226
&gt;&gt; I've almost read
half of the Bone series.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:43.793
I've actually -- I didn't
hear of them until last year

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:46.860
when my friend pointed
them out to me

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:48.926
and I got them from
my school library.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.860
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Well
that's wonderful.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.460
Thank you.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.726
Thank you Collette.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.460
[Applause]

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.460
&gt;&gt; And do you think I can get
one of those pictures you drew?

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.060
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Yeah, you can
talk to someone over here.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.460
I'm going to stay out of that.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.460
[Laughter] Yes?

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:06.526
&gt;&gt; Okay I like the way you draw

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:08.976
where you just start
like piecing it out.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.410
And when you made up the Bones
picture did it sort of just

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.220
like flow with your pencil?

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.483
Do you think of these
pictures before you draw them

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.090
or do you just write
something down and just see it?

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.406
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: I think
I understand that.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.940
Did you get -- can everybody hear
all the questions and everything.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.073
Alright the question was when
she saw me drawing the characters

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:35.486
and it looked like I was moving

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.220
around in different
parts and drawing them.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.453
I think you're asking do
I see it before I draw it.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720
Is that right?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720
&gt;&gt; Um huh.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.053
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: It's actually
a really good question

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.120
and I try to do that.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.853
I try like before I start
I kind of already know

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:51.853
where everything is going to be.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.853
I kind of picture the
drawing and then just kind

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.386
of trace my imagination
as I'm seeing it.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:06.070
I have certain little tricks,
which I'll try to show you one.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:07.746
I'm trying to think of an example.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.746
Let's say Fone Bone was
going to throw a baseball.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:12.986
Well that would be
a hard thing to do.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.266
So what I'll do is I'll
picture in my head, "Okay,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:19.573
he's probably" -- is that right?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.440
I don't know.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.906
I don't play baseball.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.440
[Laughter]

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.573
[ Sound effects ]

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.590
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: But this is the
trick I'm going to tell you

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:36.700
about because it's kind of unnatural
for a little cartoon character

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.323
because he doesn't like really
have bones, not real ones.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:43.923
So what I would draw after I got
the position down of his head,

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.456
and got his determined throwing
face, now I'm going to draw his hand

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.843
and I'm going to put it where
it would be interesting.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.920


00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:57.643
[ Sound effects ]

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.773
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Okay, so now
I'm not really going to worry

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:03.373
about how long his arm is anything.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.946
I'm just going to connect
it up to his body.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000


00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.673
[ Sound effects ]

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.993
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Alright.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.526
Okay, thank you.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.460
[Applause]

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.793
&gt;&gt; What inspired you to make like
the evil character Briar sisters

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.813
with Grandma Ben, like
the good character?

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.393
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: There are twins --
twins happen a lot in storytelling.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.643
Stories that go way back
all the way to roman times

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.990
and even earlier than that.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.030
It's a very popular kind
of motif to tell stories

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.973
and it's all throughout Bone.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.240
So you see you'll have
Fone Bone and Phoney Bone.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.126
You have the good one
and the bad one.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.686
So basically it's just
kind of like a running joke

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.483
so to speak throughout all Bone.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.410
So you have not only Fone Bone and
Phoney Bone, you have Grandma Rose,

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:25.050
you have Rose and you have Briar.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:27.540
So there's just -- a lot
of times there's two.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.920
It's just kind of a
story kind of trick.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:34.050
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:35.183
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Okay, thanks man.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.050
Yes.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:39.280
&gt;&gt; First I'd just like to say I'm
a really big fan of your work.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.753
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Thanks man.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.663
&gt;&gt; So again I was researching
you on the internet one day

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.043
and I read somewhere that you

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.920
at one point challenged
fellow cartoonist Dave Simms

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.900
to a boxing match.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.633
Would you mind telling
the story behind that?

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.700
[Laughter]

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.100
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: That's a great story.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.033
Except it was the other way around.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.566
He challenged me to a match.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.700
&gt;&gt; Oh okay.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.100
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: But he also -- he
didn't want to do any of the work.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.566
He wanted me to like
set up the boxing ring.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.700
It was silly.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.900
We got in a fight.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.536
We were mad at each other and
I don't know it was silly.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.330
[Laughter] I don't want
to tell that story.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.470
You can find out about it on the
internet if you really want to.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.896
[Laughter] Alright, thanks man.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.830
Go ahead.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.363
&gt;&gt; What is the story
of the red dragon?

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.790
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: The
story of the red dragon.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.760
Now how do I tell that
story to kids?

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:42.276
The story of the red dragon is in
stories you need to have a mentor,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:48.250
a kind of guardian
angel type character.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.983
Well in Star Wars that
was Obi Wan Kenobi.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.583
Well in Bone it's the
Great Red Dragon.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.873
He kind of watches over them.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.456
The idea of the character
came from --

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:07.850
around the world dragons have
different meanings and in the east

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.476
like in China dragons
are very good characters.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.400
They represent water and wind and
they are protective guardians.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.570
They're good.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.503
They're like good powers,
whereas in the west

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:25.913
in our culture dragons
are usually bad.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.293
They're fire-breathing.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.760
They always want to hoard
princesses and gold,

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.053
things they really have no use for.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.270
They're bad.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:42.270
So I thought maybe the very
first dragon would be a very good

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.433
benevolent dragon and then
that dragon who's Queen Mim

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.643
in the bone story, her son
would be the red dragon.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.806
So he's sort of a western
dragon, breathes fire

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:56.696
and an eastern dragon who's a
guardian and he has a goatee,

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.783
sort of like Chinese dragons do.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:02.230
And then all the other
dragons, the eastern

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.030
and western dragons
all descended from him.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.763
So that was sort of
like his mythology.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.296
Alright, thanks.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.030
Yes sir.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.030


00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.640
&gt;&gt; So when you draw Bone do
you think about how more --

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.030
the swordplay and fighting
the creatures

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.540
and all the other guys
that's more of Grandma Ben

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.253
and Thorn's department, but it's
usually except for one part in --

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.893
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Okay.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.693
&gt;&gt; It's never the Bone brothers.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.653
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: So let
me see if I understand.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.200
You're saying that when
I'm writing am I --

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.800
do I compartmentalize
it or is one --

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:02.423
is the adventure part more
important than the funny part?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
&gt;&gt; No. It's --

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.600
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Go ahead.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.566
&gt;&gt; They never really pick up a
sword and do a lot of fighting.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.000
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Right.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.320
&gt;&gt; It's more Thorn style
and Grandma Ben's style.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.146
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Yeah, well
I think of the Bones,

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.420
they're cartoon characters.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.353
And they're classic comedy slapstick
comedians like the Marx Brothers

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.306
or Mickey, Donald and Goofy.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.176
And their job isn't really
to do the adventure stuff.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.630
You know their job is to
get in trouble basically

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.616
and that's how it works out.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.550
And sort of the Luke Skywalker
part of the story that fell

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.156
to Thorn and Grandma Ben to do.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.076
So I did think that
they should be separate.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.070


00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280
Okay sure.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.880
Okay we're getting down.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.346
We got about two more
minutes left so let's try

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:03.680
to ask a couple more
questions quick.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.573
&gt;&gt; Well do you have any advice
to fellow storytellers how

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:08.896
to balance -- when to write
stories that balance like comedic,

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:17.143
really silly, really funny, really
fun stuff with mythology and epic?

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:21.450
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Well I've always
liked comedies that forget

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:22.980
that they're comedies for awhile.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.446
I think one of the movies

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.013
that really struck me was
American Werewolf in London,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.363
which is a comedy but it's also one

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.386
of the most terrifying
films I've ever seen.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:38.140
Ghostbusters did a really good job
of balancing humor and big scale

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:39.263
and you know end of the
world cataclysmic stuff.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.576
So my best advice would find
examples of it, you know

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.730
and just read it and do your best to
reconstruct it and see how it works.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.680
Watch it a couple of
times, whatever.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.540
That's what I did.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.806
Does that help at all?

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah thank you.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.873
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: Alright.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.006
&gt;&gt; Are you going to
create anymore books?

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.406
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: I am going
to create more books.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.873
I'm probably not going to create
anymore Bone books I'm sorry to say.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.873
We are doing a series
of -- well hey --

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.120
we're going to do a series of books
that are pros books that I'm going

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.966
to do the illustrations for.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:17.390
But I really didn't
want them to be sequels

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.286
and my one rule was I didn't want
the three Bone cousins to be in it

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:23.800
because I don't really like
-- I don't like sequels.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:26.640
I really think once the story is
over it should be done and kind

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.966
of -- it's up to you to imagine
what happens to the characters

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.753
and where they go after that.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.776
Alright last question.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.643
&gt;&gt; From all the books you've
written so far, how --

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.293
which one is your favorite
Bone cousin to write about?

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.166
Like can you describe it?

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.960
&gt;&gt; Jeff Smith: You know they're
all my favorite sometimes.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.233
Phoney Bone is so much fun 'cause
he always says such nasty things

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.153
that I could never
really say in real life

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:56.966
and it's really fun
to do that sometimes.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:58.673
But in all honesty it
has to be Fone Bone.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.406
He's probably the one I
most closely identify with

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.376
and he's my guy, alright.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.143
Well I will thank you
everyone for coming.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:10.410
Time's up.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:12.410
Thank you.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.410
[Applause]

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.276
