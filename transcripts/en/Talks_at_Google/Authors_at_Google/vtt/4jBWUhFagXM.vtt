PENN JILLETTE: Anyway,
welcome to this Google Talk.

00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:04.100
We have Penn
Jillette here today.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.030
You probably know him
from Penn &amp; Teller.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.545
Been on "The David Letterman
Show," Howard Stern.

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:13.790
And he's been on a
lot of other shows.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.290
This is his latest book on
the New York Times best seller

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:16.830
list.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.699
He did "Penn &amp; Teller Bullshit."

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.490
And of course now, it's
Penn &amp; Teller "Fool

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.410
Us," which abbreviates to
FU, which is the theme.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.800
Could be coming
out very shortly.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.125
We're so happy to have him here.

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.166
How about we give a nice
Google round of applause

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:32.876
to Penn Jillette.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.130
Thanks so much, Phil.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.630
Thank you!

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.130
Thank you.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.380
Thank you so much, so much.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.750
Thanks for that really
nice introduction.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.770
That was a great introduction.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.070
I'm so glad to see you here.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.820
I'm gonna talk a little
bit about my book,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.464
about how I lost a
wicked lot of weight.

00:00:51.464 --> 00:00:54.130
But the first thing I gotta say,
the most important thing to say

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.720
to you is, if you take medical
advice from a Las Vegas

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.290
magician, you are an asshole
and you deserve to die.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.810
Make that very, very clear.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.820
I'm going to be talking
about a lot of stuff

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.160
I don't know jack shit about,
which is not unusual for me.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.506
But I am going to be
talking rather seriously

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:17.630
about a lot of weight loss.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.530
And these are serious
medical things.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.690
So really, if anybody's going
to listen to a word that I say,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.750
you really have to do
the research on your own

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.230
and talk to doctors and people
that actually know shit.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.780
In 2014, around Halloween time,
I ended up in the hospital.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.910
I had blood pressure
like UK voltage.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.600
I was really looking like 220.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.990
And that was on
five hard core meds.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.610
And the doctor said
to me that I had

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.440
to lose about 30 or 40 pounds.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.730
I was about-- at that
point, I was about-- well,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.240
you don't weigh yourself
at the heaviest,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.950
but I figure I weighed
in at about 333.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.310
So I think I was
probably heaviest day,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.160
probably about 340.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.430
I'll give you some
advice, anybody here,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.700
if you want to lose a lot
of weight, first gain a lot

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.680
of weight.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.300
Because if you haven't
got 110 pounds to lose,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.290
you have not got a chance.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.180
So I was probably around 340.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.520
I don't really know.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.540
And I've been told for
years that the reason

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.990
I had high blood pressure
was that it was genetic.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.530
They always said it was genetic.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.140
And I do have in my
ancestry some the high risk

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.780
for high blood
pressure background.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.390
I have a little bit of African
and some Native American.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.210
And those are the ones
that do really bad.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.001
What are you doing?

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:48.140
What are you doing?

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.046
PHIL: Sabotaging you.

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:51.390
Sorry.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.580
Just please go on.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.970
PENN JILLETTE: No, no.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.803
I just want to know.

00:02:53.803 --> 00:02:54.610
This is exciting.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.420
I want to know what exciting
sort of things you're up to.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.860
Oh, you turned the
microphone up a little bit?

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.550
PHIL: Trying to.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.800
I don't know if it'll work.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800
PENN JILLETTE: OK, good.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.380
You couldn't get your own
fucking mic to work, so.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.550
First take the log
out of your own eye

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.290
before finding the stye in mine.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.390
At least my mic was
working somewhat.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.920
You doing OK?

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.740
PHIL: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.454
Thanks.

00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:18.370
PENN JILLETTE: It's not
like you're invisible.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.720
I mean, it's not like you
walk like a Warner Brothers

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.150
cartoon up like this
and no one sees you.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
PHIL: When you were over
there, I wasn't quite--

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.310
PENN JILLETTE: Oh, you thought
I was misdirecting from you?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.060
OK.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.820
Am I louder now?

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.830
Is that OK?

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.080
So I have some of those high
blood pressure kind of genes.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.020
And the nutty thing was,
the doctor came to me

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.010
and said that I was going
to-- they were suggesting

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.310
that I get a stomach sleeve.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.230
So they were going to give me
a surgical operation to make it

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.580
so that I couldn't eat as much.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.630
And he said he wanted to
get me down to about 280

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.513
so that the meds
that I was taking-- I

00:03:58.513 --> 00:04:03.160
was taking five medications
and at the highest dosage

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.186
to get it down to what could
be controlled by drugs.

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:07.810
And then I said to
him, well, you know,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.230
what if I get down below that?

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.282
What if I get down
to about 230 or so?

00:04:11.282 --> 00:04:12.990
And he said, well, if
you get down there,

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.904
you wouldn't need
the meds at all.

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:16.320
And I thought that
was really odd.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.800
Because if this was
a genetic condition,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.626
how could I get rid
of a genetic condition

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:21.709
just by losing the weight?

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.820
So I said, the drugs
that I'm taking

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.650
are not really high
blood pressure drugs.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.390
They're fat fuck drugs, right?

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.610
I mean, they're just drugs
because I'm a fat fuck.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.870
That's the reason I'm
taking these drugs.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.260
And he said, well, I guess so.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.950
I guess you could say that.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.870
But you know, you'll
never get down.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.340
You'll never get down to 230.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.460
We're just hoping
you'll get down to 280.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.156
And I did not say anything
about losing weight

00:04:46.156 --> 00:04:47.280
when I was in the hospital.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.170
As a matter of fact, when
he said stomach sleeve,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.650
I said, sure, I'll do
that in a few months.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.274
Whenever it's right, I can come
back in and schedule something,

00:04:53.274 --> 00:04:54.392
get that operation.

00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:56.850
Because I didn't want to make
any promises in the hospital,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.350
because I do not
believe anything anyone

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.460
says in the hospital, on
New Year's Eve, or right

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.330
after they come.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.620
And surprisingly, I say the same
thing in all three situations.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.080
So I didn't promise anything.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.770
I just thought,
well, maybe I'll see.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.640
But what the doctor gave me
by saying stomach sleeve,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.140
by saying that they were going
to do a surgical operation so

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.290
that I can lose weight,
what he said to me

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.045
had nothing to do with
the surgical operation.

00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:33.620
It had nothing to do
with the procedure.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.260
What it gave me was the
liberty to go crazy,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.330
the liberty to be a nut.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.210
Because what I'd
always thought was

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.360
I was supposed to lose
weight like a grown up,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.140
like an adult, like the New
York Times wanted me to--

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.400
with slightly smaller
portions, and why not be

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.220
vegan after 6:00, had maybe
do an afternoon fast once

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.930
in a while.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.950
It was all this
moderation thing.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.940
And as soon as he brought
up they were actually

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.850
going to do a
surgical operation,

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.600
it gave me license to
be crazy, to look around

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.400
for something nutty to do.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.270
And I realized at
that moment, when

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.780
he said they were going to
actually do a surgery, that not

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.780
only am I not good
at moderation,

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.630
it's easy to say that you're
not good at moderation,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.820
but I also don't
respect moderation.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.530
As a matter of fact, if
you're good at moderation,

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.650
I don't like you.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.570
I think you're a boring asshole.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.050
The only things
we brag about are

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.450
things that do not have
to do with moderation.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.110
No one brags about taking a
casual walk up a grassy slope.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.490
They brag about
climbing Everest.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.040
And I realized that all
the people I admire,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.240
all the people I look
up to, are people

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.560
who do not do moderation.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.270
So I started sniffing around
to try to find some way

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.290
to lose the weight crazy.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.550
And so all the stuff they
say to insult people who

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.420
lose a lot of weight
quickly, like it's a fad diet

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.420
or it's this or that, was
exactly what I was looking for.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.476
I wasn't looking to just do
a little bit of something.

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:12.350
I was looking to do
something really intense.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.190
And into my life-- not into
my life, but a friend of mine

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.139
showed up again about the
day before Thanksgiving.

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:21.930
He showed up again.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.280
His name is Ray Cronise
I call him Cray-Ray,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.410
because he's nuttier
than a shit house rat.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.580
And he used to work at NASA.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.020
He worked with astronauts.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.189
And he's the one that took
me up in the Vomit Comet

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:36.105
when I got weightless.

00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:38.680
So he's always been involved
in taking weight away from me.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.710
Well, actually, not
the real Vomit Comet.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.800
We actually set up what I think
now was in an illegal bootleg

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.720
Vomit Comet.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.080
All I know is that on the
manifest when we took off,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.030
it was an Air
Mexicali cargo plane.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.800
Which doesn't seem
too official for NASA.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.690
And it was at a little
kind of stupid airport.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.040
And also on the
manifest, the two people

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:15.020
listed as mission specialists
were me and Billy Gibbons of ZZ

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.520
Top.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.330
We were the brains
of the outfit.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.790
So when you've a magician
and a blues guitar player

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.900
together in charge
of an aircraft,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.170
you know you've got trouble.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.360
But we did the parabolas
went weightless for a while.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.190
And that was Ray
Cronise, who, as matter

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.179
of fact, when I was
on the Vomit Comet,

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.899
and when I realized I was gonna
go weightless-- I think I share

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:43.440
this with everybody--
the first thing

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.420
you think when you're
going to be weightless

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.950
is, boy, if I'm going
to be weightless,

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:53.490
I have got to strip naked and
sing the Barbarella theme.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.920
Especially if Billy Gibbons is
there to play guitar, right?

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.670
Because, as we all know,
Barbarella, the '60s film,

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.492
Jane Fonda strips
naked while weightless.

00:09:04.492 --> 00:09:05.950
Now, she's not
actually weightless.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.480
See, here I am being that
skeptic, exploding those myths.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.730
She's not actually weightless.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.480
She didn't shoot like Apollo 13.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.040
You know, she didn't
have Ron Howard doing it.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.570
She just was on a piece of glass
in Hollywood, rolling around.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.450
But I wanted to see
if I could strip naked

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.540
like Jane Fonda in zero G.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.360
So Billy played guitar, and I
went Barbarella-- and they're

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.280
kind a little bit
surprised that I was

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.080
going to actually strip naked.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.020
But if you look at my
resume, I'm not one to bluff.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.900
So I was not only zero G,
but I was zero G naked.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.090
And then I also-- as it's
called the Vomit Comet,

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.340
I also vomited.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.180
And at that point, I had
hair down my back, and curly

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.280
and messy in zero G. So
I not only vomited naked,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.730
but also vomited
naked into my hair.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.390
And the person who
was videotaping that

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.800
was my buddy
Cray-Ray, Ray Cronise,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.220
who also set up the
illegal Vomit Comet thing.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:14.210
So he came back into my life
that Thanksgiving of 2014.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.180
And he had been doing about
five years of research

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.990
with a bunch of real
academic people about really

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.100
extreme weight loss.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.942
And they discovered a few
things that were really,

00:10:25.942 --> 00:10:27.900
I would say counterintuitive,
but I don't think

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.330
they're counter-intuitive.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.360
I think they actually
are intuitive.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.850
They're just kind
of counterculture.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.620
They found out a few
things, that the faster

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.770
you lose weight, the more
likely you are to keep it off.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.660
And they also found that
radical changes in diet

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.190
were actually easier
for people to adhere to

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.340
than moderate ones.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.700
And they had been taking
people through this program.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.890
Now, they'd done very few
studies at this point.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.210
They'd done about 300 or 400
people they'd put through this.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.580
And as we all know
statistically,

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.200
a few hundred people
means nothing.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.900
So the information
that you're getting--

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.810
what's weird about my book,
this stupid popular book

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.250
by a comedian came out before
the real science studies,

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.390
which will be coming
out in a year or two,

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.030
because I'm one of the
early people doing it.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:23.690
So I actually got out into the
forum, into the public eye,

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.060
before the real scientists.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.430
So all this stuff will be
backed up and then torn apart

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.830
by peer review after that.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.710
Of course, my book is
also peer reviewed,

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.310
but I'm a Vegas performer.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:39.975
So my peer is Carrot Top.

00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:42.540
So Carrot Top looked over
the science in the book

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.690
and says it's OK.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.680
But what Ray did for
me was he first of all

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.430
did two weeks on a mono diet.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.250
Now, this is why when I
was on Good Morning America

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.310
they put Penn's potato diet
on the chyron underneath me.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.060
It's a little bit of
an oversimplification

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.757
but a little bit interesting.

00:12:02.757 --> 00:12:03.840
They put me on a monodiet.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.340
Now, the monodiet
could be anything.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.590
The monodiet could be rice.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.792
It could be corn.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:11.370
It could be beans.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.780
But we chose potatoes.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.250
And we chose potatoes
because they're funny.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.286
So for two weeks I ate
nothing but potatoes.

00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:21.660
Sweet potatoes,
regular potatoes,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.590
but not anything
added or subtracted.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.640
Which means not microwaved
and cut up so they lose water,

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.780
and with the skins
and everything.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.240
I ate potatoes for two weeks.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.690
And what that does that's
really interesting is,

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:39.220
it resets a lot of the
psychological and physiological

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.240
parts of eating.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.300
Because it takes away
eating as entertainment.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.940
Because eating potatoes
is not entertaining.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.650
It takes away the social
aspects of eating.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.540
Because nobody calls you
up and goes, hey, Penn.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.530
I just got into Vegas.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.680
Let's go have a potato.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.120
At least it didn't happen to me.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:04.160
And so after two weeks
of just potatoes,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.730
I first of all lost a
huge amount of weight

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.370
and also felt better.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.050
Day three and four, hell.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:15.980
Because you get really lethargic
and sad and have no energy.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.770
And then day five, you're
just bursting with energy.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.500
I just felt fabulous
for the whole rest

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.750
of the time, the whole rest
of the time I lost weight.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:28.590
Was about three months
I lost over 100 pounds.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.650
Then I went to a very limited
diet, but not just potatoes.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:40.260
And the first day after
my two weeks of potatoes,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.120
I had corn on the cob.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.230
And the crazy thing was I've had
corn on the cob my whole life.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.720
But I had it after
two weeks of potatoes,

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.430
it actually seemed
to me like candy.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.190
It was just so
sweet and so salty

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.480
and to actually taste food
that I've eaten my whole life

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.320
but without the butter, without
the salt, without the shit,

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.090
was just amazing.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.630
It tasted so good.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.540
And you just had two weeks,
just two weeks, just two weeks.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.130
No time at all.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.550
So much of me changed.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.800
Foods that I didn't like to
eat before I was fine with.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.790
Turns out, at least
from stuff I've

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.917
been reading, that all of the
food we eat is just habit.

00:14:25.917 --> 00:14:27.000
There's nothing but habit.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.510
There's no sort
of natural desire.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.330
You eat what you were
brought up eating.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.540
Grilled cheese sandwiches
are a comfort food

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.760
because they were given
to you as a comfort food

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.240
and you got used to it
for no other reason.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.120
So after that two
weeks, I ended up

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.950
on the diet I'm on now,
which is no animal products.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.650
I don't say that I'm vegan,
because I'm wearing a leather

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:57.920
belt. But I don't eat animal
products, no refined grains,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.110
and extremely low
salt, sugar, and fat.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.410
And after about
three months of that,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.070
your microbiome changes, and
you don't have the cravings.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.410
I mean, what I said
to Cray-Ray was

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.200
am I going to be able to
eat these foods that I love?

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.600
Am I going to be able to
have pizza, and hamburgers,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.400
and that kind of stuff?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.000
And Cray-Ray said,
well, you know,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.280
what really matters about food
is what you eat chronically,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.290
what you eat daily.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.050
No one gets fat from
one meal, and no one

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.920
gets healthy from one meal.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.610
So sure.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.260
When it's rare and appropriate,
on special occasions,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:39.620
on holidays, or with special
friends, eat whatever you want.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.910
And I did that after I hit
my target weight, which

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.210
was on my birthday.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:51.110
So I was in the hospital
October 31st, 2014.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:16:00.200
On March 5th, 2015,
I was 229 pounds.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:08.270
Now, from 330 pounds
we predicted 229 pounds

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.270
that we would hit
on my birthday.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:15.810
We hit it one day before my
birthday to the exact amount.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.670
Which to me is much more
impressive than NASA

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.140
hitting Jupiter.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.160
Because it's done
by an idiot, which

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.580
you have to grade on a scale.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.799
And then about two
weeks after that,

00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:31.590
I went out and had a
rare appropriate meal.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.381
And I went and ate
everything in the world.

00:16:33.381 --> 00:16:36.020
I ate French fries and
hamburgers and chocolate

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.850
desserts and all that stuff.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.370
And what amazed me
was, it was good,

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.444
but it wasn't like
falling off the wagon.

00:16:43.444 --> 00:16:45.860
It wasn't like this is the way
I was going to eat forever.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.864
It wasn't like I had
no control over it.

00:16:48.864 --> 00:16:49.860
It was just like, OK.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.870
That's a fine thing.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.000
And what's happened
is it's now been--

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.010
and this is important
to keep in mind,

00:16:55.010 --> 00:17:00.450
because the magic number on
weight loss is two years.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.140
Two years, you're down
to 1% of the people that

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.420
keep the weight off.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:11.040
Two years is kind of magic
in weight loss science.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.810
And I'm now at 17 months.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.416
17 months I have
kept the weight off,

00:17:18.416 --> 00:17:20.290
and it doesn't feel like
it's coming back on,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.650
but I don't want to exhibit
too much hubris on this.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.631
I'm still careful.

00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:25.880
But I realized-- and this
was just the past week, just

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.859
the past week.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:32.940
I realized that I have no more
cravings whatsoever for meat

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.150
at all, even though I'm due
for a rare inappropriate,

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.170
I can eat anything I want,
the idea of eating chicken

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.710
is repulsive to me,
fish I don't want

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.820
to have at all, steak and
hamburgers went later,

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.660
but I still have
no desire for them.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.980
Probably the next time
I eat whatever I want,

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.020
it'll be a hunk of chocolate,
maybe some spaghetti, maybe

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.330
a cookie.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.820
It's gotten so, so easy.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.890
And what I found is,
doing stuff that's

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.710
really intense and
hardcore when you have

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.610
a real difference in feeling
is so much easier than doing

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.410
stuff that's half assed.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.080
Also, and nobody
knows about this,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.570
I mean, so I can talk
very freely about this,

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.030
because no one
will contradict me,

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.770
because nobody knows jack
shit about the microbiome.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.107
This is a whole
new area of study

00:18:23.107 --> 00:18:24.190
they'll get to in a while.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.050
But it sure seems like after you
don't-- I'm going to use some

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.230
technical terms here.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.910
So try to stay with me.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.240
After you've not
eaten meat and stuff

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.720
for a while, the cooties
that live in your guts that

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.120
eat meat and fat and
that kind of stuff,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.550
those cooties, they die.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.160
And then the cooties
don't send stuff

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.160
to your brain that
makes you crave them.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.080
That's the way I understand it.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.930
And I know that some
of the scientists

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.560
out are not using
the word cooties,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.540
but that's seems like
the exact right word.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.480
But there's magic
in the microbiome

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.720
as far as I can tell.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.070
And after you change the
way you eat for long enough,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.380
things inside you change.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.671
So this is what happened to me.

00:19:03.671 --> 00:19:07.620
And what surprised me probably
the most, and the thing I'm

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.110
most embarrassed about, about
this whole thing, is I'm

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.660
an atheist.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.790
I'm a hardcore atheist.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:19.290
And I certainly don't believe
in a mind-body separation.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.930
I certainly don't
believe there's

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.690
any sort of soul or
anything supernatural.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:29.370
I believe we are computers
made of meat and nothing more.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.160
And yet, there was
some part of me

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.140
that seemed to not believe that.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.410
Because when I was
really fat, I really

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.070
thought there was some
homunculus inside of me that

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.140
was driving this
big fat machine,

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.216
and that my mood and my
personality, and who I was,

00:19:51.216 --> 00:19:55.650
was somehow different than the
body that I carried around.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.780
And one of the things that
embarrassed me, and shocked me,

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:05.060
and surprised me was
after I lost 110 pounds,

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.240
I really was deeply
and profoundly happier.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.950
And my mood was really
better all the time.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.750
And I enjoyed things more.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.120
And I didn't really expect
that to be the case.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.720
I expected that when I
played with my children,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.430
I enjoyed being
around my children,

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.810
and although it took a little
more energy to get going,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.101
I still wanted to be with them.

00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:32.940
I didn't expect to be happier,
and kinder, and just nicer.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.410
I mean, not to Teller,
but to everyone else.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.200
And it really made this huge
difference in my personality.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.080
And I remember going
back to the Vomit Comet.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.080
What people don't talk about
when they're being weightless,

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.210
when they're doing
this, is that in order

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.750
to do the physics
to be weightless,

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.007
when you're doing
this, you're at zero

00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:02.460
G. When you go back
up, you're about 2 G.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.320
And what I remembered
from that going on there

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:13.820
was when you're doing
these things physically,

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.370
and the physics of that
are doing that, you also

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.600
do the same thing emotionally.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.140
And there's this
nutty thing that

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:27.620
happens when you're on the Vomit
Comet, when you go weightless,

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.660
you get really,
really, really happy.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.530
There's a euphoric feeling.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.770
I read before I went
on the Vomit Comet

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.040
that once you're weightless,
you can dream weightless.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.770
And I didn't really
know what that meant,

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.810
but there's a feeling
I got during those.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:49.370
I did, I guess, 26
30 second moments

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.810
of weightlessness,
which I guess if you had

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.090
that up is about 12 minutes.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:22:01.390
And you really feel that,
and you can remember it.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.450
And sometimes when
I'm dreaming now,

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.870
I dream that I'm floating
around, which I never

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.270
was able to do before.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.390
And now I feel that.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.890
And a lot of people have talked
about that, all the guys that

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.590
shot "Apollo 13" talked
about that feeling of being

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.390
weightless.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.480
But what I've never
seen anybody talk

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.147
about was the feeling I
had when going back up.

00:22:22.147 --> 00:22:24.230
Because at that point, I
weighed about 300 pounds.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.540
It means going back up
I weighed 600 pounds.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.830
And you do this real
incredible mood shift.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.910
Because when you
go to 600 pounds

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.880
the depression that came over
me in just that 30 seconds

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.430
was this huge wave.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.580
So you'd go back and forth
from euphoria to depression.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:47.150
So now it's been 17 months.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.130
Everything is better for me.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:55.430
As far as I can tell, there's
almost no willpower required.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:23:00.270
A huge amount of willpower the
two weeks, the potato weeks.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:04.330
A lot of willpower when you
first start eating carefully.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.840
But after about
five or six months,

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:13.240
as you jack into the habit,
and as your microbiome changes

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.570
and all of that, it gets
really, really easy.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:21.300
It's much easier to do stuff
that's really, really hard.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.060
It was much easier for
me to make a major change

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.190
than a minor change.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:30.540
Now, since I wrote the book,
and since I went through this,

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.700
a lot of my friends
came on board.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.130
And they're someone
that's keeping a tally,

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.310
one of the Penn and
Teller enthusiasts

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.820
has been watching people
claiming weight loss.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.000
This is the least
scientific thing.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.470
This is less scientific
than the cootie theory.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.900
Because people self-reporting
on Twitter and in email

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.712
is no information at all,
really, because we don't know.

00:23:55.712 --> 00:23:57.420
We don't know how many
of them are lying.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.250
Yes, we do.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.830
100% of them are lying.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.190
We don't know how
much they're lying,

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:07.360
but it looks like
about 16,000 pounds

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:12.290
people have lost,
they claim, inspired

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.990
by what Cray-Ray has been
talking about on this diet

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.020
and stuff.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.730
And it's been a really,
really wonderful thing.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.000
I got a zillion
other things to say,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.130
but I always like to
open up to questions.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.213
Anybody has any questions?

00:24:27.213 --> 00:24:28.160
And also on anything.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.940
It can be on anything you want.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.640
I mean, we can't
really be done until I

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.964
mention Trump, but go ahead.

00:24:35.856 --> 00:24:37.141
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] weeks.

00:24:37.141 --> 00:24:38.266
PENN JILLETTE: What's that?

00:24:38.266 --> 00:24:39.230
AUDIENCE: How much potatoes?

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.260
PENN JILLETTE:
How many potatoes?

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.280
The question is,
"how many potatoes

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.529
did I eat in those two weeks?"

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:44.916
I didn't keep track,
but I started out

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:47.540
talking to Cray-Ray going, "you
mean I can eat as many potatoes

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.040
as I want?"

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.170
He goes, "sure sure, as
many potatoes as you want."

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.170
What happens if I eat
a shit ton of potatoes?

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.590
Well, it turns
out, even when you

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.435
throw in sweet potatoes
and all kinds of potatoes,

00:24:59.435 --> 00:25:00.560
you get pretty sick of 'em.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.580
By day three or
four, I was having

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.900
two or three potatoes a day.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.985
The first few days it
was probably five or six.

00:25:06.985 --> 00:25:08.443
I don't really know
how many I ate.

00:25:08.443 --> 00:25:09.526
I didn't keep track of it.

00:25:09.526 --> 00:25:12.770
I didn't really intend
to document this at all.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.450
So I didn't really get on board
with the keeping track of this

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.330
till a little bit too late.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.785
Oh, now there's a
microphone and everything.

00:25:17.785 --> 00:25:18.285
Go ahead.

00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:19.194
Ask something.

00:25:19.194 --> 00:25:20.610
AUDIENCE: Well,
the first question

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.810
is if the microphone works.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.190
I think I got the
answer to that one.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.650
PENN JILLETTE: Sure.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.025
AUDIENCE: The
second question is,

00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:27.100
the dedication page of
your snazzy new book

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.435
just has three numbers on it.

00:25:28.435 --> 00:25:29.560
What do those numbers mean?

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.976
PENN JILLETTE:
Those three numbers

00:25:30.976 --> 00:25:33.142
are the weights of my
wife and my two children.

00:25:33.142 --> 00:25:34.540
AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.280
Thank you.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:35.740
PENN JILLETTE: I
thought since it's

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.365
a book about weight, that's the
way I should do the dedication.

00:25:38.365 --> 00:25:40.310
So that's their
weight at that time.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.780
I believe my wife is lighter,
and my son and daughter

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.280
are heavier.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.190
But then again,
they're 10 and 11,

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.757
so they should be
getting heavier.

00:25:48.757 --> 00:25:49.590
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:56.686
So my question is that I saw the
dramatic change on "Fool Us."

00:25:56.686 --> 00:25:58.310
And the first thing
that occurred to me

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:03.360
was all the sleight of hand,
all that stuff is so practiced.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.870
Did that have an effect?

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.180
Did you have to relearn where
things are on your body?

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.200
PENN JILLETTE: Yes!

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:09.970
Completely.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.440
The weird thing, and this is
something I was so afraid of,

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.850
I started out as a
juggler, not as a magician.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.860
And when I first did
all the weight loss--

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.670
I should also say.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.660
This is a really important
thing that I just

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.690
left off-- during the time
I was losing weight, no

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.850
exercise whatsoever.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.430
As little exercise as possible.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:31.560
You want to exercise.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.490
You need to exercise.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.690
You need to be active.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.890
But not until you're
at target weight.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.929
Because bodybuilding
and losing weight

00:26:39.929 --> 00:26:40.970
conflict with each other.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.370
They're fighting
the same things.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.342
So I didn't exercise for the
whole time I was losing weight.

00:26:45.342 --> 00:26:46.800
But as soon as I
hit target weight,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.171
I started exercising again.

00:26:48.171 --> 00:26:49.920
And what was really
interesting about that

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.090
was that once I
started exercising,

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.220
health and muscle
came back so fast.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.320
It was just really creepy.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.160
I mean, three or four
weeks of pushups and they

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.060
were just increasing
this huge amount.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:08.580
But the other thing was, when
I first hit target weight,

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.240
I really couldn't
juggle for shit.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.660
I'd lost all this--
the muscle memory

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.870
had changed with a
different sized body.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.580
Now, that came back
very, very quickly.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.520
But it was probably
a week or two

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.230
that I had to practice
pretty heavily to get back

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.302
to where I was.

00:27:26.302 --> 00:27:31.490
That wasn't so much true for
the minor muscular movements,

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.050
for just hand movements
and so on, but certainly

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.520
for my bass playing, for all
the stuff that's kind of big.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.730
My voice also changed.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.730
No one seemed to
notice it, but when

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.900
I was in the middle of
doing a different audio book

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:51.220
for a friend of mine, and
we went back to do pick-ups

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.510
and couldn't do them.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.580
I had absolutely lost
the voice I had before.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.070
It's hard to
describe what I lost.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.190
It lost a different
kind of texture.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.350
Also in a movie I was
doing at the time,

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.350
we couldn't go back
we do pick-ups.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.705
We had to reloop the
whole scene if we

00:28:06.705 --> 00:28:08.020
were going to change my voice.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.360
Otherwise, you'd
hear me punching in.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.090
It also changed the
way I move on stage.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.810
And it changed the
way I did comedy.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.270
It changed the way
I address people.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.890
There was something--
when I was 300 pounds,

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:27.930
I mean, this is a pun,
but it's also true,

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.930
there was a certain
kind of gravity

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.980
in just being able to
state something standing

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.930
on stage the size of a doorway.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.770
I mean, I'm six foot seven.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.730
And when I was 330
pounds at six foot seven,

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:40.990
you're just a presence.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:42.810
You're a sculpture.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.530
You're just this big blob.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.660
And I found out that
when I was lighter,

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.960
in order to get the
same points across,

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.230
there was more movement.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.140
It was just a
different way I stood.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:01.170
Also, the suits we wear in
the show, the Penn &amp; Teller

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.827
suits, the matching
suits, couldn't keep up

00:29:03.827 --> 00:29:04.660
with my weight loss.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.890
We had tailors coming in
every couple of weeks.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.130
But it was really hard
to change my clothing.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:14.340
And although when you
watch a Penn &amp; Teller show,

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.090
we hope you're thinking that
there are no costume changes,

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.030
there are actually costume
changes on every single bit.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.630
What we do is that the
suit coats we're wearing

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.280
are gimmicked.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.030
I mean, gimmicked to the tits.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.810
Not just secret
pockets, but things

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.810
that drop things out
of here, and things

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.790
that drop out of our sleeves,
and poles, and rubber bands,

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.280
and all this stuff that
makes the magic work.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.800
Because we don't really
have magic powers.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.060
So we had to go through and do--
I mean, one of the things when

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:51.330
we're doing our show,
we run off stage,

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:55.759
do a complete suit coat change,
change our vests, run back on,

00:29:55.759 --> 00:29:57.550
and the audience just
thinks we stepped off

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.200
to get a drink of
water or something.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.290
So we do hidden costume
changes in our show.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.000
And all of that wardrobe
had to be changed.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Also, if anybody is interested
in PR, Glenn Alai, who's

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.410
our manager and PR person
standing in the back there,

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.510
the long suffering
Glenn, Glenn had

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:20.360
to go through selling a
Broadway show of Penn &amp; Teller

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.220
when one of the stars
of the Broadway show

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.950
didn't look like what
all the advertising said.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:30.270
Actually, it's much more
complicated than this,

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.310
but one of the things
that happened on Broadway

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.200
was when you were
going into the theater,

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.550
all the pictures were fat Penn.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.397
Because you wanted people
to come up to see fat Penn.

00:30:39.397 --> 00:30:40.980
And when you were
leaving the theater,

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.422
all the pictures
were skinny Penn,

00:30:42.422 --> 00:30:43.880
because that was
the Penn we wanted

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.200
you to see in the future.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.660
So I was really
surprised by the fact

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.710
that my juggling skills
changed and had to be adjusted.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.520
And I was also just
surprised at how much

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.750
just movement difference
and mood difference and all

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.250
of that.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.710
It's a much bigger deal.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:03.660
And of course some of
this, it's not just--

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.840
it may even be the most minor
point may be the loss of fat.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.980
Because the lack of salt,
and oil, and refined grains

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.980
in my diet, nobody
knows how much

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.990
change that is, but certainly
for my blood pressure,

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.000
the salt was a huge thing.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.710
It also changes your
mucus membranes.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.200
That changes a lot of the voice.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.220
The voice change may
be more salt than mass.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:29.970
I just don't know.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.010
I mean, we don't
have a control group.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:36.830
We don't still have fat
Penn to compare me to.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:41.335
AUDIENCE: Let me just--
that's very disconcerting.

00:31:44.932 --> 00:31:47.768
So I just wanted to say first
that your magic acts are

00:31:47.768 --> 00:31:49.760
indistinguishable from magic.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.254
PENN JILLETTE: Thank you.

00:31:51.254 --> 00:31:54.990
AUDIENCE: And some of my
coworkers are of the opinion

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.012
that I kind of eat crazy
because I eat Soylent.

00:31:57.012 --> 00:31:58.470
PENN JILLETTE: Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:59.590
AUDIENCE: Do you have
an opinion on Soylent?

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.381
PENN JILLETTE: Yeah,
I was very interested.

00:32:01.381 --> 00:32:03.830
Before I started this diet,
I was fascinated by Soylent.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.695
I mean, I always
wanted human chow.

00:32:05.695 --> 00:32:08.260
I always wanted to
just be able to-- like

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.410
they have monkey chow.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.929
I even tried eating monkey
chow, and then a girlfriend

00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:13.970
said she'd never fuck me
again if I ate it again,

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.230
so I stopped.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:21.360
But yeah, Soylent, the only
thing I have against Soylent

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.890
is I just don't trust our
science where it is right now.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.970
In theory, I think
that certainly all that

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.830
could be synthesized and
done properly in theory.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:39.070
I just know that one of
the problems-- and this

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:42.930
is so counter what I would
have thought-- but my diet

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:46.960
before, when I would
eat everything, anything

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:53.090
I came across, my diet
was very, very limited.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:57.090
I ate really fat, sugar.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.460
You know, there's not
any very much difference

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.399
between a pizza and a hamburger.

00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:04.440
There's not very much
difference between brownies

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.110
and a pizza and a hamburger.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:10.010
You've got all this same
stuff going in all the time.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:14.440
What I find now is eating
the huge amount of vegetables

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:19.690
I eat-- I mean, the amount
I eat now is unbelievable.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.270
I mean, the salads I
eat are like that big.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.636
One of the things is,
I get bored eating,

00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:25.760
because I'm eating so much.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.150
I just eat forkfuls
and forkfuls of salad

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:30.820
with just apple
cider vinegar on it.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.180
No oil, no nothing.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.060
And the different
kind of food I eat,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.420
it's so, so varied that
I really feel like I'm

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.770
getting many more nutrients.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.440
And I just don't know if
we know enough right now

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.364
to be able to pick all those
nutrients, all those vitamins,

00:33:47.364 --> 00:33:48.780
put them into
something like that.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.380
But boy the idea is seductive,
just to make it simple.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.494
Also, I need to do this.

00:33:55.494 --> 00:33:57.160
I probably shouldn't
announce this here,

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.284
because I'm not sure of it.

00:33:58.284 --> 00:34:02.509
But I imagine I'll be
winning a Nobel Prize.

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:03.008
I know.

00:34:03.008 --> 00:34:04.420
I know.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.390
I'm excited about that.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:10.120
Stockholm has not
called yet, but I

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.659
got the greatest idea
human beings have ever

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.210
gotten for a food.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.130
And I'm going to
give you a recipe.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.960
And I can say with a
great deal of pride

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:22.120
that I made this recipe on
Dr. Oz's show and damn nearly

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.620
fucking killed him,
which would have

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.230
been a real plus
for medical science.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.344
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:29.344 --> 00:34:30.469
Here's what you want to do.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.920
And this is rich guy food,
because it's expensive.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.449
But it's so worth, and
you're going to love it.

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:39.340
You take blueberries
and blackberries.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.510
You know those
containers like that big?

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.060
If you buy them
at Asswhole Foods,

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.260
they're like $7 or something?

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:52.420
You take like six of those
containers, maybe eight.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.070
I mean this is this many
blueberries and blackberries.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.929
That many.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.020
And you wash them
off really good,

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.946
in case they've
been near Chipotle.

00:35:01.946 --> 00:35:03.950
And you get those really clean.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:05.867
And you dry them
off a little bit,

00:35:05.867 --> 00:35:07.200
but leave them a little bit wet.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.320
That's OK too.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.140
And then you take
cayenne pepper.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.640
Oh no.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.530
No, don't you laugh.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:19.390
Oh, when you try this, you'll be
feel so stupid for your laugh.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:22.760
Cayenne pepper, and you put
on too much cayenne pepper.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.300
And you look down and go,
"oh Jesus, that's too much."

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.460
Then put on more.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.490
And then you go, "oh fuck.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.490
I've lost my mind.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.110
It's gonna burn my ass forever."

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.456
Then a little bit more.

00:35:32.456 --> 00:35:33.190
OK.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.030
Because the best thing is,
this will keep your children

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:38.820
and Doctor Oz away from it.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:44.650
Then you take cocoa powder,
just really bitter cocoa powder.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:47.470
No sugar, no fat,
no nothing in it--

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.360
just the raw,
bitter cocoa powder,

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.760
bitter like a jazz
musician at 3:00 AM.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.890
And you put much
too much on there.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.180
And then you shake it up.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.170
And if you do it naked,
it'll look better.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:04.600
You shake it up so you've got
cayenne, and you've got cocoa,

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.250
and you've got blueberries
and blackberries.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.450
And you don't do raspberries,
because raspberries

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.250
will fuck you.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.030
Raspberries, they get
too mushy, and also they

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.850
get moldy before
they really should.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.170
So fuck you, raspberries.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:19.220
You taste good.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.560
You taste good,
but not that good.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.140
OK?

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.840
Too good looking
to be fun to fuck.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.820
That's what raspberries are.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.994
Stay away from the raspberries.

00:36:27.994 --> 00:36:28.770
Fuck them.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.950
Assholes.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.700
But blueberries
and blackberries,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.970
pretty safe, pretty safe fruits.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.680
You mix them up like that, and
when you first bite into it,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.060
it is fabulous.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:45.472
It is like a flourless
chocolate Mexican rapist.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.380
OK, it's just the greatest
thing in the world.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.450
Now, you're going
to say, "haha, Penn.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:55.760
That's really stupid.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.170
That many blueberries?

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.620
That much cayenne?

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.040
That much cocoa?"

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.290
You're going to write me
a tweet, I guarantee you,

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.620
some of you will say,
saying, "you're right.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.590
Stockholm should be calling.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:10.730
Nobel Prize for these hot,
spicy, chocolaty good."

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.210
And you'll never even
want chocolate cake again.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:14.710
This is the thing
you'll be craving.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:19.400
I sometimes eat that big
bowl of blueberries, cayenne,

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.260
and chocolate like twice a day.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.530
And you feel great.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.390
And you can even eat too much
of it so you're too full.

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.920
And then in five minutes,
you don't feel bad.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.692
It's not like eating
four steaks or something.

00:37:31.692 --> 00:37:32.900
You feel really, really good.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.760
So keep that in mind.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.676
You don't have to write
it down, but make sure

00:37:35.676 --> 00:37:40.486
when you put the cayenne on,
don't be a wimp about it.

00:37:40.486 --> 00:37:43.110
And then when you think it's too
much, a little bit more again.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.697
Someone else have a question?

00:37:44.697 --> 00:37:46.280
That question, by
the way, had nothing

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.680
to do with the blueberries.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.800
I just wanted to bring that up.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.730
PHIL: I'm pleased
to introduce today--

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:53.790
I have a working mic now.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.040
PENN JILLETTE: OK, OK, OK, OK!

00:37:56.629 --> 00:37:58.920
PHIL: No, anyway, thank you
very much for coming today.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.020
We really appreciate it.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.810
PENN JILLETTE: Oh, that
was the last question?

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:00.610
PHIL: Yeah, that was
the last question.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:01.630
Thank you very much.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.963
PENN JILLETTE: Oh no, he's got--

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.822
PHIL: He did, but--

00:38:08.822 --> 00:38:10.530
PENN JILLETTE: There's
a revolution here.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.660
PHIL: Yeah, it's a
time issue and all.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.130
AUDIENCE: I heard
something about--

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.236
PENN JILLETTE: No, no.

00:38:24.236 --> 00:38:26.820
Trump-- the rules
of "Apprentice,"

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.440
the rules of "Celebrity
Apprentice" are Donald Trump

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.900
throws off the show
anyone he wants to.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.450
So there is no way that anything
that happens on "Celebrity

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.740
Apprentice" can be unfair.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.010
There are no rules to the show.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.050
I mean, I don't know.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:46.150
I'm not a good chess player,
but I can tell you the rules.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.420
I'm not a good poker player.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.760
I can't play Texas hold'em,
but I can tell you the rules.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.720
There are no rules to
"Celebrity Apprentice."

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.810
A guy just decides who
goes home and who stays.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.590
So anybody who tells you
there's something unfair

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:00.980
being done-- I'll also say
in defense of "Celebrity

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.970
Apprentice," I mean, without
getting too "Rashomon" on this,

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:10.550
I believe that the
portrayal of what happens

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.750
is fairly accurate.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:17.150
I mean, they've got 12
cameras running 20 hours a day

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:18.460
in several different rooms.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.810
They can add anything
they want, but the story

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.840
they tell on that show was
consistent with the story

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.350
I experienced.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.570
Really, all the bullshit
and conspiracy things

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:31.150
you hear about reality
shows are kind of jive.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.010
People really are that
fucked up and stupid

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.470
and they just film it.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.100
So yeah, I guess I don't
get any more questions.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.460
So good night!

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.280
Drive safely!
