BRADY HARAN: Hey there,
everyone.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.920
Today's video is about
Richard Feynman--

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.040
a lot of people's favorite
scientist--

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.770
and safe breaking.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.670
But I just wanted to point out
at the start that most safes,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.020
or secure filing cabinets,
actually have one dial.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.410
And if you've got a three
number combination, for

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.860
example, you'll turn that dial
in one direction, then the

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.490
other direction, and then back
in the other direction.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.140
And that's how you open it.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.720
But the mock up that we've
used in this video--

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.080
and it is a mock up,
I can assure you.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.720
It's about as far from a
safe as you could get.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.500
We've used three dials.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.110
That kind of makes things a bit
more visual, a bit easier

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.490
to understand looking
at it in that way.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.780
But in most cases, the sort of
safes we're talking about will

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.380
actually be using one dial.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.910
I don't want to get all the safe
enthusiasts out there too

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.080
fired up and angry in the
comments section.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.560
But for now, here's Professor
Bowley with his pretend safe

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.520
and the story of Richard Feynman
and his World War II

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.210
safe cracking.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.500
PROFESSOR ROGER BOWLEY: I'm
talking about Feynman and how

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.580
he managed to crack safes when
he was working on the atomic

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.060
bomb project in Los Alamos
in the early '40s.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.170
His wife had died.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.580
So early in the 1940s,
his wife died.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.020
And he was stuck in the
middle of Los Alamos,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.470
not able to get out.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.620
It was a sort of desert
area around there.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.450
He was stuck with lots of other
theoretical physicists.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420
So he needed something
for amusement.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.900
And as a hobby, he tried
cracking open all the safes in

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.280
Los Alamos.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.800
Now, they had new, purpose built
safes with locks on them

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.720
made by the Mosler
lock company.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.230
You can imagine 100 numbers
for this, 100 numbers for

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.980
that, 100 numbers for that--

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.270
a million, a million
possible settings.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.480
And if you fiddle them around,
it'll take about five

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.310
seconds to do it.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.380
So if you tried to crack
it, it will take

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.830
you about 60 days.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.800
On the average, it'd be 30 days,
but 60 days if you screw

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.210
up and it takes the last
one to open it.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.150
Well, Feynman was
a group leader.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.990
So he was given one of these in
his office to keep all the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.110
top secret files that he
might come up with.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.700
So he knew how this worked
mechanically, because he

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.660
fiddled around with it.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.199
He'd just fidget
with anything.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.200
He wanted to know
how it worked.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.060
And he found by trial and error,
suppose the number

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.910
should be 20, it was set at.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.920
Actually, it started at 25,
and a lot of people didn't

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.450
change it from 25, naught, 25.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.680
That was the default.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.040
And if he wanted to crack the
safe, a lot of times, people

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.080
left it in the default setting,
because it's the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.400
easiest one to remember.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.510
Suppose he set it at 20.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.110
Now, he found that if he tried
to set it at 20 and it opened,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.920
he could also set it to 21
and it would open, or 22.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.480
There was some slack on this.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.700
This was not mechanically
perfect.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.540
So there was a bit of tolerance,
plus or minus 2 on

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.290
every single number, which meant
that if you set it at

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.070
20, it could be 21 or
22 or 19 or 18--

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.100
and the same for this dial and
the same for this dial.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.090
So now, if you go through all
the combinations, you only

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.890
have to do 3, 8,
13 and so on--

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.360
every fifth one--

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.730
to make sure you
cover them all.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.160
Now, there are only 20 settings
for this, 20 for

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.430
that, and 20 for that.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.380
So automatically, that's gone
down, oh, I can't do it.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.630
Can you do it in your
head, Brady?

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.040
It's really quite difficult.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.520
8,000 different settings--

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.130
now, that becomes doable
mechanically.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.240
It will take you something
like 10 hours

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.540
working solidly overnight.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.910
And you could do it.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.930
And he could do that.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.010
He worked out how to do it.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.560
He found out other ways
of doing this.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.970
He found that most people
will set a birthday, an

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.260
anniversary, some well-defined
date that--

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.500
I don't know, the Independence
Day in the United States of

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.230
America, whatever.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.740
And it would not be an ordinary
number, because if

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.300
it's going to be, say, my
birthday, which is the 21st of

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.550
April if anybody wants
to send me presents.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.340
There's the 21st.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.100
04--

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.310
04 is there.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.620
And I'm born in 1946,
which is down there.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.810
So for the top one, which is the
days of the month, there

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.190
are typically 30 days
in a month.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.250
So let's suppose there are
just 30 and never 31.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.890
30 days in the month, you would
need to set it in six

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.669
different positions.

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.710
Now, for the months, there's 12
months in the year, so you

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.140
may need not two, but
three for that.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.850
So now, we've got six settings
here, three settings there.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.670
And for the year--

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.160
well, now, the year, if it's
some date, it's going to be

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.510
something in the past.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.590
So how long back in the past
is somewhat arbitrary.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.450
But suppose 45 would do,
and then it would be 9.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.980
He was doing it 1942
or '43 or '44.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.390
All right.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.800
So the test would be somewhere
around there.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.890
So 45 is a natural number to
look at, because then you

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.890
don't have to go back into
the previous century.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.880
6 for this one, 3 for this
one, and 9 for that one.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.980
And you multiply
them together.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.690
And you get out 162.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.420
So that's 162 different
settings.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.678
Five seconds for each, 162--

00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:12.060
that's 800 seconds.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.230
It's about 12 minutes.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.690
So he could go in and if
somebody had chosen one of

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.640
those dates, instead of having
8,000, he's got 162.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.960
And he can do it
in 12 minutes.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.260
On the average, it will be six
minutes, because he might be

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.630
reach it in the first
go or he might

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.370
reach it after 12 minutes.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.030
But he would only require
12 minutes.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.770
So he would go in and make a
big fuss of going into the

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.000
office and say, I'm not going
to show the secrets.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.200
These are top secret stuff.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.890
I don't want everybody
to know my secrets.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.360
And he'd carry in a bag with
tools-- screwdrivers, picks,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.070
all sorts of things that people
would think you crack

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.300
safes with--

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.990
shut the door, and in 12
minutes, he would do it.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.250
He'd take a magazine
in with him.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.810
Sometimes, he'd get it done
straight away and he'd do some

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.320
exercise and wait for 20 minutes
just to make everybody

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.380
believe it was tough
work doing this.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.560
And then he'd come out with a
bit of sweat on his brow,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.110
saying, that was hard work.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.290
So those were the main
techniques that he used.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.530
162 means that this isn't safe
and using your birthday or

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.020
anniversary is not safe.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.870
But after that, he learned
another trick.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.910
And he got the number
down to 20.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.470
Out of all these million,
there were 20.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.240
And it turns out that if you
open the safe and leave it

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.910
open, and there's a little
draw on the bottom.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.710
And he goes into somebody
else's office.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.750
He chats to them.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.680
And the safe is open.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.040
He fiddles with all the knobs.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.640
And after two years of practice,
he got these two

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.810
sorted out by fiddling around
with the knobs when the safe

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.440
was open in somebody
else's office.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.340
He'd go back afterwards--

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.870
and they don't realize he's been
doing this-- and writes

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.155
down these two numbers
in a little book and

00:07:00.155 --> 00:07:01.040
says such and such.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.170
So by the end of the
war, he could go

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.590
into anybody's office.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.980
He's got the last two numbers.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.370
There are 20 settings.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.380
It takes him a minute
and a half to open

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.840
the safe, or less.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.080
So he really has
to spin it up.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.240
He has a reputation
of safe cracking.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.900
And everybody thinks he knows
how to use picks.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.437
But he's just used human nature,
the tolerance of all

00:07:22.437 --> 00:07:27.000
this, and deviousness, just
to show how clever he was.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.575
He was doing it just to show
how clever he was.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.290
He was obnoxious.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.090
He would like to be one
up on everybody else.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.180
But there was a security
problem there.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.290
And the guy who he shared a room
with was the guy who gave

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.580
the secrets of the bomb
to the Russians,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.690
which is Klaus Fuchs.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.475
He was a roomie of his.

00:07:54.475 --> 00:07:56.410
BRADY HARAN: But for all his
showing off about safe

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.192
breaking, it turns out
the real spy was in

00:07:58.192 --> 00:07:59.710
the room with him.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.470
PROFESSOR ROGER BOWLEY: Yes.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.310
But I don't--

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.020
well, yes.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.360
When you look at this, now that
we live in worlds where

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.180
you have a little security
code for everything, this

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.950
seems unbelievably primitive--

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.030
phone hacking and everything
else going on.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.340
But people weren't-- if you're a
scientist, you're not really

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.610
looking at the other guy next
door and wondering whether

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.020
he's letting all your
secrets out.
