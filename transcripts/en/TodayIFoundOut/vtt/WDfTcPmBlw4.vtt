the scene where he kicks the helmet by the

pyre in Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers,
thinking Marry and Pippen were dead.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.000
Because of his realistic cry of anguish after
kicking the helmet and breaking his toes,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.460

shots using 70 different camera angles.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.580
The entire movie only took six weeks to shoot,
however, that one shower scene took just over

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.810
1 week to complete.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.540

shots from 70 camera angles get you?

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.140
Only 45 seconds of footage that made it into
the film.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.930

the biggest stars we all know and love, but

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.900
to the show.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.820
At the time, it was called “The Flagstones.”
and was intended to be a show for adults,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.820
not kids.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.979
In fact, the first two full seasons of the
show were sponsored by Winstons, a cigarette

company.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.270

Chaplin’s body was stolen on Christmas day

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.509
in 1977, by two mechanics.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.420
They thought they could get money from his
family in exchange for his body.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.590
However, the two grave robbers were captured
eleven weeks later and Chaplin’s body was

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.590
recovered.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.351
To stop this from happening again, Chaplin
was buried under 6 feet of concrete the second

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.700

“It’s a Wonderful Life” was partially

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.200

on the riverboat, Sunflower.

9)“Play it again, Sam” was never said
in Casablanca.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.640
Furthermore, although many attribute the adapted
version to Bogart, the closest thing to it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.390
comes from Bergman’s character, Ilsa, who
says, “Play it once Sam… for old time’s

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.390
sake….

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.390
Play it, Sam.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.700
infant garment which takes the form of a diaper
including, on its outer side, a sealed, but

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.630
openable, moisture-proof pocket which contains
one or more clean-up wipers.”
