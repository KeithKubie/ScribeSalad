00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.354
I want to tell you all about a piece
of American history

00:00:17.378 --> 00:00:18.528
that is so secret,

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:24.868
that nobody has done
anything about it for 167 years,

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:26.094
until right now.

00:00:26.456 --> 00:00:30.433
And the way that we're going to uncover
this vestigial organ of America past

00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:31.743
is by asking this question:

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:33.422
Why?

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:35.690
As we all know --

00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:37.717
(Laughter)

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.315
we are in the middle
of another presidential election,

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.902
hotly contested, as you can see.

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:42.926
(Laughter)

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.034
But what you may not know
is that American voter turnout

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:49.759
ranks near the bottom
of all countries in the entire world,

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.631
138th of 172 nations.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:54.804
This is the world's most famous democracy.

00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:57.078
So ...

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.306
Why do we vote on Tuesday?

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.916
Does anybody know?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.586
And as a matter of fact,
Michigan and Arizona are voting today.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.858
Here's the answer:

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:12.995
Absolutely no good reason whatsoever.

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:14.020
(Laughter)

00:01:14.044 --> 00:01:15.194
I'm not joking.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.590
You will not find the answer
in the Declaration of Independence,

00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:21.633
nor will you find it in the Constitution.

00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:24.906
It is just a stupid law from 1845.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.127
(Laughter)

00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:32.961
In 1845, Americans
traveled by horse and buggy.

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:34.761
As did I, evidently.

00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:37.948
It took a day to get to the county seat
to vote, a day to get back,

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:41.427
and you couldn't travel on the Sabbath,
so, Tuesday it was.

00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:46.259
I don't often travel by horse and buggy,
I would imagine most of you don't,

00:01:46.283 --> 00:01:48.602
so when I found out about this,
I was fascinated.

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:51.544
I linked up with a group called,
what else -- "Why Tuesday?"

00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:54.302
to go and ask our nation's
most prominent elected leaders

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:56.380
if they knew the answer to the question,

00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:58.522
"Why do we vote on Tuesday?"

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:03.310
(Video) Rick Santorum: Anybody knows?
OK, I'm going to be stumped on this.

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:05.194
Anybody knows why we vote on Tuesdays?

00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:08.201
Jacob Soboroff: Do you happen to know?
Ron Paul: On Tuesdays?

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:10.416
JS: The day after the first
Monday in November.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.290
RP: I don't know how that originated.

00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:15.268
JS: Do you know why we do vote on Tuesday?
Newt Gingrich: No.

00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:17.208
Dick Lugar: No, I don't. (Laughter)

00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:19.690
Dianne Feinstein: I don't.
Darrell Issa: No.

00:02:19.714 --> 00:02:23.112
John Kerry: In truth, really,
I'm not sure why.

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:24.383
JS: OK, thanks very much.

00:02:24.407 --> 00:02:27.250
(Laughter)

00:02:27.274 --> 00:02:29.686
JS: These are people
that live for election day,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.996
yet they don't know
why we vote on that very day.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.333
(Laughter)

00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:36.542
Chris Rock said,
"They don't want you to vote.

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:39.177
If they did, we wouldn't vote
on a Tuesday in November.

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.652
Have you ever thrown a party on a Tuesday?

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:42.931
(Laughter)

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:45.210
No, of course not. Nobody would show up."

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:48.271
(Laughter)

00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:49.456
Here's the cool part.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.830
Because we asked this question,
"Why Tuesday?"

00:02:51.854 --> 00:02:54.039
there is now this bill,
the Weekend Voting Act

00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:56.302
in the Congress
of the United States of America.

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:59.399
It would move election day
from Tuesday to the weekend,

00:02:59.423 --> 00:03:01.633
so that -- duh -- more people can vote.

00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:06.133
(Applause)

00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.838
It has only taken 167 years,

00:03:08.862 --> 00:03:12.397
but finally, we are on the verge
of changing American history.

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:13.591
Thank you very much.

00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:16.976
(Applause)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.168
Thanks a lot.

00:03:18.192 --> 00:03:20.675
(Applause)
