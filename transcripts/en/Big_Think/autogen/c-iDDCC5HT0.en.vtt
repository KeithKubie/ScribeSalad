perception and you look at the research
is that we can be influenced as

is that we can be influenced as
 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.890
is that we can be influenced as
perceivers by stereotypes that we don't

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
perceivers by stereotypes that we don't

you know how our interaction is probably
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.730
you know how our interaction is probably
gonna go the problem of course is that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
gonna go the problem of course is that
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.240
gonna go the problem of course is that
every stereotype is a generalization the

there they're just they're just
absolutely unnecessarily negative and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
absolutely unnecessarily negative and
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.200
absolutely unnecessarily negative and
completely untrue and yet we are

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
completely untrue and yet we are
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.819
completely untrue and yet we are
affected by them because again that's

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
affected by them because again that's
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.010

that that the activation of stereotypes

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
that that the activation of stereotypes
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.690
that that the activation of stereotypes
in the mind is odd relatively automatic

for example I'm a female scientist and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
for example I'm a female scientist and
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.850
for example I'm a female scientist and
there are stereotypes about women not

being is capable in science and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
being is capable in science and
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060
being is capable in science and
mathematics so I like to get right out

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
mathematics so I like to get right out
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.609
mathematics so I like to get right out
in front with people and you know show

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
in front with people and you know show
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.740
in front with people and you know show
them demonstrate my expertise in science

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
them demonstrate my expertise in science
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.080
them demonstrate my expertise in science
and math and so that that I can counter

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
and math and so that that I can counter
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.550
and math and so that that I can counter
that stereotype before it has a chance

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560

accurately the the best way to do that
 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.530
accurately the the best way to do that
are to get that person to work with you

are to get that person to work with you
 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.710
are to get that person to work with you
in some way or to get that person to to

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720
in some way or to get that person to to
 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.559
in some way or to get that person to to
to to notice that you can help them

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569
to to notice that you can help them
 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.690
to to notice that you can help them
reach their goals that's another really

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700
reach their goals that's another really
 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.520
reach their goals that's another really
great way to get people to to kind of

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530
great way to get people to to kind of
 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.920
great way to get people to to kind of
get past the initial assumptions and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930
get past the initial assumptions and
 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.660
get past the initial assumptions and
really take a second look at you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670
really take a second look at you
