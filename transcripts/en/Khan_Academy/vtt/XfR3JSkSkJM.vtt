00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.170
In the depreciation video, we
saw that if a company had to

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.730
buy some equipment for its
factory, let's say at the

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.060
beginning of 2007, just based
on the cash that went out of

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.970
the door, there might have been
this temptation to say,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.950
OK, in 2007, we had an
equipment expense.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.200
EQ expense.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.540
And they could have just
wrote, let's say that

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.060
equipment cost $50,000.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.940
So they would have just put a
$50,000 expense right in 2007.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.770
I write it as a negative number
just because I like to

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.450
remember it's an expense,
although normally people just

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.406
write it as a positive expense,
but I always like to

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:40.340
put a negative for an expense
to know that it's going to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.980
subtract from your revenue.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.080
So they would put that cash
expense there in 2007.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.760
And then in future years, maybe
2008, 2009, 2010, they

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.070
would have no expense until
maybe they had to replace that

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.550
machine or buy a new one.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.795
And we saw that that is one way
to account for things, but

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:03.180
it really doesn't reflect the
reality of the business.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.810
The fact that this machine right
here that cost $50,000

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.030
is used for-- in this example,
in the depreciation video, it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.120
was usable for two years.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.390
Let's say in this example, it's
usable for four years.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.970
So what they do is, instead of
just expensing the cost of the

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.220
machine, when the machine is
bought on the balance sheet at

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.390
the beginning of 2007, they
say, we now have an asset

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.745
called a machine.

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:31.900
I'll just call it
M for machine.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.450
That's $50,000 at this point
right here, right when we

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.150
bought the machine.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.760
Remember, balance sheets
are snapshots in time.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.720
And then instead of having an
equipment expense, instead of

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.800
having that expense, they'll
have an equipment

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.050
depreciation expense.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.300
And the difference here is
instead of saying that the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.240
entire expense was that machine
in just the first

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.470
period, they're saying no,
we're using some of the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.700
machine in that period.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.110
And let's say we do a
straight-line depreciation,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.460
which means we essentially
depreciate the asset evenly

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.949
over its lifespan.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.130
So in this case, we're assuming

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.600
it's a four-year lifespan.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.860
So let me draw that out.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.420
So the asset should linearly
go to zero

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.350
over these four years.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.720
So essentially, in the
first year, our

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.830
expense would be what?

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.000
It's $12,000.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.130
If you divide $50,000
by 4, it's $12,500.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.040
It would be minus $12,500 in
each year, depreciation

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.340
expense, and we would account
for it on the balance sheet.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.500
Because remember, income
statements are just telling

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.320
you how do you get from one
balance sheet to another.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.830
So expenses reduce the
value of your assets.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.960
So, for example, in this one,
at the beginning of the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.950
period, before the 2007
income statement, the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.600
asset was worth $50,000.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.710
We depreciated $12,500 from it,
so at this point in time,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.020
the balance sheet as of the end
of 2007 or the beginning

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.780
of 2008, we're going to say
that our machine is now

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.370
$12,500 less, so $47,500.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.160
And then at the end of 2008,
beginning of 2009, our balance

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.230
sheet under the assets, the
machine, if they gave us that

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.550
level of granularity, would
be $12,500 less than that.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.350
So that's what? $37,500.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.240
So then the machine
is $25,000.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.900
And then another $12,500
on the books.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.960
It'll say the machine
is worth $12,500.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.960
And then at the end of
2010, it'll say the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.550
machine is worth nothing.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.390
And if we did our depreciation
schedule right, or if the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.630
lifespan of this machine really
is four years, then

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.990
it's time to go buy another
machine and start doing this

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.730
all over again.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.430
This is all a review of the
depreciation video.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.500
Amortization is the exact same
thing, but it deals with

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.790
intangible assets.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.870
What's an intangible?

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.560
It's something you can't see,
touch, feel, smell, eat.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.670
Obviously , a machine you can't
do all of those things

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.279
to it, but you can at least
touch it and possibly smell

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.399
and taste it.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.740
So an intangible asset, we can't
do any of that stuff to,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.790
but it's the exact same idea.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.720
For example, let's say we are
some type of widget company.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.460
And let me write down
the years: 2007,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.090
2008, 2009 and 2010.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.400
And let's say that if we just
did it from a cash point of

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.090
view, let's say we had
to buy a patent in

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.810
order to make our widgets.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.200
So we could have said, oh, we
have to buy a patent expense.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.940
We had to buy a patent
from some

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.680
brilliant inventor someplace.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.000
We could just say, oh,
you know what?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.240
The patent cost $4,000.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.800
So we could just put that there
even though the useful

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.130
life of the patent might
be four years.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.640
And so it doesn't reflect the
fact that we still are using

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.260
that patent in these years, and
we just take the hit here.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.160
So this income will look
unusually low, while these

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.860
will look unusually high.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.830
It's not reflective of the fact
that you're using this

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.540
patent that has four
years left on it.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.660
So instead of doing that, what
you do is, at the beginning of

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.360
the period you say, we have
acquired a patent, an asset,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.000
that is worth $4,000, And then
every year over the life of

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.950
the patent, we'd amortize a
fourth of it since it has a

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.900
four-year life.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.760
So it would be patent
amortization.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.620
And there's all sorts of
intangible assets that you

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.740
might amortize.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.820
And amortizing really just means
spreading out the cost

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.400
of this asset, just like
depreciation was spreading out

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.880
the cost of a physical asset.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.070
So patent amortization would be
$1,000 in this year, $1,000

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.450
in this year, $1,000 in this
year, and $1,000 in this year.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.180
And then our snapshot, or our
balance sheet at the end of

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.030
2007, will have on its
assets a patent

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.280
that's now worth $3,000.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.930
And at the end of 2008,
it'll have a patent

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.395
that's now worth $2,000.

00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:24.040
The end of 2009-- I think you
get the point-- you'll have a

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.760
patent worth $1,000.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.530
And at the end of 2010, probably
because the patent is

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.430
now expired and anyone can go
out and produce whatever that

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.170
invention that was patented
without having the patent, we

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.400
then say that the patent
is worthless.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.570
And a very relevant thing is if
you were a drug company and

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.550
you were buying the patent to
some pharmaceutical that had

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.320
four years left so that you
could have exclusive rights to

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.430
develop that drug. and at this
point, all of a sudden, now

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.030
anyone can develop the drug, so
that patent is worthless.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.410
So the balance sheet is really
trying to capture what your

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.170
asset is worth at that
point in time.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.290
At this point in time, your
patent is arguably only worth

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.870
$1,000, because you paid $4,000
for four years, and now

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.150
you only have a year left.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.520
But that's all amortization
is.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.770
Nothing fancy.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.050
Really, in my mind, it's very
similar to depreciation.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.340
Depreciation is tangible.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.760
Amortization is intangible.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.940
It could be patents, it
could be licenses.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.290
It could be fees associated
with the financing.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.530
Let's say you have some debt
that you took from a company,

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.690
and the debt is going to last
for 10 years, and you had to

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.010
pay a one-time lump-sum
to the bank.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.020
Well, that one-time lump-sum fee
should probably be spread

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.760
over the life of the debt, so
you would amortize that

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.470
expense over its life.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.750
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
