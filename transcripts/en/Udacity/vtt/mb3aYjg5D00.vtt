00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay. Let's see. Here's the factor in all three pairs.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The potential energy is just the sum of

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:17.000
K&lt;i&gt;Q1&lt;i&gt;Q2 over this distance plus Q1&lt;i&gt;Q3 over this distance plus Q2&lt;i&gt;Q3 over this distance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, if we plug in our numbers,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Q1 is +2, Q2 is -3, and Q3 is +4, we find that the answer is -9&lt;i&gt;10ยนโฐ J.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, a very interesting question is where is this energy stored.
