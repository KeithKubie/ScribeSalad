00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.260
This movie...

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.700
I mean it's...

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.359
it's really fucking-fuck-fuck! Okay. I apologize -FUCKFUCKFUCK! Okay,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.660
I'm really sorry. It's just

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.769
Man this a bad one. I mean just saying the title of this movie pisses me off. That's how bad it is.  Watch.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.569
A Troll in Central -Fuck this movie!    A Troll in Central Park!

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.659
I mean talk about pandering to your kids and not having any respect for their intelligence

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.149
Often considered Don Bluth's worst film this movie doesn't even seem like a real kids movie

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.890
It seems like a parody of a kids movie

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.259
You know on a show when you see kids watching TV

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.099
and some over-the-top nonsense is playing that obviously nobody put any thought into?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.650
You know because it's in the background and nobody needs to pay attention to it? Yeah imagine a whole movie like that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.340
Just a complete waste of time that has nothing to offer

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.160
I don't care if it's innocent and cutesy, it's a piece of shit with no constructive creativity that any audience member can see.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.950
I had to sit through it, now you're gonna sit through it. Let us venture through, A Troll in Central Park

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.020
God!

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.369
So at first you think the movie is going to be kind of cool. There's these dark

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.279
backgrounds, some neat looking monsters. This awesome looking creepy place is known as the Kingdom of Trolls.   And then

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.750
our main

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.639
character appears. His name is Stanley and the only way to describe him is imagine Bilbo Baggins just ate the Lucky Charms

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.699
leprechaun and got shit out through Dopey's anus. And that's the nice version. [I'm just a sweet William, uh

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:46.979
I mean, Stanley, to do it.] He's voiced by Dom DeLuise. Imagine, Dom DeLuise in a Don Bluth movie. It turns out

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.799
he has a magic green thumb that can make precious,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.009
beautiful flowers appear. The only downside is that flowers aren't allowed in the Kingdom of Trolls.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.590
[Say, what was that? *laughs*]

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:05.579
Oh, I'll have to hide the uncontrollable fear of losing my mother.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.809
[I thought I saw one of them, um um um, flower things. Oh well, have a rotten day!]

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.190
[*sings* I'm a bad troll. A very bad troll]

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.490
Okay.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.289
This is what happens when you let your five year old write the screenplay. And then the troll says, "I'm at bad troll."

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.210
Oh, that's good, son!  And then the troll said I'm a bad troll. I have to go potty.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.449
Oh, even better! And then he says, "I have to go potty."

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.020
No really, I have to go potty. Oh uh, yeah, uh, go ahead. Go. Go potty.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.680
Still a good line though.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.930
So Stanley goes to his house and oh

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.580
God, as if Hobbits couldn't get any gayer. [You know, Violet, what this garden needs is a big rosy posy, right there.]

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.369
But the other trolls suspect the pansy growing pansy, as they approach him outside. [For your crime

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.140
you are going before the number one flower hater in the land...

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.810
Gnorga!]

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.160
Isn't that weird name? It sounds like the sound you make when you sneeze and hiccup at the same time.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.740
[No face shall smile, no star shall glow.]

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.720
Boy, Lindsay Lohan really let herself go, didn't she?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.300
So she is the Queen of Trolls and spends most of her time

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.009
singing songs that would actually make Andrew Lloyd Webber sound original. [It feels delicious

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.329
to be so vicious, I'm Gnorga the Queen of Mean.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.009
I'm so animalistic to be cannibalistic. That is...random. I'm ballistic!

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.520
[He is kind. He is good. He is gentle and he is giving a bad name to trolls everywhere!

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.660
stone him!]

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.809
Oh, trust me, I think enough people involved this movie have been stoned already. [I won't have him growing any more of those things!]

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.559
Need I remind you? We are bad trolls!

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.119
So her husband recommends not stoning him, but rather banishing him to a place without flowers. [I know a place, rock and steel,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.839
nothing grows.  Why, it's a shoo-in for the tabloids.]

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.300
So, without even knowing where the place he's talking about is, she sends him directly there.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.760
Yeah, she sends him to the land of rock and steel where nothing grows in

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.000
Central Park, New Yor--Okay, did you guys even read your own script?!  There's flowers everywhere, you morons!

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.079
So he arrives in Central park (seriously, it's called a park,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.460
how can you not know flowers grow there?) as he's given the traditional New York welcome.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.750
[Hello]

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.750
[Zoom muthafucker, hey!]

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.649
So he runs around in, I guess what's supposed to be a chase scene, but it goes on forever.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.549
Come on Bluth, you're telling a story, not one of your Dragon's Lair games.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.540
So he finally ends up under a bridge, (get it? troll under a bridge, haha) as he decides to take rest in a giant bed of

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.379
marijuana leaves. Hey, I think I'm starting to see the inspiration for this movie.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:31.090
Okay, so we cut to two kids named Rosie and Gus and their parents, who for some reason, are played by Jonathan Pryce and Hayley Mills.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.629
Just listen to how well they hide their British accents.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.180
[You know I have an important case to prepare for. I have an open house on Park Avenue today.]

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.320
Sounds about convincing as House. *boos* Oh come on, it's obvious!

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.230
[The park will have to come later. It always has to be later. Why can't we ever do what I wanna do?

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:59.369
Your father works very, very hard to make our life nice, children. You have to learn to appreciate that.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.770
Yes, we all have to appreciate what we have. For example, I could have been the star of Saved by the Bell.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.230
I was the star of Saved by the Bell, yet for some reason I'm not the star of Saved by the Bell. Good Morning Miss Bliss, my fucking ass!

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.550
Sorry.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.009
So while you're probably wondering why two British parents raised non British kids,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.230
Gus puts a sign on the door to keep Maria the housekeeper out of his room. [Stay out, Maria!

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.290
Hey Rosie, want to go with me?]

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.739
Well, it does say, "privet, keps out', so I guess I better follow the directions.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.210
Okay, this is why there's a difference between a housekeeper and a babysitter. Didn't they teach you that in jolly old London?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.870
So the kids go down to Central Park where they get in all sorts of dangers

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.580
(thank you, Maria) as we listen to some of the brilliant dialogue that our writers came up with for Rosie.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.580
[Boat! Bug!

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.060
Butterfly! Flower! Hi!]

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.860
That's great, honey. Can you say these words as well? I knew you could

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.960
So Rosie finally stumbles upon Stanley as they partake in several minutes of undiluted filler.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:22.500
*happy music playing*

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.900
and...

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:29.959
This is pretty much it, people. Just a whole hour of watching things bounce and smile. That's the entire movie.

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:32.029
Don't believe me? Just keep watching.

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:37.720
*happy music continues*

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.580
*Much bouncing and smiling*

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.740
God, this is the equivalent of waving your keys in front of a baby's face. This movie is on par with keys.

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:59.209
Um, should he really react this way to a toddler kissing him?

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:05.809
I mean, if any people you knew reacted this way, especially in Central Park, I don't think you'd watch with charm at all.

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:07.800
I think you'd probably call the cops.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.020
[Oh please, tell me your name.]

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.800
[Rosie!]

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.940
[Rosie! Did you hear-

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:18.749
Rosie! Oh

00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:21.480
yes, I like that a lot.]

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.480
TELL A STORY!

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.280
Seriously, there's only so much whimsical pandering an audience can take. Do something of substance!

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.300
[*Beings to sing* I like to close my eyes...].

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.340
No, no, no, not sing. NOT SING.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:41.540
*continues singing*

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.680
Oh God.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.800
My Little Pony,  the Care Bears,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.100
Teletubbies, Cabbage Patch Kids,

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.820
the Smurfs, Barbie,

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.820
Pound Puppies, Rainbow Brite,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.820
Strawberry Shortcake, Barney the Dinosaur,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.340
all the High School Musicals, Jem,

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.400
and the goddamn Get Along Gang

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.100
are fucking butch

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.560
compared to this.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.660
Oh thank God, an interruption.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.300
[My boat!]

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.300
So Gus comes across the troll and can't believe his eyes.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.180
[I'm a troll!]

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.180
[And he's a good troll!]

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.240
[Talking flowers?

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.840
This is weird.]

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.400
THIS is weird?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.900
Uh uh, weird is when your alarm clock goes off like, five minutes early.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.400
This is an abomination of annoyance.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.600
So Gus wants to take Rosie away which causes her to start crying.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.300
This...somehow gets the attention of the Queen.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.500
[It's a baby crying!

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.440
She's all

00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:41.329
so miserable!]

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:44.100
There's probably millions of babies crying all over the world,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.100
but this one particular I want to hone in on!

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.300
[Hey, this is serious.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.220
Ah, step aside chumps,

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.980
I'll show yous how to make the kid smile!]

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.680
So because Rosie's crying seems to be the first big dilemma in this movie,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.680
the flowers try to cheer her up.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.480
[Come on, follow me

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.600
Oh boy!]

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:11.160
*happy music plays as flowers dance*

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.560
Oh my God, DO SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.600
I can't take this.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600
I really can't.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.600
This is the guy who directed The Secret of Nimh,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.380
one of my all-time favorite movies.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.040
How can he bring himself to such a fucking low?

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.780
I'll tell you how,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.980
it's that goddamn troll.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.620
Yeah, that fucking little troll.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.020
He's the cause of all this

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.080
and I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.000
[Hello, this is Stanley the troll.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.900
Happy happy happy.]

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.440
Stanley, how dare you destroy a great animator's career

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.320
with your mere existence!

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.740
[Oh, but I didn't Mr. Critic.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.640
I'm sharing all the good good good goodness

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.700
that came from flowers, sunshine,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.780
and animals that smile with their mouths open.]

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.860
Yeah, but couldn't you make something with a little more intelligence and charm to it?

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.820
I mean, this is so annoying.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.560
[But annoyance is part of my charm

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.980
I'm like that cute little puppy who barks a lot,

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.140
or a unicorn's horn shoved up your ass,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.380
or pancreatic cancer.]

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.480
Okay, look, I'm just gonna hang up.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.020
Obviously I'm getting nowhere with you.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.500
[Be sure to share lots of hugs!

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.940
Hugs hugs hugs hugs hugs!]

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.940
Oh God, there's more movie.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.680
Okay, so the Queen of Trolls finds out

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.500
that Stanley is still alive.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.120
So she decides to rip off Alice in Wonderland

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.660
and make Gus's tears literally cry him a river.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.680
[What's happening?!]

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.800
[It's Gnorga!

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.860
She's put a curse on you!]

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.620
But Stanley's green thumb actually makes

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.820
a larger boat

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.720
hi, how can he do that?

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.780
as they float on the river of tears.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.200
[How'd that happened?]

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.120
[You believed in saving your sister so much,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.600
your power was stronger than Gnorga's.]

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.540
But that still doesn't explain

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.520
where the fucking boat came from.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.319
[Anything that's real

00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:47.319
starts with a dream.]

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.140
[Dreams are silly.]

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.720
[No no, they're not!

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.560
Look Gus, see this boat?

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.380
This is no ordinary boat.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.820
This is a dream boat!]

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.320
Wait.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.380
So,  if you just dream that certain things will exist,

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.380
they'll just magically exist?

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.819
That's

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.860
nuts.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.200
You can't just DREAM for something to HAPPEN

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.980
and expect it to MAGICALLY HAPPEN.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.560
That's not how life works!

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.180
Hell,

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.240
if that was true,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.520
I would wish for waterfall

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.380
to drown those little bas-oh hey!

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.360
[We're gonna crash!]

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.620
All right!

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.620
Now I wish we had to crash and burn!

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.740
[No way!

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.400
This is my dream

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.400
and nobody gets hurt in my dreams.]

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.320
Son of a bitch

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.780
[Pretty pretty pretty, yes?]

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.280
Hey!

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.680
How come your dreaming is so much more powerful

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.580
than my dreaming?

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.960
[Oh, that's because I have

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.140
buttery butterflies,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.100
beautiful flowers,

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.360
and the wasted talent of ex-Disney animators.]

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.160
YOU ARE SCUM!

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.740
[I love you!]

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.480
So Stanley and the kids sail through a world of magic

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.760
literally done just through the power of dreaming.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.880
That's the only explanation.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.700
What are you trying to teach our kids, movie?

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.000
That if you just dream your dog will come back to life

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.720
or your parents will get back together?

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.480
Goddamn it.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.440
You need logistics and a system in place

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.820
to execute that vision!

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.340
This isn't pandering to your kids.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.020
It's simple LOGIC.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.920
Dreams don't happen by just

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.680
DREAMING

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.880
you make it happen.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.140
The phrase is, "follow your dreams"

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.140
not just dream alone

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.580
that makes no sense!

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.560
And sweet Jesus,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.400
this musical number is still going!

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.600
What's the point?

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.860
What's the purpose?

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.280
It doesn't further the story,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.080
it's not funny,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.600
It's not entertaining.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.100
WHY ARE YOU STILL ON?!?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.060
*musical number still on*

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.580
No. You know what?

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.540
I got it.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.360
I know what the intended audience for this was.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.260
This is for babies

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.660
who are high.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.500
No, no, pets who are high.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.580
No, no, pets' fleas who are high.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.320
No, no, you know what?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.320
This movie was intended for your wall.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.840
Just show it to your wall,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.680
and maybe possibly, it'll be entertained.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.660
But to be honest,

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.720
even that's doubtful.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.980
Here's the last wall that they showed the movie to.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.360
Should have rented Iron Giant.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.100
So everybody

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.860
sleeps,

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.860
because I guess it's the movie's nap time,

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.620
as Ganon's wife here decides to go down to Central Park

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.740
and destroy Stanley for good.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.460
So she obliterates all the trees as

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.140
nobody calls the cops about it

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.860
and the kids wake up to find that Central Park daytime is looking an awful lot like

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.400
Central park nighttime.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.800
Kids decide its time to go home

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.300
as they wander through the wasteland.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.180
Okay, I think the bikes ruined whatever

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.180
threatening effect you were going for there.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.740
[Hang on, Rosie!]

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.320
[Hang on!]

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.460
So after an annoying chase scene, the Queen captures Rosie

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.320
as Gus tries to get Stanley to help rescue her.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.960
[But what can I do?]

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.320
[What about all your powers, Mr. You Gotta Believe Green Thumb?]

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.560
Yeah, tell that Rice Krispie elf!

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.980
[My prestidigitation is no match for Gnorga's magic.]

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.860
[Oh sure! You're just saying that cause you're scared to fight her!]

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.880
Did he actually suggest that somebody have balls in this movie?

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.700
[I'd help you if I could, but I can't.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.680
She'll turn me into stone!

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.200
And I don't want to be rock-gnized.]

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.040
[You'll never have a dream come true

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.880
and you know why?]

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.340
Take your pick.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.720
[You're a coward!]

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.740
Good choice.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.200
So after Gus frees Rosie

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.200
from the cage that wasn't even locked,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.680
the Queen and her husband chase after the two

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.880
as she turns Gus into a troll himself.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.860
This sort of backfires though, as now he

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.100
has the power to turn people into stuff.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.280
Which begs the question: why did she turn him in the first place?

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.400
[Rosie!]

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.260
[Rosie!]

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.080
It's okay kid, all you have to do is dreeeeaaaaam!

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.880
Huh, I fail.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.440
So gee, I guess Rosie's really dead.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.440
They're not going to fake us out or anything, are they.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.020
So Stanley finally nuts up and tries to defeat the Queen.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.360
[What do we have here?]

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.200
So after they literally declare thumb wars,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.300
Stanley wins with his flower power.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.540
But I guess the Queen uses her power of controlling thumbs...

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.860
Yeah, that's one of her powers now,

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.620
to use Gus' thumb to turn Stanley into stone.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.520
Hurray!

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.660
Then the Queen turns into a rosebush

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.300
which causes her magic to wear off

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.760
and return Gus to normal.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.060
Which is weird because that would mean

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.720
Stanley would return back to normal as well-oh who cares.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.240
Our British parents return home for one more cameo

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.140
as we find out the moral of this story.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.040
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.420
there's a moral. Listen to this:

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.940
[You know, your mother and I,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.780
we've, uh, we've thought of a few

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.520
real fun things we could do today.]

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:38.020
[Dad, do you think today maybe we could do

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.020
what I want to do?]

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.100
Ah, so that's the slapped on, last minute lesson of this tale.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.720
If you don't get what you want,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.400
demand it more!

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.340
What a wonderful lesson for kids!

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.620
After all this was the boy who politely asked:

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.060
[Why can't we ever do what I wanna do? I wanna do what I wanna do!]

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.040
So I guess it only figures he should get a reward for being so patient.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.460
Blow me.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.960
So they go to the obliterated Central Park

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.960
as they place Stanley in the woods.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.460
Gus uses his magic thumb that he now has,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.660
(consistency, what's that?!)

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.900
as it appears to have no effect on him

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.580
until...

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.820
He's been taken up! He's been taken up! My king!

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.940
So Stanley comes back to life, the kids' parents

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.620
never turn around so I guess they never see him

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.980
and he rebuilds Central Park with his enchanted powers.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.020
Uh, okay, Stanley, going a bit too far now.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.340
Dude Stanley, what are you doing?

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.340
You're engulfing the entire city!

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.660
Oh my God, was this your evil plan all along,

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.140
to enslave the city to carnivorous plant life?

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.660
Stop it!

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.100
Would you team up with Poison Ivy?

00:19:07.109 --> 00:19:08.789
This is like supervillain stuff.

00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:11.200
The world's economy is gonna collapse because

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.520
New York has been overgrown by a giant hedge.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.380
Okay, so Stanley enslaves New York

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.400
because he can dream it, I guess and that's the end.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.300
Boy, was this a hard one.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.300
I mean, I love Don Bluth, but this was shit.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.509
You ever get stoned or drunk with a bunch of friends?

00:19:33.509 --> 00:19:37.500
And you are the first one to start sobering up and realize how stupid everyone was acting?

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.120
That's this movie.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.540
I mean it, I didn't even show you half of the pandering

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.180
or the pointless filler that this movie had.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.060
It has no atmosphere,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.580
the characters are annoying, the lessons are tagged on,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.300
and it just makes no sense.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.840
It's junk food. Brightly colored junk food for the mind.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:58.140
And I personally hate how it talks down to kids while offering virtually nothing in return.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.060
I mean, I don't mind mindless entertainment for kids, but it has to at least be entertainment.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.020
This is the kind of movie that thinks children will watch anything

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.020
and it really pisses me off.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.100
In fact, I'm going to call that obnoxious little troll one last time.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.440
[Posy posy, I love posies. Hello?]

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.580
Hey Stanley, you know, your movie inspired me greatly and uh,

00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:23.729
Yeah, and I finally realized that I think I can dream just as strong as you can dream.

00:20:23.759 --> 00:20:30.839
Maybe even I'll dream you. So um, I've a very special dream lined up for you right now. I hope you enjoy it

00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:35.488
[Oh, that's wonderful, Mr. Critic. I sure hope that it involves flowers and butterflies and

00:20:36.609 --> 00:20:39.959
excuse me, there, uh, appears to be a porcupine growing out of my anus.

00:20:40.509 --> 00:20:45.419
Wow, yes, that's incredibly painful actually yeah, oh, oh, yes, incredible amount of pain, huh?

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:52.580
Oh, oh well now is transformed into a tyrannosaurus rex. Hello Mr. Lizard, how are yo-Oh God!

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.840
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.900
I'm a bad troll!
