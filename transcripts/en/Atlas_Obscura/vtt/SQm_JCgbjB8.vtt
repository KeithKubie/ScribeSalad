00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.667
The world’s largest bioluminescent area

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:05.750
an area so big you can see it from space

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.000
went unknown to science until 2005

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.083
This was common sailor lore

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:22.083
that sometimes you would sail into these areas where the sea was white

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:25.750
and light was glowing up from below the ship

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.208
The reason scientists didn’t know about it

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:30.041
is that they didn’t think it was possible for that many micro organisms

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:32.792
to be in one place, doing something together

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:34.458
but they were wrong

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:38.542
So how did the milky seas finally get spotted by science?

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:40.417
 Well, Google helped 

00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:45.250
In 2005 a scientist named Steve Miller was musing over lunch 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.458
 whether it would even be possible for a light sensing satellite 

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:51.375
 to see bioluminescence in the ocean 

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:53.375
 he got home and he started Googling 

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.667
 He came across a 1995 report from the SS Lima 

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.792
 The exact words are 

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:03.625
 “The bioluminescence appeared to cover the sea horizon to horizon “

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:08.333
 Luckily for Steve Miller as he matched the report from the SS Lima 

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.667
 with the satellite data 

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:13.667
 a very clear image began to resolve 

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:18.458
  There was in fact a corresponding area of bioluminescence 

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:20.333
 that was enormous! 

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:24.500
 This was the first hard proof of the Milky Seas 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.001
 The bacteria they think causes the milky seas 

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.542
 is a bacteria called Vibrio Harveyi 

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:31.333
 it doesn’t want to scare off predators it wants to attract fish 

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.333
 because the place it wants to live is on the inside of a fish 

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:39.542
 So the amount of bacteria it would take to make a glowing area the size of Connecticut 

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:41.375
 is almost unfathomable 

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:48.250
 it is forty billion trillion bacteria 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.500
 if each bacteria were the size of a grain of sand 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.166
 the grains of sand would cover the earth ten centimeters deep 

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.333
 the whole earth, all of it 

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.458
 what causes this? The truth is they don’t know 

00:01:59.458 --> 00:02:01.709
 We don’t know yet how it forms 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.583
 we don’t know what the conditions are 

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:05.458
 But what we do know is that it does happen 

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.542
 and you know who else knew it? Jules Verne

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:11.375
 In 20,000 leagues under the sea he describes the SS Nautilus 

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:12.625
 coming across this phenomenon 

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:19.250
 It’s likely that Jules Verne used real ships logs to describe the milky seas 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.041
 while it may have taken science until 2005 

00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:26.001
 to find definitive proof of the milky seas 

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:31.625
 Jules Verne was eerily scientifically accurate in 1869

 Siri when was 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea published? 

00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:45.375
 The answer is one thousand eight hundred and sixty nine 

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:49.959
 If you have places you’ve traveled 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.291
that you thought were just the most amazing thing you have ever seen 

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.208
