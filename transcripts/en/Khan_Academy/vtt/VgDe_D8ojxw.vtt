00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.775
Welcome to the presentation
on solving inequalities,

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:06.890
or I guess you call them
algebra inequalities.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.120
So let's get started.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.500
If I were to tell you that,
well, let's just say x is

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.840
greater than 5, right?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.700
So x could be 5.01, it could be
5.5, it could be a million.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.680
It just can't be 4, or 3, or 0,
or negative 8, and actually,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.500
just for convenience,
let's actually draw that

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.970
on the number line.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.260
That's the number line.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.270
And if this is 5, x can't be
equal to 5, so we draw a big

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.400
circle here, and then we would
color in all the values

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.060
that x could be.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.510
So x could be just the small--
it could be 5.0000001.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.110
It just has to be a little bit
bigger than 5, and any of those

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.310
would satisfy it, right?

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.660
So let's just write some
numbers that satisfy.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.120
6 would satisfy it, 10
would satisfy it, 100

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.060
would satisfy it.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.640
Now, if I were to multiply, or
I guess divide, both sides of

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.700
this, I guess we could say,
equation or this inequality

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.000
by negative 1, I want to
understand what happens.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.360
So what's the relation between
negative x and negative 5?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.500
When I say what's the relation,
is it greater than or is

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.410
it less than negative 5?

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.530
Well, 6 is a value
that works for x.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.170
So negative 6, is that greater
than or less than negative 5?

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.810
Well, negative 6 is less
than negative 5, right?

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.665
So let me draw the
number line here.

00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:44.622
If we have negative 5 here, and
let's just draw a circle around

00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:47.450
it because we know it's not
going to be equal to negative 5

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.770
because we're deciding between
greater than or less than.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.500
So we're saying 6 works for x.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.580
So negative 6 is here, right?

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.880
So negative 6 is less than
negative 5, so is negative 10,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.330
so is negative 100, so is
negative a million, right?

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.920
So it turns out that negative
x is less than negative 5.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.540
And this is really all you have
to remember when you are

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.940
working with inequalities
in algebra.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.260
Inequalities, you can treat
them just the way-- a greater

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.050
than or less than sign, you
could treat them exactly the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.930
way you would treat
an equal sign.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.320
The only difference is, if you
multiply or divide both sides

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.290
of the equation by a negative
number, you swap it.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.850
That's all you
have to remember.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.290
Let's do some problems,
and hopefully, that'll

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.370
hit the point home.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.230
And if you ever forget, you
just have to try-- you just

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.770
remember this: if x is greater
than 5, well, then negative

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.840
x is less than negative 5.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.480
And keep trying out numbers.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.090
That's what's going to give
you the best intuition.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.650
Let's do some problems.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.120
So if I said that 3x plus 2 is,
let's say, less than or equal

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.820
to 1-- well, this is a pretty
easy equation to solve.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.540
We just say 3x-- let's subtract
2 from both sides, and when you

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.490
add or subtract, you don't do
anything to the inequality.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.180
So if you subtract 2 from both
sides, you get 3x is less than

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.150
or equal to negative 1, right?

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.730
And then, now we're going
to divide both sides by 3.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.690
We get x is less than or equal
to negative 1/3, right?

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.020
And notice, we didn't
change anything because

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.470
we divided both sides
by a positive 3, right?

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.270
We could have actually
done this equation in a

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.250
slightly different way.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.240
What if we subtracted
1 from both sides?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.270
So this is another
way of solving it.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.780
What if we said 3x plus 1 is
less than or equal to 0, right?

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.820
I just subtracted 1 from both
sides, and now let's subtract

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.920
3x from both sides.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.010
And we get 1 is less than or
equal to minus 3x, right?

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.180
I subtracted 3x from here, so I
have to subtract 3x from here.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.480
Now, I would have to
divide both sides by a

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.360
negative number, right?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.780
Because I'm going to divide
both sides by negative 3.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.170
So I get negative 1/3 on this
side, and based on what we had

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.060
just learned, since we're
dividing by a negative number,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.350
we want to swap the
inequality, right?

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.580
It was less than or equal,
now it's going to be

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.840
greater than or equal to x.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.480
Now, did we get the same
answer when we did it

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.520
both-- two different ways?

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.310
Here, we got x is less than or
equal to negative 1/3, and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.440
here we got negative 1/3 is
greater than or equal to x.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.110
Well, that's the same answer,
right? x is less than or

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.760
equal to negative 1/3.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.530
And that's-- I always
find that to be the cool

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.210
thing about algebra.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.500
You can tackle the problem in a
bunch of different ways, and

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.170
you should always get to the
right answer as long as

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.940
you, I guess, do it right.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.840
Let's do a couple
more problems.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.680
Oh, let's erase this thing.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.710
There you go.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.450
I'll do a slightly harder one.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:56.760
Let's say negative 8x plus 7
is greater than 5x plus 2.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.030
Let's subtract 5x
from both sides.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.540
Negative 13x plus 7
is greater than 2.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.300
Now, we could subtract
7 from both sides.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.780
Negative 13x is
greater than minus 5.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.180
Now, we're going to divide
both sides of this

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.050
equation by negative 13.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.720
Well, very easy.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.120
It's just x, and on this
side, negative 5 divided by

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.990
negative 13 is 5/13, right?

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.200
The negatives cancel out.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.382
And since we divided by a
negative, we switch the sign.

00:05:31.382 --> 00:05:33.750
x is less than 5/13.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.620
And once again, just like the
beginning, if you don't believe

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.930
me, try out some numbers.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.460
And I remember when I first
learned this, I didn't believe

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.780
the teacher, so I did try out
numbers, and that's how I got

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.690
convinced that it
actually works.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.020
When you multiply or divide
both sides of this equation

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.600
by a negative sign, you
swap the inequality.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.510
And remember, that's only when
you multiply or divide, not

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.700
when you add or subtract.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.630
I think that should give
you a good idea of how

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.350
to do these problems.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.160
There's really not
much new here.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.360
You do an inequality-- or I
guess you could call this an

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.450
inequality equation-- you do it
exactly the same way you do a

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.090
normal linear equation, the
only difference being is if you

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.270
multiply or you divide both
sides of the equation by a

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.250
negative number, then you
swap the inequality.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.810
I think you're ready now to
try some practice problems.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.300
Have fun.
