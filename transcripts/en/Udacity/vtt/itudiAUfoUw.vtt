00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.290
And the answer here, of course, is that if we had a polynomial time algorithm for vertex cover,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.030
then as we saw in the last unit we would also have a polynomial time algorithm

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.700
for independent set and we would have one for clique because as we found out

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.930
solving vertex cover on a graph is basically the same problem as solving independent set.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.340
And if you have a good algorithm or a polynomial time algorithm for independent set,

00:00:24.340 --> 99:59:59.000
then through an easy transformation of the graph you can also solve clique.
