uncertainty and doubt and what you do is

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
uncertainty and doubt and what you do is
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.929
uncertainty and doubt and what you do is
you spread fear that this knowledge

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
you spread fear that this knowledge
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.330
you spread fear that this knowledge
might lead to a government regulation

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
might lead to a government regulation
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.969
might lead to a government regulation
and that regulation might actually

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
and that regulation might actually
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.429
and that regulation might actually
conflict with your worldview the way you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
conflict with your worldview the way you
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.090
conflict with your worldview the way you
make of living and so you begin to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
make of living and so you begin to
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.410
make of living and so you begin to
reject it and you actually have you

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
reject it and you actually have you
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.940
reject it and you actually have you
muddy the waters by spreading

muddy the waters by spreading
uncertainty so if science says this you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
uncertainty so if science says this you
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.260
uncertainty so if science says this you
find someone else that might say

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
find someone else that might say
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.190

to interview that one in 5000 and then
 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.699
to interview that one in 5000 and then
you use fear and uncertainty to turn

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709
you use fear and uncertainty to turn
 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.069
you use fear and uncertainty to turn
what would be healthy skepticism into

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079
what would be healthy skepticism into

denial okay

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.780
denial okay
so here's some information this is the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790
so here's some information this is the
 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.780
so here's some information this is the
land and water temperatures around the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
land and water temperatures around the
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.629
land and water temperatures around the
world averaged around the world the

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:39.639
world averaged around the world the
 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.670
world averaged around the world the
first question is are these measurements

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680
first question is are these measurements
 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.410
first question is are these measurements
accurate was there bias in the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420
accurate was there bias in the
 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.729
accurate was there bias in the
measurements maybe you make more

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739
measurements maybe you make more
 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.890
measurements maybe you make more
measurements around cities which then

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900
measurements around cities which then
 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.720
measurements around cities which then
actually tend to raise the temperature

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730
actually tend to raise the temperature
 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.330
actually tend to raise the temperature
so on and so forth but this has been

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
so on and so forth but this has been
 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.940
so on and so forth but this has been
worked out over many many years 20 plus

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
worked out over many many years 20 plus
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.990
worked out over many many years 20 plus
years of challenges reassessments I just

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000
years of challenges reassessments I just
 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.050
years of challenges reassessments I just
want to remind you that this is a recent

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
want to remind you that this is a recent
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.849
want to remind you that this is a recent
phenomena we talked about the beginning

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859
phenomena we talked about the beginning
 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.000
phenomena we talked about the beginning
of the Industrial Revolution but most of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010
of the Industrial Revolution but most of
 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.080
of the Industrial Revolution but most of
this rise has been since 1976 now let's

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090
this rise has been since 1976 now let's
 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.770
this rise has been since 1976 now let's
talk about climate change this is some

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780
talk about climate change this is some
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.360
talk about climate change this is some
change in climate but if you look back

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370
change in climate but if you look back
 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.460
change in climate but if you look back
at the history and there are three

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
at the history and there are three
 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.699
at the history and there are three
graphs the bottom graph is the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709
graphs the bottom graph is the
 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.469
graphs the bottom graph is the
temperature where the extreme right hand

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479
temperature where the extreme right hand
 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.539
temperature where the extreme right hand
side is the present time and going

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549
side is the present time and going
 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.110
side is the present time and going
backward 800,000 years and look the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120
backward 800,000 years and look the
 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.930
backward 800,000 years and look the
climate is changing we are in a warm

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940
climate is changing we are in a warm
 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.330
climate is changing we are in a warm
stable period but before that there was

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340
stable period but before that there was
 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.460
stable period but before that there was
an ice age there was another warm stable

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470
an ice age there was another warm stable
 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.430
an ice age there was another warm stable
period only about one to one point two

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440
period only about one to one point two
 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.379
period only about one to one point two
degrees warmer than we are today

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389
degrees warmer than we are today
 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.920
degrees warmer than we are today
ice ages ice ages ice ages Neanderthals

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930
ice ages ice ages ice ages Neanderthals
 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.990
ice ages ice ages ice ages Neanderthals
roamed the earth at this period of time

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000
roamed the earth at this period of time
 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.300
roamed the earth at this period of time
Homo sapiens came at this period of time

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310
Homo sapiens came at this period of time
 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.890
Homo sapiens came at this period of time
and I can assure you based on a strong

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900
and I can assure you based on a strong
 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.530
and I can assure you based on a strong
faith that Neanderthals weren't

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540
faith that Neanderthals weren't
 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.920
faith that Neanderthals weren't
responsible for climate change but you

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930
responsible for climate change but you
 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.719
responsible for climate change but you
see the other thing methane carbon

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729
see the other thing methane carbon
 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.119
see the other thing methane carbon
dioxide there was no Industrial

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129
dioxide there was no Industrial
 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.009
dioxide there was no Industrial
Revolution there was no massive human

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019
Revolution there was no massive human
 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.770
Revolution there was no massive human
emission of carbon dioxide and you

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780
emission of carbon dioxide and you
 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.149
emission of carbon dioxide and you
noticed that there strongly correlated

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159
noticed that there strongly correlated
 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.490
noticed that there strongly correlated
so you can say well the climate is

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500
so you can say well the climate is
 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.969
so you can say well the climate is
changing

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979
changing
 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.270
changing
carbon dioxide cycles with temperature

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
carbon dioxide cycles with temperature
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.300
carbon dioxide cycles with temperature
so this is a natural phenomenon well is

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310
so this is a natural phenomenon well is

carbon dioxide and methane so we're

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560
carbon dioxide and methane so we're
 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.340
carbon dioxide and methane so we're
going off the charts so

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350
 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.860
this is the more recent past in the last

this is the more recent past in the last
 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.470
this is the more recent past in the last
10,000 years and then all of a sudden

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480
10,000 years and then all of a sudden
 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.150
10,000 years and then all of a sudden
the change looks a little bit funnier

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160
the change looks a little bit funnier
 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.580

there's a long stable period and all of
 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.410
there's a long stable period and all of

up and we're right now over here and you

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840
up and we're right now over here and you
 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.420
up and we're right now over here and you
look at the time scale over the last

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430
look at the time scale over the last
 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.110
look at the time scale over the last
10,000 years and you find out 3/4 of the

increase in carbon dioxide has occurred
 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.560
increase in carbon dioxide has occurred
over the last 65 years but it's more

over the last 65 years but it's more
 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.250
over the last 65 years but it's more
worried than that the rise in carbon

but how is it going down now in the
recent pass it turns out the dilution of

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:51.389
recent pass it turns out the dilution of
 

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:55.100

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.400
which was supposed to gain in mass was
actually losing a mass during this

period of time the yellow was gaining
 

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.900
period of time the yellow was gaining
mass but only in the first half of the

evaporation more snow in Antarctica but

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.130
evaporation more snow in Antarctica but
 

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.430
evaporation more snow in Antarctica but
Antarctica is cold so it should have

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440
Antarctica is cold so it should have

accumulated ice mass didn't surprise so

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540
accumulated ice mass didn't surprise so
 

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.710
accumulated ice mass didn't surprise so
we missed that and so I talked about the

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720
we missed that and so I talked about the
 

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.020
we missed that and so I talked about the
last warm period one degree warmer the

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:45.030
last warm period one degree warmer the
 

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.540
last warm period one degree warmer the
sea level was 69 meters higher that is

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:47.550
sea level was 69 meters higher that is
 

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.390
sea level was 69 meters higher that is
not a climate model that's a measurement

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:50.400
not a climate model that's a measurement

based on dating seashells that died
during that period of time

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:55.950
during that period of time
 

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.490
during that period of time
see she cell critters that live between

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500

land and ocean all around the world and
 

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.250
land and ocean all around the world and
so what's a little scary is we used to

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.260
so what's a little scary is we used to
 

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.900
so what's a little scary is we used to
think that would take many thousands of

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:05.910
think that would take many thousands of
 

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.140
think that would take many thousands of
years to come to this new 6 to 9 meters

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.150
years to come to this new 6 to 9 meters
 

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.170
years to come to this new 6 to 9 meters
higher the UN goal 6 to 9 meters higher

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.180
higher the UN goal 6 to 9 meters higher
 

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.560

sea level but now we're frightened that

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:15.570
sea level but now we're frightened that
 

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.720
sea level but now we're frightened that
it might take a hundred or 200 years and

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:17.730
it might take a hundred or 200 years and
 

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.460
it might take a hundred or 200 years and
so this is what

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:19.470
so this is what
 

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.390
so this is what
coming on all right now another final

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:23.400
coming on all right now another final
 

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.340
coming on all right now another final
claim and that is you know fossil fuels

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:28.350
claim and that is you know fossil fuels
 

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.350
