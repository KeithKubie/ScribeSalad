00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.780
to cut it into a petal form since we had
to make a ton of them we actually had a

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:19.790
to make a ton of them we actually had a
 

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.690
to make a ton of them we actually had a
little mold here to use you're gonna

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:22.700
little mold here to use you're gonna
 

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.310
little mold here to use you're gonna
have to cut off a little bit of the tip

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320
have to cut off a little bit of the tip
 

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.310
have to cut off a little bit of the tip
there no problem because it is gonna

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320
there no problem because it is gonna
 

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.530
there no problem because it is gonna
have to nestle inside itself and then

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:29.540
have to nestle inside itself and then
 

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.460
have to nestle inside itself and then
just kind of get yourself a petal shape

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:32.470
just kind of get yourself a petal shape
 

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.650
just kind of get yourself a petal shape
it helps to give yourself a little bit

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:35.660
it helps to give yourself a little bit
 

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.080
it helps to give yourself a little bit
of leeway because you're gonna fold them

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:38.090
of leeway because you're gonna fold them
 

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.870
of leeway because you're gonna fold them
over because petals are not straight in

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880
over because petals are not straight in
 

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.080
over because petals are not straight in
nature until eventually it'll look

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.090
nature until eventually it'll look
 

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.860
nature until eventually it'll look
something like that or I have another

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:47.870
something like that or I have another
 

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.230
something like that or I have another
one right here it'll look like that to

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240
one right here it'll look like that to
 

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.930
one right here it'll look like that to
make one flower you need three of these

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:52.940
make one flower you need three of these
 

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.840
make one flower you need three of these
so at the end when you open it up it'll

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:55.850
so at the end when you open it up it'll
 

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.930
so at the end when you open it up it'll
look like this basic flower template

00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:58.940
look like this basic flower template
 

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.900
look like this basic flower template
there you need three of them so on one

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:01.910
there you need three of them so on one
 

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.080
there you need three of them so on one
of them you cut out one petal so now

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:05.090
of them you cut out one petal so now
 

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.850
of them you cut out one petal so now
I've got one petal cut out of that one

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:06.860
I've got one petal cut out of that one
 

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.060
I've got one petal cut out of that one
there on another one which I've already

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:10.070
there on another one which I've already
 

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.090
there on another one which I've already
done you'll cut out two petals and then

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:13.100
done you'll cut out two petals and then
 

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.070
done you'll cut out two petals and then
guess what on the third one you'll cut

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080
guess what on the third one you'll cut
 

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.100
guess what on the third one you'll cut
out three petals so it's not that hard

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.110
out three petals so it's not that hard
 

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:22.150
out three petals so it's not that hard
okay with the bigger ones you have to

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:22.160
okay with the bigger ones you have to
 

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.820
okay with the bigger ones you have to
take the hot glue and just make it into

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:24.830
take the hot glue and just make it into
 

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.590
take the hot glue and just make it into
a circle basically

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600
a circle basically
 

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.169
a circle basically
gonna start with my biggest one here

00:20:28.169 --> 00:20:28.179
gonna start with my biggest one here
 

00:20:28.179 --> 00:20:32.650
gonna start with my biggest one here
you'll want the petals that you want

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:32.660
you'll want the petals that you want
 

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.779
you'll want the petals that you want
facing outward because color does matter

00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:34.789
facing outward because color does matter
 

00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:36.460
facing outward because color does matter
when you're putting it together you'll

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:36.470
when you're putting it together you'll
 

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.409
when you're putting it together you'll
want the ones that you want to show

00:20:38.409 --> 00:20:38.419
want the ones that you want to show
 

00:20:38.419 --> 00:20:41.620
want the ones that you want to show
facing inward like that so I want the

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:41.630
facing inward like that so I want the
 

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.450
facing inward like that so I want the
purples to show cuz I like the Purple's

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:43.460
purples to show cuz I like the Purple's
 

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.610
purples to show cuz I like the Purple's
in this I think it'll go well with some

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:45.620
in this I think it'll go well with some
 

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.130
in this I think it'll go well with some
of the blues that I have in this one

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.140
of the blues that I have in this one
 

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.690
of the blues that I have in this one
then all you're left with are these

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:49.700
then all you're left with are these
 

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.529
then all you're left with are these
little ones the three the two and the

00:20:53.529 --> 00:20:53.539
little ones the three the two and the
 

00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:56.529
little ones the three the two and the
one with the three it's gonna fit

00:20:56.529 --> 00:20:56.539
one with the three it's gonna fit
 

00:20:56.539 --> 00:20:58.840
one with the three it's gonna fit
together almost like a puzzle so if I

00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:58.850
together almost like a puzzle so if I
 

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.730
together almost like a puzzle so if I
put it like that and that and I'm gonna

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:00.740
put it like that and that and I'm gonna
 

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.470
put it like that and that and I'm gonna
glue it like that so it's still similar

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480
glue it like that so it's still similar
 

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.850
glue it like that so it's still similar
to what you've been doing with the

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:06.860
to what you've been doing with the
 

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.070
to what you've been doing with the
bigger ones but not quite so it almost

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080
bigger ones but not quite so it almost
 

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.020
bigger ones but not quite so it almost
looks like the folded up pedal when you

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.030
looks like the folded up pedal when you
 

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.870
looks like the folded up pedal when you
have it like that but on the inside

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880
have it like that but on the inside
 

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.659
have it like that but on the inside
again on the inside is what you want for

00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:16.669
again on the inside is what you want for
 

00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:18.039
again on the inside is what you want for
the ones that you want the color you

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:18.049
the ones that you want the color you
 

00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:19.779
the ones that you want the color you
want to show so on my inside pedal I'm

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:19.789
want to show so on my inside pedal I'm
 

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:21.880
want to show so on my inside pedal I'm
gonna have spider-man that's what's

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:21.890
gonna have spider-man that's what's
 

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:25.840
gonna have spider-man that's what's
gonna show up with the one pedal you're

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:25.850
gonna show up with the one pedal you're
 

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.779
gonna show up with the one pedal you're
gonna kind of roll it up tight cuz this

00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:28.789
gonna kind of roll it up tight cuz this
 

00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:30.490
gonna kind of roll it up tight cuz this
is your Center this is your center piece

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:30.500
is your Center this is your center piece
 

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.190
is your Center this is your center piece
so if I roll it up tight kind of like

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200
so if I roll it up tight kind of like
 

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.960
so if I roll it up tight kind of like
rolling a cigarette not that I know

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:34.970
rolling a cigarette not that I know
 

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:40.060
rolling a cigarette not that I know
anything about that guy's nothing it's

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.070
anything about that guy's nothing it's
 

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.490
anything about that guy's nothing it's
easier to put the glue just on the edge

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:42.500
easier to put the glue just on the edge
 

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.940
easier to put the glue just on the edge
it's also easier to use a low temp if

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:45.950
it's also easier to use a low temp if
 

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.640
it's also easier to use a low temp if
you have that option a low temp hot glue

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:48.650
you have that option a low temp hot glue
 

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.770
you have that option a low temp hot glue
gun a lot of my friends who help me

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:50.780
gun a lot of my friends who help me
 

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.419
gun a lot of my friends who help me
we're using a high temp and we had some

00:21:52.419 --> 00:21:52.429
we're using a high temp and we had some
 

00:21:52.429 --> 00:21:55.360
we're using a high temp and we had some
burns but they healed before the wedding

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:55.370
burns but they healed before the wedding
 

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.549
burns but they healed before the wedding
and that's all that mattered I put mine

00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559
and that's all that mattered I put mine
 

00:21:57.559 --> 00:22:00.130
and that's all that mattered I put mine
on stems because I did eventually put it

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.140
on stems because I did eventually put it
 

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.740
on stems because I did eventually put it
inside of a floral foam to make the

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:02.750
inside of a floral foam to make the
 

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.890
inside of a floral foam to make the
actual bouquet itself if I hold it to

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:05.900
actual bouquet itself if I hold it to
 

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.419
actual bouquet itself if I hold it to
make the decay itself it's on floral

00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:07.429
make the decay itself it's on floral
 

00:22:07.429 --> 00:22:10.780
make the decay itself it's on floral
foam so I put it on stems

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:10.790
foam so I put it on stems
 

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.850
foam so I put it on stems
to do that was really easy just put a

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860
to do that was really easy just put a
 

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.800
to do that was really easy just put a
little hot glue gun glue at the tip here

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:17.810
little hot glue gun glue at the tip here
 

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:23.870
little hot glue gun glue at the tip here
and it can dig that there let it hold

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880
and it can dig that there let it hold
 

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.350
and it can dig that there let it hold
and it will set on the stem then I just

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360
and it will set on the stem then I just
 

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.950
and it will set on the stem then I just
took regular 18 gauge pre-wrapped floral

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960
took regular 18 gauge pre-wrapped floral
 

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.390
took regular 18 gauge pre-wrapped floral

of rolling it up but you have to make it

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:39.270
of rolling it up but you have to make it
 

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.610
of rolling it up but you have to make it
a little bit bigger because it's going

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620
a little bit bigger because it's going
 

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.480
a little bit bigger because it's going
to go on top of the smaller one this the

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:44.490
to go on top of the smaller one this the
 

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.870
to go on top of the smaller one this the
one one's gonna go inside of it so again

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880
one one's gonna go inside of it so again
