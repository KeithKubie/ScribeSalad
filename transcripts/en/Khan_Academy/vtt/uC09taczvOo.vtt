00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.204
- [Voiceover] Plot the following
numbers on the number line.

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:07.705
The first number we have here is five,

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:10.070
and so five is five to the right of zero,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.671
five is right over there. That's our five.

00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:19.172
Then we get 1/3. 1/3.

00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:22.289
So 1/3 is between zero and one.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.256
We can actually split this into thirds.

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:28.089
So that would be 1/3, 2/3,
and then 3/3, which is one,

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.553
so 1/3 is going to sit right over there.

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:35.454
It's 1/3 of the way from
zero to one, that's 1/3.

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:38.053
Let me write that. That's
1/3 right over there.

00:00:38.053 --> 00:00:42.938
Then we have negative 1.2. I'll
do that in this blue color.

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:47.303
Negative 1.2. So, negative
one is right over here.

00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:49.802
This is more negative than negative one.

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:54.635
It's negative 1.2. It's negative
one, and then another .2,

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:57.319
so it's going to be right over here.

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:02.319
This is negative 1.2.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.868
Zero is pretty straight forward.
Zero is right over there.

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:09.501
It's even labeled for us at zero.

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.553
Five was labeled for us too at five.

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:14.635
Then we have negative two and 1/4.

00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:17.301
So let's go to negative two.

00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:19.936
Negative two is here, and it's going to be

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:22.037
more negative than negative two.

00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:25.762
It's negative two and then
another another negative 1/4.

00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:27.824
So it's negative two, and then we go

00:01:27.824 --> 00:01:30.396
1/4 of the way to negative three.

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:34.885
So negative 2 and 1/4 is
going to be right over here.

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:38.567
So negative two and 1/4.

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:41.984
And then finally we have 4.1. 4.1.

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:43.667
So four is right over here.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:46.969
.1 is another tenth greater than four,

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.070
another tenth on the way to five.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.247
So four and 1/10 is going
to be right over here. 4.1.

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.833
4.1. And we are done.
