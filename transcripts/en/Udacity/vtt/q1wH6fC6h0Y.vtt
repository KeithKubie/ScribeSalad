00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:07.495
[SOUND] Oh, good,
you made it to the end.

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:11.190
Or did you take some longest, shortest
path through the lesson to get here?

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.330
Well, here's what I think are the two
big ideas of this lesson.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.559
The first one is the [COUGH] excuse me,

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.635
[COUGH] the first one is
the idea of congestion.

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:25.160
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Boo.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.830
&gt;&gt; This concept let's you design for
one topology and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.300
then estimate whether it will
map well or poorly to another.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.500
The second big idea is to exploit
higher dimensional networks,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.710
both for fun and for profit.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.450
For instance,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.900
you should have noticed that there are
big algorithmic scalability wins from

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.840
taking advantage of a 3D mesh
network instead of a 2D one.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.830
Now, in closing,
let me pose one last question.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.260
As systems get bigger,
will topology matter again?

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.770
If it does, you will be ready.
