TOM STANDAGE: That is
just such a good line.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.960
I'm totally stealing that.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.840
Now that the internet is just
way to make you go faster

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.770
That's brilliant.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.540
Thank you.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.900
You'll be hearing that on NPR.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.670
So thanks very much
for having me here.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.560
Thank you, Stephan, for
making it all happen.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.940
Yes, I've written this book
about social media and the idea

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.709
that it's a very
old thing and not

00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:25.250
as we are encouraged
to think of it--

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.890
new and shiny and completely
historically unprecedented.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.350
I don't think it is.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.250
I think, actually, it has
been around for a long time.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.950
And that means it could
be-- we can look at history

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.260
and we can learn about it.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.380
We can learn some
unexpected lessons from it.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.880
So in order to
make this claim, I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.220
need to really define what
I mean by social media.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.670
So what do I mean
by social media?

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.710
I think this is the sort of
crucial aspect of social media

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.820
is horizontal two way
transmission rather

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.540
than vertical one
way transmission.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.140
I can say that to an
audience like this,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.490
but this is what I
normally have to say.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.929
It's crucially media we
get from other people.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.470
And it travels along
social networks,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.600
and it results in the
creation of a distributed

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.220
community or discussion.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.570
So you can feel part of a group
with other people who are not

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.330
physically present by
exchanging media with them.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.310
So that means I'm not
including word of mouth.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.980
I'm including anything that
involves writing or copying

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.615
of media.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.710
So clearly this is something
we could do on the internet.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.196
And we know what the network
topology of that looks like.

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:30.820
But it turns out that
this is something

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.730
that you don't need a
digital network to do.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.670
And I would contend that social
media environment have in fact

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.060
existed for centuries.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.050
So what do you need to have
a social media environment?

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.242
I think you need to have,
obviously, literacy.

00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:46.200
Because in order to read
and write the messages

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.410
you're passing around,
you need to be literate.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.160
But you also need the cost of
copying them and delivering

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.170
them to be sufficiently low.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.360
And I think this situation where
that combination first arose

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.330
was in the late Roman Republic.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.479
Copying and delivering
information was cheap then.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.270
It's cheap for us now
because of broadband.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.080
It was cheap then
because of slavery.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.759
And so slavery was
the Roman broadband.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.200
And this is a Roman
couple from-- actually,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.170
the first century AD,
but around that time--

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.330
this is a mural from Pompeii.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.360
And that chap on the right is
a guy called Terentius Neo.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.460
And he was a baker in Pompeii.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.035
And that's his wife there.

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.700
And this is a mural
from their house.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.050
And he is holding
a scroll and this

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.369
is the label on the
scroll, this bit here.

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.160
So when you had lots
of scrolls on a shelf,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.493
it was like the spine of a book.

00:02:36.493 --> 00:02:38.180
It was how you
could identify them.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.550
And she is holding what looks
like a Samsung Galaxy Note 3,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.451
but is in fact a Roman wax
tablet sort of note pad thing.

00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:48.700
And what seems to be the
case is that he is the baker,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.100
and she actually runs the
books and runs the business.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.940
So they are saying in
this mural, look at us,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.707
we are literate.

00:02:56.707 --> 00:02:58.040
They're proud of their literacy.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.740
And they are members of
the Roman middle class,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.220
and not members of the elite.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.600
But this shows you that
literacy was quite widespread

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.836
among both men and women.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:08.710
But it's among the Roman
elite that we really

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.210
see the social media
system working.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.050
Because they've
got-- a rich noble

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.040
would have actually
several slaves on his staff

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.130
who were just messengers.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.200
And their job was to just
run around delivering

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.229
and collecting
messages on his behalf.

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.770
And so really big families have
their own essentially private

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.650
postal services.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.894
And they could have messages
taken wherever they want.

00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:30.560
And they would also
have scribes so they

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.700
can have documents
copied very quickly.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.269
And if we look at the
letters of Cicero,

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.310
which is the best preserved
set of correspondence

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.320
from this period.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.370
And interestingly, we have
his inbox and his out box.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.000
We can see how the Roman
social media system works.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.950
And so this is an example from
a letter of Cicero's-- "I sent

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.260
you on March 24th a copy
of Balbus' letter to me

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.770
and of Caesar's letter to him."

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.660
And this is a letter
that Cicero is writing--

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.662
I think-- to his friend Atticus.

00:03:55.662 --> 00:03:58.910
So if you think about
what's happening here,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.610
Balbus has written to
Cicero, and Cicero's copying

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.840
that letter to Atticus.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.560
But Caesar has also
written to Balbus,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.440
and Balbus has copied
that letter to Cicero,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.320
and Cicero is now
copying that to Atticus.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.744
So this is a third
level retweet basically.

00:04:13.744 --> 00:04:14.910
And this is what people did.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.360
This is what they did
with their letters.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.360
And the reason they did
was that the Roman elite

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.209
was a bunch of
intermarried families.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.270
And the political news
and the social news

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.510
were very tangled up because
if two families fell out,

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.490
that could actually
mean civil war.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.890
And if two families
formed an alliance,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.940
that would change the
political landscape.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.920
And that might be
cemented with a marriage.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.630
But then if there was a
divorce, that would mean that,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.797
potentially, there
was obstruction

00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:40.630
and there was going to
be political fallout.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.502
So what we see is
all of these member

00:04:42.502 --> 00:04:44.210
of the Roman elite
writing to each other.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.890
And we see some
quite forming letters

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.170
that Cicero writes
to other people

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.340
to remind them of that
he's their friend when

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.050
he's in trouble.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.660
And then other people writing
to him when he's on top.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.730
And there, they're worried
about their position.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.700
And so the social
and the political

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.560
are very closely mixed together.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.430
Here's another example.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.350
On this occasion, Cicero
has written a letter

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.160
criticizing Caesar, and he's
put it into general circulation.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.430
So he's sent copies of it
to many of his friends,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.330
and they've copied
to and passed it on.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.440
And he's also kept-- because
he kept copies of everything he

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.950
sent-- he would have
kept the rough copies,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.010
and his scribe would then make
the neat copies to send out.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.990
He says that he's actually
allowed people who've said,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.140
I've heard you've written
a really scorching letter

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.060
about Caesar.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.310
Can I have a copy of it?

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.440
So this is what he's
allow to happen here.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.106
And the same would
happen with speeches.

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:35.270
So if you were a Roman
and you gave a speech

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.260
and you're particularly proud of
it, you would put copies of it

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.060
in circulation.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.240
So that even people
who haven't been

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.240
able to hear you make
the speech could read it.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.365
And in fact, more people
might then read the speech

00:05:44.365 --> 00:05:46.300
than had actually seen
you deliver the speech.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.230
And Roman books were also
propagated in this way.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.212
A book would be a set
of rolls in a box.

00:05:51.212 --> 00:05:52.670
And if you were a
Roman author, you

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.810
would choose the wealthiest,
most influential patron

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.480
that you could.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.021
Actually, you would
choose the patron

00:05:58.021 --> 00:06:00.610
who had the most foot traffic
going through his library.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.540
And you would then
have the book put

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.260
in his library or
your dedicated to him.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.010
And you would hope
that the people passing

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.990
through the library would
read it and be so impressed

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.510
that they would ask
for a copy of it.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.968
And at that point, he would
get his scribes to make a copy.

00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:15.930
And this is why the slaves and
the scribes are like broadband.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.760
The marginal cost per page
is zero at this point.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.480
Because he's paid for
the slave, and he's

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.563
paying for the upkeep of
the slave in the same way

00:06:22.563 --> 00:06:25.020
that you pay you're
broadband bill every month.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.940
And so you can have as many
pages copied out as you like,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.120
you just have to wait
for them to download.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.880
So this is why it's
like broadband.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.470
So the books would then spread
from one library to another.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.054
And if you were
really successful,

00:06:37.054 --> 00:06:38.970
you could tell you'd
make it as a Roman author

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.710
if you went to the book
seller's street in Rome

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.140
and you saw a copy
of your book on sale.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.640
That would mean enough people
were going to the book sellers

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.650
and saying, have you got
the new Thomas Standage's?

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.692
And eventually they would
find someone who had it

00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:53.775
and make some copies so
that they could sell them.

00:06:53.775 --> 00:06:56.410
So they would only do that if
there was sufficient demand

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.934
so books were
propagating socially.

00:06:58.934 --> 00:07:00.350
But my favorite
example is the way

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.044
the news circulated in the
sort of official gazette.

00:07:04.044 --> 00:07:05.460
And it's called
the "Acta Diurna."

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.770
It was founded by
Julius Caesar in 59 BC.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.659
And as someone who
works in news media,

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:11.700
that means he sort of
founded our industry, which

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.340
is quite funny.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.480
And this was a summary
of the debates that's

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.309
happened in the Senate and in
the People's Assembly each day.

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:21.600
And it was also a roundup of
births, deaths, marriages,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.050
and divorces, because those
were politically very important.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.060
And announcement of public
holidays, the gladiator

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.870
results, that kind of stuff.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.450
And this newspaper
was produced each day.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.720
But it was bizarrely-- by a sort
of traditions of the newspaper

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.470
industry-- the circulation
was apparently rather low.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.900
Only one copy of it was made.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.390
And it was put up in the Forum.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.681
And if you want to read it,
you have to go to the Forum

00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:45.950
and read it yourself.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.462
Or, if you were a wealthy
noble and you had a scribe,

00:07:49.462 --> 00:07:51.170
you could send a scribe
down to copy down

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.841
the bits that are
most relevant to you.

00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:54.590
And then you could
read it over breakfast.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.048
And you would do that using a
device that looked like this.

00:07:57.048 --> 00:07:58.670
And this is a Roman iPad.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.010
And this is exactly
the size and the shape

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.130
and the aspect ratio
of the modern iPad.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.150
And you'll notice, Google
folks, that it's not 16:9.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.037
So the Romans decided
that the big bevel, which

00:08:10.037 --> 00:08:11.620
Apples apparently
about to get rid of,

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.800
and 4:3 was the way to go.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.860
Anyway, they also
have the smaller ones

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.212
we saw early on which
is this sort of thing.

00:08:19.212 --> 00:08:21.170
These were things you
could note stuff down on.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.710
I'll go back to the
Roman iPad there.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.630
So you could then
read the news on this,

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.731
and then you would send
the news that you thought

00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:30.730
would interest your friends
to them in a letter.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.820
And we see this-- we see it in
the letters of Pliny and Pliny

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.650
the Elder and also in
letters of Cicero and Tacitus

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.630
talked about this as well-- that
when a Roman was outside Rome,

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.463
they would expect their
friends to keep them

00:08:42.463 --> 00:08:44.059
abreast of the news
by sending them

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.900
the most relevant
parts of the "Acta."

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.320
And in some cases, in
fact, entire copies

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.970
of the "Acta
Diurna" transcribed.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.530
And that way they could keep
up with what was happening.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.050
But they didn't just what the
raw content of the "Acta,"

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.100
they wanted the discussion
of it the commentary

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.160
and the analysis that their
friends would provide around it

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.740
as well.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.260
So the Romans were using
their friends to sift the news

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.540
and to deliver the news.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.049
It was a social distribution
system for all of this stuff

00:09:08.049 --> 00:09:09.840
because, of course,
there was no broadcast.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.505
There was no printing press.

00:09:11.505 --> 00:09:13.480
It was the only way you
could actually do it.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.020
And this seems to
work very well.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.280
We can tell that
news from Rome would

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.440
get to Britain in
the West and Syria

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.240
in the east in about
five or six weeks.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.560
And that's really not bad.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.440
So news would propagate in
from the Provinces to Rome,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.709
and then would be
also distributed

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:31.750
from the center outwards.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.700
And there were boats
going to and fro.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.940
Seneca is very amusing.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.362
He writes about how some people
were so obsessed with getting

00:09:39.362 --> 00:09:41.570
their mail that they-- when
they saw the ships coming

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.962
from Egypt with the mail-- they
would rush down to the harbor.

00:09:44.962 --> 00:09:46.920
And he would sit down
and sort of laugh at them

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.860
in the same way that
people who are addicted

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.770
to their BlackBerrys
are mocked-- or used

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.250
to be when anyone
had BlackBerrys.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.930
And this is a sort
of being hooked

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.020
on the dopamine rush to
getting your mail is something

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.120
that even the
Romans were mocking.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.580
Probably the most effective
user for the Roman social media

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.410
system was the apostle Paul.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.410
And he used it to
distribute the epistles.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.910
If you think about it,
epistles are letters.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.480
This is a classic example
of how Roman letters were

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.100
passed around.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.740
And so, this is what
Paul says in his letter

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.490
to the Colossians.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.680
So he's got this
network of churches

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.530
across Asia Minor and Greece.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.260
And he's writing to them all.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.180
And he's encouraging them to
read out the letters in church,

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.270
and then to copy them
to local churches.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.870
And also to get
copies of the letter

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.490
that he's written
to those churches.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.989
And what happens
is all the chapters

00:10:32.989 --> 00:10:35.550
end up with a set of all the
letters that he's written.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.740
And they end up being made
into part of the New Testament.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.142
And by doing this,
what he's doing

00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:43.100
is binding together this
community of churches.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.090
He's making them feel like
a distributed group that

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.380
are connected to each other.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.165
And they hear about one of
the Church's being persecuted,

00:10:50.165 --> 00:10:53.500
and they're invited to pray
for the members of that church.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.775
And he resolves matters of
doctrine and answers questions.

00:10:56.775 --> 00:10:58.900
And that's something that
they're all interested in

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.390
and they all want to hear about.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.470
So he helps to form
the Christian church

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.250
in the first century
AD using social media.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.710
And the social
distribution of the epistle

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.580
are still going on today.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.750
In churches on Sundays
when epistle is read out,

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.260
that is the same
social distribution

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.510
system still in action.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.810
Which is something that's been
going on for a very long time.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.110
And in fact, what Paul's doing
is he's arguing at this stage

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.020
with other members of
the early church who

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.725
think that Christianity
should be just the Jews.

00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:31.100
And he's arguing that, no, it
should be open to everyone.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.520
And because he essentially runs
the more effective social media

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.636
campaign, he prevails.

00:11:35.636 --> 00:11:37.010
Which is why
Christianity ends up

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.514
being an open religion
in the way that it did.

00:11:39.514 --> 00:11:40.930
So this is, as far
as I could see,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.770
the first example of
a social media system.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.670
You've got enough
literacy, you've

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.140
got enough-- it's cheap
enough to copy and deliver

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.840
information.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.102
And so you get social media
first in the Roman world.

00:11:53.102 --> 00:11:54.560
And what I do in
the book is I look

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.180
at many other examples of this.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.680
So I'll touch on a
couple of others.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.880
So here's the second one.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.180
This is 1,500 years later.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.190
Again it involves
the Christian church.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.980
But instead of using social
media to reinforce the church,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.710
this is Martin Luther using it
to actually split the church.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.596
That wasn't his
initial intention.

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:12.970
Initially, he just
wanted to have

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.371
a debate about the
doctrine of indulgences.

00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:17.870
And these are sort of tickets
that the Catholic church would

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.890
sell you to get out of
purgatory after you died.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.290
And the idea was that if
you gave them some money

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.830
to help them build-- in this
case, Saint Peter's Rome,

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.416
that giant cathedral--
they would then give you

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:31.040
a ticket that would
mean when you died,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.240
you wouldn't have to spend
so long in purgatory.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.720
And Luther thought this
all sounded a bit silly.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.170
Because the sales people
were saying you could also

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.290
buy tickets for your already
dead relatives who were,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.530
presumably, stuck in
purgatory at that point,

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.080
and you'd be able to
release them straight away.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.970
And they were playing
well at fast and loose

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:50.761
with this doctrine.

00:12:50.761 --> 00:12:54.472
So Luther drew up this list
of problems he had with this.

00:12:54.472 --> 00:12:56.430
If he'd done it these
days, he'd have done it--

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.347
I'm sure-- as a listicle.

00:12:58.347 --> 00:12:59.555
It would've been on BuzzFeed.

00:12:59.555 --> 00:13:01.790
You know, 95 crazy
questions the pope

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.320
must answer about indulgences.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.370
But of course, it wasn't.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.800
It was 1518, so
he didn't do that.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.680
Instead, he wrote them in Latin
and pinned them to the door

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.199
to church in Bittenburg
where he was a theologian.

00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:15.240
And this was the notice
board for the university.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.150
So he was inviting
people to come and debate

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.983
with him about this.

00:13:17.983 --> 00:13:19.840
Now, this was so
explosive that people

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.110
started to copy down the
theses and circulate them

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.700
to their friends.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.810
These are the theses
that he wanted to debate.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.280
The 95 theses.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.915
And so far, this sounds like
a Roman distribution system.

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:33.790
You've got people copying
stuff down in Latin

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.167
and sending it to their
friends, manuscript form.

00:13:36.167 --> 00:13:38.500
But of course, what's happened
since the Roman period is

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.069
the printing press
has been invented.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.110
And so eventually, some
printers get hold of this

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.060
and they print them.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.360
And print 1,000 copies, so
that's a very big increase

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.040
in the number of
copies in circulation.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.950
Those copies get
carried to other towns.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.682
Those printers there get
hold of it, they print it.

00:13:52.682 --> 00:13:54.640
Some of the printers
translate this into German

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.120
so that more people can read it.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.095
And the result is that
these 95 propositions--

00:13:59.095 --> 00:14:01.820
written in, frankly, very
impenetrable theological

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.312
Latin-- spread
very, very quickly.

00:14:04.312 --> 00:14:05.770
And a contemporary
of Luther's says

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.360
that in fact it took
two weeks for the theses

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.260
to spread throughout
Germany, and only a month

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.210
for the rest of
continental Europe.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.510
So this was extraordinary.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.218
And it was a complete
surprise to Luther.

00:14:16.218 --> 00:14:17.572
He wasn't expecting to do this.

00:14:17.572 --> 00:14:19.530
He said, the theses "are
printed and circulated

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.470
far beyond my expectation."

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.190
But he realized this presented
him with an opportunity.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.780
If he wanted to take his
message about problems

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.040
with the corruption
of the Catholic Church

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.490
and the need to reform
it to the people,

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.800
he could use this mechanism.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.470
So he followed up with a series
of pamphlets, mostly written

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:36.380
in German.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.530
And a very easy to
understand German which

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:43.750
avoided any sort of
dialectic-- regional dialects.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.490
And he would simply take the
text on one of these pamphlets

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.630
that he would write and give
it to a printer in his town.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.410
And they would
print 1,000 copies.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.137
And then those copies would
ripple to other towns.

00:14:54.137 --> 00:14:55.970
And printers there would
print them as well.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.540
They would spread and
spread in this way.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.870
And he didn't have
to do anything.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.190
The audience was sufficiently
interested in his message

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.030
that they amplified
it themselves.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.450
And the printers were sort
of special super nerds

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.450
who could make this application
much, much more efficient.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.140
And so you could measure
how effectively his campaign

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:13.640
worked.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.890
Today, we measure social media
campaigns by how many +1s

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.900
or likes or retweets or
reblogs or repins they get.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.172
But for Luther it was
the number of reprints

00:15:24.172 --> 00:15:26.005
by printers that's the
really crucial thing.

00:15:26.005 --> 00:15:29.110
And it shows that you can do
Martin Luther's traffic stats.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.440
And it looks like this.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.330
And this shows you have a great
big spike in traffic in 1523,

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.970
which is the height
of the Reformation.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.040
Where you've got
all the order world

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.000
353 prints of
1,000-- maybe 2,000--

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.580
copies of these pamphlets.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.580
What's happening here is
that the blue pamphlets

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.839
are Latin ones and the
red ones are German ones.

00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:50.880
And the dark bits are the
number of new pamphlets

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.840
that Martin Luther
is issuing each year.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.440
And the white ones are
the number of reprints.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.150
So you see, mostly what he's
doing is writing in German.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.202
But he did write some in
Latin because he was also

00:16:01.202 --> 00:16:02.660
addressing the
theological audience

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.580
to who he wrote in Latin.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.010
You can see that the retweets
of existing pamphlets

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.360
are sort of more
important than the number

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.070
of the actual pamphlets
that he's putting out.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.520
And overall, there was something
like 5 to 7 million pamphlets

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.120
by Luther and others
floating around Europe

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.040
within the first 10
years of the Reformation.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.440
And the result was the splitting
of Western Christendom,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.270
and the emergence of Protestant
churches and Protestant

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.470
Christianity.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.890
So this is the result of
social media campaign that

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.685
is helped along by
improvements in the technology

00:16:34.685 --> 00:16:37.770
of propagation, in
this case printing.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.820
Here's another example very dear
to me which is coffee houses.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.890
And coffee houses were
particularly popular

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.721
in England.

00:16:43.721 --> 00:16:45.470
And they became popular
in the second half

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.150
of the 17th century.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.420
And coffee houses were
media sharing platforms.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.840
You went to them
because they had

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.080
all sorts of things to read.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.200
So this is an
example on the right

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.410
of what a pamphlet
would look like.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.350
And again, pamphlets
were very often written

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.740
in the form of letters, even
if they weren't actually

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.990
letters to real people.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.580
So this is a letter
from a gentleman in Kent

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.800
to a friend in London.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.280
And this is a
literary device just

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.450
to say a particular thing
about what's going on.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.680
But it was the sort of thing
you'd find in coffee houses

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.762
where you could go and you would
find a very free conversation.

00:17:17.762 --> 00:17:19.970
And you could read all manner
of printed news instead

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.470
of being used books-- which
are precursors of newspapers.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.011
There would be
pamphlets, there would

00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:26.690
be handwritten newsletters that
were called "Letters of News."

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.945
These were gathered by the
precursors of journalists.

00:17:28.945 --> 00:17:31.260
They were people who went
around listening and talking

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.459
and exchanging gossip and
then they'd write it down

00:17:33.459 --> 00:17:35.250
and they would send
these "Letters of News"

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.130
to paying subscribers
in the countryside.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.316
And again, that's quite a Roman
sort of way of doing things.

00:17:41.316 --> 00:17:43.440
So you can find all of
these things in coffee house

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.310
and you could discuss
stuff with people.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.940
And it was a very alluring
information environment.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.550
And we see this from the
diary of Samuel Pepys.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.287
He often says, "service
to the coffee house."

00:17:53.287 --> 00:17:55.870
And he tells you all the sorts
of amazing people he would meet

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.050
and things you would learn.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.669
That he would meet a merchant
from the South Seas who'd

00:17:59.669 --> 00:18:01.710
seen people who'd learn
to write with their feet.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.200
Or there's a new kind of
fruit called a pineapple,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.210
or that sort of thing.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.460
And so it was a very alluring
information environment.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.501
In fact, some people
thought it was too alluring.

00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:12.450
And that people were
spending too much

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.030
of their time just hanging
out and coffeehouse networking

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.410
and sharing gossip
with their friends.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.810
So it's a very sort
of recognizably modern

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.330
environment.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.100
And one of the reasons that it
was that people were encouraged

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.690
to mix socially in a way
that they otherwise normally

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:29.570
wouldn't.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.610
So there was a
convention of politeness

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.080
in coffee houses
and a convention

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.820
that you would leave
distinctions of social class

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.650
behind as you entered there.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.360
So you would enter,
you would pay a penny

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.740
for dish of coffee--
and that was

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.560
the kind of admission
price-- and then

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.340
you could join in
the conversation.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.190
And the idea was, as a
contemporary description,

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.140
"gentleman mechanic,
lord and scoundrel

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.210
mix and are all of a piece."

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.870
What this means
is that ideas were

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.730
able to cross social
boundaries in a way

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.170
that they previously
couldn't have done.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.280
And so this was what made going
to a coffee house so exciting.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.796
That you never knew--
the serendipity

00:19:03.796 --> 00:19:04.920
was part of the attraction.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.370
You never knew who you might
meet or what you might learn.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.500
And I have many more
examples in the book.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.370
This is a commonplace book.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.730
Commonplace books
were notebooks where

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.550
you would write down cool stuff.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.420
And it might be a
poem that had been

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.910
sent by a friend, a new
sonnet by Shakespeare perhaps.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.960
Or an aphorism-- maybe you're
reading one of the classics,

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.070
and there was a
particularly good quote

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.196
from Cicero or from Tacitus
or something like that.

00:19:29.196 --> 00:19:31.528
You think, oh that's great,
I'm going to write that down

00:19:31.528 --> 00:19:32.685
in my commonplace book.

00:19:32.685 --> 00:19:34.810
And that way, when you
wanted to remember it later,

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.320
you'd know that it was
in your commonplace book.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.150
And then you might
also write a letter

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.750
to a friend saying,
by the way, I've

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.560
come across this really
great quote today.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.470
And they would then-- if
they thought it was awesome

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.360
as well, they would copy it
into their commonplace books.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.443
Sometimes people would
exchange commonplace books.

00:19:49.443 --> 00:19:52.440
Or they would sometimes
share commonplace books

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.390
within families, within groups
of friends, where people would

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.790
write these things down
and write poems and comment

00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:59.940
on each other's stuff.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.650
And this looks to be
very similar to what

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.070
we see with, say,
tumblr and Pinterest,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.360
where 80 percent of the content
circulating on those networks

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.360
is rebills or repins of
other people's stuff.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.410
So it's self expression
through the curation

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.600
of other people's content.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.530
And some of what you
post is original,

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.770
but actually the
vast majority is

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.970
the selection of
other people stuff.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.880
So that is quite a
striking parallel

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.860
I think, with the way some
social platforms work today.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.270
And there are others as well.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.710
I talk about pamphlets
in the English Civil War,

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.030
the circulation of poetry
in the Tudor Court,

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.780
the circulation of
pamphlets in the run up

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.070
to the American
Revolution, the circulation

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.270
of poems on tiny slips
of paper in the run

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.650
up to the French Revolution.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.380
And all of these
have characteristics

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.130
that are very similar
to different aspects

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.040
of social media today.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.460
So the idea, that
is, that this has all

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.350
got a much deeper and richer
history than we might think.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.260
So what happened it?

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.140
Why is it that we've failed
to notice this before?

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.320
Well, I think the reason is
that we had this big shift that

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.940
took place in the
19th century where

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.754
we went from this sort
of network topology

00:21:03.754 --> 00:21:04.670
to this sort of thing.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.380
And essentially,
machines were invented

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.070
starting with the steam
press and later radio and TV

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.020
transmitters.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.020
That made it possible to deliver
information single message

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.380
to a large audience
very, very efficiently.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.370
And this changed the way
that information travelled.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.000
People still wrote
each other letters

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.790
and exchanged
information socially.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.220
But this is was
much more efficient

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.270
that more of their media diet
came from these centralized one

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.696
way broadcast sources.

00:21:29.696 --> 00:21:32.320
If you look at newspapers in the
beginning of the 19th century,

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.560
the average circulation
newspaper was 1,000 or 2,000/

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.580
they were very, very
local and they were sent

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.130
to the local's social platforms.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.930
Most of what was
in newspapers was

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.230
letters sent in by readers,
reports of speeches, and so on.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.110
It was not articles written
by professional journalists.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.210
And what happens by the
end of the 19th century

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.050
is that steam presses make it
possible to have newspapers

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.710
with a million copies
being produced a day.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.900
And what this does--
because the equipment needed

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.400
to do this to reach
a large audience

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.020
is so expensive--
that gradually,

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.680
the scale of these
platforms goes up

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.720
and the barrier to entry
gets bigger and bigger.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.780
This means that the access
to that technology--

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.702
the ability to send your
thoughts to lots of people--

00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:12.910
is concentrated into the
hands of a very small number

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.810
of people-- journalists and
opinion leaders, politicians.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.110
And most people are
not participating

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.440
in the system other than to
be recipients of information.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.290
And I think the most sort of
the infamous example of this

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.550
is the Nazi Volksempfanger.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.770
So we've heard of the
Volkswagen, the people's car.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.380
This is the people's receiver.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:35.490
And the Nazis recognized
the power of radio

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.716
to impress their view of the
world on the German people.

00:22:39.716 --> 00:22:41.340
And the Volksempfanger
was deliberately

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.620
designed not to be able to
pick up foreign broadcast.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.330
So all you could listen to
was the Fuhrer banging on.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.480
"Dans Deutschland
hurt dem Fuhrer."

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.180
So, "the whole of
Germany is the Fuhrer."

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.970
You could see that
there they all are,

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.710
gathered symbolically
around this radio.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.960
This is as far away from the
social media distribution

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.310
as is possible to get.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.670
This is a single man
imposing his view

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.780
of the world on
an entire nation.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.110
This is one way.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:10.671
And this is as unequal
as it's possible to be.

00:23:10.671 --> 00:23:12.670
But of course what happened
in the past 10 years

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.086
is that the internet
has massively

00:23:14.086 --> 00:23:17.510
reduced the cost of delivering
information to large audiences.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.660
So it's now possible for social
distribution systems to compete

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.940
with broadcast and with
mass media in a way that it

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.930
previously couldn't.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.090
And we can see
information to shifting.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.400
We can see people are
spending less time watching

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.800
TV and reading newspapers, and
more time on social platforms

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.560
getting their friends to filter
interesting stuff towards them.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.076
And there are lots of surveys
of young people showing

00:23:40.076 --> 00:23:41.700
that they don't read
newspapers at all.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.325
And my children don't
watch television,

00:23:43.325 --> 00:23:45.120
they kind of watch YouTube.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.210
And a lot of what
they watch on YouTube

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.040
is usually generated content
made by people like them

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.310
for people like them.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.970
So I think this means we need
to look at the history of media

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.204
in a very different way.

00:23:56.204 --> 00:23:57.620
We used to think
of it like this--

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.956
where we had old media, which
was analog, and broadcast.

00:24:01.956 --> 00:24:03.330
And then the
internet came along,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.890
and we have new
media and digital

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.394
and it was more
social in nature.

00:24:06.394 --> 00:24:07.810
And this is a part
of the picture.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.490
I think if we look at
the last 2,000 years,

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:10.380
it looks like this.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.860
We need to have this
period of really old media

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.040
because nobody is
not really that old.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.720
I have the arbitrary
date of 1833 here.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.970
Because that's the year that
the first penny newspaper was

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.247
launched, "The New York Sun."

00:24:22.247 --> 00:24:24.830
And it was the first newspaper
that adopted the new mass media

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.130
model where most of the money
came from advertisers not

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.040
subscribers.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.500
And you use the fact that
you had a large audience

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.540
to appeal to advertisers who
then gave you that money.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:39.090
To bootstrap that model, the
founder of "The New York Sun"

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.329
did a rather clever thing.

00:24:40.329 --> 00:24:42.870
Instead of selling his newspaper
at $0.06 like everyone else,

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.990
he sold it at $0.01 which
means he'd lose money.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.330
So he copied ad words
from the other newspapers

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.110
and put them in.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.570
And then he went to
advertisers and said,

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.540
look, all of these other
companies are advertising.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.248
Maybe you should.

00:24:52.248 --> 00:24:53.890
And they all fell
for it and signed up.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.750
So that was how he
bootstrapped the model.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.290
And that model
worked very nicely,

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.220
thank you, for
the media industry

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.970
until just a few years ago.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.190
At the peak in 2007, an
average American newspaper

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.170
got 87 percent of its
revenue from advertising.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.870
So that turned out
to be unsustainable,

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.570
and they're now having
to find new models.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.750
So I think we need to
look at it like this

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.604
and we have to recognize that
there was this very long period

00:25:17.604 --> 00:25:19.270
of really old media
which, in many ways,

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.960
is similar to new media.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.710
And what new media has
done is brought back

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.755
the spirit of the coffeehouse
and the other social platforms

00:25:26.755 --> 00:25:31.210
that were around before
the advent of mass media.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.110
So that means I think given
that similarity between really

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:37.320
old media and new media,
that ancient old social media

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.370
systems have lessons
for us today.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.340
Many of the questions we
have about social media today

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.410
actually arose in conjunction
with these ancient social media

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.639
systems as well.

00:25:46.639 --> 00:25:48.430
So I think that could
be quite informative.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.320
And again, in the book I look
at several examples of this.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.140
But I'm just going to
touch on three of them now

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.580
that relate to
the three examples

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.130
that I gave you earlier
on-- so the Roman, Luther

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.590
and coffeehouses.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.874
Let's start with this one.

00:25:58.874 --> 00:26:00.790
Is social media merely
a dangerous destruction

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.640
that wastes time?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.334
This is very common to
critique of social media today.

00:26:05.334 --> 00:26:07.250
In particular, the idea
that social networking

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.750
should really be
called not working.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.510
And it's a sort of
way of avoiding work

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.890
rather in the way of
doing anything useful.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.520
And this turns out to
be a timeless complaint.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.730
So this is Oxford in the 1670's.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.560
Anthony Wood, who was
an academic in Oxford,

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.410
is very worried about the
fact that, "solid and serious

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:24.705
learning is in decline."

00:26:24.705 --> 00:26:26.330
And the students are
not actually doing

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.720
work anymore because they're
in coffee houses all the time.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.886
And it's not just in Oxford.

00:26:29.886 --> 00:26:32.340
Meanwhile in Cambridge,
"Hours are spent in talking

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.530
and less profitable reading
of newspapers-- scholars

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.260
are so greedy after news
they neglect all for it."

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.160
And another pamphlet
from the period

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.450
warns that coffee houses
are "Great enemies

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.100
to diligence and
industry-- the ruin

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.110
of many serious and hopeful
young gentleman and tradesmen."

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.620
And so this is all quite
a modern sounding critique

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.855
of these very
alluring platforms.

00:26:52.855 --> 00:26:55.800
They're so alluring that
people go in and don't realize

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.810
what's happened and
hours later as they

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.732
emerge realizing that the
afternoon has disappeared.

00:27:01.732 --> 00:27:03.690
It has turned out to be
actually exactly wrong.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.550
If you look at what
coffee houses actually

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.240
did in the late
17th century, they

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.370
turned out to be-- rather
than enemies of diligence

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.911
and industry-- they turned out
to be crucibles of innovation.

00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:14.080
Because of this mixing
of ideas and people

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.800
who had previously not been
able to encounter each other,

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.600
this was a really,
really fantastic place

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.970
to come up with new
ideas, new ventures,

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.170
whether that was joint
stock companies, whether it

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.380
was the scientific revolution.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.650
The Royal Society came out of
meetings held in coffeehouses

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.240
by scientists.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.770
Isaac Newton writes "Principa
Mathematica," the foundation

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.800
stone of modern science in
order to settle a coffeehouse

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.170
argument between
Hook, Haley, and Rand

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.510
about the nature of the
inverse square law of gravity

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.500
and its relationship to
the shapes of orbits.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.010
Lloyd's of London starts
off as a coffeehouse

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.970
where marine shippers meet
and discuss insurance.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.001
And then they
realize that this is

00:27:53.001 --> 00:27:54.500
something they're
all interested in.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.560
You have Lloyd's list
pinned to the wall.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.180
It turns into Lloyd's of London.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.107
It goes from coffeehouse
to insurance market.

00:28:00.107 --> 00:28:01.690
Similarly, there's
another coffeehouse

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.815
called Jonathan's where
all the stock traders would

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.960
meet that turns into the
London Stock Exchange.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.220
So all of this innovation
comes out of coffeehouses,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.928
because they're very
fertile environments

00:28:09.928 --> 00:28:11.360
where people and ideas can mix.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.818
And I think there's
a lesson for us

00:28:12.818 --> 00:28:15.680
there, that social media
offers us similar opportunities

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.630
within companies, between
companies, and as scientists

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:23.140
or individuals or artists--
that we can encounter people

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.910
and exchange ideas and
come up with new cool stuff

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.740
as a result of it.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.430
Second question.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.513
So again, this is a very
sort of current question.

00:28:32.513 --> 00:28:36.790
The role of social media in
revolutions and to what extent

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.380
were Facebook and
Twitter factors

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.769
in causing Arab Spring
and that sort of thing.

00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:43.060
Well, it turns out that this
is also a very old debate,

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.785
and we can ask Martin Luther.

00:28:44.785 --> 00:28:47.160
Martin Luther says, "From the
rapid spread of the theses,

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.470
I gather what the greater
part of the nation

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.689
thinks of indulgences."

00:28:50.689 --> 00:28:52.480
So this is a phenomenon
that media scholars

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.850
call synchronization of opinion.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.790
If you were Luther and
you saw your pamphlets

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.970
spreading like wildfire--
One description

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.550
was that they were
more seized than sold.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.266
So people really couldn't wait
to get their hands on them.

00:29:07.266 --> 00:29:08.640
Then that told
you that there was

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.920
quite a lot of support
for your views.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.530
And more importantly, if you
were one of the readers of one

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.340
of Luther's pamphlets,
pamphlets were quite accessible.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.107
They cost about the
same as a chicken.

00:29:17.107 --> 00:29:19.190
So they were much, much
less expensive than buying

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.470
a book, which was
like buying a car.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.050
So they really were
accessible to ordinary people.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.280
And if you went to the
printer in your town and said,

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.613
I hear there's a new Martin
Luther, have you got a copy?

00:29:28.613 --> 00:29:30.200
And the printer
said, no, sold out.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.400
Then you knew that lots of
other people in your town

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.108
were interested in
what Luther had to say

00:29:34.108 --> 00:29:36.610
and probably agreed with you
that he was on to something.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.240
And so this was how
people across Europe

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.650
were able to recognize that
their views about the nature

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.785
of the Catholic Church and
corruption in the higher

00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:48.010
echelons of the Catholic
church was shared

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.610
by large numbers
of other people.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:51.930
And that's ultimately
what enabled

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.362
the Reformation to get going.

00:29:54.362 --> 00:29:56.320
And so I think the way
of thinking about this--

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.028
And we saw the same
with the Arab Spring,

00:29:58.028 --> 00:30:01.040
where previous
efforts by governments

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.080
had been successful
to stifle outbursts

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.240
of local dissent,
local protests.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.740
But social media
eventually allowed people

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.720
in one part of
Tunisia to tell people

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.574
in the rest of Tunisia
what was going on.

00:30:12.574 --> 00:30:14.532
And then people across
Tunisia could say, well,

00:30:14.532 --> 00:30:17.430
hang on a minute, we all
think that this isn't on.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.400
And then you
actually get change.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.370
And so I think the
way that you should

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.620
think about this is that
social media doesn't actually

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.170
trigger or start revolutions.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.040
There's an underlying
grievance in both cases

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.610
here about the corruption
of the Catholic church

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:36.940
or of the despotic leaders
in various Arab countries.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.100
And that's the ultimate cause.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.070
And once there's a
spark, social media

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.110
synchronizes opinion
and allows the protest

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.370
to spread much more quickly.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:46.090
So it's like an accelerant.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.720
It doesn't start a fire, it
helps it spread more quickly.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.330
This is Jared Cohen's
idea, a Google person.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.330
And I think he's put his
finger on it by saying,

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.640
it's the accelerant, is the
right way of thinking about it.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.060
Finally, is social media a fad?

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.894
Well, I hope that my very
brief tour 2,000 years of it

00:31:04.894 --> 00:31:06.310
has convinced you
to actually this

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.860
is a very old idea with
very deep roots and a very

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.820
rich history.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.320
If we go back to
this chart here you

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.028
can see that actually
it's old media that

00:31:15.028 --> 00:31:17.780
is the historical anomaly here.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.490
This was just a
consequence of the fact

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.150
that technologies to
propagate information really

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:26.290
quickly to large audiences
used to be really expensive.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.470
And they used to be only
available to a small number

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.970
of people.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.178
And there were business
models you could build around

00:31:31.178 --> 00:31:33.140
that to do with scarcity
and local monopolies.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.681
But they don't work
anymore, as we've

00:31:34.681 --> 00:31:37.410
seen what's happened to
the newspaper industry

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.090
in particular.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.360
So that was the anomaly.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:45.220
And really, new media and its
similarity to really old media

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.360
is a sort of reversion to
the way things used to be.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.790
So I think this is a fad at all.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.800
I think historically,
the broadcast era

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.740
was the sort of fad-sh bit.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.360
It was the historical anomaly.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.000
So I think that means that we,
users of social media today,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.630
are as to a centuries
long tradition even

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.130
if we didn't realize it.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.810
What I've to tried to do is
to put our use of social media

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.670
today in historical context.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.360
And there are these
very direct parallels

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.700
between the source of
social media we use today,

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.752
and the source that existed
in the past like this.

00:32:16.752 --> 00:32:19.210
So I hope I've convinced you
that social media doesn't just

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.401
connect us to each other today,
it also links us to the past.

00:32:22.401 --> 00:32:22.900
Thank you.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.285
Oh, this is my book
on the subject.

00:32:29.285 --> 00:32:30.410
This is what it looks like.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.720
AUDIENCE: So I
was wondering what

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.640
lessons you can draw from
the really old media in terms

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.250
of something else you mentioned,
which was the business

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:47.070
models for newspapers that have
kind of become obsolete now?

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.930
TOM STANDAGE: Well, I think all
media companies are struggling

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.580
with now is how they make
sharing their friend.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.540
And we saw in-- the music
industry was hit first by this.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.250
And the model of
the music industry

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:03.610
has sort of ended up with is
that the emphasis on selling

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:05.970
music-- that's
going to be of much

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.730
more part of their
revenues in future.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.810
And much more of it is going
to come from basically tickets

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.560
to live events and
merchandise and so on.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.670
So there's been
that shift there.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.880
Similarly, newspapers
are shifting away

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.144
from advertising funded models
to subscription funded models.

00:33:21.144 --> 00:33:22.810
Some of them can do
advertising from it,

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.790
but they can't-- the
number of papers,

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:29.474
the number of publications that
that model will sustain is--

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:31.140
because they're all
competing globally--

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.530
is nothing like as
big as it used to be.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:36.471
But my favorite example is
actually the Asian video game

00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:36.970
model.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:39.010
Where instead of the
consoles and selling

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.050
the games and the
licensing fees to model

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.340
that we have in
the West, you have

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.920
to model of distributing
the client software.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.290
And you actually want
as many copies of it

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.510
to be made as possible, and
to be as easy as possible

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.135
to download it.

00:33:51.135 --> 00:33:53.676
And then you get a very large
number of people playing a game

00:33:53.676 --> 00:33:54.740
and it's free to play.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.572
And then you sell
in-game upgrades.

00:33:56.572 --> 00:33:58.280
And that's where you'll
model comes from.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.930
So this is a model that works.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.140
The more widely your
client software is pirated,

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.475
the better it works.

00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:05.850
And I think what
we're all trying

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:07.516
to do in different
parts of the industry

00:34:07.516 --> 00:34:10.510
is work out how we make
sharing our friends

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.560
in our particular industry.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:18.100
AUDIENCE: So for every person
that creates something great

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.804
based on social media or every
group of people that does,

00:34:20.804 --> 00:34:21.929
there's the average person.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:23.935
Where it is genuinely
just a big time suck

00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:26.590
and they're not going to
create the next "Principia

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.650
Mathematica".

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:31.429
So are there any lessons we can
glean from the really old media

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:37.620
model to increase the amount
of the great things that

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.070
come from social media?

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.429
TOM STANDAGE: Well, one
of the timeless complaints

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.050
about media, whenever
technology makes it easier

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.446
to distribute stuff is
that there's then too much.

00:34:46.446 --> 00:34:48.820
And that the wrong people are
publishing the wrong thing.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.819
So we see this now about
the trivialization,

00:34:50.819 --> 00:34:52.469
the coarsening of debate.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:56.929
And one man's trivialization is
another man's democratization.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.924
And if we look at what
happened to-- So Erasmus

00:34:58.924 --> 00:35:00.590
is complaining around
the time of Luther

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:02.765
that there are all these
pamphlets flying around.

00:35:02.765 --> 00:35:05.300
They're really short.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.460
They're in German so
they're really easy to read.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.280
And this means no one's reading
the classics in Latin and Greek

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.409
anymore, which he thinks
is a big-- terrible.

00:35:13.409 --> 00:35:15.450
So it's very similar to
sort of modern complaints

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:18.230
that as media becomes easier
to consume and more people

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.749
access to it that
it's a bad thing.

00:35:20.749 --> 00:35:22.540
But if you look at what
happened-- and then

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.199
there was a sort
of huge increase

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:25.990
in the number of books
that were published.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.750
And people felt very
overwhelmed by it.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.670
And people feel overwhelmed
by what's happening now.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.020
But what actually happened
in the case of printing

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.170
in the last big
step change here,

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:41.400
was that people figured out
mechanisms, technologies,

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.200
to cope and to sift the
good stuff from the bad.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.650
So things like-- in the
case of books-- book reviews

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.850
and tables of contents and
bibliography and indexes.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.660
And what all of
those things are is

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:55.250
they are ways to figure out
whether a particular book is

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.160
relevant to what you're
doing and to find

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.670
the bits that are
relevant to you quickly.

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.160
Without having to read--
because you can't plausibly

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.785
read all of the books
about everything.

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:02.850
We're used to that now.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.350
We're never going
to be able books.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.200
So instead, we rely on
these other mechanisms

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.740
to identify the good stuff.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.220
And I think that's
what we're going

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.678
to have with-- we've obviously
seen this with the internet.

00:36:12.678 --> 00:36:14.620
We had the Yahoo
directory model.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.780
That was great for a while.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.980
Then we had the
search engine model.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.920
That also got its merits.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.380
Now, we seem to be in a world
where we are using social

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.360
as part of the
filtering process.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.850
And there's this combination
of search and social

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.530
that Google is doing as well.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:31.530
So I think all of this is the
process by which we determine

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:32.980
where the valuable stuff is.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.510
And what's really good
about these versions of it

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:38.390
is that it's capable of
producing different answers

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:39.380
for different people.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.690
So what I think is
the really cool stuff

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.440
will be different from what you
think is the really cool stuff.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.310
But as far as I'm
concerned, this

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.730
is the task you are
engaged in which

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:51.770
is helping people find
the-- organizing the world's

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.230
information.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.440
And so what you're doing is
part of this very, very long

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.880
historical continuum
of some of what

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.292
people have been
trying to do before.

00:37:01.292 --> 00:37:03.750
AUDIENCE: What are your thoughts
on the rate of information

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.050
delivery and how that's
changed and maybe effected

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:09.242
attention spans or
anything like that?

00:37:09.242 --> 00:37:10.950
TOM STANDAGE: Well,
certainly the analogy

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.800
isn't perfect in the sense
that the internet is global,

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.030
instant, searchable,
and maybe, permanent.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.530
We don't know how
permanent it is.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.460
So the analogy though
I think is close enough

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.430
to be informative because we
see the same social reactions.

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.590
And my thesis is, in all of
my writing about the history

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.080
of technology, that we
essentially-- our brains

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.790
are still running
the same Stone Age

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.390
software and
different technologies

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.370
come and go and just push the
same buttons in our brains.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.520
So the Twitter pushes
the same button for me

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.090
as coffeehouses did
for the Samuel Pepys.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:46.800
So in that sense, I'm sort of
arguing that the rate of change

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.300
doesn't--

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.260
You know, people have always
complained about this before.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.190
A good example would
be the step change

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:56.590
in the range of information
that occurred with the telegraph

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.120
in the 19th century.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.620
If you look at how
stockbrokers used

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.450
to deal with their
clients, you might

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:04.257
meet your stockbroker once a
year, or maybe twice a year.

00:38:04.257 --> 00:38:05.965
And you might say,
I'm going to sell tea,

00:38:05.965 --> 00:38:06.882
I'm going to buy gold.

00:38:06.882 --> 00:38:08.798
What you think will
happen to the price of tea

00:38:08.798 --> 00:38:09.909
in next six months?

00:38:09.909 --> 00:38:11.450
And then the telegraph
meant that you

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.230
could have multiple price
updates every day, globally.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:18.920
And stockbrokers were not really
terribly impressed by this.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.246
Because it meant that they
had to work a lot harder,

00:38:21.246 --> 00:38:22.620
they were always
getting messages

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.286
to buy or sell this,
that and the other.

00:38:24.286 --> 00:38:26.039
And they thought this
was a big problem.

00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:28.330
But of course, then the next
generation of stockbrokers

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.880
thought this was totally
normal and got used to it.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.190
So we actually see this
pattern again and again.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:36.400
And we see the complaint
that attention spans

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.350
are getting shorter.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.380
We particularly see it with
the telegraph, actually.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.600
That it makes people nervous.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.700
That we only skim the
surface of things.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.015
That it leads to politicians
speaking in soundbites.

00:38:47.015 --> 00:38:48.390
These are all
actually complaints

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.140
that arrive in the 19th century.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.040
So they're not actually new
and the world didn't end then.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.290
People have gotten used to it.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.248
So I think that just
tells us that we will just

00:38:56.248 --> 00:38:57.260
get used to it again.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.140
We'll have to find and
identify and create

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.190
these coping mechanisms.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.720
Some of which are
technological, like tables

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.250
of contents or search engines.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.640
And some of which are
social technologies,

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.960
customs about how we should
and should not use things.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.210
But that's what's particularly
bewildering about this.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.180
And living through a period
where we're still figuring out

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:18.060
our answers to those questions.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.935
AUDIENCE: I was just
looking at your timeline

00:39:19.935 --> 00:39:22.870
and wanting to go
back the other way.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.120
I think you can add two
more giant blocks of time

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.620
to that view which
is the Dark Ages.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.590
Which was a very centralized
media from the church world.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.600
There's a thousand year block
where it wasn't the old media.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.690
TOM STANDAGE: So
what's the other block?

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:35.065
AUDIENCE: There
was another block

00:39:35.065 --> 00:39:37.925
before that was in the age
of primitives and ziggurats.

00:39:37.925 --> 00:39:39.200
Again, strong central control.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.500
TOM STANDAGE: Well, yes
I see what you mean.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.295
Especially, it
depends what you mean

00:39:42.295 --> 00:39:43.310
by the consumption of media.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.060
So most people aren't
consuming it at all.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.457
In the Dark Ages, you've got--

00:39:46.457 --> 00:39:47.790
AUDIENCE: Well, it's the church.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.831
TOM STANDAGE: You've got
monks writing stuff out,

00:39:49.831 --> 00:39:52.330
and then you've got the pulpit
as a sort of quasi broadcast

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:52.830
medium.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.370
Yes.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:56.232
But I think that most
people are not-- where

00:39:56.232 --> 00:39:58.690
are they getting-- they're just
not consuming media at all.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.460
So the actual-- so it's
very hard to work out what

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:06.330
the balance of
distributed versus--

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.130
centralized versus
social media is--

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:12.200
I should also stress this is
very much Western centric view.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.830
I have been looking for
non Western examples,

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.900
and there's some quite
nice cases of social poetry

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.124
in 10th and 11th century
Japan, for example.

00:40:20.124 --> 00:40:21.540
And what I'm hoping
will happen is

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.335
that the publication
of this book

00:40:22.335 --> 00:40:24.520
will sort of flush
out some more examples

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.340
and I'll be able to broaden it.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.350
Going back to the period
before the Romans,

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:30.970
I think basically the
literacy rates were very low.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.410
If you look at-- there are
examples of-- you'll see,

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.360
there are a couple I have
in the book where they're

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.670
are scribes in Egypt who
have a sort of poetry club.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.870
And they send each other poems.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:45.460
But they were really very,
very few examples of it

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:49.190
because literacy is
so so restricted.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:53.130
And in fact, in Egypt's,
the scribes deliberately

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.320
avoided adopting the much
more efficient technology

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.237
of the alphabet
because they wanted

00:40:57.237 --> 00:40:58.570
it to be hard to read and write.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.130
Because they wanted to
preserve their special status

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.040
as people who could do it.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.870
And so, they actually fought
against this far more efficient

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.540
way of the way of doing things.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.130
So that's why I think it
really starts with the Romans

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:14.960
where you have a reasonably
widespread use of media

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.460
by ordinary people and then they
are sharing it in a social way.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.800
AUDIENCE: The Library of
Alexandria comes to mind.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.790
Also, the retrieving of the
Buddhist [INAUDIBLE] from India

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:27.557
and spread of Buddhism on
the Silk Road is another--

00:41:27.557 --> 00:41:29.140
TOM STANDAGE: So the
retrieval of-- So

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.010
that's involving
written documents.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.780
AUDIENCE: Written
documents, yes.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:31.890
TOM STANDAGE: Oh, brilliant.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:32.390
They-- yeah.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:36.350
So this is the kind of thing
that is being flushed out.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:37.980
That's what I want to find.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.585
Thank you.

00:41:38.585 --> 00:41:43.920
AUDIENCE: You were saying
that if your book was copied

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:49.790
or your letter was copied
in-- that's like re tweeting.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.610
And now, people whenever
they publish something

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.870
or your YouTube videos
if a lot of views

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.540
then you're theoretically--
right-- making more money?

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.710
But that didn't seem
to be part of it.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:01.650
Because if that
happened today, right,

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:03.566
there would be all this
copyright, oh my gosh,

00:42:03.566 --> 00:42:04.724
people are selling my book.

00:42:04.724 --> 00:42:06.390
So was they're not--
I mean, were people

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.067
not trying to earn money?

00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:10.150
There's definitely some
difference here, I'm not--

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:11.608
TOM STANDAGE: Yeah
no, that's true.

00:42:11.608 --> 00:42:14.370
So I mean, copyrights are
a relatively modern idea.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.140
It goes back to the beginning
of the 18th century.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.440
And so Roman authors
didn't expect

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.190
to be able to make
money because they knew

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.150
that the only way to
get their book out

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:27.340
there was unrestricted
copying by the audience.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.129
And that was-- they
couldn't imagine

00:42:30.129 --> 00:42:31.420
that any other way of doing it.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:35.830
And they wrote books with a
view to becoming more famous,

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:39.600
winning patronage,
getting a nice job.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.900
And that's how they
benefited from them.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.220
So that's clearly a different
way of doing things.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.400
What then later
happens with printing

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.350
is that pamphleteers
would be paid

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.220
little or nothing
to write pamphlets.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.849
They would be paid in the form
of copies of their pamphlets

00:42:56.849 --> 00:42:58.140
that they could give to people.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.380
And again, it was
a patronage thing.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.740
So it's rather like the
deal I have with Wordpress.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.320
Which is that I don't pay
them, but I give them content

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.070
and then they gave
me distribution.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:12.150
So I'm paid back in the
ability to reach an audience.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:14.990
So that's quite a similar model.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.250
And this idea that you own
stuff and you have a right

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.400
to make money from it is
actually quite recent.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.790
And as we can see, it
it's now become harder

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.980
to enforce than it used to be.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.050
So that sort of
ownership of content

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:32.800
is very much a mass media
way of looking at the world.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.350
And we do see some
people asking,

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.715
how you look beyond that?

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:40.347
Should you have your music on
Spotify and then make money?

00:43:40.347 --> 00:43:42.180
But you hardly make
anything from it at all.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.690
And make money from other
things if you're a musician?

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:45.950
And to what extent?

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.580
Cory Doctorow gives away
his books as ebooks.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.620
And we're all trying to work
out what the sort of new models

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.400
are around that.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.240
But there were
people in the past

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.170
you managed to make a
living from doing things

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.550
in a sort of indirect way.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.890
So maybe we can borrow
some of their models.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:05.330
AUDIENCE: I haven't
read the book,

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.330
so I'm not sure if
there's a chapter that

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.150
talks about the culture
difference like West

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.930
or East difference in terms of
the influence of social media

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:15.270
revolution?

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:16.777
And also--

00:44:16.777 --> 00:44:18.360
TOM STANDAGE: I only
consider Western.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.276
AUDIENCE: Western, OK.

00:44:19.276 --> 00:44:22.660
TOM STANDAGE: So I'm aware
of a few examples in Asia,

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.920
but like I don't feel I
can see into the literature

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.070
there so I don't think
I have a sort of-- I'm

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:33.630
very aware of my limitations
of my understanding of that.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.690
So I'd be grateful for
any suggestions you have.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:44.910
How do you see the difference
in the attitude towards those?

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.215
AUDIENCE: I'm from China.

00:44:46.215 --> 00:44:53.510
At least, you know I don't
know too much on the old media

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:54.010
phase.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:59.680
But even in the current phase,
right, after 2000, there's

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:04.255
no social network but there's
a similar-- Facebook, Twitter,

00:45:04.255 --> 00:45:05.330
like that.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:09.710
But they all are kind
of run differently.

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.060
At the least, it's
not truly distributed.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.650
You still have a
little bit censored

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.840
under government control.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.940
So that's kind of a
very hybrid model.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:22.940
TOM STANDAGE: Well, yes.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.940
I mean, to be honest, one
of the striking things

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.014
about social networking
in the West as well today

00:45:28.014 --> 00:45:29.430
is that it's
extremely centralized

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.050
and it's run by
private companies.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:33.760
So we treat it as though
it's a public sphere,

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.620
but it's not really.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.606
It's not a town square,
it's more like a mall.

00:45:37.606 --> 00:45:38.480
It's privately owned.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.605
And if Facebook doesn't
like something that you say

00:45:40.605 --> 00:45:42.921
or whatever they can
shut down your page.

00:45:42.921 --> 00:45:45.170
But again, I think there's
a historical analogy there.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:48.020
Which is if you look at what
happened to AOL and CompuServe,

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.610
they were swept away by the open
standards of web publishing.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.400
And I wonder whether the same
is true for social media.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.380
There have been various attempts
to build open distributed

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.570
standards for social media.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:02.880
But it seems weird that
I can set up my own web

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.986
server or my own
email server, but I

00:46:05.986 --> 00:46:07.360
have to go to
Facebook or Twitter

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.420
or Google to do
social networking.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.080
So that's one of things
I'm very interested to see

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:12.860
how that changes.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.920
Because that may be
a historical anomaly.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.920
It's just that doing
timely, in order delivery

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.820
of social streams is really,
really hard distributing.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.590
Usenet used to do this.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:25.180
And it didn't do
it terribly well.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.140
It was very slow.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.610
So there are advantages
to a centralized model,

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.499
but there are drawbacks as well.

00:46:31.499 --> 00:46:33.040
AUDIENCE: So there's
a concept called

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.820
WeMedia is that you can comment.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.780
WeMedia.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.930
I think at least in
China it's very popular.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.950
You just set up some
site, and the public,

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:47.710
some journalism
just quit that job.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.044
It run some sites themselves a--

00:46:49.044 --> 00:46:51.251
TOM STANDAGE: But it's still
a centralized site then.

00:46:51.251 --> 00:46:54.390
I mean, I think we need a sort
of equivalent to iMap or HTTP

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:59.450
that does establishing social
connections-- basically

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:04.300
friend connections, status
updates, that sort of stuff.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.410
And there have been
various attempts to do it.

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.320
The most recent one
was called Temp.iO,

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.827
which was quite
clever I thought.

00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:11.660
But it's hard to see
how any of these things

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:15.360
can get off the
ground because you

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.390
need to get the ball rolling.

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:19.730
And the existing networks
have such a big advantage

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.260
because they have these
massive advantages of scale.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.390
So I don't know.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:28.340
But it happened with the
web, so maybe it can happen.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:28.840
Thank you.

00:47:32.926 --> 00:47:35.590
Great, well, thank
you all very much,

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:39.280
and it's great to be here.
