00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.780
Have you ever shared a GIF from your favorite
movie or Instagrammed some meme you found online?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.920
In that moment, did you ever think about where
that content came from and if you were allowed
to use it?

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.880
Did you consider that it may actually be illegal
to share it?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.140
Or at least in some legal no man’s land?

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.000
Probably not, and it’s ok, we’re not calling
the cops on you.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.140
A lot of what we consider everyday internet culture
– retweets and memes and viral videos – is built on
this kind of casual, everyday sharing.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.700
We forward links and remix photos and songs...

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.040
But what happens when what we’re sharing
is someone else’s property?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.540
Or could harm somebody?

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.080
The internet gave tons of people access to
tools for communication and media creation.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.460
But it also opened up many legal loopholes
and muddied the waters of rights and regulations.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.660
In our last episode, I talked all about the
big, macro companies that rule our media world.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.820
Today we’re focusing on how new media is
changing our real world lived experiences,
down to the letter of the law.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:09.800
[Theme Music]

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.500
The media economy is ruled by profits, yes,
but also by the governments and industry
organizations who set out to regulate it.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.840
Just as the big media companies need to follow
certain rules, so do media consumers (that’s you).

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.720
Over the past few years many media-related
laws have had to adapt dramatically to changing
times and incredible leaps in technology.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.840
One such law you’ve probably heard a lot
about is copyright.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.200
Copyright gives creators of media the exclusive
rights to their creations.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.380
They can copy, modify, distribute, or show
off their works however they want.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.700
Others need to get permission to use them.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.000
This helps creators make money from and get
credit for their work.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.720
But a copyright isn’t a total monopoly on
a work.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.420
Thanks to the notion of fair use, the public
can exercise its first amendment rights by using
others’ work without permission.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.590
That is, as long as it transforms the work
in some way.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.040
In fact, there are four factors courts use
to determine whether a use is fair.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.860
First is the purpose and character of the
work.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.940
Many educational uses of media, like showing a
film in class, are protected under fair use
because they’re not for commercial purposes.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.320
Other protected uses are criticism, commentary
(like parody), research and scholarship.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.860
Second is the nature of the copyrighted work.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.680
Copyright law is meant to encourage creative
expression.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.480
You can’t copyright facts, but you can copyright
something you imagined.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.380
Creative media like a movie or a song, something
that takes imagination, is more difficult to use fairly.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.800
But with fact-based media, like news articles
or a documentary, there are more options for
fair use, like education or parody.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.240
Third is the amount of the piece used from
the copyrighted work.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.120
If the use employs a tiny proportion of
the copyrighted work, it’s more likely to be
deemed fair.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.740
Fourth is the effect of the use on the market
for the copyrighted work.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.960
So, streaming a bootleg version of Titanic
isn’t fair, because it directly competes with
lawful streaming services.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.280
But your version of Titanic that replaces all
the characters’ voices with chipmunk sounds –

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.540
that’s unlikely to “compete” for the attention
of people looking to watch the original.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.499
But, Fair Use isn’t the only way that media
is allowed to be adapted by the public.

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.859
There’s an expanse of media works that are
available in the public domain.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.580
This is the set of all works whose copyright
has expired and are free to use by anyone.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.980
Characters like Robin Hood and Sherlock Holmes
are in the public domain.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.640
So between Copyright, Fair Use, and Public
Domain – you have the three pillars of Intellectual
Property in everyday media.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.260
Seems pretty cut and dry, right?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.600
Well, it kinda was before the internet.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.099
Before many more people had the ability to
use copyrighted material at the speed of light.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:48.260
During the 1990s, established media corporations,
like the music industry, began to get real upset about
the way the internet was challenging the status quo.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.680
Media was getting copied and shared and
moved around faster than ever before – and
they wanted to stop it.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.660
This all culminated in the 1998 Digital Millennium
Copyright Act or DMCA.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.549
You might have heard of the DMCA.

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.920
It does a LOT of things, but one obvious thing it
does is give copyright holders the ability to make
claims against content on digital platforms.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.280
In fact, once it was enacted, The Record Industry
Association of America even targeted young internet
users who downloaded copyrighted materials with
lawsuits.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.820
And if you’ve ever seen a YouTube video
vanish beneath an “infringing content claim”
– that’s thanks to the DMCA.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.700
So in this brave new world of digital media
and pop music anime lip sync mashups, how
DO you know if your use is fair?

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.540
Let’s head into the Thought Bubble to find
out.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.020
Let’s say you want to make a montage video of
your two favorite characters from your favorite TV
show: Archie and Veronica from Riverdale.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.420
(Apologies to Barchie or Beronica shippers.)

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.260
You pull together cute clips from the show
and pop on your favorite Taylor Swift song
– Love Story, obvs – in the background.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.060
Now is it fair use?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.880
First step: what’s the purpose and character
of your work?

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.200
Your purpose is to get all the likes, but
also to prove that Varchie is the OTP.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.060
You’re not in it for the money and the video
itself is commentary on Riverdale.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.220
Ok, that could pass.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.880
Second: what’s the nature of the copyrighted
work?

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.820
The TV show and the song are definitely creative
and not fact-based, so yeah, that’s a strike.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.380
Like I said, it’s harder to use an imaginative
work like a movie or a song.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.500
Third: How much did you use of the show and
the song?

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.120
You definitely only used clips of the show, a
couple of seconds each of a whole season of TV.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.580
That would probably get a pass.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.680
But you did use the whole song – that’s
not cool.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.540
Strike two.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.680
Finally: what effect would your work have
on the market for the works you used?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.120
Since someone couldn’t reasonably watch your
clip video instead of watching the full Riverdale
series on TV, that’s probably fair use.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.080
But someone could just listen to your video
instead of buying that Taylor Swift song.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.540
Sorry, no matter how perfectly “Love Story”
encapsulates Archie and Veronica’s relationship,
you’re not transforming the song.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.420
In fact, you’re using it in a pretty normal
way, like in a movie – except movies pay
to use a song on the soundtrack.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.060
So while the montage of clips you made may
be transformative, the use of the song wouldn’t
be considered fair use.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.600
As you can see, the notion of “fair use”
isn’t cut and dry.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.080
It’s like a puzzle that changes for every
person who tries to solve it.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.280
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:12.980
The thing that makes the DMCA, and intellectual property generally, interesting is that it shows laws trying to play catch up with how media has changed due to technology.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.220
And many of the old definitions and approaches
start to grind when used in this new media ecosystem.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.440
Some challenges to media laws are more high-stakes
than Taylor Swift montages.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.480
Get your giggles out now, kids, cause I’m
about to talk to you about “sexting.”

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.840
So. Urban Dictionary defines “sexting” as...oh.
Oh my. Ah.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.180
Let’s just say that sexting is like...when
two people really like each other, and so
one of them draws the other naked.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.900
Now they have that drawing, and when they
look at it...they uh – you get what I’m saying.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:50.080
It’s no surprise that nowadays, young people
might use their phones to “communicate” in
relationships, rather than paper and charcoal.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.320
The only problem is: what about the law?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.740
First. Most states in the US define
the age of consent.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.920
If two teenagers above the age of consent
want to meet up in the back of a car – there’s
nothing illegal about that.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.920
BUT in the US there are also laws against
the production, possession, or distribution
of child pornography –

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.360
ANY visual depiction of explicit content
involving someone under 18.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.320
Good laws. Important laws.
Super important and good laws.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.180
The problem comes from figuring out what
happens when the legal sexual relationships
between two teenagers –

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:28.080
over the age of consent, but still under 18
– when those relationships start to involve,
you know, sexy pictures.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.900
Because technically – according to U.S. law
– that can be classified as child pornography,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.940
and there are already many examples where
young people have been charged as such.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.180
And these laws are meant to protect children
from sexual abuse.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:46.840
Federal laws carry mandatory minimum
sentencing of five years in prison and registry
as a sex offender for related charges.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.820
These are huge consequences!

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:54.580
Because of this, some states have recognized
sexting as a widespread practice and have
reduced charges accordingly.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.520
But there’s still a grey area, however, between
federal and state laws and local jurisdictions

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.660
– including whether police are allowed to
search a teen’s phone.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:09.360
The point is, these are laws that were made
before our current media moment, colliding with
what has become everyday practice.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:17.000
And the outcome often comes down to a discussion
or a judgement call – often by people who are, let’s say,
not the most plugged in with “kids these days.”

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.220
It might not be the most fun to talk about.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.880
But these gaps – between current media practices and
traditional laws – are already impacting people’s lives.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:31.380
From copyright laws to sexting and cyberbullying,
our online lives have posed some serious challenges
to our legal system.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.040
And many of these questions are still up for
debate.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.280
But maybe none of these have been as tough
to deal with as the issue of online privacy.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.880
Privacy refers to the access, collection and
sharing of personally identifiable information.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:50.220
Online that includes our browsing habits and
history, plus the personal information we share
with all the websites and apps we use.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.880
Traditionally, privacy has determined what
information was allowed to be used in court
cases.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.180
Some private information was protected from
unlawful search and seizure.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.019
But of course, the internet threw a wrench
in that, too.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:07.200
If you use a social media in the public setting,
where anyone can access your posts, is that
public or private?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.080
What about if you use the app in a private
setting, for just your friends and family?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.380
What if you share your private thoughts on
an anonymous, public blog?

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:20.980
On top of these shifting notions about what
constitutes privacy online, protections for accessing
that data are even less clear.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.940
When and where law enforcement can request
or demand access to phones, computers and
social media accounts is often a grey area.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.520
And when they do, what are their rights to
privacy?

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.160
Gen Z will be the first generation to live their
lives on smartphones from such a young age.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.940
Think of all the data they’re sharing about
themselves before they’re able to walk home
alone, let alone drive or vote.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.720
Will that data follow them around, forever?

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:49.900
How would you feel if your first AIM screen
name or all the Snapchats from your awkward
years followed you around forever?

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.000
One response to this problem will take effect
in Europe in May 2018.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.400
The European Union’s General Data Protection
Regulation (or the GDPR for short) is a big, big deal.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.580
This legislation will impact all of the European Union,
affording a stricter right to protect yourself online.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:15.120
Part of this law, the Right to be Forgotten, will make it easier to get rid of personal information that’s been collected about you and make clear what that data is, too.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:22.440
But since this legislation affects multinational corporations like Google and Facebook, the ramifications won’t be stuck on the other side of the pond.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.160
The industry titans are expected to follow
suit across the globe to ensure they remain
compliant.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.760
Clearly, we’ve entered a new paradigm where
our technology is outpacing legislation.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.920
As laws and regulations continue to develop
around our fast-paced digital world, the only
solution is to stay vigilant.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.660
Know what data you’re sharing.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.680
Be careful of downloading or sharing others’
work online.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.220
And remember that your words and your images
have meaning, and can be used against you.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:55.240
Next time on Crash Course: Media Literacy we’ll talk
all about how bad actors can use those vulnerabilities
against us through propaganda and misinformation.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.640
You’ll need the skills we learned today
to dive into the dark side of media.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.980
Until then, I’m Jay Smooth.
See you next time.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.280
Crash Course Media Literacy is filmed in the
Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.260
