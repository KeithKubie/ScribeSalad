00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
To find this out, we sort the list.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here are the ages of the kids,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and here are the ones of the parents.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now we see the median is 4.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Is this a useful statistic?

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Not really.
