00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.220
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I think most people here
know Larry Lessig.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.210
You should know him either from his work at
Stanford or Harvard, Creative Commons, helped

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.190
out the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the
Sunlight Foundation.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.730
There's a whole bunch of places you should
know him from.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
But really the reason why we wanna pay attention
to what he has to say is because he's been

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.220
right on so many issues, whether arguing in
front of the Supreme Court, talking about

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.550
things like copyright extension, or--if people
noticed a few years ago--he started to move

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.039
away from copyright and started to talk about
broader issues.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:42.050
Specifically, the influence or potential corruption
of money in politics and a lot of institutions

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.190
that are important in the United States.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.690
So, I think it's important that we make sure
that Larry not be a Cassandra.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.579
You know, the prophet who could hear the future,
but no one would ever believe her.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.180
And so, I think it's important for us to listen
to what he's got to say today.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.180
Read through the book.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.180
It's really good.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.180
Don't forget to badge in.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.310
But also, after the talk, please take a little
while and ask, "How can we try to make sure

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.470
that he's not a Cassandra--that we do take
these issues seriously?"

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.090
Because, I think, the influence of money in
politics and in our institutions is probably

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.390
the most important issue facing us today in
the United States.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.310
So with that, thanks very much to Larry Lessig.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.590
[applause]

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.729
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: Thank, Matt.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.150
And it's great to be back.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.630
I have one sacred text.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.110
"There are a thousand hacking at the branches
of evil."

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.200
Henry David Thoreau, 1846, on Walden.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.619
There are a thousand hacking at the branches
of evil to one who is striking at the roots.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.420
Imagine a letter written by a young woman.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.250
"There were two clocks regulating our life--the
one on the wall and the one in the bottle.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.149
We built our life around those clocks.

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.420
He slept late so mornings were bliss.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.069
“We could play and laugh without fear.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.410
But at some point, he would awake.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.709
And soon after he woke, the bottle was opened.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.569
And then the older the day grew, the more
terrifying my life became.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.360
He was happy at first--just before dinner,
the most happy.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.290
“That's the only time I spoke to him, a
moment to pretend I had a father who had a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.430
feeling of love.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.430
He'd smile.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.430
He'd laugh.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.840
But then, he'd grow irritated.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.560
And by the end of dinner, he was angry and
if we weren't gone--usually just hiding in

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.629
our room by nine--he'd be violent.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.190
He hit me more than once.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.350
“Once he tried to do something worse than
hitting me and then I left and I never went

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.129
back.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.349
We struggled to do many things in that house
to keep food in the house, to keep the winter

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.740
out of the house, to keep the house.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.299
But the one thing we never even spoke about
was getting him to stop.

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.840
“I don't know why.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.540
The bottle was just part of our life.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.560
We learned to live with it.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.190
Anything more just seemed impossible."

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:23.400
Now, the thing about us--we humans--is that
we adapt, we adjust, we learn to live with

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.909
it until we can't.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.330
And then a certain fever breaks out and if
we're lucky, we have this Thoreauvian moment--a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.299
recognition that we have to stop hacking at
the branches and start striking at the roots,

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.799
the recognition that we have to become this
sense of a root striker.

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:42.909
OK.

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.960
So, here's the argument here.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.379
I think that there's this feeling among too
many of us Americans that we just might not

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.379
make it.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.870
Not that the end is near or that doom is around
the corner, but that a distinctly American

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.120
feeling of inevitability of greatness, culturally,
economically, politically, is gone--that we

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.060
have become Britain or Rome or Greece.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.579
A generation ago, Ronald Reagan rallied the
nation to deny a similar charge: Jimmy Carter's

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.420
fear that we had fallen into a state of malaise.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.420
And I confess.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.140
I was one of those so rallied and I still
believe Reagan was right today.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.940
But the feeling I'm talking about today is
different.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.950
Not that we, as a people, have lost anything
of our potential, but that we, as a Republic,

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.460
have.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:45.310
That our capacity for governing, the one thing
that we were once most proud of, this our

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.260
Republic, is the one thing that we have all
learned to ignore.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.330
Government is an embarrassment.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.610
And it has lost the capacity to make the most
essential decisions and slowly it dawns upon

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.000
us that a ship that cannot be steered is a
ship that will sink.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.590
This is not a Democratic or Republican point
alone.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.100
This is a genuinely multi-partisan frustration.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.120
The sense that the government doesn't work
is signaled by many different policy areas

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.070
on the left and the right, which systematically
get blocked.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.880
And when confronted with this systematic block,
my suggestion is we need to exercise this

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.080
Thoreauvian insight.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.970
So, my objective this afternoon is to do a
little bit of brainwashing.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.970
[laughter]

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.710
To get you to the place that you see the roots
that I want you to see.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.970
I'm gonna do that with three some examples.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.970
One of them is familiar.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.140
Indeed, I told a similar story here the last
time I was here--the story around copyright.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:52.280
On October 27th, 1998, I became a copyright
activist the day President Clinton signed

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.100
into law a statute in honor of this great
American, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.310
Act--a statute which extended the term of
existing copyrights by 20 years.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.920
Now, the question Congress was supposed to
be asking when it passed that statute was,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.520
"Would it advance the public good to extend
the term of an existing copyright by 20 years?"

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.150
Copyrights are designed to create incentives,
but we know about this universe.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.110
Put aside Star Trek for a moment.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.300
What we know about this universe is that its
incentives are prospective.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:33.570
So, not even the United States Congress can
get George Gershwin to produce anything more.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.570
[laughter]

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.030
So when you ask the question, "Does it make
sense to advance the public good to extend

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.620
the term of existing copyright?" it's a pretty
easy answer.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.340
Indeed, when we challenged this statute in
the Supreme Court and a bunch of economists

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.520
wanted to sign a brief saying it did not advance
the public good, this liberal, left-wing--.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.660
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.660
Wait.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.230
This is Milton Friedman--right-wing, Nobel
Prize winning economist, agreed to sign the

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.930
brief but only if the word "no brainer" was
in the brief somewhere.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.180
[laughter]

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.490
So obvious was it that you could not extend
the public good by extending the term of existing

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.490
copyrights.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.250
But apparently there were no brains in this
place when Congress unanimously extended the

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.370
term of these existing copyrights.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.930
What there was, was more than six million
dollars in contributions from Disney and related

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.030
corporations seeking the extension of their
valuable copyrights--the public be damned.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.350
Here's another example.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.350
Wall Street Journal, at the end of last year,
was puzzled about the explosion of temporary

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.430
tax provisions in our tax code.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.970
These temporary tax provisions expire after
a limited period of time.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:47.060
And that leads to this extender mania, as
lobbyists and Congress race around to try

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.190
to extend the particular tax provision for
another period of time.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:57.000
And the Journal wondered what explains the
explosion and change in the number of these

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
extensions.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.780
Well, it turns out the first of these temporary
provisions was given to us by Reagan in 1981.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.260
Congress passed the Research and Development
Tax Credit.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.070
But because the Democrats were skeptical about
whether it would work, they made the tax credit

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.070
temporary.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.830
They said they would test it after a number
of years.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.160
And if it turned out it worked, they would
make it permanent.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.050
If it didn't work, they would repeal it.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.870
So, after a couple years, the economists asked
the question, "Did it work?"

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.390
The answer is yes.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.160
Left and right economists all agreed that
it did work.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.940
It was a great tax idea.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.090
It spurred a kind of investment that otherwise
would not have been spurred.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.720
And so, it made sense absolutely to make this
part of the tax code.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.000
Here's the puzzle.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.960
It is still temporary to this day.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.960
Why?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.660
Well, as Rebecca Kysar describes in this piece
in the Georgia Law Review, "The principle

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.890
recipients of the research credit are large
US manufacturing corporations.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.740
These business entities are more than willing
to invest in lobbying activities and campaign

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.960
donations to ensure the continuance of this
large tax savings."

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.920
The Institute for Policy Innovation put it
a little bit more sharply.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.740
"This cycle has repeated for years.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.950
Congress allows the credit to lapse until
another short extension is given.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:15.240
Proceeded, of course, by a series of fundraisers
and speeches about the importance of nurturing

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240
innovation.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.600
Congress essentially uses the cycle to raise
money for re-election, promising industry

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.480
more predictability the next time around."

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.840
Now this dynamic is central to how Washington
works.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.820
We architect tax policy in part, at least,
not just to raise money for our treasury,

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.460
but to make it easier to raise money for our
Congressmen's campaigns.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.700
And not just tax policy.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.250
When Al Gore was Vice President, he had an
idea to simplify the regulation governing

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.560
infrastructure that internet would come across.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.780
Right now, we have two titles in the Communications
Act--Title Two and Title Six.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.140
Title Two governs telephones.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.340
Title Six governs cable.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.380
Those are two radically different regulatory
structures.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.940
Gore's idea was to put them together in a
Title Seven and fundamentally deregulate them--much

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.930
less than even network neutrality regulation
would require.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.110
His team took the idea to Capitol Hill and
the chief policy person described--the reaction,

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.680
he said the reaction was quote, "Hell no.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:26.090
If we deregulate these guys, how are we going
to raise money from them?"

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.440
And you get this kind of sinking, terrifying
feeling here, right?

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.660
Recognizing that we tax in part to make it
easy to raise campaign funds.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:39.830
We regulate, in part, to make it easier to
raise campaign funds.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:45.820
Campaign funds driving critical areas of fiscal
policy unrelated to the merits of the underlying

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.420
fiscal policy.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.420
Here's the third example.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.420
Think about Wall Street.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.410
We've of course seen this collapse on Wall
Street, which triggered a collapse in the

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.410
economy.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.410
What explains that collapse?

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:01.160
Well, as Simon Johnson and James Kwak describe
in their book, "13 Bankers," part of the explanation

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.430
is this perverse mix of too little government
and too much government.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.980
Too little government in the form of deregulation.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:15.360
In the 1990s, we saw an explosion of financial
innovations, derivatives.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.060
But these innovations were essentially invisible
to the market because a series of regulatory

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:26.760
changes in the 1990s made derivatives, unlike
other financial assets, not subject to the

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.930
standard requirements that have existed since
the new deal that they be traded on public

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:39.260
exchanges, transparently with anti-fraud obligations
tied to every transaction.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:46.140
So, my colleague, Frank Partnoy, calculated
that in 1980, 98 percent of assets traded

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:53.740
in our economy were traded under these standard
new deal, trade-based rules.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:12:02.140
But by 2008, 90 percent of the assets traded
in our economy were exempted from these exchange-based

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.090
rules, could be traded without transparency,
could be traded without anybody knowing what

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.630
the prices would be for.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.710
It could be traded without any anti-fraud
requirements being tied to them, producing

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:18.529
this shadow banking market, which encouraged--because
of the uncertainty it spewed everywhere--the

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:21.750
bubble which eventually burst and brought
the economy down.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.330
But that alone, Kwak and Johnson say, wasn't
enough.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.430
In addition, we had too much government.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:34.170
Throughout the 1990s, there was a beacon,
a constant signal from the government that

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.920
there was, in effect, a government guarantee
that when this bubble burst there would be

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:45.220
a bailout on the other side producing what
is the dumbest form of socialism ever invented

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.940
by man--socialized risk and privatized benefit.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.740
We suffer the downside.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.480
They get the upside.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.500
Now I know you guys are not lawyers.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.600
This is a technical legal term, but this is
an insanely stupid way--

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.910
[laughter]

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.810
to set up a financial system.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.570
And all that stupidity is just before 2008.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:14.730
Even worse is after 2008, where we add insult
to injury in the way that Congress increasingly

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.730
functions.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:21.100
Because after 2008, after the worst crisis
since the Depression, after all who are not

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:26.170
involved in that crisis had concluded that
one of the principle causes to that crisis

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:31.740
was the architecture of deregulation that
Wall Street had purchased until 2008, after

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:37.270
the dean of deregulation, the Ayn Rand-ian,
Alan Greenspan, Head of the Fed, confessed

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.710
in testimony to Congress that he was quote
"mistaken" about whether the banks would act

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.120
in the public interest as opposed to their
private interest.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:51.620
After all of that, Wall Street was still powerful
enough to blackmail the Democrats and Republicans

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:59.410
both to give them an essential "get out of
jail free" card and to keep the core flaw

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.630
of our architecture of regulation the same.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:09.550
If the banks were too big to fail before 2008,
the banks are only too bigger to fail after

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:15.839
2008, leading many Independents of Wall Street
to include that our risk of a collapse is

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:19.480
greater today than it was before the collapse
in 2008.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.180
Again, why?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.770
What would explain this stupidity in the architecture
of regulation?

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.630
Well, lots of possible reasons, but here's
the one thing we know.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:35.800
The fastest growing sector in campaign contributions
since 1991, and the largest chunk of contributions

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.860
in the 2010 election, come from the finance
and insurance industries.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.860
OK.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.980
Here's one final example.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.980
I'm sure many of you, when you saw these images,
had a question in the back of your head.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:52.270
How was it that it's possible to launch such
an experimental drilling platform, as the

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:56.850
Deepwater Horizon, without extensive environmental
impact and risk studies?

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.440
All right.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:04.710
In my part of the country, we've just spent
nine years and ten thousand pages of environmental

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:09.870
impact studies to permit the construction
of this green energy technology.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:15.279
So, exactly how much was required before they
were able to build the experimental deep water

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.910
drilling platform, which was the Deepwater
Horizon?

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:26.051
The answer is 17 pages before they were exempted
from any further need for review, leading

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.690
Congress to be shocked of course.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:35.170
[plays video clip]
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I am shocked--shocked--to find

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.170
that gambling is going on in here.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.170
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Your winnings, sir.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.170
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thank you very much.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.170
Everybody out in front.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.170
[laughter]

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.170
[end video clip]

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.170
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: And of course, it was Congress
that had required these fast track approval

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.399
processes, leading again to the question,
"What would ever convince them that fast track

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:47.750
approval on experimental drilling wells made
sense?"

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.200
Lots of possible answers to that question.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.000
The one thing we know is endless campaign
cash driving to this conclusion.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.750
Now, here's the point.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:16:02.930
No respectable Liberal or Libertarian or Conservative
could defend these cases.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:08.810
Each of them is an abomination from each of
those three political philosophy perspectives.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.480
So, how is it they become policy in the United
States?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.420
Now, it turns out political sciences are uncertain.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.890
They say it's a little bit complex.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.270
But here's the thing.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.190
You believe you know.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.710
I just had to point to point to the money.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:28.950
And you believe you now know the root cause
to this stupidity.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.800
And that's the core of my claim.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.830
Number one, it is because of cases like this,
and I could go on for hours, I promise--millions

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:41.680
of cases like this--that Americans believe
money buys results in Congress.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.180
Seventy-five percent of Americans in a poll
that we conducted for my book conclude money

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.740
buys results in Congress.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.520
You think, "What were the 25 percent thinking?"

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.520
I don't know.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.520
[laughter]

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.190
But a little bit more Democrats than Republicans.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.960
But I guarantee you when the Republicans were
not in control, it was just as many Republicans

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.960
as Democrats.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:06.069
So, whether it's two-thirds or three-fourths,
here's the thing we Americans all agree about.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.930
Money buys results in Congress.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.220
Leading to number two.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.840
A belief in money buying results erodes trust
in the institution.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:23.660
So, last year Gallup concluded that eleven
percent of Americans have confidence in Congress.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.030
Gallup's number this year is a little more
optimistic.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.079
They say 12 percent.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.079
[laughter]

00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:33.590
But I just read today in the New York Times--New
York Times CBS poll says that nine percent

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.980
of Americans have confidence in Congress.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:42.530
To keep this in some context, right, it is
certainly the case that there were more people

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:48.020
who believed in the British crown at the time
of the Revolution than believe in our Congress

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.020
today.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.020
[laughter]

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.660
And at what point does an institution have
to declare political bankruptcy?

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.309
At what point has it just lost the credibility
with the people?

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:59.300
What, nine percent isn't enough?

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.300
Five percent?

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.520
What is the number when we have to say there
is no more confidence in this government?

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.750
And that leads to number three.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.520
Low trust erodes participation in the system.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.929
Rock the Vote, the organization that registered
and turned out to vote the largest number

00:18:13.929 --> 00:18:19.020
of young people who ever voted in the history
of this nation, and arguably delivered the

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.420
election to Barack Obama, in 2010, found a
large number of their voters were not gonna

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.420
turn out and vote.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.510
So, they polled them.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.510
Why?

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.020
Number one answer to that poll by far--two
to one over the second highest--was "no matter

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:36.880
who wins, corporate interest will still have
too much power and prevent real change."

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.100
And it's not just kids who think this.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.340
The vast majority of people, who could have
voted, didn't vote and didn't vote in part

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.460
because of this belief precisely.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.620
Now here, I'm gonna shift into professor mode.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.770
Here's my blackboard.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.000
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.130
That wasn't the intent.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.160
Framers of our Constitution gave us, as Conservatives
like to remind us, a Republic.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:05.809
But what they meant by a Republic was a quote
"representative democracy."

00:19:05.809 --> 00:19:10.260
And what they meant by a representative democracy
as Federalist 52 puts it was, "a government

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.400
that would have a branch quote 'dependent
upon the people alone.'"

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400
OK?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.310
So, here's the model of government.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.310
We have the people.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.310
We have the government.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.570
I do my own slides, so it's cool the way that
bounces, right?

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.570
[laughter]

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.320
The people, the government, marionette relationship
between the two.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.630
Here's the problem.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.220
Congress has evolved a different dependence.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.950
It's not just the people and the government.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.670
Increasingly, it's the funders and the people
and the government.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:43.900
In a world where members spend between 30
and 70 percent of their time raising money

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:49.370
to get back to Congress, or to get their Party
back into power--they can't help, like each

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:56.460
of you couldn't help--developing a sixth sense,
a constant awareness about how what they do

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.380
might affect their ability to raise money.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.540
In the words of the "X-Files," they become
shape-shifters, constantly adjusting their

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.540
positions.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.309
Not on issues one to ten, but issue eleven
to five hundred in light of what they know

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.330
will raise money.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.290
Leslie Byrne describes it when she came to
Congress.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.309
She's a Democrat from Virginia.

00:20:15.309 --> 00:20:19.520
She was told by a colleague quote, "Always
lean to the green."

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.380
And then to clarify, she went on, "he was
not an environmentalist."

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.950
[laughter]

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:32.380
Now, the point is this a dependence, too.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:39.270
But it's a different and conflicting dependence
from a dependence upon the people alone because--surprise,

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.230
surprise--the funders are not the people.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:50.240
Indeed, candidates pay attention in campaigns
most to those who max out in the campaign.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.150
So, what percentage of Americans maxed out
in 2010 in congressional elections in either

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.910
of the two cycles?

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:01.299
The answer is point zero five percent of Americans.

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:05.809
So, the Occupy Wall Street people are so proud
of their slogan, "We are the 99 percent."

00:21:05.809 --> 00:21:06.809
Bad marketing.

00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:09.640
They are the 99 point nine five percent,--

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.640
[laughter]

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.799
who don't get listened to because they are
not in the point zero five percent of people

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:19.360
who are directly tied into the influence that
is our government.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.100
Now, this is--Supreme Court doesn't recognize
this yet, but you should.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.970
This is corruption.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:32.880
It's not the corruption of brown paper bags
secreting cash among members of Congress.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.770
Up through the middle of the 20th Century,
members of Congress had safes in their office

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:38.770
for cash.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.430
You think to yourselves, "I didn't know that
they paid Congressmen in cash."

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.430
They didn't.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.430
[laughter]

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.340
They just discovered that there would be cash
on their desk and they needed a place to keep

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.340
it.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.330
[laughter] So, that was the way things were.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.870
But that's not the problem today.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:56.240
Our Congress, in that sense, is the cleanest
Congress in the history of Congress.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.220
It's not filled with Rod Blagojeviches.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.160
It's not filled with people who are violating
any law.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.610
None of the corruption I'm talking about is
illegal.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.690
It's all legal, in plain sight.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:13.930
But it is corruption because it's relative
to the baseline the framers gave us of the

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.440
dependence upon the people alone.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.070
We have corrupted that dependence.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:23.860
It is a dependence corruption because the
wrong dependence has been allowed to step

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.570
into the middle of this system.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.970
So then, what does the corruption do?

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.660
How does it affect the results?

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.559
Well, you can think about its effect in substance.

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:39.390
But it turns out, interestingly, bizarrely,
but interestingly, this controversy about

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.470
whether it affects the results.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.990
There's some people who believe it doesn't
affect the results.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:51.600
Indeed, the former Chairman of the Federal
Election Commission, Bradley Smith--I quote

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.340
in his book, said this.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:59.460
"The evidence is pretty overwhelming that
money does not play much of a role in what

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.140
goes on in terms of legislative voting patterns
and legislative behavior.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:09.590
The consensus about that among people who
have studied it, is roughly the same as the

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.540
consensus among scientists that global warming
is taking place."

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.540
[laughter]

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.810
Now, to be clear, Bradley Smith is not a global
warming denier.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.000
He is a corruption denier.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.170
And he said this--we were on in interview
on the radio.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.170
I just couldn't believe it.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.290
I had to tweet it.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.410
But then I got in a lot of trouble for this
hash tag.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:28.410
[laughter]

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.190
But of course, that hash tag just means Bradley
Smith--

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:31.190
[laughter]

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.190
just talking about--.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.190
OK.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:37.490
So, do we have evidence that the results are
a function of the money?

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.360
Well, there's lots of recent studies that
are beginning to make this absolutely compelling.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.460
One of my favorites is this piece by Clayton
Peoples that looks at seven thousand votes

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.559
over a period of 1991 to 2006.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:52.740
It concludes, can show a statistically significant
contributor influence in at least seven of

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.910
the eight Houses.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:58.110
The one House you couldn't show it was the
House that passed the McCain-Feingold Campaign

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.220
Reform Act.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.020
So they were thinking good in that one term,
but not any other period.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.790
But I think more interesting is this piece
by Martin Gilens at Princeton.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:13.130
Gilens took about 17 hundred public opinion
surveys about attitudes about how policy should

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.130
change.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:19.700
And he narrowed that down to about 887, where
the attitudes of the top ten percent were

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.400
different from the attitudes of the bottom
90 percent.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.929
And he asked the question, "When the top ten
percent think we should go left, and the bottom

00:24:27.929 --> 00:24:30.392
90 percent think we should go right"-- I don't
mean that left and right politically.

00:24:30.392 --> 00:24:34.360
I just mean go one direction and the other
wanna go the other direction.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.710
"--which way do we go?"

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:41.430
And what he found was "when Americans with
different income levels differ in their policy

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:47.130
preferences, actual policy outcomes strongly
reflect the preferences of the most affluent,

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:53.480
but bare virtually no relationship to the
preferences of the poor or middle income Americans."

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:59.929
There is a vast discrepancy between what our
Congress does if it in fact were following

00:24:59.929 --> 00:25:05.320
the people alone, and what our Congress does
given that it's following the thing I'm taking

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.590
for as the proxy for the funders.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.590
OK.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.590
That's substance.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:14.140
But here, you can also just more easily identify
agenda because remember, Brad Smith also said

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.490
it doesn't affect legislative behavior.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.830
And here, there is no basis for suggesting
it doesn't affect legislative behavior.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.830
Here's just one example.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:27.710
If I asked you, "What was the number one issue
Congress spent its time on in the first four

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:28.710
months of this year?"

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:32.460
It's felt like many years this year, but just
the first four months.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:39.150
We're in the middle of two wars, huge unemployment
problems, huge budget deficit problems.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.200
Still have a bunch of questions around health
care and still have a bunch of questions around

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.440
global warming that have not even begun to
be addressed.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.310
What was the issue they spent most of their
time dealing with?

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.710
The answer is the bank swipe fee controversy.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:53.400
Now, what's the bank swipe fee controversy?

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.130
Well, the bank swipe fee controversy is whether
banks, when you used your debit card, get

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:02.299
to charge more, or retailers when you use
your debit card get to be charged less for

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:03.750
the use of debit cards.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.610
That is the critical national issue that dominated
the Congressional agenda for the first four

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:09.610
months.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.030
And you think, "Well, why would that ever
be?

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.320
Why would swipe fees be the center of what
they care about?"

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:18.049
How many members of Congress got elected going
down there saying, "The thing I'm going for

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:20.460
is to deal with that swipe fee controversy."

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.460
Right?

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.150
Well, the answer is one Senator described
it like this.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.549
"The fights down here can be put into two
or three categories: The big greedy bastards

00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:32.309
against the big greedy bastards; the big greedy
bastards against the little greedy bastards;

00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:37.710
and some cases even the other little greedy
bastards against the other little greedy bastards."

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:38.710
[laughter]

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.010
So we have this kind of controversy.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.520
And here's the money line, so to speak.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:47.050
I don't even think the authors, Zach Carter
and Ryan Grimm, saw the significance of this,

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.040
but this is the real money line in the piece.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:54.000
They say, "The clock never ticks down to zero
in Washington: one year's law is the next

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
year's repeal target.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.980
Politicians, showered with cash from card
companies and giant retailers alike, have

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:06.770
been moving back and forth between camps,
paid handsomely for their shifting allegiances."

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:13.150
So, it's not just tax policy that gets architected
to raise money for members of Congress.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:17.760
It's not just regulation that gets architected
to make it easy to raise money for members

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.840
of Congress.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:24.020
It's the very agenda of what Congress addresses
that gets set in a way to make it easier for

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.770
members to raise money.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.410
So why don't we address unemployment?

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:32.020
Turns out unemployment doesn't pay so well
[laughter] for Congressmen raising money for

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.020
their campaigns.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.710
Now, my view is we critically need a way to
change this.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.830
And we change this by fixing the dependence.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:46.250
If the problem here is that the funders are
not the people, a solution is to make the

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.330
funders the people, to give them a way--.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.360
I know that looks like one word.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.059
I mean two words, here.

00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:54.660
I don't mean give Congress away.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.250
I know a lot of people would like to do that.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:02.750
I mean, give Congress a way to fund their
campaigns without Faust, without selling their

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.740
souls, and thereby without alienating America.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.390
And the one way, and I increasing think the
only way to do this, is to commit to a system

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.679
of publicly funding public elections.

00:28:12.679 --> 00:28:17.840
Now, a particular brand of public funding
is what I want to pedal here.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.049
I want a public funding that changes from
large-dollar funded campaigns to small-dollar

00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:24.049
funded campaigns.

00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:26.570
And there are lots of examples of this around
the country.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:31.799
Three states in particular, Arizona, Maine,
and Connecticut, have systems where candidates

00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:37.960
opt into a regime where they take small dollar
contributions only and the regime effectively

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:43.610
amplifies those contributions, so that they
can successfully wage a campaign having never

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.940
taken a large dollar contribution from anybody.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.070
There are many ways to do that.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:53.160
I describe one in my book that's a little
different from what Maine and Connecticut

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.270
have done.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.840
And I can talk about that in questions, but
the point I want you to recognize, the critical

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:03.500
point about this way of funding elections,
is if we had an election where the majority

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:10.190
of Congress--the vast majority of Congress--took
small dollar contributions only, then we all

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:16.120
could believe, as we all want to believe,
[laughter] that when Congress did something

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.960
stupid it was either because there were too
many Democrats or because there were too many

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.549
Republicans, or because they just didn't understand
what they were doing.

00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:26.320
But not because of the money.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.120
The essential element of mistrust and cynicism
in the system would've been removed by an

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:37.850
alternative funding system that gave us no
reason to doubt the integrity or credibility

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.540
of what that system was doing.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:47.179
Now, this is a way, I believe, to create a
reassertion of the dominance of the people

00:29:47.179 --> 00:29:51.570
and the dependence the framers intended and
to restore the institution of Congress to

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:55.890
at least be a little bit more popular than
King George at the founding.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:56.890
[laughter]

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:57.890
OK.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:58.890
Now that's the argument.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:29:59.890
Here's the hard question.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:00.890
How do you get there?

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:01.990
I don't think it's hard to describe the problem.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:06.851
We all believe we believed in the problem
before I even said anything about it.

00:30:06.851 --> 00:30:08.830
And it's not even hard, I think, to describe
a solution.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.470
I'm happy to tell you more about mine, but
I think the solution is pretty clear.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:19.360
What is hard--maybe what's impossibly hard--is
to imagine the political movement that brings

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.480
about the solution.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.680
And the reason for that is an insight given
to me by Congressman Jim Cooper, Democrat

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.669
from Tennessee, who has been in Congress for
as long all but about 20 other members of

00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:31.669
Congress.

00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:32.669
And Cooper said this.

00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:37.309
He told me "the problem with Capitol Hill
is it has become a quote 'Farm league for

00:30:37.309 --> 00:30:38.309
K Street.'"

00:30:38.309 --> 00:30:40.679
K Street, the home of lobbyists.

00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:46.059
A farm league for K Street, meaning members
and staffers and bureaucrats have this increasingly

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:48.400
common business model in the back of their
head.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:55.570
The business model is focused on their life
after government, their life as lobbyists.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:00.710
Public Citizen calculated between 1998 and
2004, 50 percent of Senators left to become

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.960
lobbyists.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.040
Forty-two percent of the members of the House.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.250
Those numbers have only gone up.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:11.980
And so, in a world where everyone depends
upon the existing system surviving, because

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:18.850
that's the only way they have a lucrative
after-government future, how to we begin to

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:25.050
imagine that institution and those people--the
lobbyists, the members of Congress, the staffers,

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:30.299
the bureaucrats--ever organizing to change
that deeply corrupt system?

00:31:30.299 --> 00:31:33.960
Well, in my book, I consider four ideas.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.990
One of them is the ordinary idea--the idea
of passing a statute.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.080
That idea is impossible.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.440
I looked it up on Google.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.440
It is impossible.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.440
[laughter]

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.669
It's technically impossible.

00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:48.200
It's impossible because there is no way they
will ever radically change the system that

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:53.669
both got them there and will carry them out
in very well-paid lobbyist’s jobs.

00:31:53.669 --> 00:32:00.500
So that leads me to three insane solutions
that are only improbable, not quite impossible.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.909
And the third of these, the one that I ultimately
think will be the most important, is this

00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:06.159
suggestion of a convention.

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:12.419
So, the framers of our Constitution in Article
Five created the standard way by which the

00:32:12.419 --> 00:32:14.680
Constitution gets amended.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.580
That is, Congress proposes an amendment and
three-fourths of the states ratify it.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.900
But then at the convention, somebody said,
"Well, what if Congress is the problem?

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.669
What do we do then?"

00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:27.640
And so, they set up an alternative path.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.860
The alternative path is that states can call
on Congress to call a convention.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.570
The convention then proposes the amendments
and those amendments have to pass by three-fourths

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:37.730
of the states.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:42.530
So either way, 38 states have to ratify an
amendment, but the sources of those amendments

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.570
are different.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:44.740
One is inside.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.770
One is outside.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:51.610
Now, all three of these insane ideas are really
just ways around what is, I think, the cancer

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.309
that is DC right now.

00:32:54.309 --> 00:33:00.870
And it's recognition that the ordinary means
of politics are just not feasible for this

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.059
kind of problem.

00:33:03.059 --> 00:33:07.659
In this--you can think of--extraordinary times,
what's gonna be required here is that we do

00:33:07.659 --> 00:33:15.059
something that we have not done in a very
long time--to build a politics that looks

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:17.360
different from this.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:24.600
A politics that is not--to borrow from my
older work-- a 'read-only' politics--where

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:30.590
people sit there and passively consume what's
fed to them in broadcast form.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:34.900
But instead, read/write politics where people
become more active and engaged and reclaim

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.560
this from the politicians.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.660
Now, here's the hard part.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:43.470
I don't actually know whether it's possible
for us to do it.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:49.220
We don't have any good evidence that we, as
a people, have the capacity to actually take

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:53.960
back power from the professional politicians
and reorder it.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.020
No good example in our recent past.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:02.030
Lots of good reason to believe people are
too disengaged to be able to do it.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:06.390
I do think we know, however, how that process
gets started.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:11.619
And it begins with, first, clarity.

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:12.619
The clarity of Thoreau.

00:34:12.619 --> 00:34:17.200
The clarity of a root striker.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.730
So it might not be surprising that the coolest
website of the Occupy movement is the Occupy

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.839
Seattle movement.

00:34:22.839 --> 00:34:28.339
But if you go to their demands page, you're
met with this list of literally hundreds of

00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:33.740
demands, which they are now trying to decide
which are the most important of their demands.

00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:39.749
Everything from protect the environment to--my
favorite--end the industrial prison complex.

00:34:39.749 --> 00:34:40.749
OK.

00:34:40.749 --> 00:34:43.520
Which is significant there and also here,
but that's the scope.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.750
All right.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.049
Now, I think all of these demands are important.

00:34:47.049 --> 00:34:52.169
It would be great to get Congress or the states
to address any of these demands.

00:34:52.169 --> 00:34:56.899
But the point is if you come forward with
a list of a hundred demands, you come forward

00:34:56.899 --> 00:34:57.899
with noise.

00:34:57.899 --> 00:35:04.680
And nobody hears anything because they can't
hear everything you're trying to say.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.920
Instead, this movement needs to find a way
to clarify and focus.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.030
It needs to celebrate its diversity, recognize
there are leftists in that movement.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:16.520
They shouldn't deny the fact they're leftists.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.470
There are people on the right in the Tea Party
movement.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.089
They shouldn't deny they're from the right.

00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:25.729
They should all stick to their principle,
but they've got to seek a common ground.

00:35:25.729 --> 00:35:32.249
Not compromise, but a common ground so that
they actually do speak for the 99 percent,

00:35:32.249 --> 00:35:36.930
not just the 21 percent of people who identify
as liberals or the 30 percent of people that

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.219
identify as supporters of the Tea Party.

00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:42.269
I think there's an exercise we all should
go through.

00:35:42.269 --> 00:35:47.829
We should be forced to come into a room and
say, "We on the left, believe this.

00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:50.829
We on the right, believe this."

00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:56.180
But then ask the critical question, whether
there's a set of beliefs that we all share,

00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:00.540
that could be the foundation for some important
reform.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:07.940
And my view is that if we could focus people's
attention on the wide range of issues that

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:13.920
they're frustrated about and get them to connect
the dots--so whether it's on the left, health

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.589
care reform, or on the right, government bailouts.

00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:20.089
On the left, global warming or on the right,
complex taxes.

00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:23.279
On the left, financial reform and on the right,
financial reform.

00:36:23.279 --> 00:36:28.249
Whatever the issue is, if we could focus them,
they would see this root cause.

00:36:28.249 --> 00:36:30.920
And the root cause is this picture.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:36.319
A democracy that is distracted by a dependence
that was never intended.

00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:43.440
And the practice of the root striker has got
to be to find a way to get, we the people,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.319
to see this root.

00:36:45.319 --> 00:36:46.469
So, that's number one--clarity.

00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:51.280
Number two is a kind of boldness.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:58.260
Now, in the book, I make a little bit of fun
of a guy you're familiar with.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.260
[laughter]

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:05.069
So, Eric Schmidt came to a talk at the American
Academy in Berlin.

00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:07.749
And it was the first time I'd ever met him,
first time I'd ever heard him talk.

00:37:07.749 --> 00:37:08.779
And I was amazed.

00:37:08.779 --> 00:37:14.400
It was the first time I'd ever heard anybody
lay out the Google vision.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.400
And I was astonished.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.880
I mean, I was astonished by him.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.660
He was extraordinary, but I was astonished
by the Google vision.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.660
This is a place.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.839
You saw these really big ideas about how they
were gonna, you guys, were gonna remake the

00:37:26.839 --> 00:37:28.170
whole world.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.059
The whole world.

00:37:30.059 --> 00:37:34.370
And I was more excited about the work going
on here than I had even been in my whole life.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:35.729
I felt like this was amazing.

00:37:35.729 --> 00:37:37.779
So then I thought, "OK.

00:37:37.779 --> 00:37:38.779
Wow.

00:37:38.779 --> 00:37:40.009
This is a company of big ideas."

00:37:40.009 --> 00:37:46.420
And I said, "Eric, so there's a whole bunch
of public policy issues where the world is

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.799
against you guys.

00:37:47.799 --> 00:37:48.920
And I think you guys are right."

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:55.539
So, immigration, anti-trust, copyrights, network
neutrality.

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:59.180
You guys are on the right side of all of those
issues and the rest of the world is on the

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.410
wrong side."

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.880
And the reason the rest of the world is on
the wrong side is exactly the corruption that

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.119
I've been talking about today.

00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:06.550
So, what are you gonna do about it?

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:13.030
Are you gonna sit around and swipe away these
bad policies like flies at a picnic?

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:16.930
Or are you gonna solve it in the way Google
addresses a problem and radically remakes

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:19.040
the world to solve it?

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:24.549
And for the first time in that evening, a
tiny idea was expressed.

00:38:24.549 --> 00:38:26.300
And it was expressed by Eric Schmidt.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.519
Because he didn't have any big idea to think
about solving this, the most fundamental problem.

00:38:30.519 --> 00:38:35.460
I agree with Matt that we, as a Republic face--any
idea like, "Oh, we're gonna get the Google

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.559
PAC to be more aggressive in teaching people
what our views about policies were.

00:38:39.559 --> 00:38:43.020
Nothing to change the core root of the problem.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:48.670
Just playing the system with all sorts of
resources allied against you.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:53.509
What we need here is a Google-level idea.

00:38:53.509 --> 00:38:58.359
What we need is the kind of big idea that
you deploy in every other sphere of social

00:38:58.359 --> 00:39:04.030
life that might get this democracy to the
place that could address this problem that

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:10.260
I guarantee you 95 percent of experts say
is impossible for the world to solve, for

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.040
us to solve.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.369
Impossible.

00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:16.859
But that's the sort of problem you guys take
all the time.

00:39:16.859 --> 00:39:17.859
That's what you do.

00:39:17.859 --> 00:39:20.430
That's your job--the impossible problem.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:21.430
And we need that.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.349
And we need that from people like you.

00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:24.460
Now, number three, we need courage.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.109
And this is also related to the company, but
I won't pick on the company anymore.

00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:30.989
Instead, I'll talk about my friend, Arnold
Hiatt.

00:39:30.989 --> 00:39:33.420
So, he's a humble guy.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.299
This is the biggest I could find of him on
the net.

00:39:36.299 --> 00:39:37.299
[laughter]

00:39:37.299 --> 00:39:39.219
[Lawrence Lessig coughs]

00:39:39.219 --> 00:39:41.559
Arnie was the president of Stride Rite.

00:39:41.559 --> 00:39:42.960
They make great shoes, like Keds.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.749
He's also a loyal Democrat.

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:49.230
In 1996, he was the second largest contributor
to the Democratic Party.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:55.460
So, in 1997, Bill Clinton invited him and
30 other large contributors to a dinner at

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.540
the Mayflower Hotel to tell him, the President,
what he should do for the remaining part of

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.540
his term.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:06.589
So, it's this dinner of these fat cats at
the Mayflower Hotel to help guide policy in

00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:07.589
America.

00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:09.760
And each of them got to stand up and address
the President.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.989
We didn't have any pictures.

00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:12.000
Arnie was the last one to speak.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.920
I kind of envision it like this.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.670
He stood up and he looked the President straight
in the eye and he said, "Mr. President, I

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:24.039
know you're an admirer of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt.

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:31.730
So I want you to put yourself in Roosevelt's
shoes in 1940, when he reluctantly came to

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:38.239
recognize that he needed to convince a reluctant
nation to wage a war to save democracy."

00:40:38.239 --> 00:40:41.999
'Cause he said, "You, too, Mr. President.

00:40:41.999 --> 00:40:48.319
You, too, need to convince a reluctant nation
to wage a war to save democracy.

00:40:48.319 --> 00:40:56.989
Not a war against fascists, but in a certain
sense, a war against us fat cats."

00:40:56.989 --> 00:41:01.979
A war against people who believe, merely because
they are rich, they are entitled to guide

00:41:01.979 --> 00:41:03.930
government policy.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.709
People who believe merely because they've
been successful in the marketplace, they're

00:41:06.709 --> 00:41:09.339
entitled to have dinner with the President.

00:41:09.339 --> 00:41:15.930
People who have convinced the American public
that this republic does not work.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.540
Now, put yourself in Hiatt's shoes.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:24.430
Imagine yourself in that room with 30 other
fat cats and the President, basically saying

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:29.799
to each of those fat cats and the President,
"This is illegitimate what's happening here."

00:41:29.799 --> 00:41:32.529
There was silence after he said what he said.

00:41:32.529 --> 00:41:33.529
[laughter]

00:41:33.529 --> 00:41:37.569
The only published account of the evening
says that Clinton's response effectively slashed

00:41:37.569 --> 00:41:43.880
Hiatt to pieces, humiliating him in front
of the group.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:49.460
I think 14 years later, we need to recognize
that it was Arnold Hiatt who was right.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:55.619
We do need to convince a reluctant nation
to wage a war to save democracy.

00:41:55.619 --> 00:42:02.039
But where Arnold Hiatt was wrong was in his
belief that politicians would wage that war.

00:42:02.039 --> 00:42:04.319
It's not gonna be politicians.

00:42:04.319 --> 00:42:05.719
It's gonna be citizens.

00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:07.559
It's going to be us.

00:42:07.559 --> 00:42:09.990
It's going to be root strikers.

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:12.309
And I pray it's going to be you.

00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:15.539
It is our job that requires our courage.

00:42:15.539 --> 00:42:17.130
It is our republic.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.930
It is ours, not theirs.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:24.099
They took it away, but we let them.

00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:26.989
Here's one more story before I stop.

00:42:26.989 --> 00:42:31.480
So, many of you might remember--actually,
many of you weren't born, but OK.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.630
Many of you might remember this event, 1989.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:43.009
The Exxon Valdez crashed into Prince William
Sound, ran aground, eleven million gallons

00:42:43.009 --> 00:42:46.599
of oil was spilled into the Sound.

00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:51.499
This is the recording of Captain Joseph Hazelwood
when he called in the accident.

00:42:51.499 --> 00:42:53.619
[plays sound clip]

00:42:53.619 --> 00:42:54.619
[static]

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:57.150
&gt;&gt;Captain Joseph Hazelwood: Yeah.

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.979
Ah, it’s VALDEZ back.

00:42:59.979 --> 00:43:10.579
Ah, we’ve— ah, should be on your radar
there— we’ve fetched up, ah, hard aground

00:43:10.579 --> 00:43:16.229
north of, ah, Goose Island off Bligh Reef.

00:43:16.229 --> 00:43:27.539
And, ah, evidently, ah, leaking some oil,
and, ah, we’re gonna be here for a while.

00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:30.472
And, ah, if you want, ah, so you’re notified.

00:43:30.472 --> 00:43:31.472
Over.

00:43:31.472 --> 00:43:32.472
[end sound clip]

00:43:32.472 --> 00:43:33.472
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: And ah, if you want, as,
so you're notified.

00:43:33.472 --> 00:43:34.472
Over.

00:43:34.472 --> 00:43:38.209
Now, as many of you are thinking, there might
be a little bit of a question about whether

00:43:38.209 --> 00:43:43.109
Captain Joseph Hazelwood was intoxicated at
the time this accident occurred.

00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:44.660
He denied it.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.809
He said he only had four vodkas before he
got on the ship.

00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:51.579
But his blood level alcohol indicated he must
have been at least six times over the legal

00:43:51.579 --> 00:43:55.930
limit when he climbed on board that ship.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:56.930
But he fought it.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.140
His lawyers fought it hard.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.819
There was some ambiguity in the evidence and
he was not convicted.

00:44:01.819 --> 00:44:06.930
So, let's say there was doubt about whether
Hazelwood was drunk when he was captaining

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:09.339
a supertanker.

00:44:09.339 --> 00:44:13.170
What there was no doubt about was that he
had a problem with alcohol.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.130
His mother testified.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.589
She had known he had a problem with alcohol.

00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:22.920
In 1985, four years before the accident, Exxon
had treated him for his problem with alcohol.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.380
After the accident, Exxon's President said
he "thought he had mastered the problem."

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:31.119
But in 1986, he had his driver's license revoked
for a DUI.

00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:34.849
In 1988, he had his driver's license revoked
for a DUI.

00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:39.559
At the time he was captaining a supertanker,
he was not allowed to drive a VW Beetle.

00:44:39.559 --> 00:44:40.559
[laughter]

00:44:40.559 --> 00:44:41.559
OK.

00:44:41.559 --> 00:44:43.799
But forget Hazelwood.

00:44:43.799 --> 00:44:52.210
Instead, I want you to think about those around
Captain Hazelwood, these other officers.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:57.279
People who could have picked up a phone while
a drunk was driving a supertanker.

00:44:57.279 --> 00:45:02.140
I want you to think about the people who did
nothing because all but one of those officers

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:04.859
did nothing.

00:45:04.859 --> 00:45:06.500
What do we think about them?

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:12.680
Now, I ask this question because as I think
about the problem this nation faces increasingly,

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:16.069
I believe we are they.

00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:21.319
This nation faces critical problems requiring
serious attention, but we don't have institutions

00:45:21.319 --> 00:45:23.000
capable of giving them this attention.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.950
They are distracted, unable to focus.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:29.819
And who is to blame for that?

00:45:29.819 --> 00:45:34.529
Who is responsible?

00:45:34.529 --> 00:45:40.200
I think it's too easy to point to the Blagojeviches
and hold them responsible, to point to the

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.569
evil people and hold them responsible.

00:45:42.569 --> 00:45:43.730
It's not the evil people.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:45.999
It’s the good people.

00:45:45.999 --> 00:45:47.740
It's the decent people.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.880
It's the people who could've picked up a phone.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.079
It's us.

00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:55.140
It's we, the most privileged.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:59.359
Because the most outrageous part here is that
these corruptions, of course, were primed

00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:06.160
by the most privileged, but they were permitted
by the passivity of the most privileged as

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.420
well--permitted by us.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:15.569
When Ben Franklin was carried from the Constitutional
Convention in the summer of 1787, a woman

00:46:15.569 --> 00:46:19.029
stopped him on the street and said, "Mr. Franklin,
what have you wrought?"

00:46:19.029 --> 00:46:25.289
Franklin replied, "A republic, ma'am, if you
can keep it."

00:46:25.289 --> 00:46:28.369
A republic.

00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:30.410
A representative democracy.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:36.950
A democracy dependent upon the people alone.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:46.359
We have lost that republic and all of us have
to work to get it back.

00:46:46.359 --> 00:46:53.259
Thank you very much.

00:46:53.259 --> 00:46:54.989
[applause]

00:46:54.989 --> 00:47:03.609
I'm happy to take questions.

00:47:03.609 --> 00:47:09.170
I'm a law professor, so I could call on people
if you don't ask questions.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:10.170
[laughter]

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.239
Yes, sir.

00:47:11.239 --> 00:47:16.750
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Do you have any opinions on electoral
reform?

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:20.759
I can't vote for the party I want 'cause if
I vote for anybody other than Republicans

00:47:20.759 --> 00:47:22.999
or Democrats, my vote is wasted.

00:47:22.999 --> 00:47:23.999
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: Yeah.

00:47:23.999 --> 00:47:28.509
I think that there's a whole list of other
reforms that we also need to think about with

00:47:28.509 --> 00:47:29.509
democracy.

00:47:29.509 --> 00:47:35.029
The way we gerrymander districts, the way
we have winner-take-all seats.

00:47:35.029 --> 00:47:37.940
All of these things I think are critically
important, too.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.700
I'm trying to think about the sequence of
problems.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.380
And I think the sequence of problems is, this
is the problem we need to solve first to create

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:48.309
an atmosphere, an opportunity, to begin to
address the other problems.

00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:53.480
So, I'm happy to sign up with you on that
once we fix the problem I'm talking about

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.480
here first.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.480
Yeah.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Hi.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480
Two quick questions.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.750
The first is, what's the name of the Senator
that came up with the little bastards that

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:01.549
are greedy in the greedy bastards quote?

00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:05.469
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: He would not go on the
record with him name, [audience chuckles]

00:48:05.469 --> 00:48:09.229
so the Huffington Post piece says it's an
anonymous Senator who said this.

00:48:09.229 --> 00:48:10.650
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: OK.

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:14.420
Secondly, about the Constitution Convention,
using say, legislatures.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.690
How are the state representatives gonna be
different from the national representatives?

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:22.119
'Cause aren't they just as greedy and looking
to climb the ladder of political opportunity?

00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:27.160
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: Yeah, so state legislatures
just passed resolutions calling on the Convention.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.530
And the question is, how do you populate the
Convention?

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:34.140
And here's the really insane, totally completely
insane idea, that I have for the Convention.

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:38.660
I think the Convention should be populated
by a random selection, random proportional

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.630
selection, of citizens.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:44.460
Now, people think that's crazy.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.460
And I agree.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.589
You're not gonna argue anybody into insanity.

00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:54.249
I think what you've gotta do is to show them,
like let's run 30 or 40 or 50 of these mock

00:48:54.249 --> 00:48:58.820
Constitutional Conventions where we have deliberative
polls where we randomly select a representative

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:03.440
mix of people from a jurisdiction and we give
them the information they need.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.900
And we have them work through the issue and
see what they come up with.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.380
California has a good example of this.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:12.490
The California Forward Project ran a deliberative
project, deliberative poll, around the question

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.039
of what California should do.

00:49:14.039 --> 00:49:18.489
And the product of that is extraordinarily
impressive--much better than anything the

00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:20.479
professionals did.

00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:25.450
And I think that signals the core insight,
which is politics is one of these rare sports

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:28.569
where the amateurs are actually better than
the professional.

00:49:28.569 --> 00:49:33.890
Because the professional is good at figuring
out how to benefit the special interests that

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.880
the professional depends upon.

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:41.380
And the amateur, like a jury, can be summoned
into a state where they're not thinking so

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.869
much about the special interest.

00:49:42.869 --> 00:49:47.309
So, I think the only way a Convention makes
sense is if we can avoid it being captured

00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:49.569
in exactly the same way government has been
captured.

00:49:49.569 --> 00:49:54.999
And I think the only way to that is to have
this randomly selected body be the Convention.

00:49:54.999 --> 00:50:00.759
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: First of all, thank you so much
for being here and for devoting so much time

00:50:00.759 --> 00:50:01.859
to this very important issue.

00:50:01.859 --> 00:50:02.859
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: Thank you.

00:50:02.859 --> 00:50:11.039
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: My question is, given the election
of Obama in 2008, and then the following three

00:50:11.039 --> 00:50:17.989
years, how much of the overwhelming Democratic
majorities and the election Obama have helped

00:50:17.989 --> 00:50:21.489
the momentum of this campaign finance reform
campaign?

00:50:21.489 --> 00:50:25.900
In that, I think there's a lot of people who
sort of generally understand the Republicans

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:32.920
were bought, but I think when the nation was
rallied around this feeling in 2008, and then

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.109
the disappointment that's come out of it,
I just--.

00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:37.710
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: Yeah.

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:42.650
You and I share that view precisely.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.650
The book is--.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:44.799
Obama was a friend.

00:50:44.799 --> 00:50:46.680
He was a colleague of mine in Chicago.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.190
I campaigned for him.

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:49.190
I worked hard for him.

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:54.420
I talked to a lot of people in here when he
first was on the trail about how he'd be so

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.969
great for what we cared about.

00:50:56.969 --> 00:51:02.039
But the only reason I think he was credible
as a candidate over Hilary Clinton, was that

00:51:02.039 --> 00:51:05.270
he, unlike Hilary Clinton, said, "This system
is the problem.

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.959
We have to take up the fight to change the
way Washington works.

00:51:07.959 --> 00:51:11.680
And if we don't, our children are gonna be
facing the same problems we faced.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.540
And our children's children will be facing
the same problems they face."

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.759
So, he made it--.

00:51:15.759 --> 00:51:21.749
He said twice at least, I have recorded in
the campaign, "This is the reason I am running.

00:51:21.749 --> 00:51:22.809
To change the system."

00:51:22.809 --> 00:51:26.809
And then he got elected and he opened up the
Clinton playbook.

00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:30.549
And he ran his Administration according to
the way Hilary Clinton would've run her Administration.

00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:32.069
And I think maybe Clinton would have done
a better job.

00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:33.069
I don't know.

00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:38.209
But if Clinton had done exactly what Barack
Obama did, I think we should say, "Great.

00:51:38.209 --> 00:51:41.039
You did what would come from that kind of
Administration.

00:51:41.039 --> 00:51:44.940
But you promised, Barack Obama, a different
Administration."

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.339
I feel it's a betrayal from what we thought
we were getting.

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:55.289
It makes it really hard for any of us to believe
that reform is gonna come from the top or

00:51:55.289 --> 00:51:56.720
from any insider.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:03.369
So, I think that this is why it becomes critical
to think about these outside traditional politics

00:52:03.369 --> 00:52:08.539
solutions, which is unfortunately, I think,
the only path we've got right now.

00:52:08.539 --> 00:52:10.609
He doesn't stand credible on this issue.

00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:13.230
The one person who is credible on this issue
is--.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:18.559
I will vote for Obama over any Republican
except one.

00:52:18.559 --> 00:52:20.759
The Republican you've not heard of.

00:52:20.759 --> 00:52:22.029
His name is Buddy Roemer.

00:52:22.029 --> 00:52:24.150
Now, it's funny you haven't heard of him.

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.150
I mean, he was a governor.

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:26.239
He was a four-term Congressman.

00:52:26.239 --> 00:52:30.690
He ran a bank for 20 years without taking
government bailouts and successfully created

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:32.119
this community bank.

00:52:32.119 --> 00:52:36.670
But he has made a pledge in his campaign for
the Republican nomination for President where

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:39.539
he will take no more than a hundred dollars
from anybody.

00:52:39.539 --> 00:52:44.400
He will commit to no PAC money, full disclosure,
because he wants to as his slogan, "It's free

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.400
to lead."

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.759
But because he takes no more than a hundred
dollars, everybody says, "Well, you can't

00:52:47.759 --> 00:52:50.470
possibly win so, we're not even gonna pay
attention to you."

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:55.140
So, he hasn't even had a chance to make this
case in the debate.

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:59.690
But if Buddy Roemer were the candidate in
the Republican side, that would be a game-changer.

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:03.910
If it were a Republican making this argument,
then it would be much easier to imagine this

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:05.529
argument actually having play.

00:53:05.529 --> 00:53:08.099
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: Thank you.

00:53:08.099 --> 00:53:12.329
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: Thank you for coming to talk to
us today.

00:53:12.329 --> 00:53:13.920
I have a question about--.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.369
I think we all can understand that there's
obviously a role that Congress has in perpetuating

00:53:18.369 --> 00:53:19.369
this system.

00:53:19.369 --> 00:53:23.180
And there's a role that we all have in our
lack of action in perpetuating this system.

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.516
But I think one thing, you didn't get a chance
to talk about and I don't know if you talk

00:53:25.516 --> 00:53:30.799
about it in your book--I look forward to reading
it--is the role of the Supreme Court and notably

00:53:30.799 --> 00:53:33.839
one of your own bosses.

00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:38.999
And how you talk about the people want to
be more involved, but at this point, the Supreme

00:53:38.999 --> 00:53:46.559
Court has defined "person" to be an incredibly
broad system and how we can move away from

00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:51.039
treating corporations as people without their
movement and how we can actually affect meaningful

00:53:51.039 --> 00:53:53.440
change without movement on the Supreme Court.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.380
And a Supreme Court that seems very unlikely
to move on that particular issue.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:58.380
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: Yeah.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:03.229
So, the particular version of public funding
that I advance is completely immune from Supreme

00:54:03.229 --> 00:54:07.910
Court invalidation.

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:12.049
Nothing in the Supreme Court, even this Supreme
Court's doctrine, would draw this type of

00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:13.140
public funding into the out.

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:20.150
But it leaves the problem of independent expenditures,
both of individuals, George Soros or the Koch

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:24.799
Brothers, as well as corporations, which now
have unlimited amounts to spend.

00:54:24.799 --> 00:54:29.279
And it took a comedian to teach the Supreme
Court that, in fact, they didn't have to be

00:54:29.279 --> 00:54:32.990
disclosed if they all could be secret because
you could channel them through a C4 that would

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:36.719
itself be identified, but the contributors
to the C4 not.

00:54:36.719 --> 00:54:37.719
OK.

00:54:37.719 --> 00:54:39.849
So, we have to address the problem of independent
expenditures.

00:54:39.849 --> 00:54:43.599
Now, my view is the law should not ban anybody
from saying anything.

00:54:43.599 --> 00:54:46.780
I think corporations should have a right to
participate.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:52.650
But they shouldn't be able to dominate the
political process so that we have not just

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:58.150
shape-shifting to appeal to the funders, but
we have shape-shifting to appeal to the independent

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:03.420
expenditure guys and therefore, the same kind
of dependency that corrupts the system.

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:09.589
So, the only way to get there without imagining
a Supreme Court reversing itself is to give

00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:13.719
Congress the power to limit, but not to ban,
independent expenditures.

00:55:13.719 --> 00:55:17.539
And if you're gonna change the Constitution
from that standpoint, I say let's have an

00:55:17.539 --> 00:55:19.309
amendment that has three components.

00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:23.289
Number one, public elections must be publicly
funded.

00:55:23.289 --> 00:55:26.150
Number two, contributions to candidates should
be capped.

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:29.809
I'd say at a hundred dollars--equivalent of
a hundred dollars.

00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:35.660
Number three, Congress has to have the power
to limit, but not to ban, independent expenditures

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.279
of both corporations and people.

00:55:37.279 --> 00:55:41.269
It just has to have the capacity to create
a time for election that's not just about

00:55:41.269 --> 00:55:42.900
the money.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:47.099
But getting to the place that we can have
the chance to have that amendment passed,

00:55:47.099 --> 00:55:52.010
is the hard thing because again, I looked
it up, there's zero chance Congress is gonna

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:53.099
propose such an amendment.

00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:57.150
And so, if Congress is not gonna propose the
amendment, what's the path to get it at least

00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:58.660
on the table for states to adopt?

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.420
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: Thank you very much.

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:01.420
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: Yup.

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:02.420
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Hi.

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:08.619
I'm wondering about your perspective on venture
philanthropy and the role of money outside

00:56:08.619 --> 00:56:10.029
the congressional system.

00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:11.359
Is it a pure good?

00:56:11.359 --> 00:56:15.950
I'm thinking, for example, of education reform,
the Charter School movement, that sort of

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:16.950
thing.

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:20.699
Or, is there some danger there that money
is talking more than it ought to, even in

00:56:20.699 --> 00:56:21.699
those worlds?

00:56:21.699 --> 00:56:22.699
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: Yeah.

00:56:22.699 --> 00:56:23.699
It's a great question.

00:56:23.699 --> 00:56:27.369
I don't think you can say without reservations
that it's good.

00:56:27.369 --> 00:56:32.390
Although, you can say it's really great that
it's out there, right?

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:40.289
There are foundations that are not disciplined
enough to insulate and protect the recipients

00:56:40.289 --> 00:56:43.699
from developing the wrong kind of dependency
on the foundation.

00:56:43.699 --> 00:56:47.279
So, it distorts them in a way that I think
is not productive.

00:56:47.279 --> 00:56:48.719
And so, harmful.

00:56:48.719 --> 00:56:54.839
But I think there are others that adopt a
very appropriate relationship to the targets

00:56:54.839 --> 00:56:58.849
of their giving that allows them to maintain
their independence, but does support their

00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:59.849
work.

00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:03.729
So, I think in a case-by-case way, we gotta
make a decision about what's the appropriate

00:57:03.729 --> 00:57:05.739
kind of relationship to be drawing in that
case.

00:57:05.739 --> 00:57:07.369
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Thank you.

00:57:07.369 --> 00:57:12.189
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: So, we're out of time to take more
questions, but thanks again for coming.

00:57:12.189 --> 00:57:13.189
&gt;&gt;Lawrence Lessig: Thank you.

00:57:13.189 --> 00:57:14.189
Thanks a lot.

00:57:14.189 --> 00:57:14.190
