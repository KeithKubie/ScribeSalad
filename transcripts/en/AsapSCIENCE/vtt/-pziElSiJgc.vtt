00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
We all look forward to the future, but have you ever realised that we only see the past?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.400
It actually takes 80 milliseconds for your brain to process information,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.880
meaning we're never truly living in the now.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.600
Not to mention, it takes time for light from an object to reach your eyes,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.660
so technically, you see how they looked a fraction of a second ago.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720
Similarly, when you look up at the stars,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.000
you're actually seeing light that has taken years to travel, thus seeing how the stars looked in the past.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.580
The next time you're looking, you may want to consider that that light has travelled all the way through the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.540
universe, until it bumped into you.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.280
So watch out... Or not, because seconds ago you were miles away.

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:41.822
How? Well the Earth is rotating while simultaneously revolving around the sun.

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:46.878
But the sun is also spinning around the galaxy, which in turn is flying through the universe.

00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:50.020
Making your chance interaction with that light... pretty incredible.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.460
It sort of puts the size of things into perspective.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.860
Like the fact that a dust particle is roughly halfway between the size of Earth, and a subatomic particle.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.960
Meanwhile, there are more atoms in a glass of water than there are glasses of water in all of earth's ocean.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.020
Speaking of oceans, if all the oxygen on Earth disappeared for just 5 seconds,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.220
The ocean's hydrogen atoms would be free, and evaporate completely into space.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.420
By the way, you can't actually see the great wall of china from space.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.508
You can, however, see the air pollution.

00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:19.028
Feeling disoriented?

00:01:19.028 --> 00:01:21.116
If you travel north, you'll eventually go south.

00:01:21.116 --> 00:01:24.349
But if you travel west, you'll always be traveling west.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:29.250
Travel to buy a lottery ticket and your chance of dying on the way is actually higher than winning.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.973
Meanwhile, when a pregnant woman suffers organ damage,

00:01:31.973 --> 00:01:33.148
such as a heart attack

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:35.440
the foetus sends stem cells to the damaged organ,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.540
to help repair it.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.560
Hot outside?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.840
The resting temperature of testicles is around 35 degrees celcius,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.160
or 95 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:45.435
meaning on a hot day, it's literally "hot as balls."

00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:47.000
Hopefully that made you smile.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.900
Because even faking a smile stimulates the same part of the brain as a real one,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.100
which can trigger endorphins and happiness.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.560
At the end of the day, humans are really just machines that turn energy into ideas.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.960
And it turns out that all of history and time has led to you listening to these ideas right now, so thanks for your time.
