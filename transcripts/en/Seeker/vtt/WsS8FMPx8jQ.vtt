Hi there space cadets, Jules here for a
DNews Short.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.580
Today, the space community is abuzz with news
that… we’ve found organic

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.380
material on the dwarf planet Ceres!

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.230
Researchers working with NASA say, quote,
“Ceres contains key ingredients for life.”

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.520
So there's a chance basic life could or did
exist on this dwarf planet.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.020
To catch you up, Ceres is the largest object
in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.930
We’ve been studying it for a while, but
new research published today in Science Magazine

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.550
revealed that NASA’s Dawn spacecraft has
confirmed the existence of concentrated organic

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.710
molecules on Ceres’ surface.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.890
And the craziest thing?

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.090
These materials likely came from inside the
dwarf planet.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.399
So, to back up, organic molecules are any
chemical molecule that contains carbon, and

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.560
are the building blocks of all known life.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.120
We already knew Ceres had water ice and hydrated
ammonia, meaning ammonia mixed with water.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.949
But this is whole new discovery.

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.390
An unusually high concentration of organic
matter in the northern hemisphere of Ceres

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.660
was detected with NASA’s spectrometer – an
instrument that maps visible and infrared

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.660
light.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.410
We can’t tell the exact makeup of the materials
right now, but researchers say they match,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.300
quote, “tar-like minerals such as kerite
or asphaltite.”

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.680
So, how do they know that these materials
originated on Ceres and didn’t come from,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.860
say, an asteroid or comet impact?

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.110
Well, the areas where they found the organic
materials also contain other substances that

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.060
are endogenous, meaning that they came from
inside the dwarf planet.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.280
So it is likely that the organics also originated
on Ceres.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.390
In addition, if the materials were carried
on an asteroid, the heat from the collision

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.220
would have probably destroyed them.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.280
This discovery adds yet another piece of evidence
that organics exist throughout our solar system,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.349
and it could help us learn more about the
evolution and distribution of organic species.

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.890
Plus, at 4.5 billion-years-old, Ceres has
been around since nearly the beginning of

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.039
our solar system.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.729
If these organic compounds were also around
that early, that may have provided a lot more

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.550
time for life to form outside our planet.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.880
There’s no evidence of other life yet, but
this is still a pretty exciting breakthrough.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.880
Want to know more about Ceres?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.720
Check out our video about how it might have
volcanoes that spew ice here.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.960
What do you think about this discovery?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.230
Does it blow your mind?

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.510
