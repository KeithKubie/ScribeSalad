00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
 Are you curious about the quality of your vision? 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.320
 Take a look at this picture, who do you see? 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.960
 If you are a natural distance from the screen and your unit is visible you are seeing Albert Einstein 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.620
 However, if you see Marilyn Monroe you should consider wearing glasses or lenses 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.020
 Are you wearing your glasses now? Try to take it off and the picture may change or if your Lord someone ask him what he sees? 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.300
 In fact, this effect may be seen by anyone if we change the dimension or size of the image 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.720
 If it is far away it is likely to see Marilyn Monroe where our eyes only capture the outlines of the image from afar 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.080
 But when you approach the picture, you see the exact details of Einstein 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.520
 We promise that we did not change anything digitally, just stop this video now and try to stay away from the computer screen 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.220
 The odds are, the picture will change and at a different distance from your friends because our eyes are all slightly different 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.940
 The farther you stand and the farther Einstein sees, the better your eyes may be 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.220
 You can get the same effect by partially closing your eyes to blur the image 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.440
 So what's going on? Well, this picture is an example of a hybrid image. 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.200
 Where the low accuracy of one of the two pictures is merged with 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.860
 High resolution picture of the other, however 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.360
 Depending on how well our eyes are matched and captured 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.120
 Antonyms your eye will pick up only certain details 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.140
 Close-up we are generally able to see minute details like Einstein's mustache 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.520
 And encourage it, but with increasing dimension 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.720
 Or if your vision is weak and this creates a distorted image in the first place 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.160
 Your ability to capture details will disappear instead. You will only see public profiles 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.060
 Like the shape of the mouth, nose and hair 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.120
 What makes him look like Marilyn Monroe 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.500
