00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:12.110
IAN LIVINGSTONE: Thank you.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.275
I'm delighted to be
here and good to see

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:16.770
all you 10-year-olds playing
one of my game books.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.890
It's brilliant to see.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.620
Actually, it's quite interesting
talking about fighting fantasy,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.350
because writing this
new book I was stuck

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.770
with a bit of a dilemma to write
for it for 10-year-olds, which

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.390
is the current market,
or 40-year-olds

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.890
masquerading as 10-year-olds.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.840
Because I'm delighted
to say they've

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.494
survived the test of time.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.410
So I'm here to talk about
the games industry--

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.707
why I think games is
such a wonderful medium.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.165
Not just in terms
of entertainment,

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:45.330
but also in the potential
for fantastic learning

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.560
and education and how games
are transformational in all

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.850
our lives.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.565
When we arrive in this world as
babies, we learn through play.

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:55.380
Play is natural.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.210
We interact with
the world and just

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.090
make many discoveries by play.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.400
And as we get older, we
enjoy solving puzzles.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.597
We are naturally
curious and want

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.180
to solve these
puzzles, because that's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.350
kind of the motivation of life.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.260
And when we attach rules to
puzzles, they become games.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.290
Now, as we said in
the introduction,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.270
I joined the game
industry not long

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.200
after chess was
invented in 600 AD.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.720
I wanted to turn my
hobby of playing games

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.100
into a career if possible.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.050
And so two old school
friends, John Peake

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.070
in the middle, Steve
Jackson on the left, and I,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.660
we met up back in London
in the early '70s.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.170
And we all had pretty
miserable jobs, badly paid,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.200
but we used to enjoy
playing board games.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.930
And we thought, wouldn't
this be a fantastic job

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.620
to do to be able to turn
our hobby into our careers?

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.320
So we set about doing
that, and ultimately

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.060
we created Games Workshop,
known these days of course

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.930
for Warhammer.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.510
But it didn't start off
straight away Warhammer.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.480
There was a lot of struggles
before we got to that point.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.150
We started off
publishing this highly

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.420
glossy full-color
magazine you see here

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.080
called "Owl and Weasel."

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.812
And we sent it out to
everybody we knew in games,

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:13.020
because we wanted to connect.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.630
Clearly there was no other
way of doing it other

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.020
than to write.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.590
Clearly there's no internet,
and there was no way

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.810
of putting out your message.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.450
And one of the recipients
of "Owl and Weasel"

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.680
was this gentleman
called Gary Gygax.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.640
Now, he lived in Lake
Geneva, Wisconsin.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.850
And although we hadn't sent
the newsletter to him directly,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.380
he got hold of a copy.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.780
He wrote to us and sent
a copy of D&amp;D to us.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.560
This incredible game here.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.200
Now, it didn't look
much, pretty plain box

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.660
with a very amateurish
drawing on the front.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.370
But as soon as you opened
the lid and started playing,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.040
it opened up the
world's imagination

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.120
like no game had
ever done previously,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.880
and I don't think any
game ever will again.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.645
Here was more of a designer
game kit than a game in itself.

00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.990
It had no board.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.030
It required one person
to be the Dungeon

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.790
Master to create a world
of monsters and magic,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.900
labyrinths of passage ways,
populating those passageways

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.500
with rooms filled with
monsters and treasure.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.200
And the other players to take on
the roles of heroes and wizards

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.270
and magic users and clerics.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.020
And go on these fantastic
journeys of the mind, theater

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.200
on the fly, the
characters combining

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.830
as a dungeon party trying
to get through the dungeon,

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.940
the twisted dungeon of the
mind of the Dungeon Master.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.230
So we became incredibly
obsessed with D&amp;D. John, not so.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.071
And within the next 12
months, he decided to leave,

00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:42.570
because he wanted to carry on
making more traditional games,

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.120
and we wanted to do
these role-playing games.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.330
So we thought this
was our calling,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.640
and we started selling it mail
order through our third floor

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.650
apartment in Shepherd's Bush.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.220
And we decided to be bold and
go over to the United States

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.950
to sign up all the
fledgling games companies.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.130
And this photo on the
near side is Fritz Leiber,

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.990
science fiction author.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.120
Next to him, Gary
Gygax, inventor

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.420
of D&amp;D. And next to
him, Professor Barker,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.740
who created a game called
Empire of the Petal Throne.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.600
Next to him is me
holding the boxes.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.430
Rob Kuntz at the
far end, another one

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.673
of the authors of D&amp;D, and
Steve smirking at the front.

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:19.589
The worrying thing about
this particular slide

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.770
is the first three gentlemen
to my right are all dead,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.940
and I'm next in line.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.750
Bit of a worry but
hanging in there.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.090
We also got to meet
Miss Wisconsin, 1976.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.590
I don't know what she's doing,
but I'm enjoying myself today

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.750
at Google.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.050
So we signed up all the
fledgling games companies

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.330
and ordered loads
of stuff, because we

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.590
were the big shot distributors
of Dungeons and Dragons.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.140
And how weird we got
that distribution,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.690
because we had no money.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.750
And when we wrote to
Gary Gygax initially

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.890
we only had 50 pounds.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.920
So we ordered six copies
of D&amp;D. And on the back

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.800
of that incredible
order, Gary gave us

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.870
an exclusive,
three-year distribution

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.010
agreement for Europe.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.822
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.289
Because he was also operating
out of a flat in Lake Geneva.

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.080
So kind of being a
role-playing businessman

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.690
about a role-playing
game was brilliant.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.820
So he must have got
a bit of a shock

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.670
when he actually saw
this, but it was fine.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.670
So he came back and
naturally, beforehand, we'd

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.040
been kicked out of our
flat by the landlord.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.720
We were on the top floor flat.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.900
And we didn't-- of course, no
mobile phones back in those

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.400
days.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.120
Didn't even have a
phone in our flats.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.350
There was only one public
phone on the ground

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.960
floor, which we shared
with our landlord, Paddy.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.290
And inevitably the
phone would ring.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.450
It would be a telephone sell for
D&amp;D. We'd run down the stairs,

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.590
or if it was too late,
Paddy was there first.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.410
Hello?

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.180
You want Games Workshop, do you?

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.160
Click.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.060
He got quite irritated
by this, and he

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.462
used to tell us that
we really had to leave.

00:06:11.462 --> 00:06:13.920
And there was people of course
milling around on the ground

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.237
floor outside, on the street
looking for this Games

00:06:16.237 --> 00:06:17.820
Workshop, expecting
to find this shop.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.182
Of course there wasn't one.

00:06:19.182 --> 00:06:20.640
We used to have to
open the window.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.390
You want Workshop?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.005
Up here, mate.

00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:23.130
Anyway this couldn't go on.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.560
So we were given
our marching orders.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.270
We had nowhere to live.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.130
So we thought, we need
to get a bank loan.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.050
Let's go and go see
the bank manager.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.887
Hello, bank manager.

00:06:31.887 --> 00:06:32.970
We've got this great game.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.220
It's a role-playing game in
which you're a hero or wizard.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.428
And you kill these monsters,
and it goes on for days.

00:06:37.428 --> 00:06:38.910
And the box doesn't
look very much,

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.370
but it really is
an incredible game.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.280
It's going to change
the whole world.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.900
And the bank manager
looks at you,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.540
a bit like a dog
watching television.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.580
Has no comprehension whatsoever
of what you're talking about

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.927
and ushers you quickly outside.

00:06:54.927 --> 00:06:56.760
So we had to make a
decision whether to have

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.414
somewhere to live or
somewhere to operate from.

00:06:59.414 --> 00:07:00.580
Clearly we needed an office.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.790
So we took on an office.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.100
And luckily, Steve had
a van similar to this.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.310
Not this one precisely,
but pretty much

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.620
like it, including the front
guard, and it was Van Morrison.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.860
And we lived in there
for three months.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.110
And people say these
days, wasn't it tough?

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.434
But when you're living in the
dream, it's not hard at all.

00:07:19.434 --> 00:07:20.600
You're following your heart.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.230
You're following a passion.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.740
And yes, it was smelly
and cold and miserable,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.630
but we were having
an incredible time.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.900
We were in this smelly
old van from 1 o'clock

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.670
in the morning to
7:00 in the morning.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.696
But we parked
outside a squash club

00:07:34.696 --> 00:07:37.320
and joined the squash club for
a shave and a shower, et cetera.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.810
And got really good
at squash by default.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.520
And then into a little
mail order office,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.370
where if a customer
came in, one of us

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.240
had to leave because
it wasn't big enough.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.740
So that's it-- a progress.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.420
But it was brilliant times.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.420
And I always tell
everybody to, if they can,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.300
to follow their heart and
start their own business

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.000
if they're able to or want to.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.016
Inevitably, we had to
expand the business.

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:03.640
We'd had a lot of
trouble trying to get

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.140
other retailers to understand
what a role-playing game was.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.490
They couldn't quite get their
head around not just a box

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.070
that wasn't a contained game.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.620
But also you need peripheral
stuff, like miniatures

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.060
and magazines and supplements.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.780
And it was just too much
of a malarkey for them.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.501
So we decided to
open our own shops,

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:24.000
because we thought
that was the best

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.920
thing to have was a flagship.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.920
And the one thing we wanted
to have with Workshop

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.700
was a Games Workshop experience.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.230
So rather than hiring
traditional retailers,

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.330
we decided to hire
a hobbyist, those

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.909
who enjoy playing the
games as much as we did.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.434
Because whilst they didn't
know about retailing as such,

00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:44.850
they knew everything you needed
to know about role-playing

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.440
games and painting miniatures.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.514
And so they created
this experience,

00:08:48.514 --> 00:08:50.430
and they were effectively
incredible retailers

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.500
because of their enthusiasm.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.420
So it became a
place to go and talk

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.460
about games and play games.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.090
I think it still maintains
that spirit largely today.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.530
We opened our first shop in
Hammersmith in West London,

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.590
and this was April 1978.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.590
We were surprised to see
the length of the queue

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.086
on that glorious day.

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:14.460
I've been trying ever since,
well, in the last few years,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.220
to reconnect with some of those
people that were in the queue

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.530
so we can try and do
an Abbey Road reunion

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.390
shot at some point.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.366
I met three people so
far, and obviously you're

00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:26.240
all far too young to
have been in that queue.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.740
But if you know anybody
who was, let me know.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.380
Might be a bit challenging
to do that photo by the way,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.571
because it's now Bosnia and
Herzegovina Community Advice

00:09:34.571 --> 00:09:35.070
Centre.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.350
But I'm sure with a bit of
Photoshop we can do that.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.310
Anyway, I'm no longer
associated with Workshop.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.760
Steve and I sold out
in the early '90s.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.920
But some of you
will know Workshop,

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.890
a publicly quoted company
now, doing wonderful things.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.170
And I focus completely
on their own IP.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.750
And I think that's
really important,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.400
because intellectual
property is what

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.840
builds real value in companies.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.630
It's often the case in
the UK in particular

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.180
that we have to trade away
our IP for project finance

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.312
so we end up being
a work for hire.

00:10:07.312 --> 00:10:09.770
And if you want to build real
value into any company you're

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.250
starting up, make sure you
retain ownership of your IP,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.010
because that's where the
value ultimately lies.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.270
So we were big
role-playing fans.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.550
We designed our own dungeons,
became fanatical players,

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.530
wrote some of the parts of the
rules and booklets for D&amp;D.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.250
And we also used to organize
these events called Games Day.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.590
Workshop still does it
today, but ours was very much

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.440
focused on role-playing
and D&amp;D rather than

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.760
Warhammer fancy battles
and Warhammer 40k.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:46.260
And at Games Day 80,
Penguin Books took a stand.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.650
And Geraldine Cook,
one of their editors,

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:53.840
was fascinated by some 3,000
or 4,000 people completely

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.470
consumed and obsessed by
playing role-playing games.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.940
And she said to
Steve and I, would it

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.770
be possible for you
to think about writing

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.915
a book about the hobby
of role-playing games?

00:11:02.915 --> 00:11:05.040
And we thought about that
for a second and thought,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.623
wouldn't it be much more fun if
we gave people the opportunity

00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:10.610
to experience what a
role-playing book is?

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.340
And if we could somehow
change the Dungeon

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.940
Master to be the book
and give multiple choice

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.100
and how is that idea?

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.950
And we called this
idea Magic Quest.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.570
And she took it away as an idea,
told the MD of Penguin Books

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.940
about this
interactive book idea.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.470
And apparently he
laughed so hard

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.800
he banged his head on the desk,
saying that wouldn't possibly

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.340
work.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.381
No one's interested in
interactive entertainment,

00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:41.870
certainly no one's interested
in interactive literature.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.850
So it took us nearly
a year of convincing.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.890
And Geraldine, to her
credit, was the person

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.260
who really drove this
through until they

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.990
decided they would test the
market through Puffin Books.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.060
Because they observed
quite rightly

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.310
this is more likely to be
appealing to children aged

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.200
9, 10, 11, rather than adults.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.950
So the very first
Fighting Fantasy game book

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:09.170
came out in 1982, "The
Warlock of Firetop Mountain."

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:15.260
And yeah, Penguin Books ended
up reprinting the first book

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.510
about 12 times in
the first six months

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.262
because they had no faith in it.

00:12:19.262 --> 00:12:21.470
They couldn't really get
their head around themselves

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.900
what an interactive book was.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.030
But they did, and the
reality of the day

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.180
was playground chat, the best
recommendation you could have,

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.610
and that was very successful.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.480
And that message grew out
there, so we finally got

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.550
commissioned to write two more.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.950
And here we are 35 years later.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.800
And Scholastic, the
largest publisher of books,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.600
children's books,
in the world are

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.830
taking on the mantle of
republishing, reimagining

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.880
Fighting Fantasy.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.580
And some of you will
have in your hands

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.280
the new book written to
celebrate the 35th anniversary,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.450
"The Port of Peril."

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.700
So even though you might
think it's too young for you,

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.250
maybe some 8, 9,
10-year-olds that you

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.480
know might appreciate it.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.070
Hopefully you will
as well because I

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.250
write them for myself, not
necessarily for children.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.230
So why are these
books different?

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.540
Well, they were taking the
essence of role playing

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.310
and giving people choice.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.350
These were books in which
you, the reader, are the hero.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.980
They're not a linear narrative
where you may or may not

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.450
connect to the main character.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.390
These were an
interactive book in which

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.480
you make all the choices.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.180
It was, in effect,
analogue hypertext.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.800
At the end of each
paragraph, there's

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.980
400 paragraphs, which
if you read sequentially

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.337
make no sense whatsoever.

00:13:32.337 --> 00:13:34.670
But at the end of the paragraph,
you're given a choice--

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.480
simplistically
turn left or right.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.240
In this case, are you
going to talk to this guy

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.440
or get into the basket?

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.360
Are you going to
carry on walking?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.030
So there's hundreds of ways
of going through these books--

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.897
but only one way.

00:13:48.897 --> 00:13:50.480
And the difference
between these books

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.010
and other choose-your-own
adventures that

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.390
were coming around
at the same time

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.520
is that these were the very
first books with a game

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.550
system attached to them.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.160
So it was a branching
narrative with a game system

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.994
to reflect the
combat and get people

00:14:01.994 --> 00:14:04.160
to have a sense that they're
overcoming the monsters

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.420
that they meet along the way.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.060
People subsequently
have called them

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.580
the gamefication of literature.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:16.760
There's lots of terms about
Fighting Fantasy being

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.941
one of the great main
causes for interactive games

00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:22.940
as we know them today,
particularly video games.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.630
But back then, we
were just kind of

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.880
making it up as we went along.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.790
We were delighted
by the success.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:34.160
And art played a very
important part in the covers.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.250
Because we were a Puffin
book, Penguin, the publishers,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:42.670
were worried that because the
the books were interactive

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:46.550
with ghouls and demons and stuff
that that could be frightening.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.770
So they wanted very tame covers.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.480
They wanted covers that
had a little toadstool

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.540
and a gnome sitting on
them and butterflies.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.480
And we wanted covers
that threatened to bite

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.690
the faces off the readers.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:14:59.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.100
And we wanted to use our
Games Workshop artists.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.670
And we won that argument,
I'm delighted to say.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.390
And we used some of the
best artists around.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.230
This particular guy, who
printed the blood beast

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.720
on Deathtrap
Dungeon, Iain McCaig,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.090
he went on to create Darth
Maul for George Lucas.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.720
So we were giving
young artists a chance

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.450
to be able to do what they
want to do for themselves

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.940
rather than being told
what to do by publishers.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.720
And we also convinced
mainly foreign publishers

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.740
to use our covers as well for
the very same argument, that we

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.800
thought children get excited
rather than frightened

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.670
by the covers that we offered.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.090
Sometimes some
territories thought

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.530
they knew better than
we did, and we bowed

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.340
to their greater knowledge.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.280
So I'll show you the
cover that was used

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.244
in Japan of Deathtrap Dungeon.

00:15:50.244 --> 00:15:52.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.750
I can't possibly
comment on that,

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.900
but it's safe to
make your own mind.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.870
Anyway, the net result is
they got a whole generation

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.480
of children reading again.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.620
Some 17, 18, 19 million
copies were sold.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.720
This is theoretically
a great thing.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.400
They were empowering, great for
reluctant readers, inspiring

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.140
children to write their own
stories, to become artists,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.620
to enjoy the medium.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.890
So it was also
found subsequently

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.290
that Fighting Fantasy game
books improved literacy by 17%.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.760
And children were asking
their parents, hey, dad,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.120
what's a sarcophagus?

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.470
And once there more and
write their own adventures.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.840
It really encouraged
creative writing.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.320
So you'd think you'd get some
good headlines in the media,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.650
but no, I'm afraid not.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.239
Not back in those days, because
there was no social media.

00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:43.030
The children couldn't
get their message out

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.660
to tell their parents that
these were a good thing.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.900
Being obsessed by these books
was seen as a bad thing.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.750
The Evangelical Alliance
published an eight-page warning

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:58.330
guide about them, saying if you
read these books, interacting

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.860
with ghouls and
demons, you're bound

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.990
to be possessed by the devil.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.140
There's no choice.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.790
A worried housewife
in deeper suburbia

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.680
phoned in her local
radio station,

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.955
said that having read one of
my books her son levitated.

00:17:11.955 --> 00:17:13.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:18.250
So the kids were thinking,
for one pound 50, I can fly?

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.359
Really?

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.940
Oh, yeah, we'll
have some of that.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.310
And the local vicar
threatened to chain himself

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.670
to the railings of Penguin
Books until they were banned.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.480
There were petitions
to have them burnt.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.470
There were magazine articles,
this one in particular,

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.960
warning that children
actually participate

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.610
through their imaginations.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.890
God forbid that
was ever to happen.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.720
What a strange thing to
do when you can have nice,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.620
safe stuff where you
don't have to think.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.110
Petition sent in
to Penguin Books,

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.650
we the undersigned demand that
the series of Fighting Fantasy

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.814
game be withdrawn from
publication immediately

00:17:55.814 --> 00:17:57.730
as we believe them to
be dangerous and harmful

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.989
to children.

00:17:59.989 --> 00:18:01.030
I've got their addresses.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.871
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:09.050
There will be a day
when I come back.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.980
But the thing is, history
has never been kind to games.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.930
Back in the 1850s,
"Scientific American"

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.040
wrote rather alarming
things even about chess,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.640
that people should be doing much
nobler things with their mind

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.800
than wasting it on chess.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.070
And of course when it
comes to video games,

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.110
the media goes into
an apoplectic frenzy

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.750
when talking about
some particular games.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.700
Now "Grand Theft Auto V" is a
great British success story.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.280
It generates a billion dollars
its first week of revenues

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.660
and should be celebrated as
bringing art and technology

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.120
together to create this
wonderful and interactive

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.890
entertainment medium.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.670
And yet, the press largely
castigated it for its content.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.260
And that's wrong
for many reasons.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.610
A, "Grand Theft
Auto" is rated 18

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.030
and shouldn't be played by
children in the first place.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.480
But it is an
incredible achievement.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.600
The biggest entertainment
franchise in any medium,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.510
is that not a good news
story for this country?

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.180
And there are many blockbusters
in video games that

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.720
are being developed in the
UK, for global publishers

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.220
everywhere.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.210
We are a great nation
at making games.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.880
And we have created some
great intellectual property

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.530
in this country.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.260
These are some of the companies
I advise or chair or something.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.200
They're all doing
amazing things,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.240
generating original
content everywhere.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.750
So if we can just pull
back a little bit and say,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.870
how did this notion of games
being a bad thing come from?

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.660
Is it because play
is seen as trivial

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.340
and has no value whatsoever?

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.860
Should we stop at a certain age
to stop playing, playing games?

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.150
Why is that?

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:52.000
So I'm sure many of you are
familiar with this, games only

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.380
really became commercialized
with Atari's "Pong"

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.640
in the early '70s.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.460
Yes, I got into video
games in the mid-80s first

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.635
designing the launch for a
small developer called Domark.

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:05.470
The game was called Eureka.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.910
And Domark, three
of the companies

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.450
metamorphosed into Eidos
PLC in the mid-90s.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.457
And of course, Eidos best known
for launching "Tomb Raiders."

00:20:14.457 --> 00:20:16.540
And I was the executive
chairman when we did that.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.944
So where did "Tomb
Raider" come from?

00:20:18.944 --> 00:20:21.360
Again, lots of people think
it was developed in the States

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.040
or in Japan.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.470
But it was actually
created in Derby,

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:30.600
right here and by this guy
in particular, Toby Gard.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.070
He was an artist at Core Design.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.150
Core Design was owned at
that time by CentreGold,

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.310
and we bought
CentreGold in March '96.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.560
We being Eidos PLC.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.350
And part of the due
diligence period

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.900
required me to go around
and look at all the studios

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.730
and the assets of CentreGold.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.970
And when I went to Derby and saw
"Tomb Raider" in development,

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.550
I guess you could say it
was love at first sight.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.620
It was amazing to see.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.220
Not just an
interesting character,

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.900
but the fact it was great
technology, great graphics,

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.560
fantastic gameplay.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.910
And the first games with a
3D character in a 3D world.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.679
It had all the planets lined up.

00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:09.970
But of course, everyone talks
about the main character,

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.230
Lara Croft.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.710
And Toby, the artist, was
the person who created Lara.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.860
Now, he'd been given
a task to replace

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.800
the lead character of a game
that Core originally produced,

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.240
called "Rick Dangerous."

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.450
And the reason was that
Rick had a slight similarity

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.020
to a character in a film
I've forgotten the name of.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:35.950
But it was his task, as the
industry grew up and matured,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.890
to obviously get
its act in gear.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.790
So everyone thought
that Toby was

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.110
going to create
another male character.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:49.740
But he'd seen the rise of girl
power and a cherry, Tank Girl.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.930
And his original
sketch for Laura Croft

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.629
was in fact Lara Cruz, was
just a simplistic thing.

00:21:55.629 --> 00:21:57.170
And another thing
I say to developers

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.415
when they're starting
off about the points

00:21:59.415 --> 00:22:01.290
I made earlier about
intellectual properties,

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.510
if you can hang onto your IP, it
could be worth a lot of money.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:09.090
What started as a simple sketch
turned into a multibillion

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.060
dollar franchise.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.600
So let that be a warning.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:22.050
So "Tomb Raider" came out
originally in October 1996.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:27.650
And Lara Croft became a
pop culture phenomenon

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:31.970
not just in the games
industry but way beyond.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:37.340
It became a main entertainment
franchise in the mass market.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.930
And so the power
of the brand again.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.660
When you own the IP,
you don't only just

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.341
get the revenues
from publishing,

00:22:46.341 --> 00:22:47.840
you get all the
incremental revenues

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.050
from licensing and merchandising
and all these brands,

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.070
powerful in themselves.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.870
So the value of
having Lara Croft,

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.940
it gave them incremental
revenue through promotion.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.460
And of course, she didn't
go unnoticed by Hollywood.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.740
Now, Hollywood traditionally
created their own IP, looked

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.200
to literature, to comics.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.870
And now they're looking at
games because of the impact

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.780
that games is having on society.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.996
And we managed to get ourselves
an executive producer role,

00:23:15.996 --> 00:23:17.870
because we wanted to
make sure that Hollywood

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.970
didn't take Lara Croft
in a direction we

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.440
didn't want it to go.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.660
So we had a veto over the
scripts and over the cast.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.910
And when they suggested
that Angelina Jolie play

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.420
the role of Lara Croft, we said
that's absolutely fine with us,

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.440
no problem whatsoever.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.120
Yes, those were the jolly '90s.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.890
And so reunion with all
the Lara Croft models

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.630
with some old bloke, and
it was a very tough job,

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.510
and I survived it.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:51.270
So console games, still
huge as we all know.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.560
The console is not going away.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.060
In fact, this
generation of hardware

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.210
has been larger
install base than

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.060
any other previous iterations.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.450
So it's great that still
continues to grow the market.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.440
But for some people, console
gaming is a challenge,

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.560
and the intimidation of
a 15-button controller

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.540
is just too much
for some people.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.890
And then along came
smartphones, and of course Apple

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.890
in particular with
swipe technology.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.950
And then anybody could
become a games player

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.350
by just swiping their
finger across the screen

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.400
and being able to access
an all you can eat store.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.447
It was transformational
for expanding the market,

00:24:27.447 --> 00:24:29.780
and this was additive rather
than replacing the existing

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.874
markets.

00:24:30.874 --> 00:24:32.540
Of course, the challenge
today of course

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.976
is two million users
trying to reach

00:24:34.976 --> 00:24:36.350
an audience of
two billion people

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.058
through the world's
smallest shop window.

00:24:38.058 --> 00:24:39.100
But that's another story.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.808
For every "Angry
Birds," there's probably

00:24:40.808 --> 00:24:42.360
20,000 dead birds out there.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.330
But that doesn't
stop people trying

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.590
to become the next big thing.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.790
And I'm not going to go into
the challenges of mobile games

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.580
today other than to say
marketing, monetization,

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.910
metrics, and margin are
the most important things.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.460
I don't have time to go
into the data of that.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.849
But if I was
launching a new game

00:24:59.849 --> 00:25:02.140
or advising people to make
a new game on the app store,

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.687
you've got to make sure you
have an open mouth on the icon

00:25:04.687 --> 00:25:06.020
because that's really important.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.360
Without an open mouth,
you're doomed to failure.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.970
So we've seen games move from a
niche to a mainstream audience.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.530
We see children still
loving playing games,

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.600
the young adults playing games.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.510
You got old people like
me still playing games.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.220
And we see games
pervasive everywhere

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.490
you go-- on public
transport, out in the open,

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.340
people are happy to
be seen playing games.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.050
We're seeing games
become a spectator

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:34.550
sport, the huge rise of
e-sports and prizes to be won.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.400
And people are very happy to
watch games being played live

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.650
or watching them being
streamed or watching people

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.570
playing games on YouTube.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.450
It's an incredible experience
now and another great market.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.630
The net result is the games
industry is a $100 billion

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.380
industry.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.004
It's the largest
entertainment industry

00:25:50.004 --> 00:25:52.860
in the world and again, a
great British success story.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.240
But beyond entertainment,
I'd also argue in many ways

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.280
that games are
actually good for you.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.540
A, they're social.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.870
We're playing with our friends.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.372
We're enjoying that
social activity.

00:26:03.372 --> 00:26:07.070
Even for old people,
give rehabilitation

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.200
a sense of purpose, burning
off calories as well.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.380
These are a good thing.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.180
Games require to problem solve.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.210
You cannot get through a game
without solving problems.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.270
You cannot advance until
you solve problems.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.610
And that is clearly
a good thing.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.696
You're given
continuous assessment.

00:26:24.696 --> 00:26:26.570
You're allowed to fail
in a safe environment.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.710
No one is going to punish
you for making a mistake.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.760
In fact, you're encouraged
to start again and try again.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.560
It's not a binary decision--

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.900
you're wrong, you're
wrong, you're a failure,

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.820
and you're right.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.220
You can try multiple ways.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.930
That allows a conversational
thinking approach

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:47.720
to solving a game and doing
it in a very encouraging way.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.650
Games can be used as a
contextual hub for learning.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.210
Take a simulation game like
"Roller Coaster Tycoon."

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.930
You're building a theme park.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.920
You understand the physics of
the rides that you're building.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.390
You understand the economy when
you're pricing those rides.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.980
You're understanding
staffing levels

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.270
as you decide how much
resource and overhead

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.690
you want to apply
to that theme park.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.406
And if you do it right,
your virtual customers

00:27:14.406 --> 00:27:15.530
will enter your theme park.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.200
If you do it wrong, you
can tweak the parameters.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.710
So you're encouraged
to try again.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.820
And ultimately, over time,
everyone can be a winner.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.130
It's not just you
on a random day

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.170
through an examination--
you're right

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.590
and you're wrong because you
remembered the wrong things.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.370
So this is a great way and
a multidisciplinary way

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.190
of learning through games.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.340
Games like "Sim City," you
can study all sorts of things

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.640
with "Sim City," even
urban regeneration.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.010
You can imagine a geography
teacher goes into a class

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:49.230
and says, OK, kids, today we're
going to do urban regeneration.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.400
You just see the color just
drain out of their faces.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.292
And yet with "Sim
City," you can do that.

00:27:54.292 --> 00:27:55.250
You can learn about it.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.850
You can step into history and
understand the ramifications

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.730
of the decisions you make
by being part of history

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.740
in civilization.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.110
You can understand physics.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.289
You can understand ethical
problems in "The Walking Dead."

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:11.830
And then games like
"Minecraft" where

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:16.100
you're building these wonderful
3D architectural worlds

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.900
to incredible degrees and
share them with your friends.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.910
I mean who wouldn't want
to become an architect

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.790
after playing "Minecraft?"

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.950
Games, going back to
the simulation thing,

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.930
for surgeons, for
the armed forces.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.520
Clearly there's
no downside if you

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.520
get things wrong when you're
using simulation software.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.380
And people seem still hung up
on games as being a bad thing.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.890
These simulations are
games without the scoring.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.810
And people still think that you
have to read, more knowledge,

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.560
and clam up this hard
drive with facts,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.790
rather than teach
them how to think.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.280
And so I usually
say to them, well,

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.777
when you next fly across
whatever ocean it is

00:28:56.777 --> 00:28:59.110
and you think about your
pilot, how they learned to fly,

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.870
would you prefer that they
read by reading a book

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.500
or using simulation software?

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.370
Which is, again, to say a game.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.620
So some of the
greatest people we

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:13.300
know in the world of technology
have really said, a lot of it's

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.340
down to games.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.480
These four gentlemen all
say, the missing words

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.540
are playing and
games, and they all

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.562
attribute games to
being a wonderful thing.

00:29:25.562 --> 00:29:29.180
And Demis Hassabis, as you
clearly know from DeepMind--

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.180
and I once beat him at a
board game, by the way.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:31.971
I wish he was here.

00:29:31.971 --> 00:29:33.760
I could sneer at him openly.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.856
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.990
He's always said that
he's viewed his obsession

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.040
with playing games is training
his mind in multiple facets.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.560
And he's a great living
example of the power of play.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.250
So if you can part your
prejudice about one or two

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.080
titles and think
cognitively what's

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.730
happening when you're
playing a game,

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.580
all these things are
giving you life skills.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.430
These are matter skills
for the 21st century

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.280
from just the problem solving
to the creative components,

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.400
et cetera.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.344
There was a program on
Horizon about 18 months ago,

00:30:05.344 --> 00:30:06.760
I don't know if
any of you saw it.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.420
But they're trying to find out--

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.070
were games effectively
good or bad for you?

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.680
And at the end of the program,
they had some old people,

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.950
and they did an
MRI scan on them.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:23.060
And said, go away with
this tablet full of games

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:26.740
and come back a month
later, which they did.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.240
And they played lots of puzzle
games, little simple strategy

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.260
games.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.860
And they did another MRI scan
and their cognitive activity

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.410
had really increased
substantially.

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.570
And it was really
put out there then,

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.270
maybe we should be giving
old people tablets to play on

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.570
rather than tablets to swallow
to solve their problems.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:48.050
And the other great
things about games

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:51.100
is the industry itself
is a brilliant industry.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.950
It supports so many great causes
and interacts and allows people

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.810
to do things that no
one ordinary can do.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.320
Now Special Effects, of
which I act as an ambassador,

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.400
fantastic charity.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.560
It gives children with
severe disabilities

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.110
the opportunity
to play and engage

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.020
with the world in which they
wouldn't have otherwise.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.020
And they modify games technology
to bring an experience

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.045
for these children.

00:31:13.045 --> 00:31:14.580
I'll just show
you a small video.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.889
And if you have the chance to
help Special Effect, please do.

00:31:17.889 --> 00:31:19.885
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:50.823 --> 00:31:52.320
[LAUGHING]

00:33:38.108 --> 00:33:40.145
[SHOUTING HAPPILY]

00:33:54.495 --> 00:33:56.870
IAN LIVINGSTONE: That's the
great work of Special Effect.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:01.360
And you never know, one day.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.848
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.850
Maybe not in my lifetime,
but you never know.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.320
So we play games.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.960
We love consuming content.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.300
But how do we
actually make them?

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.449
And how do we get more
diversity into games

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:21.804
from all society to reflect the
content, particularly women?

00:34:21.804 --> 00:34:23.095
Well, we are a creative nation.

00:34:23.095 --> 00:34:26.300
Look at our film, our fashion,
our music, our theater,

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.449
our publishing, and of
course our games industry.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.469
And of course,
video games brings

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.719
art and technology like no
other medium, I would suggest.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:38.540
The storytelling, the art,
and science and technology.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:42.030
And as Google knows more than
any other company in the world,

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.300
I'll say, there's a dearth
of software engineers.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.760
Not just for video
games industry,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:52.000
but for all industries.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.350
And I was involved
with campaigning

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:58.520
to get computer science on
the national curriculum.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.490
As an employee myself
back in the day,

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:04.310
it was quite alarming
what a difficulty

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:08.540
it was to get coders and digital
artists and software engineers

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.940
of a high enough caliber
to work in our industries.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.190
And it's not just about games.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.210
It's designing a jet
propulsion engine

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.630
or fighting cybercrime
the way you guys do here.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.150
It just wasn't happening.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:24.440
So I went to Ed Vaizey, the
former culture minister.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.490
And he pushed it straight
back onto us and said,

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.980
well, why don't
you write a review?

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.890
Which I did with Alex
Hope of Double Negative.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.990
And the fantastic
research is from NESTA,

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:40.100
who funded all the work,
and [INAUDIBLE] studies,

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.090
and gave us two fantastic
researchers in Hasan

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.740
Bakhshi and Juan Mateos
Garcia, and of course

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.690
published the review.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.210
And we were talking
about how we're

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.010
going to turn children
from being consumers

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.260
to creators, how
they're going to be

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.210
empowered for the digital age.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.700
As Douglas Rushkoff said,
do we direct technology

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.006
or do we let ourselves
be directed by it?

00:36:01.006 --> 00:36:03.380
Are we going to be in the
driving seat or the passenger's

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.490
seat of this technology?

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.610
So long story short, the
main problem we found

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.550
was that ICT as was
taught in schools

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:11.740
was not fit for purpose.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.410
It was largely a strange
hybrid of office tutorials,

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.936
boring kids to death
with PowerPoint and Excel

00:36:17.936 --> 00:36:19.310
and giving them
no insight on how

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.141
to create their own technology.

00:36:21.141 --> 00:36:23.390
So our main recommendation
was to put computer science

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.472
on the curriculum as
an essential discipline

00:36:26.472 --> 00:36:27.680
because this was nothing new.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.710
Back in the 1980s, the
BBC was a cornerstone

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.270
of computing in schools.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.240
And then at home,
everyone had a Speccy,

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.340
an affordable,
programmable machine.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.280
And those two
machines themselves

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.070
were one of the instrumental
reasons why the video games

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:46.880
industry took off
so early in the UK.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.850
And that all got
changed as people,

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:52.970
schools worried about people
accessing the open internet

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.020
and viruses and stuff.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.420
So they were just allowed to use
other people's software rather

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.600
than writing their own.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.529
Now, we did do a film.

00:36:59.529 --> 00:37:01.070
We haven't got time
to show it today,

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:05.830
but you can see it
on YouTube or Next

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:09.950
Gen. It's about 14 minutes
long, which we submitted again

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:11.130
on our application.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.060
Of course, we're also
thankful to Eric Schmidt, who

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.700
referenced our Next
Gen review in his Q&amp;A

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.720
at this Mactaggart lecture.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.470
And he was saying how
he was flabbergasted

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.690
that computer science
wasn't taught in schools.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.090
And of course, if Eric
said it, it has to be true.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:28.310
And the then prime minister
echoed his words saying,

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.800
we're not doing enough
for programmers.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.190
And Mr. Popular,
one thing you have

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.970
to say in support
of Michael Gove

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.250
is that he was instrumental
in making the change.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.410
He listened to not
just what I was saying

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:46.120
and Alex Hope was saying,
but the whole world,

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.330
including Google, the
learner societies,

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.840
every digital company
in the UK just about

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.710
was saying the same thing.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:59.940
And he did allow the
computer curriculum

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.070
to take over from the
ICT curriculum, which

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.310
is a great thing.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:04.860
So 2014, that happened.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.595
Computing is here.

00:38:06.595 --> 00:38:08.220
Who's going to be up
for the challenge?

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.980
Who's going to
teach the teachers?

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.040
I know this is some
of the initiative

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.030
that Google is doing.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.180
It's great there are
resources everywhere,

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.330
as hope that creativity
is essential to this

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.030
because a lot of it is dry,
and I know a lot of children

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.290
are not enjoying it.

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:25.380
So we have to do a lot to make
computer science exciting,

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.250
show what can be done with this
wonderful thing called code.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:32.340
I recently wrote a book called
"Hacking the Curriculum," which

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.329
is free in this month's
issue of Hello World,

00:38:34.329 --> 00:38:35.370
if you happen to get one.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:38.700
But this is trying to be a
practical guide and a fun

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.640
way for teachers to
teach computer science.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.220
Because it can be argued
that computer science is

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.780
the new Latin
because it underpins

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.820
the digital world
in the way Latin

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.770
underpinned the analog world.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:52.450
And I hated school.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.630
And a lot of children
today hate it

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:58.140
even more through the narrowness
through which it's taught.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.640
And as Einstein
said, the only thing

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.610
that interferes with
learning is education.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.290
And Generation Z are different.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:07.110
They are naturally connected.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.120
Again, you know more
than anybody else

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.630
how they happily share
everything that they have.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.530
They naturally collaborate.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.600
When they go to school, that
is a different experience

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.700
altogether.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.380
And with the furious
rates of change,

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.150
we have to train children--

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.870
well, train is the
wrong word, but allow

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.550
them to learn skills
that are going

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.730
to enable them to have
jobs, be ready for jobs

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.380
that don't yet exist.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.060
And the World Economic
Forum recently

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.600
said that for 2020, the
three most important things

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:43.120
for any child is complex
problem solving, creativity,

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.620
and critical thinking.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.370
Now, of course, it was OK
back in the day for everyone

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.460
to learn the same stuff,
because you're just going

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.990
to transplant these children.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.852
They've all had their brains
stuffed with the same facts

00:39:54.852 --> 00:39:56.310
into the factory,
because they were

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.430
going to do the same thing.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.220
But we know the
robots are coming.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.204
So there's no point in trying
to train children like robots,

00:40:04.204 --> 00:40:06.120
because they won't
actually be able to compete

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.810
with the real thing.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.282
So we have to teach our
children how to think.

00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:12.240
Now, one of things I'm
also doing at the moment

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.590
is to set up a foundation.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.920
We're going to be opening
to academies in 2019,

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.680
working in conjunction with
Aspirations Academy's Trust,

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.772
one in Bournemouth and
one in East London.

00:40:22.772 --> 00:40:25.105
And trying to put some of the
things that we believe in,

00:40:25.105 --> 00:40:29.370
some problem-based learning and
projects and all the contextual

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:33.060
learning to give real
meaning and understanding

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.220
for the children.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.380
So acknowledge the importance
of but know how it's

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.350
equally important in my mind.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:43.062
So let's get some more practical
work in the school room.

00:40:43.062 --> 00:40:45.270
It seems to me that the
government is pushing it more

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.490
to academic success,
even arts exams.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.500
Now you have to do a written
paper and theories and things.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:56.100
And we seem to be stripping
creativity and diversity out

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.960
of the curriculum rather
than adding to it.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.770
We're supposed to be a creative
nation that is doing so well,

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.830
our fastest growing sector.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:08.580
So let's allow children to
enjoy what they read, especially

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.590
"Port of Peril."

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:11.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.790
Now, if you start children
off on Shakespeare,

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.160
chances are you're going to
put off reading for life.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.650
You read Shakespeare
when you're ready for it.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.960
So whether it's comics
or an interactive book,

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.940
the point is to get
children reading,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.490
to enjoy the experience
and move on when

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.050
they're ready to
things that might

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.480
be seen as more challenging.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:35.380
And let's not keep
teaching the same things.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.320
We're not all academics
and yet require

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.749
children to memorize formula.

00:41:39.749 --> 00:41:42.040
There's no reason we have
all these devices that can do

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.470
the solving of these formula.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:51.480
I gave a talk to about 500
teachers about a year or so ago

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.020
and said, hands up,
anyone can do this?

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.699
And I think about
10 hands went up.

00:41:55.699 --> 00:41:57.490
I'm sure all your hands
are going to go up.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.650
But I'll try anyway.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.232
How many?

00:42:01.232 --> 00:42:02.815
Yeah, I knew that
was going to happen.

00:42:02.815 --> 00:42:04.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.686
But I think you know
what I'm saying.

00:42:07.686 --> 00:42:10.830
It's crazy if you have
devices that can do this.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:12.600
We have to have the
context for children

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.360
in mathematics, how to
apply it rather than being

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.210
scared about it.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:20.130
So let's use games
as a contextual hub.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.260
This child here is
now understanding

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.180
by applying heat to
the surface in the game

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.030
of "Minecraft" to the
silica sand that he's found.

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:28.380
He can make glass.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.090
And that will live with
him forever as he puts it

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.540
into the world he's created.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:39.630
And Lego is doing quite a lot
too for creative education.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.700
So let's get more of a hands-on
approach, get them to build

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.980
and make a game, do something
with robotics, anything

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:53.581
to get them making, not using,
and allow them to collaborate.

00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:55.080
That's how we work
in the workplace.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.220
It's not cheating.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.420
It's what we do.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.700
So why can't we have
that in schools?

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.910
And more introduction
of code clubs and accept

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.740
our differences.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:10.657
I think this sums it
up really, together.

00:43:10.657 --> 00:43:12.240
Are we saying the
elephant's a failure

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.010
because he can't climb a tree?

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.089
Now together we can
do wonderful things

00:43:16.089 --> 00:43:17.130
because we are different.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:18.930
That's the important thing.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.000
If the problem is,
as Ken Robinson said,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.894
this problem with
conformity is in education

00:43:22.894 --> 00:43:24.810
that people aren't
standardized to begin with.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.150
So there's no point in judging
everyone by the same metric.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.270
So I don't know why
we're relentlessly

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.320
going along that route.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:37.350
The Department for Education
cites China as best practice

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:40.500
for mathematics and want to
introduce Shanghai maths.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.200
At the same time, China
is looking to the UK

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.940
to see how can
they move from made

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.920
in China to designed in China?

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.020
They want to move up the
value chain of creativity.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.831
And so they want to know,
how do you become creative?

00:43:52.831 --> 00:43:54.330
Well, we seem to
be doing everything

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:57.300
to strip creativity out of the
classroom, which to my mind

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.810
seems crazy.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.306
So again, Einstein is
saying, imagination

00:44:01.306 --> 00:44:02.680
is more important
than knowledge.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.540
Knowledge is almost a given,
thanks to Google in particular.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.270
So let's get children
to dream and understand

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.480
the value of the arts.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.720
It should not be no
longer seen as either or.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.530
The diverse opinions,
the self-expression,

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.150
self-determination
that the arts give

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.024
is not just good for
the creative industries,

00:44:23.024 --> 00:44:26.490
it's good for all industries.

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:30.030
The greatest polymath of all
time, Leonardo da Vinci, not

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:33.450
just the world's best
painter but also an engineer

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.170
and a mathematician.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:37.200
So let's embrace
the STEAM agenda.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.110
Let's have arts front
and central to education.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:42.240
It's not just about STEM.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.630
Art should not be just seen
as a facilitator and nice

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:48.330
to have to increase
STEM performance.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.600
And let's stop punishing
children for making mistakes.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.730
Failure is just success
work-in-progress

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.230
as we saw in the game.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.480
So allow them to fail,
not feel bad about it.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.050
We all have something great
to do, we can all contribute.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:05.580
So all I'd say to finish is
that in the analog world,

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.359
the winners were really often
down to the amount of capital

00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:11.400
they had because you have
to build physical goods

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.960
and have expensive
distribution channels,

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.380
and that was quite complex.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.980
But today, any child given the
right digital making skills

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.760
and entrepreneurial spirit
wanting to do these things,

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.530
allow them to build
goods and services

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:30.300
they can access global markets
through high speed broadband

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.100
and monetize the world.

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.566
So I think there are equal
digital opportunities that

00:45:34.566 --> 00:45:36.190
were not available
in the analog world.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.350
So hopefully they will
start their own business,

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:40.500
hopefully they'll hang
on to their own IP.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.755
They might not become
the next Mark Zuckerberg,

00:45:42.755 --> 00:45:45.840
but maybe they will become
a digital entrepreneur.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.950
Thank you.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.400
