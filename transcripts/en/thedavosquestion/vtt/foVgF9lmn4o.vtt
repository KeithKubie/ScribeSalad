00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
&gt;&gt; Here you go.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Looking at the camera?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.090
&gt;&gt; Okay. China will help to pull us out of
this crisis but of course, not a lot. It depends

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.619
a lot on the other emerging countries like
Brazil, like the country I'm from, and also

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:25.329
the US. We cannot live economically without
the help of the Americans. So China can help

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:32.559
and will help and actually China is already
helping us to get out of this, but we have

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:39.230
to do a lot of things to go back to the old
good times, so it takes a lot of time. I expect

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.510
at least two or three years.
