00:00:00.573 --> 00:00:02.479
- Let's say that we have the function

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:05.458
F of X is equal to X squared

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:07.968
plus one and what we want to do

00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:10.605
is we want to figure out the average value

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:15.605
of our function F on the interval,

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.225
on the closed interval between zero

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:24.225
and let's say between zero and three.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.806
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:27.718
especially if you've seen the other videos

00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:29.618
on introducing the idea of an average

00:00:29.618 --> 00:00:31.031
value of a function and figure out

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:31.787
what this is.

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:33.865
What is the average
value of our function F

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:34.938
over this interval?

00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:37.574
So, I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:37.574 --> 00:00:39.536
Let's just visualize what's going on

00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:42.850
and then we can actually find the average.

00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:46.141
So that's my Y axis.

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:49.283
This is my X axis.

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:51.774
Now over the interval between

00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:53.402
zero and three, so let's say

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:58.402
this is the zero, this is one, two, three.

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:00.538
It's a closed interval.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.217
When X is zero F of zero

00:01:03.217 --> 00:01:04.560
is going to be one.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.401
So, we're going to be right over here.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.408
F of one is two.

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:14.548
So it's one, two, three.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:15.876
Actually, let me make my scale

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:17.351
a little bit smaller on that.

00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:18.876
I have to go all the way up to 10.

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:20.802
So this is going to be 10.

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:23.293
This is going to be five.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.091
And then one, two, three.

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:29.797
This is the hardest part is making

00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:30.832
this even.

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:33.512
So see this is going to be in the middle.

00:01:33.512 --> 00:01:35.910
Pretty good, and then
let's see in the middle.

00:01:36.176 --> 00:01:37.176
Then we have that.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.663
Good enough. All right.

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.895
So, we're going to be there.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.559
We're going to be there.

00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:44.355
I have obviously different scales

00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:45.475
for X and Y axis.

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:47.787
Two squared plus one is five.

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:50.496
Three squared plus one is 10.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.078
Three squared plus one is 10.

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:55.209
So it's going to look something like this.

00:01:55.485 --> 00:01:56.476
This is what our function is going

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:57.379
to look like.

00:01:58.455 --> 00:01:59.798
So, that's the graph of Y is

00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:01.014
equal to F of X.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.928
And we care about the average value

00:02:02.928 --> 00:02:06.179
on the closed interval
between zero and three.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.592
Between zero and three.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.728
So, one way to think about it,

00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:12.620
you could apply the formula,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.366
but it's very important to think about

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.842
what does that formula actually mean?

00:02:14.842 --> 00:02:15.959
Once again, you shouldn't memorize

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.064
this formula because it actually kind

00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:19.299
of falls out out of
what it actually means.

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.141
So the average of our function

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:26.861
is going to be equal to the definite

00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:28.693
integral over this interval.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.681
So, essentially the area under this curve.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.279
So, it's going to be
the definite intergral

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.643
from zero to three of F of X which is

00:02:37.643 --> 00:02:41.074
X squared plus one DX.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.799
Then we're going to take this area.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.734
We're going to take this area

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:46.041
right over here and we're going

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.669
to divide it by the width of our interval

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.727
to essentially come up
with the average height,

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:53.284
or the average value of our function.

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:56.091
So, we're going to divide it by B minus A,

00:02:56.388 --> 00:02:59.527
or three minus zero, which is just

00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:00.838
going to be three.

00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:03.194
And so now we just have to evaluate this.

00:03:03.593 --> 00:03:04.908
So, this is going to be equal to

00:03:04.908 --> 00:03:06.379
one third times --

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.045
Let's see the antiderivative of X squared

00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:11.678
is X to the third over three.

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:14.890
Antiderivative of one is X,

00:03:15.364 --> 00:03:19.264
and we're going to evaluate
it from zero to three.

00:03:19.592 --> 00:03:22.035
So, this is going to be equal to one third

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:25.918
times when we evaluate it at three.

00:03:25.918 --> 00:03:27.040
Let me use another color here.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.276
When we evaluate it at three it's

00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:29.079
going to be three to the third

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.413
divided by three.

00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:31.790
Well, that's just going to be 27 divided

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.526
by three.

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:35.965
That's nine plus three and then

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:39.864
when we evaluated zero, minus zero

00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:41.970
minus zero.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.283
So, it's just minus.

00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:44.963
When you evaluated zero it's

00:03:44.963 --> 00:03:46.002
just going to be zero.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.950
And so, we are left with --

00:03:50.173 --> 00:03:51.080
I'm going to make the brackets

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.912
that same color.

00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:53.550
This is going to be one third

00:03:53.763 --> 00:03:55.081
times 12.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:59.616
One third times 12, which is equal

00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:00.721
to four.

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:03.512
Which is equal to four.

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:05.507
So this is the average value

00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:06.338
of our function.

00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:07.873
The average value of our function

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:12.873
over this interval is equal to four.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.969
Notice, our function actually hits

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.347
that value at some point in the interval.

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:21.714
At some point in the interval,

00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:24.793
something lower than two
but greater than one.

00:04:24.968 --> 00:04:26.861
We can maybe call that C.

00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:28.994
It looks like our
function hits that value.

00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:33.969
This is actually a generally true thing.

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.218
This is a mean value theorem

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.208
for integrals and we'll
go into more depth there.

00:04:39.348 --> 00:04:41.022
But you can see this kind of does look

00:04:41.022 --> 00:04:42.254
like it's average value.

00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:43.831
That if you imagine the box, if you

00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:45.520
multiplied this height, this average value

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.814
times this width you would have this

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:50.837
area right over here, and this

00:04:50.837 --> 00:04:53.839
area right over here is the same,

00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:56.068
this area that I'm highlighting

00:04:56.068 --> 00:04:58.067
in yellow right over here is the same

00:04:58.074 --> 00:05:00.281
as the area under the curve

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.374
because we have the average height

00:05:02.374 --> 00:05:04.048
times the width is the same

00:05:04.048 --> 00:05:05.364
thing as the area under the curve.

00:05:05.406 --> 00:05:06.235
So, anyway hopefully you found

00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:07.154
that interesting.
