00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.180
[MUSIC]

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.390
These buildings were never
meant to be lived in.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.910
These streets were
never meant for traffic.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.750
These walls were never
meant for family photos.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.740
This is an abandoned town that
was built to be abandoned,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.530
except for a few days every year
when it's a literal war zone.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.414
[SPEAKING OVER RADIO]

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:31.298
[GUNSHOTS]

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.660
This is Fort Ord, a
former US military base,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.340
once inhabited by
soldiers, civilians,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.950
and even German
prisoners of war.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.730
It's now a place of business,
education, and adventure.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.340
But past the hiking
trails and the fences,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.880
beyond the accessible
and familiar,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.450
is this place, Impossible City.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.640
This cement block
city sits alone

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.300
in its namesake,
Impossible Canyon.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.300
It was built in 1984,
but it feels much older,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.069
as if it were once a
real community that

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.870
was abandoned for some reason,
leaving only these gray,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.850
ghost-like buildings.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.550
Abandoned places
like these often

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.570
make us daydream of what
once could have been

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.960
or what once was.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.600
The schoolhouse where the
local children learned,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.380
the office building where
their parents worked,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.370
the town square where
the community gathered

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.690
to celebrate this small city.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.470
But it's a history
that never existed.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.270
The realness of
Impossible City is it

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.370
it's unfortunate necessity,
built as a reaction

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.475
to the ever-changing
face of war,

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.600
one that has moved out of
the jungle and the desert

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.130
and into urban environments.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.980
Impossible City is an active
urban military training

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.950
zone, a real life simulation to
prepare for real life battles.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.350
Its generic, gray
facades are designed

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.690
not to look like any one
city, but instead to be

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.760
a stand-in for all cities.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.040
Training men and women on
how to approach sniper fire

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.850
in the Middle East, or how to
sweep an apartment building

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.350
in middle America.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.100
This is where troops
trained before they

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.570
were deployed to Panama
to capture dictator Manuel

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.200
Noriega.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.310
Today it remains quiet.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.910
Today it is a peaceful city.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.270
Silence has replaced gunfire,
shadows have replaced soldiers,

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.410
and the boot marks in the dirt
have blown away in the wind.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.880
Impossible City is a town
where no one has ever lived,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.149
and a war zone where
no one has ever died.

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:38.690

a deserted rail yard.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.140
These walls were put
up over 100 years ago

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.460
on landfill made partially
from the debris of the 1906

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.680
earthquake that devastated
much of the Bay Area.
