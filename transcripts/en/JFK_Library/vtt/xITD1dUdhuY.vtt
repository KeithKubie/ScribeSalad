00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.150
- Political courage is
doing the right thing

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.150
and when you are tested to
stand up, and when it's hard,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.610
and it's tough you stand
and do the right thing.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.390
Not only did he change those
monuments but he also changed

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.730
an attitude and for
the first time I think,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.810
he had an epiphany, I
think as a young mayor,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.980
a young man he was probably
not aware of just how

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.620
offensive Robert E. Lee's statue was,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.420
but to a lot of people, to
young people, black people,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.610
white people even it really bothered them.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.440
It bothered them a lot.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.900
And so it's going to take
like Mayor Landrieu, and other

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.670
people I believe at the local level,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.320
where people live, where
people work, where people play,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.143
where people pray, and
where they love each other;

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.400
the right to love who they want to love

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.770
is gonna take I think the mayor's

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.363
of this nation to make us really great.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:03.268
