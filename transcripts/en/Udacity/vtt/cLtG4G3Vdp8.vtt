00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.920
I mentioned before that it's still a good

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.320
idea to validate your data on the server,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.990
even with client side validation. Why do you

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.530
think this is? Is it because if javascript

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.120
is disabled, client side validation won't work? Or

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.760
because, older browsers might not recognize your new

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.290
input types? Or could it also be because,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.020
it's fairly easy to circumvent client side validation?
