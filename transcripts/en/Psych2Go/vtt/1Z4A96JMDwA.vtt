Hello, everyone, and happy Halloween! I'm Melissa, and welcome back to Psych2Go.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.660
First off, I really want to say "thank you" to everyone who watched my first video

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.300
and I'm glad you guys liked it and I hope you like this one just as much.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.400
The article I'm going to be talking about is "Rejected: how does parental rejection after coming out impact us."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.160
This article hits pretty close to home for me. Not because I've been rejected by my parents,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.320
but because I know people who have been rejected by their parents.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.740
*inhale* Now, rejection is a pretty hard thing to deal with, but it's specially difficult when it's coming from parents.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.520
It's sad to say that a lot of people who come out to their parents experience some form of rejection,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.180
whether it would be a form of physical violence, invalidation, or emotional, or financial support.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.320
But how exactly does this impact the mental health of those who are rejected?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.360
The writer of this article, Eva Woodward, worked with Jay Puckett and... Ethan Mereish - I believe,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.100
if that's incorrect, I'm really sorry - uh, she met the two of them through the LGBT Health Summer Institute,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.200
to answer this question: "How does parental rejection when coming out lead to psychological distress

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.320
for sexual minorities folks?" They survey two hundred and forty one (241) sexual minorities individuals

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.340
across the United States from 2010 to 2012. What they found is that a person who is rejected by their parents

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.460
is more likely to think negatively about themselves, and that that person is more likely to experience

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.140
depression, anxiety, and thoughts of suicide. Now, there could be some limitations to the research.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.580
They only surveyed two hundred and forty one people, which (while that is a decent number),

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.360
is fairly small is comparison to the entire GLBT community. Also, they asked people to look back at

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.920
on their experiences, and for some people, over several years, so it's hard to say that this is the exact path

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.700
parental rejection to mental health problems. Even so, it's very important that we learn from their results.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.680
So, what about you guys? Have you or anyone you know ever been rejected by your parents because of

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.140
your sexuality? And how did that have an impact on you?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.120
Finishing this video up, I would like to say that if you or anybody you know is having any kind of trouble,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.660
or is experiencing thoughts of suicide, to please call the national suicide prevention lifeline

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.080
