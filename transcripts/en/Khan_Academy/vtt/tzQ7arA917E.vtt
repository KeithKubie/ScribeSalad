00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.166
Voiceover:Let's explore the unit circle

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.433
a little bit more in depth.

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:07.242
Let's just start with some angle theta,

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:08.768
and for the sake of this video,

00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:11.000
we'll assume everything is in radians.

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:15.303
This angle right over here,

00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:17.633
we would call this theta.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:19.769
Now let's flip this, I guess we could say,

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.648
the terminal ray of this angle.

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:24.566
Let's flip it over the X and Y-axis.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.766
Let's just make sure we
have labeled our axes.

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.971
Let's flip it over the positive X-axis.

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:33.300
If you flip it over the positive X-axis,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.413
you just go straight down,

00:00:34.413 --> 00:00:36.186
and then you go the same
distance on the other side.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:38.438
You get to that point right over there,

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.000
and so you would get this ray.

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:45.001
You would get this ray that
I'm attempting to draw in blue.

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:47.501
You would get that ray right over there.

00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:49.100
Now what is the angle between this ray

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.933
and the positive X-axis if you
start at the positive X-axis?

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.084
Well, just using our conventions
that counterclockwise

00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:59.024
from the X-axis is a positive angle,

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:00.433
this is clockwise.

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:02.901
Instead of going theta above the X-axis,

00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:03.900
we're going theta below,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.033
so we would call this, by our convention,

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.733
an angle of negative theta.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:11.700
Now let's flip our original green ray.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.066
Let's flip it over the positive Y-axis.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.434
If you flip it over the positive Y-axis,

00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:21.435
we're going to go from there
all the way to right over there

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:26.600
then we can draw ourselves a ray.

00:01:27.702 --> 00:01:30.601
My best attempt at that
is right over there.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.436
What would be the measure of
this angle right over here?

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:38.800
What was the measure of
that angle in radians?

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.281
We know if we were to go all the way

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.433
from the positive X-axis
to the negative X-axis,

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:46.101
that would be pi radians

00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:48.667
because that's halfway around the circle.

00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:53.100
This angle, since we
know that that's theta,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.767
this is theta right over here,

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:56.367
the angle that we want to figure out,

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.300
this is going to be all the way around.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.100
It's going to be pi minus,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.402
it's going to be pi minus theta.

00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:06.767
Notice, pi minus theta plus theta,

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.566
these two are supplementary,

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:14.133
and they add up to pi
radians or 180 degrees.

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:18.000
Now let's flip this one
over the negative X-axis.

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:21.967
If we flip this one over
the negative X-axis,

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:23.567
you're going to get right over there,

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:26.600
and so you're going to get an
angle that looks like this,

00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:28.533
that looks like this.

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.700
Now what is going to be
the measure of this angle?

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.833
If we go all the way around like that,

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:37.233
what is the measure of that angle?

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.900
To go this far is pi,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.233
and then you're going another theta.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:43.700
This angle right over here is theta,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.104
so you're going pi plus another theta.

00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:47.967
This whole angle right over here,

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.703
this whole thing,

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:53.202
this whole thing is pi plus theta radians.

00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:55.033
Pi plus theta,

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:56.167
let me just write that down.

00:02:56.167 --> 00:02:59.267
This is pi plus theta.

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:02.459
Now that we've figured out

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:04.769
these have different
symmetries about them,

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.700
let's think about how
the sines and cosines

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.866
of these different angles
relate to each other.

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:12.833
We already know that this
coordinate right over here,

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:15.233
that is sine of theta,

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:18.374
sorry, the X-coordinate
is cosine of theta.

00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:20.100
The X-coordinate is cosine of theta,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.566
and the Y-coordinate is sine of theta.

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:23.968
Or another way of thinking about it

00:03:23.968 --> 00:03:27.100
is this value on the
X-axis is cosine of theta,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.566
and this value right
over here on the Y-axis

00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:31.050
is sine of theta.

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:33.740
Now let's think about
this one down over here.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.505
By the same convention, this point,

00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:38.368
this is really the unit circle definition

00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:40.166
of our trig functions.

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:42.903
This point, since our angle
is negative theta now,

00:03:42.903 --> 00:03:47.252
this point would be cosine
of negative theta, comma,

00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:52.267
sine of negative theta.

00:03:52.674 --> 00:03:54.982
And we can apply the same thing over here.

00:03:54.982 --> 00:03:56.766
This point right over here,

00:03:56.766 --> 00:04:02.833
the X-coordinate is
cosine of pi minus theta.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.366
That's what this angle is when we go

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:06.300
from the positive X-axis.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.233
This is cosine of pi minus theta.

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:16.633
And the Y-coordinate is
the sine of pi minus theta.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:19.800
Then we could go all the
way around to this point.

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:22.268
I think you see where this is going.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:26.233
This is cosine of, I guess
we could say theta plus pi

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.833
or pi plus theta.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:35.600
Let's write pi plus data
and sine of pi plus theta.

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:38.233
Now how do these all relate to each other?

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:41.900
Notice, over here, out here
on the right-hand side,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.233
our X-coordinates are
the exact same value.

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:47.169
It's this value right over here.

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.033
So we know that cosine
of theta must be equal

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:52.500
to the cosine of negative theta.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.700
That's pretty interesting.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.167
Let's write that down.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:05:00.767
Cosine of theta is equal to ...

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:02.367
let me do it in this blue color,

00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:05.300
is equal to the cosine of negative theta.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.200
That's a pretty interesting result.

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:09.367
But what about their sines?

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:11.833
Well, here, the sine of
theta is this distance

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.769
above the X-axis,

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:15.433
and here, the sine of negative theta

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:17.900
is the same distance below the X-axis,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.900
so they're going to be the
negatives of each other.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.100
We could say that sine of negative theta,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.900
sine of negative theta is equal to,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.433
is equal to the negative sine of theta,

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:37.500
equal to the negative sine of theta.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.433
It's the opposite.

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:41.900
If you go the same amount
above or below the X-axis,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.835
you're going to get the
negative value for the sine.

00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:47.100
We could do the same thing over here.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.767
How does this one relate to that?

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:52.900
These two are going to
have the same sine values.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.300
The sine of this, the Y-coordinate,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.433
is the same as the sine of that.

00:05:56.433 --> 00:05:59.768
We see that this must be equal to that.

00:05:59.768 --> 00:06:01.100
Let's write that down.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:14.067
We get sine of theta is equal
to sine of pi minus theta.

00:06:14.967 --> 00:06:16.917
Now let's think about how
do the cosines relate.

00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:18.119
The same argument, they're going to be

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:19.433
the opposites of each other,

00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:22.366
where the X-coordinates
are the same distance

00:06:22.366 --> 00:06:24.800
but on opposite sides of the origin.

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:29.900
We get cosine of theta is equal to

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.369
the negative of the cosine of ...

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:34.700
let me do that in same color.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.734
Actually, let me make
sure my colors are right.

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:41.166
We get cosine of theta is equal to

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:46.200
the negative of the
cosine of pi minus theta.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.933
Now finally, let's think
about how this one relates.

00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:54.967
Here, our cosine value, our
X-coordinate is the negative,

00:06:54.967 --> 00:06:58.366
and our sine value is also the negative.

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.533
We've flipped over both axes.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.966
Let's write that down.

00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:09.366
Over here, we have sine of theta plus pi,

00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:11.441
which is the same thing as pi plus theta,

00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:17.768
is equal to the negative
of the sine of theta,

00:07:17.768 --> 00:07:19.367
and we see that this is sine of theta,

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:21.643
this is sine of pi plus theta,

00:07:21.643 --> 00:07:23.438
or sine of theta plus pi,

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:29.100
and we get the cosine of theta plus pi.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.243
Cosine of theta plus pi is going to be

00:07:31.243 --> 00:07:33.766
the negative of cosine of theta,

00:07:33.766 --> 00:07:38.067
is equal to the negative
of cosine of theta.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.151
Even here, and you could see,

00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:39.900
you could keep going.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.900
You could try to relate
this one to that one

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.433
or that one to that one.

00:07:43.433 --> 00:07:45.701
You can get all sorts
of interesting results.

00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:48.101
I encourage you to really
try to think this through

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:51.034
on your own and think
about how all of these

00:07:51.034 --> 00:07:53.567
are related to each other
based on essentially

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:57.969
symmetries or reflections
around the X or Y-axis.
