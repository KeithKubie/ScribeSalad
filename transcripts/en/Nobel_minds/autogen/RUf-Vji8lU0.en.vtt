00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.990
audience and then we've been talking a
great deal about artificial intelligence

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000
great deal about artificial intelligence
 

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.150
great deal about artificial intelligence
this morning I want to introduce a

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160
this morning I want to introduce a
 

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.340
this morning I want to introduce a
slightly different but very closely

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:47.350
slightly different but very closely
 

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.840
slightly different but very closely
related concept called artificial

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:48.850

revelation this is a term being

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:50.890
revelation this is a term being
 

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.790
revelation this is a term being
introduced by the late Nate Rosenberg

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800
introduced by the late Nate Rosenberg
 

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.320
introduced by the late Nate Rosenberg
who passed away a few months ago and

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.330
who passed away a few months ago and
 

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.720
who passed away a few months ago and
what artificial revelation basically

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:57.730
what artificial revelation basically
 

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.670
what artificial revelation basically
tells you is that in order to understand

00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680
tells you is that in order to understand
 

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.540
tells you is that in order to understand
nature we are very limited if we rely on

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.550
nature we are very limited if we rely on
 

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.240
nature we are very limited if we rely on
our senses alone right so our vision and

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.250
our senses alone right so our vision and
 

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.920
our senses alone right so our vision and
our hearing and our computational

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:07.930
our hearing and our computational
 

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.020
our hearing and our computational
abilities are all limited by human

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.030
abilities are all limited by human
 

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.760
abilities are all limited by human
evolution and there's so much we can do

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:11.770
evolution and there's so much we can do
 

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.520
evolution and there's so much we can do
but what we can do is we can reveal

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:14.530
but what we can do is we can reveal
 

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.580
but what we can do is we can reveal
things to us artificially by creating

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:17.590
things to us artificially by creating
 

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.610
things to us artificially by creating
tools that allow us to see those things

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:20.620
tools that allow us to see those things
 

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.130
tools that allow us to see those things
that nature didn't mean us to see and so

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:23.140
that nature didn't mean us to see and so
 

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.550
that nature didn't mean us to see and so
we built telescopes we built microscopes

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560
we built telescopes we built microscopes
 

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.500
we built telescopes we built microscopes
to see things that we normally wouldn't

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:28.510
to see things that we normally wouldn't
 

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.380
to see things that we normally wouldn't
be able to see we create vacuum pumps

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:31.390
be able to see we create vacuum pumps
 

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.780
be able to see we create vacuum pumps
and now we have to cook

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:32.790
and now we have to cook
 

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.440
and now we have to cook
computers that allow us to do

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.450
computers that allow us to do
 

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.540
computers that allow us to do
computations that nature didn't mean us

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:36.550
computations that nature didn't mean us
 

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.100
computations that nature didn't mean us
to make because our brains are limited

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:38.110
to make because our brains are limited
 

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.800
to make because our brains are limited
but we can fool nature by doing things

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:40.810
but we can fool nature by doing things
 

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.590
but we can fool nature by doing things
that nature didn't want us to do the

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600
that nature didn't want us to do the
 

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.110
that nature didn't want us to do the
great bread sauce that we associate with

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120
great bread sauce that we associate with
 

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.390
great bread sauce that we associate with
the work of people like Galileo and

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:48.400
the work of people like Galileo and
 

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.150
the work of people like Galileo and
Newton in the 17th century we're in fact

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160
Newton in the 17th century we're in fact
 

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.150

ideologically driven worth by people who

00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:15.929
ideologically driven worth by people who
 

00:28:15.929 --> 00:28:17.450
ideologically driven worth by people who
actually have access to information but

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460
actually have access to information but
 

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.060
actually have access to information but
they read the wrong things or they read

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:20.070
they read the wrong things or they read
 

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.169
they read the wrong things or they read
the same things and give you different

00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179
the same things and give you different
 

00:28:21.179 --> 00:28:23.719
the same things and give you different
interpretations and so then you ask me

00:28:23.719 --> 00:28:23.729
interpretations and so then you ask me
 

00:28:23.729 --> 00:28:25.940
interpretations and so then you ask me
well do you think printing you know

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:25.950
well do you think printing you know
 

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.519
well do you think printing you know
printing press was in Unbounce a good

00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:28.529
printing press was in Unbounce a good
 

00:28:28.529 --> 00:28:30.589
printing press was in Unbounce a good
example I have a good count for example

00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:30.599
example I have a good count for example
 

00:28:30.599 --> 00:28:32.479
example I have a good count for example
there because we know do know that there

00:28:32.479 --> 00:28:32.489
there because we know do know that there
 

00:28:32.489 --> 00:28:34.759
there because we know do know that there
was in the Islamic world in which was

00:28:34.759 --> 00:28:34.769
was in the Islamic world in which was
 

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:35.960
was in the Islamic world in which was
mostly the Ottoman Empire at the time

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:35.970
mostly the Ottoman Empire at the time
 

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.880
mostly the Ottoman Empire at the time
actually there was a prohibition

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:37.890
actually there was a prohibition
 

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.640
actually there was a prohibition
printing presses and so between 1450

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:40.650
printing presses and so between 1450
 

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.080
printing presses and so between 1450
when the first printing press appear in

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.090
when the first printing press appear in
 

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.350
when the first printing press appear in
Europe and about 1720 it's the earliest

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360
Europe and about 1720 it's the earliest
 

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.420
Europe and about 1720 it's the earliest
we know books were printed in Europe in

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:47.430
we know books were printed in Europe in
 

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.880
we know books were printed in Europe in
every language in in in Roman letters in

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:49.890
every language in in in Roman letters in
 

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:51.500
every language in in in Roman letters in
Cyrillic letters in Hebrew letters in

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:51.510
Cyrillic letters in Hebrew letters in
 

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.450
Cyrillic letters in Hebrew letters in
Greek letters they were not printed in

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.460
Greek letters they were not printed in
 

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.280
Greek letters they were not printed in
Arabic or Turkish letters because that

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:55.290
Arabic or Turkish letters because that
 

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.330
Arabic or Turkish letters because that
was not allowed and so 300 years the

00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340
was not allowed and so 300 years the
 

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.390
was not allowed and so 300 years the
Islamic world lived without having

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.400
Islamic world lived without having
 

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.610
Islamic world lived without having
access to the printing press and so you

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620
access to the printing press and so you
 

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.180
access to the printing press and so you
ask yourself well do you think that has

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:08.190
ask yourself well do you think that has
 

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.840
ask yourself well do you think that has
any implications for our own time and

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:11.850
any implications for our own time and
 

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:12.620
any implications for our own time and
you know I'm not gonna answer that

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:12.630
you know I'm not gonna answer that
 

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.330
you know I'm not gonna answer that
question you all should think about this

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340
question you all should think about this
 

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.760
question you all should think about this
but clearly the alternative to not doing

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:16.770
but clearly the alternative to not doing
 

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.740
but clearly the alternative to not doing
it was worse than the alternative to

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:18.750
it was worse than the alternative to
 

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.960
it was worse than the alternative to
doing it but we also should keep in mind

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:20.970
doing it but we also should keep in mind
 

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.330
doing it but we also should keep in mind
that that was a very high price to be

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340
that that was a very high price to be
 

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.510
that that was a very high price to be
paid for this progress but you cannot

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520
paid for this progress but you cannot
 

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.340
paid for this progress but you cannot
blame the printing press for anything

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:30.350
blame the printing press for anything
 

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:36.140
blame the printing press for anything
people printing press basically played a

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:36.150
people printing press basically played a
 

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.300
people printing press basically played a
role that you know that the internet or

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:38.310
role that you know that the internet or
 

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.910
role that you know that the internet or
computer or play today it's a medium

it's what we make of it well and we want

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:44.280
it's what we make of it well and we want
 

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.530
it's what we make of it well and we want
to so you are saying you know it's if we

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:48.540
to so you are saying you know it's if we
 

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.620
to so you are saying you know it's if we
leave out ideas if we leave out meanings

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:51.630
leave out ideas if we leave out meanings
 

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.650
leave out ideas if we leave out meanings
that people attach to what is a life

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:54.660
that people attach to what is a life
 

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.990
that people attach to what is a life
that they aspire to you know and this is

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000
that they aspire to you know and this is
 

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.540
that they aspire to you know and this is
a question that I think we have to ask

00:29:59.540 --> 00:29:59.550
a question that I think we have to ask
 

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.180
a question that I think we have to ask
ourselves again and again because in

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:02.190
ourselves again and again because in
 

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:05.560
ourselves again and again because in
some way we are immersed in many

some way we are immersed in many
 

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:09.620
some way we are immersed in many
wonderful technological imaginaries not

wonderful technological imaginaries not
 

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.980
wonderful technological imaginaries not
just science fiction of an old kind but

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:12.990
just science fiction of an old kind but
 

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.530
just science fiction of an old kind but
something that seems so very close and

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:15.540
something that seems so very close and
 

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:19.160
something that seems so very close and
yet we very often don't have an idea

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:19.170
yet we very often don't have an idea
 

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.680
yet we very often don't have an idea
what is the kind of society we would

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:21.690
what is the kind of society we would
 

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.880
what is the kind of society we would
need to make it is fully realizable so

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:25.890
need to make it is fully realizable so
 

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.870
need to make it is fully realizable so
I'm saying there is a asymmetry between

I'm saying there is a asymmetry between
 

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.120

the technological imaginaries we have
and the imaginary is about a society

because again the media likes to focus

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:43.590
because again the media likes to focus
 

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.850
because again the media likes to focus
on disagreements and but the idea that

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860
on disagreements and but the idea that
 

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.390
on disagreements and but the idea that
we want democracy Liberty ideas of

the number of democracies on the fingers

I think the increase of communication

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:09.270
I think the increase of communication
 

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.760
I think the increase of communication
with the printing press brought about a

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.010
explosion of scientific knowledge which
is out there and we have tools to help

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:45.020
is out there and we have tools to help

us access it and interpret it and lots

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:48.410
us access it and interpret it and lots

us access it and interpret it and lots
of people are involved and there's a

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480
of people are involved and there's a
 

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.990
of people are involved and there's a
concept of wisdom of crowds where you

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000
concept of wisdom of crowds where you
 

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.490
concept of wisdom of crowds where you
know no one individual including

understand the information but you can
 

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.210
understand the information but you can
actually have a crowd be wiser than any

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:01.220
actually have a crowd be wiser than any
 

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.280
actually have a crowd be wiser than any
of its individuals and occasionally we

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:03.290
of its individuals and occasionally we
 

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.740
of its individuals and occasionally we
achieve that there's also the wisdom of

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:05.750
achieve that there's also the wisdom of
 

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:08.980

lynch mob which that's so good wisdom of
 

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:12.580
lynch mob which that's so good wisdom of
crowds but we do have an unprecedented

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:12.590
crowds but we do have an unprecedented
 

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.250

people are able to get involved and I

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:18.230
people are able to get involved and I
 

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:21.280
people are able to get involved and I
think that does lead to more

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:21.290
think that does lead to more
 

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.859
think that does lead to more

this value of free inquiry is something

this value of free inquiry is something
very very precious and I think it needs
