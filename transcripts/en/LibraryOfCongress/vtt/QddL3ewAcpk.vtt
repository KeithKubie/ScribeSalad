00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Good evening
and welcome to the main event.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.230
The last program of the
evening here in the ballroom.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.820
My name is Ron Elving.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.650
I am an editor correspondent
podcaster at NPR

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.810
and also a full-time, thank you,
and also a full-time faculty member

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.600
at American University
School of Public Affairs.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.320
And it is my very great
pleasure to be here this evening

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.940
with John Aloysius Farrell;
Jack Farrell to his friends,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.770
and he has written his third book.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.820
His first book was called "Clarence
Darrow, Attorney for the Damned."

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.080
Now I think you should buy
that book just for the title.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.060
His second book was called "Tip
O'Neal and the Democratic Century,"

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.960
and then he turned to
Richard Nixon, "The Life."

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.630
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: Because he's
such a popular character.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Because
of that trajectory,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.380
I have to ask what made
you turn to Dick Nixon?

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.880
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I was
drawn to his story.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.330
The original subtitle for the
book was "Mr. Richard Nixon,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.950
An American Tragedy," and I was
struck when I did the research

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.240
that people like Henry Kissinger
and Elliot Richardson would write

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.920
in their diaries or talk on
the phone with each other

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.200
and as Watergate was collapsing
around him, they would say,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.660
"This is really like
classic Greek tragedy."

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.950 position:56%
This is really a Shakespearean scene
of someone who has so many gifts,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.370
and yet this amazing tragic
flaw which ended up bringing him

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.740
down in quite a Shakespearean
manner.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.860
He was Iago to this own Othello.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.680
He was always whispering in his
own ear, "You're not good enough.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.460
They hate you.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.470
They're against me," and in
the end, it destroyed him,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.920
and he had that one final
moment of recognition.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.520 position:56%
Some of you may remember on the last
day that he was in the White House

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.400 position:56%
when he addressed his staff and
family in the East Room and he said,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.360
"Remember others may hate you

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.820
but if you hate them then you
destroy yourself," and so,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.930
there's this wonderful moment
of self-recognition when he sees

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.410
that that the tragic flaw has
brought him down in just the way

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.480
that he feared the most, and yet
in the end that's what got him.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: I'm
struck by your comparison

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.290
to Iago to his own Othello.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.670
I don't believe that
line is in the book.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.320
I think you had said it on another
occasion and I had looked for it

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.170
in the book and I don't
believe I found it.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.600
Is that something you have
thought of since writing the book

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.120
and what does it mean to you?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.420
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: No.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.160
Actually when you write a proposal
for a book, you sort of try to come

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.120 position:56%
up with analogies to what this story
is, and when I wrote the proposal

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.490
for Double Day, that
was in the proposal.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.970
I didn't use it in the book.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.900
I probably should have because
as I went back and prepared to go

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.170
out on the book tour, I
came across that line.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.390
I said, "Hey, this is a pretty
good line," and I've used it.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.640
But if you remember the play,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.380
Othello was this great general
and Iago his lieutenant.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.620
Very jealous of him and
starts whispering in his ear

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.780 position:56%
and Iago puts this paranoia in
Othello, and in the end Othello ends

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.360
up killing his beautiful
wife Desdemona

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.970
because Iago was so
good at doing that.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.050
So Nixon always had this
susceptibility of telling himself

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.150
over and over again,
"I'm not good enough,"

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.290
and one of the most heart
[inaudible] examples of this is

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.940
when he comes back from China,
and he's accomplished everything

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.710
that he wanted to do in his life.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.200
He's become president
against all these odds.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.980
Come from the backwoods
of California

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.090
to become president
of the United States.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.650
He wants to be a great man
and he sees this opportunity

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.650
in the Cold War to drive
a wedge between Red China

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.780
and the Soviet Union, and to bring
China into the family of nations.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.730
And long before he was president,
he wrote about this in an article

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.830
in the Foreign Affairs Magazine,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.890
talking about how this
new century was going

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.420
to be a century --
an information age.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.740
This is Richard Nixon in 1965.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.060
An information age
dominated by computers

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.980
and that the old Communist
monolithic societies would not be

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.010
able to compete with the
nimbleness of science that's going

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.900
to be needed in the 21st century.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.190
So he sees this happening
as he's president.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.810
He goes to China.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.380
He makes this amazing breakthrough,
and he comes back and he's talking

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.830
to Henry Kissinger on one of
these infamous White House tapes,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.290
and Iago starts to whisper.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.640
And he says, "You know Henry,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.260
the American people
are a bunch of sheep.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.630
They watched me on television with
all that handshaking and stuff

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.610
in China, and you and I know it
really doesn't mean a thing."

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.720
And this is Richard Nixon
not really being cynical

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.940
about the American people but
badmouthing himself because he had

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.970
such a sense of inferiority.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.220
So that's where I -- I should
have used it in the book.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.520
It is a good line.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: And then you
mentioned that foreign affairs piece

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.340 position:56%
from 1965 in which he seemed to have
an enormous amount of sophistication

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.000
about Asia, and in the book, you
point out that he had toured Asia

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.440
as vice-president as part of
his duties for Dwight Eisenhower

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.880
and that he had learned a great
deal and impressed a lot of people.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.920
He seemed to have really
taken that on as a study

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.590
through much of the
rest of his life.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.720
But one of the things about the
book that got attention as soon

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.060
as it came out was you broke
a bit of news that had to do

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.300
with the Asian land war that
everyone knew we shouldn't try

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.650
to fight but Richard Nixon found us
fighting when he became president

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.850
in Vietnam, of course, and the
news that you broke had to do

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.860
with a person named Anna Chennault.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.420
Famous to perhaps our generation
and the generation before us,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.140
but not so well known today who
was sent on a mission by the,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.140
if you will, Nixon White House

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.610
in waiting before he
was elected president;

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.300
when he was still a private citizen

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.840
but the nominee of
the Republican party.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.800
What was that all about?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.960
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: Well,
it's almost 50 years.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.450
It'll be 50 years next year.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.280
And Nixon was running in 1968.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.150
An amazing year of turbulence.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.090 position:56%
The year that Bob Kennedy and Martin
Luther King were assassinated,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.420
and you had Eugene McCarthy
challenging LBJ in New Hampshire.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.400
You had riots at the
Democratic convention.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.760
And in the midst of all this,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.160 position:56%
Richard Nixon builds a pretty
formidable lead by September of 1968

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.510
over his Democratic
opponent Hubert Humphrey

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.000
because Lindon Johnson the
sitting president has announced

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.960
that he's not going to run for
reelection because of Vietnam.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.910
And then all of a sudden, the
Democratic party starts --

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.450
the Democratic voters start
coming home in the fall of 1968.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.580
And the blue collar union
workers, they leave George Wallace

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.310
who was running as a
third party candidate

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.080
and they start going back
to the Democratic party.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.130
The Eugene McCarthy anti-war
folks start forgiving Humphrey

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.620
because he does a little bit

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.800
of a tiptoe towards a
split with LBJ on Vietnam.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.940
And all of a sudden what --
at the beginning of September,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.270
Richard Nixon had this young
guy who was a vote counter,

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.600
and his name was Allen Greenspan.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Good counter.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.200
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: Yes.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.500
And Allen Greenspan
sends in a memo and says,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.390
"We're going to win
410 electoral votes.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.980
Humphrey will be lucky
if he wins a single state

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.930 position:56%
because Wallace will take the rest."

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.840
But it has closed dramatically
by the middle of September,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.630
and then Lindon Johnson
calls Nixon in and says,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.210
"We're seeing some
progress on Vietnam.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.170
I may institute a bombing halt."

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.540
Now Richard Nixon thought that
he had lost the 1960 election

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.740
because the Kennedy's stole it
from him, and he had seen Johnson

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:23.700 position:56%
in 1966 do an October surprise in
the off-year congressional elections

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.470
by announcing that he was
closer to peace in Vietnam.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.620
So Nixon's paranoia kicks in,
and he sees these forces lined

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.320
up against him ready to steal
something from him once again,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.410
and he uses this connection,
a woman named Anna Chennault

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.570
who was very well-known
in the palaces of Asia

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.790
because her husband Claire
Chennault had led the Flying Tigers

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:53.850
into battle against the Japanese
in World War Two, and he sends her

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.630
to the South Vietnamese to tell
them that if they can just hold

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.460
on a little bit longer,
Nixon will be elected

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.490
and you'll get a better deal.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.240
And so, rather than go to Paris
and join in the peace talks,

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.850
which Nixon thinks is a charade,
the South Vietnamese resist.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.390
They don't join in the peace talks.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.860
Now this was pretty much a known
story because at some point

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.670
that fall, Lyndon Johnson got
wind of it, and he sent the FBI

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.110
out to tail and to tap the --

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: The tapes.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.710
They always come back.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.950
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: -- to tail
and to tap the Republican,

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.720
Claire Chennault, the
Republican envoy;

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:40.990
Anna Chennault the Republican envoy
and the South Vietnamese Embassy

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.920
and the presidential
palace in Saigon.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.160
So Johnson is getting
all this information

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.960
and he sees what's happening.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.480
He gets on the phone call
with Republican Senators

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.960
like Everett Dirkson, and he sees,
"I'm reading their hand Everett,"

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.030
and this is darn near treason.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.600
So he confronts Nixon
and Nixon denies it,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.480
but it has actually happened and
the great tragedy of this story is

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.360 position:56%
that there really was a peace feeler

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.440
from the Soviet Union
to Johnson that summer.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.380
And the Soviets said, "If you'll
do a bombing halt, we can promise

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.300 position:56%
that there will be productive talks.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.200
We'll get the North
Vietnamese to the table."

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.740
So what Nixon saw as a dirty trick,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.110
Johnson actually believed was a
chance to end the war earlier,

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.380
but Nixon intercedes and the
South Vietnamese pull back

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.480
and the peace talks don't happen,
and Nixon is elected in one

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.990
of the closest elections
in American history.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Forty-three
percent of the vote I believe.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.050
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: With
only 43% of the vote.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.030
So elements of this story
come out over the years,

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.870
but Nixon always denied
it and if you go back

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.410
and watch the famous
Frost/Nixon interviews,

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:57.020 position:56%
David Frost asks him specifically,
"Did you send Anna Chennault to talk

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.600
to the South Vietnamese,"
and Nixon says, "No.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.850
I would never do something
like that."

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.380
So the last big piece of
the puzzle and the piece

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.950
that confronted Lyndon Johnson

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.070
in 1968 was whether Richard
Nixon had been directly involved,

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.910
and as I'm going through
this vast amount

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.570
of material that's been
released in the last 20 years

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:24.050
at the Nixon Library in Yorba
Linda, there are handwritten notes

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.390
by Nixon's chief of staff.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.740
A man named H. R. Bob
Holman, and he's writing

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.520
down what Nixon is telling
him and Nixon is saying,

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.880
"Keep Anna Chennault working
on the South Vietnamese.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.880
Anyway we can monkey wrench
Johnson's initiative."

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.520
And monkey wrench of course
meant throw a monkey wrench

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.990
into the gears and stop it.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.540
So that was my little
contribution to history.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.910
History sometimes is like
a rainy day like today,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.210
you're down at the beach and
you pull out a jigsaw puzzle

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.660
because there's nothing else to do

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.260
and you start putting the
puzzle pieces together.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.530
And then the sun comes
out and you go away

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.700
but your brother-in-law
comes up behind you

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.770
and he starts putting a few
pieces of the puzzle together

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.080
and eventually the
puzzle gets assembled.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.480
So that was my little
piece of the puzzle.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.130 position:56%
I was glad to contribute to history.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: And a
crucial piece it is.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.180
One of the things that
strikes me about your book,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.190
and I think has struck others
as well and reviewers as well,

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:25.110
has been the extraordinary way that
you manage to remain dispassionate

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.650 position:56%
and yet have a sort of edge on the
seat involvement in what's going on.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.250
Now you did not live all
of this history but --

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.210
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: Sadly
I lived some of it.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Many of
us have lived much of it.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.560
And I think, for a large
generation, I read the book feeling

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.130
as though I was reliving my life.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.370
Did you feel that way at all when
you were going back through this?

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.730
Did you feel personally
involved in these events?

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.770
The larger events if
not the specific events

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.070
of Richard Nixon's life?

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.370
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I was
a little born torn.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.190
I was in college during Watergate.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:04.740
So I wasn't in college at the time
of the great Vietnam protests,

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.160
and yet, Nixon was a bad guy
for people of my generation.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.970
So when I started to go into
his life, I approached it

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.900
as a biographer which is
telling myself, "All right.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.200
You have to be objective.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.500
You have to be fair.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.850
You have to look at this guy
dispassionately and see it

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.480
from his point of view,"
and what I found as I looked

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.840
into Nixon's life was
that my sympathy,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.290
my empathy for him grew even
as I was finding out things

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.410
about Watergate or
this about Vietnam,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.300
which I thought was a
horribly, horribly cynical act.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.330
I was looking at where he
came from and what he had

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.660
to do to get to where he was.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.810
He was born in the
California outback as I said,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.880
and his father was a blowhard.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.180
Somewhat abusive.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.180 position:56%
He managed to be someone who could
fail to grow lemons in Orange County

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.980
which is one of the most bountiful
citrus belts in the world,

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.270
and he took it out on his sons.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.700
And he had five sons and two of
them died in Nixon's childhood.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.170
His baby brother Arthur died in
like a week shocking the family

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.800
of meningitis, and then
his older brother Harold

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:26.600 position:56%
who was the golden boy of the family
contracted tuberculosis and died

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:32.150
over a period of six years that
wasted the family's finances.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.210
So by this point, they had sold
the lemon farm and they had moved

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.380 position:56%
to a crossroads outside of Whittier,

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.260
and his father bought an
abandoned church and had it toted

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.640
down the road and put on this
corner, and opened a grocery store

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.240
and began to sell groceries
out of this abandoned church.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:54.450 position:56%
And Dick's job was to drive into
Los Angeles to the markets at 3 a.m.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.630
and get the produce and bring it
back to the store and polish it

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.040
and prepare it and
then go off to school.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.410
And he did this while
trying to maintain a lot

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.290
of extracurricular activities;
drama, football, debate,

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.720
and it was very successful,
very bright individual.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:15.900
But all the time knowing that
the good kids inside Whittier,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.850
the kids in the garden side of
this town looked down on him

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.880
because of his family situation.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.100
So he was always had
this resentment,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.600
but at the same time this
amazing drive and resilience.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.330
If there's anything to admire about
Dick Nixon it's the resilience.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.730
The ability to pick himself up and
even in the last years of his life

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.080
after Watergate to mount
a semi successful comeback

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.360
at least public relations wise
until he appears on the cover

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.860
of Newsweek Magazine
with a big headline,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.350
"He's back," and Nixon [inaudible].

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: And Nixon won as
you said in 1968, 43% or not,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.960
he won the electoral college
because it was a three-way vote

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.170
with George Wallace
and Hubert Humphrey.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.710
So then he is president and he
does continue the Vietnam War

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.110
but we get changes in
the way draft works,

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:12.430
and we start to [inaudible] the war
more aggressively and people kind

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.730
of step back a little back.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.890
College campuses get
a little bit cooler.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.170
Not so much after the
Cambodian invasion in 1970

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.470 position:56%
but you know what I'm talking about.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.280
In general he deescalated and moved
us towards an American withdrawal

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.280
which eventually would happen, but
he also did a lot of other things.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.020
Especially in that first term
which stand to surprise people

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.570
who don't remember those years.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.880 position:56%
I'm going to refer to a few of them.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.770
He expanded Social
Security benefits.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.290
The EPA Act that he
signed, OSHA, the Safety

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.740
and Occupational Health
Administration.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.930
Title 9 for women athletes.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.260
He had a healthcare proposal
you write about in the book

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.550
that was amazingly like what
we now think of as Obamacare.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.180
&gt;&gt; John Ferrell: Very close
to what we see as Obamacare.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.860
His administration pioneered
the idea that we should --

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.440
rather than go to a single payer
system, rather than Medicare

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.690
for all, rather than a Canadian
or a European type system,

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.980
that we should just tell the
insurance companies that --

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.330
tell the American companies that
everybody's got to have insurance.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.750
We're going to keep the
private insurance framework

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:25.270
and very slight differences
between that principle and Obama's

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.470
in that Nixon's principle
was to have every --

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:33.470
make it a mandate for every
employer to provide insurance;

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:39.550
whereas Obama's mandate was that
all of us have to buy insurance

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.900
if our employers isn't doing it.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.620
And Ted Kennedy told
me before he died,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.010
he said this was my biggest
legislative error was not taking

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.130
this deal from Nixon.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.260 position:56%
Especially Nixon offered it twice in
each of his two terms and especially

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.010
in 1973 when he was desperate for
domestic support and offered it,

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.370
but the Democrats looked at him
and said, "You know, he's so weak.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.670
We're going to get him out.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.140
A new president will come in,

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.580
and with the new president
we'll get Medicare for all.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.610
We'll get single payor,"
and it turned

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.520
out to be Jimmy Carter a
conservative from Georgia,

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.190 position:56%
and the economy inflation was raging

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.670
and Carter had promised a
balanced budget; and so,

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.150
instead of getting
national healthcare,

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.450
you had a huge fight break

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.820
out between Ted Kennedy
and Jimmy Carter.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.940
He challenges Jimmy Carter
in the primaries in 1980,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.630
and Ronald Reagan is elected,

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.360
and Harold's in this
new conservative era.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.800
So Ted Kennedy knew he had
missed his chance in 1973

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.050
by not taking Richard
Nixon's proposal.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: When
he had an opportunity.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.050
But there were all these other
things that Nixon managed

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.650
to accomplish that
would by today's lights,

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.120
certainly in the post-Reagan
era or in our current era,

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.400
would count as liberal programs.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.020
Expansions of government
power, provision of new rights,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.650
provision of new programs
and benefits for people.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:05.760
Did he get any kind of satisfaction
from that part of his legacy?

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.480
Did he have any joy in it?

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.780
&gt;&gt; John Ferrell: Two things.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.350
One is that he had been part
of the World War 2 generation,

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:16.550
and the World War 2 generation
had seen a great crisis;

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.860
two great crises.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.560
The Depression and then World War 2

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.490
and had seen how muscular
government could fix problems.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.900
So it was not like in
the post-Reagan era

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.990
where Bill Clinton says the
era of big government is over,

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.280
or Reagan said, "Government
is not the solution.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.640
Government is the problem."

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.440
To Nixon and to Dwight Eisenhower,
in particular who Nixon served

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.570
as vice-president, there
was nothing to be ashamed of

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.060
or afraid about government.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.820
If we need it for national
defense to build highways

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.590
across the country connecting every
state capital, we would just do it.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.530
That was the way that
Dwight Eisenhower thought

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:01.320
because when he had to
invade Normandy and bring

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.740
down Adolph Hitler it was
do we need 5000 ships?

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.120
Well, let's get 10,000 ships.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.800
This was their thinking.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:19.910 position:56%
So there was really no feeling that
government was this great evil force

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.250
in our lives in those days;

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:25.110
the World War 2 generation
felt differently.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:29.510
Nixon himself had certain things in
the domestic side that he realized

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.250 position:56%
that he needed to do for the public.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.530
The environment is a prime example.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.510
He's elected and three days later
we have the biggest oil spill

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.700
in our history up to that time
in Santa Barbara, California,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.390
and Nixon flies out
there and this is just

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.090
as the environmental
movement is kicking off

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.580
and Nixon has two choices.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.970
He can either go along
with it or he can resist it

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.200
and he sees it's vastly popular.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.270
He has sort of a gut feeling that
California is a beautiful place

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:04.170
and we should keep it that way;
and so, you get this amazing tide

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.140
of environmental measures.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.770
And it's in the book that at one
point the major environmental

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.720
organizations were polled
and they were asked,

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.940
"Who was the best green president,"
and Teddy Roosevelt came in first

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.700
and Richard Millhouse
Nixon came in second.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.530
So it's really a formidable record.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.390
But then there's other
things that happened too.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.780
He was -- I once said that the
subtitle to the book should be

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.900
and yet, because as you
read the book you'll see

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.450
that Nixon was the one who brought
about the deliberate polarization

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.780
of America on racial matters.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:44.020 position:56%
The so-called southern strategy, and
yet, in the Nixon Administration,

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.770
there was more desegregation
of southern schools

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.460
than in the Johnson
Administration, Eisenhower,

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.350
and Kennedy Administration.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.950
His administration very quietly,
prodded by the Supreme Court,

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:01.110
but very quietly, desegregated
the southern schools to the point

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.880
that polls of southern black voters

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:11.380
in the 1970s gave Nixon
a 53 to 47 polarity.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.490
It was really appreciated but Nixon
didn't want the rest of the country

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.720
to know about it because
he had been so successful

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.570
with the southern strategy.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.300
So at the same time that
he's quietly doing that,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.830
he's appointing people
like Clement Haynsworth

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.570
and Howard Carlswell
to the Supreme Court.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.230
Guys that were really
borderline if not outright racist,

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.530
and then when they were defeated

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.090 position:56%
by Congress making these impassioned
stands that he was the only one

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.640
who understood the south.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.480
So while he was doing the
right thing quietly not wanting

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:49.130
to let the south know
that he was doing it,

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.790
he would take these
outrageous steps to make it look

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.420
like he was against bussing.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.010
He knew that there was
this feeling of resentment

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.280
that people had in the late 1960s.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.810 position:56%
That white middle voters, the people

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:10.380
that he called his great silent
majority and that he could tap it

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.220
by telling them that, "Well,
these minorities want it easy.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.490
They want to leap ahead
of you in line.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:21.150
They don't want to do the hard
work that you did," and he played

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:25.600
that very successfully and
really introduced that strain

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.100
into American political life
and it's still with us today.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: You know, the morbid
fascination that Richard Nixon had

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.990
with the media and that to some
degree comes to fruition with some

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.320
of the things that he did in
the Watergate larger conspiracy.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.300 position:56%
You don't really start writing about
Watergate or focusing on Watergate

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:51.180
or using that term until the book
is into the page numbers of 400s,

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.420
and maybe some people would
be disappointed in that.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.870
But in another sense,

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.960 position:56%
you're actually explaining Watergate
almost from the very beginning.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.460
You're talking about what it was
in Richard Nixon that led him

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.310
to his relationship with the media
and then ultimately to Watergate.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.710
Talk a little bit about
his early relationships

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.140
with the media in Orange County.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.440
Some of the little
newspapers and then

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.040
of course the Los Angeles
Times of the 1940s and 50s.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.340
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: Yes.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.280
There's a great irony that both
Donald Trump and Richard Nixon are

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:25.580
so anti-press because both of them
were really creations of the press.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.000
In Nixon's case, in
Southern California,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.410
the Los Angeles Times was like
the great elephant in the room.

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.710
A really hard-lined
conservative newspaper,

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.340
and from the beginning
took an interest

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.280
in young Dick Nixon's career
and promoted him especially

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.060
in the 1950 senate race when he ran

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:50.110
against a congresswoman
named Helen Gahagan Douglas.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: The pink lady.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.710
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: The pink lady.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Although
he did not name her that.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.310
He did not call her that.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.610
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: No.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:57.910
She was actually first of the line

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.930
by her democratic opponents
in the primaries.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.300
And that's the kind of stuff
that I was talking about.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.650
When you think about Nixon
going in as a writer,

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.640
you think about the 1950 race and
you say, "Ah, horrible demagoguery.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.240
He was the one who
called her the pink lady."

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.390
Well, it was horrible demagoguery.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.350
By the last days of the election,
he was literally accusing her

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:23.710
of being treasonous and embracing
Red China which had just come

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.500
across the border and
joined the Korean War.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Because the
Korean War had started during

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.480
that campaign.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.780
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: It started
during that campaign.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.080
But, where were we?

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.360
Where was I?

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Well, we were talking

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.600
about his relationship
with the LA Times.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.900
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: Oh, yes.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.200
The Los Angeles Times.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.500
And same thing with Donald Trump.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.800
I mean I grew up on Long Island.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.410 position:56%
I spent a lot of time as a political
reporter reading the Daily News,

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.670
reading the New York Post
and seeing Donald Trump grow

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:54.070
by manipulating the tabloid
atmosphere in New York City,

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:59.450
and then, of course, during the
campaign he was such a feature

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.870
on the evening cable news that it
is a great irony that both Nixon

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.940
and Trump both identify
the press as the enemy

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.240
or the enemy of the people.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Now that's parallel

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.050
that I had hoped you
might be able to make.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.620
It carries on when they get
to Washington, doesn't it?

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.650
Because when Richard Nixon came
east first as a congressman,

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.320
then a senator and vice-president,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.220
he discovered a very
different attitude

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.040
in the media towards his career.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.340
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: Yes, definitely.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.880
But he took down a
series of liberal icons.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.870
It is unavoidable that
strong elements

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.870
of the eastern press were liberal.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:39.260
In Nixon's case in the 1950s,

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.260
many of them were liberal
Republican but still liberal.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:51.460
When he went after Earl Warren and
he took down Alger Hiss, the spy

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.140 position:56%
and Harry Truman's state department.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Jerry Voorhis.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.860
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: He defeated Jerry
Voorhis and his first campaign,

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.310
and Helen Gahagan Douglas.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.800
He was putting skins up on the
wall that really marked him

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:08.210
as a young conservative aggressive
comer when he got to Washington

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.700
and the press indeed did several --

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.810
some elements of the press
did really a job on him.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.650
Drew Pearson.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:21.510
The great [inaudible]
picked him as a target.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:27.990
Herblock the cartoonist for the
Washington Post in particular,

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.160 position:56%
would do these cartoons to the point

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.130 position:56%
that Nixon couldn't stand his
daughters to read the morning paper,

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.450
and so, he cancelled his
morning Washington Post

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:36.750
and got it at the office.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:42.810
So, there was an element definitely
that took that native paranoia

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:48.380
within his spirit and
accentuated it in Washington.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.670
But it was there from the beginning
because that first campaign,

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.520
another little piece of the
jigsaw puzzle that I found was

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.690
that Nixon loved to make lists.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:01.650 position:56%
He would sit in an armchair, put
his feet up with a yellow legal pad,

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.610 position:56%
all the way even through his
presidency, and just write out lists

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.130
and thoughts on yellow legal pads.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:11.210
And one of these I found, one of
the first ones when he came back

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.580
from the war, and he was running
for Congress, a complete unknown,

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.120
and there one of the
things to do is like, okay,

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.630
go to the rotary meetings, stop by
the local newspaper and buy an ad,

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.990
set up a voter organization in
such and such a neighborhood.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:29.970
Put spies in the Voorhis camp.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.250
This is [inaudible].

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.820
There was something there from the
very beginning that eventually grew

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.710
and flourished and erupted
in Watergate, but all along,

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:48.650 position:56%
he definitely had opposition from
the liberal press that egged him on.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: And he always
believed, perhaps because of

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.550
that early experience that he
had with individual publishers,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:59.800 position:56%
editorialists, reporters, that every
newspaper decided whether they were

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.090
with you or against
you and that was it.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.910
Not just on the editorial page.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.510
Not just in terms of endorsement,

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.610
but in terms of how they
covered you in the news.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.780
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: And then he had
some horrible misfortune in 1960.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:18.380 position:56%
He runs against the most charismatic
candidate of the time, Jack Kennedy,

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.220
who loved the press, who was
a reporter, who could relate

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:26.230
with the press, and there is
absolutely no doubt in history

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:31.890 position:56%
that the 1960 press core, the actual
reporters were sided with Kennedy.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:36.930
Nixon got more editorial
endorsements and Nixon was,

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.090
who had used television
so masterfully

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.350
in the famous Checker's
speech was betrayed

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.510
by his performance in the debates.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:48.120
So there were balancing
factors in the media

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.070
but definitely the campaign
reporters that he dealt

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:56.370
with every day were very much pro
Kennedy and there's really no doubt

00:29:56.370 --> 00:30:00.590
in history that this reinforced
his idea that reporters were

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.080
at least ideologically on the tape.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: And I want to
give you all an opportunity

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:09.400
to ask questions so I'll just ask
you one more as people come forward

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.570
and you can line up here at
the microphone so we have one

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.440
on either side if you'd
like to ask question.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:20.020
But let me just ask you, the
name of Donald Trump has come up,

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.080
and it's difficult to not draw
parallels between these characters.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.980
Other people have done some between
the character of Richard Nixon

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.280
and the character of Donald Trump.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.760 position:56%
The media element is an obvious one.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.840
What else do you draw as a
biography and as a reporter,

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.780
what else do you draw as
lessons from this period

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.840
when we come to our own era?

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.280
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I don't
think there's a lot

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.980
of comparison between the two men.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.590
Nixon was definitely a
foreign policy intellectual.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.220
He read and wrote books.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:58.220
Because he had served as
Eisenhower's vice-president,

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.960 position:56%
he had a great dignity and respect
for the office that didn't blind him

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.140
to commit the sins of Watergate,

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:11.730
but still he would
never treat it vulgarly.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.550
So in that regard, there's
really not a lot of comparison

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.820
between the -- I don't see a lot
of comparison between the two men.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.680
They both campaigned and perhaps
Trump took this from Nixon,

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.290
with sort of this politics
of grievance and resentment.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.750
And in fact, at times, Trump,
when he was campaigning,

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.320
he even used the phrases
that Nixon used.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.620
You know, "It's going to be a law

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.350
and order administration,"
and things like that.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:43.240
And the sins that Nixon was charged
with or that had been alleged

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.050
about our President
Trump are very similar.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:53.440 position:56%
The Saturday night massacre in which
Nixon fired the special prosecutor

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.400
is compared very closely
to Nixon firing the --

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.130
Trump firing the FBI director
who was leading the investigation

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:03.130
into Nixon, and there's
all this talk

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:06.640
that perhaps Trump will fire
today's special prosecutor.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.840
So it's more of a superficial
resemblance I think

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.980
than an actual one.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Thank you.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.580
And we will take your
questions, sir.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.300
This gentleman on the left.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.720
This concerns the five
Watergate burglars.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.800
I had the pleasure this week

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.980
of attending a continuing legal
education program presented

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:32.470
by John Dean, and he
said very definitively

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.440
without any hesitation whatsoever,

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:43.670
that if the five burglars had
not been apprehended breaking

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.340
into the democratic
headquarters at the Watergate,

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:54.480
they had another place to go that
very evening, and that other place

00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:01.150
to go was McGovern
headquarters because people

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:05.780
in the White House had expressed an
interest in knowing what was going

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:11.980
on there, and the point that
he made is that while the break

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:16.860
in at the DMC did not emanate
from the White House per se,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.030
the cover up did but
not the DNC break in.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.720
The subsequent break in that
never got a chance to happen

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.000
at McGovern headquarters did
emanate from certain individuals

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.260
in the White House and
therefore ironically

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:38.570
if the five guys had managed to
make it to destination number two,

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:43.110
then the Watergate house of cards
might have come down sooner.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:47.410
I'd very much appreciate
your addressing that.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:52.500
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: There are no
questions anymore about Watergate.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:57.050
The tapes show Nixon talking
to Bob Holden saying, "Bob,

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.420
we need more wiretapping.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:02.920
You need to go out now and follow
the Democratic candidates."

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.010
And in this vast flood of paper
that's been released in the last 30

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:11.090
or 40 years, you have evidence

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.120
that it wasn't just
McGovern headquarters.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.900
That they also -- Muskie
was the frontrunner.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.950
They had opened up an office next
to Muskie headquarters to serve

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:23.470
as a listening post
and had gotten --

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:26.790
by putting spies in the Muskie
camp had gotten floor plans

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:30.310 position:56%
of Muskie showing where the
different desks and telephones were.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:35.220
So this was almost everyone of
Nixon's aides at the White House

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:38.560
with the exception of Henry
Kissinger had some sort

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.280
of involvement in one
of these dirty tricks.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.520
It was a massive campaign.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:49.440
And indeed, as you say, it's a
signal of what clowns Gordon Liddy

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.710
and Howard Hunt were that they
thought that they could break

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:58.370
into the Democratic National
Committee at 11:00 p.m.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:02.960
and burglar it and install
bugs and take photographs

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.600
and then still be fresh
enough and energetic enough

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.790
that at 3:00 a.m. they would
drive up to Capitol Hillis

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:12.280
to McGovern headquarters which they
had tried unsuccessfully to break

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.390
into three times already and break
successfully do it the same night.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.720 position:56%
And they were doing it because Liddy
and Hunt had loaned all this money

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:24.530
that they had been given and their
bosses called them in and Mitchell

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.440
and others were saying,
"Where's the fruits

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.000
of what we're spending money
on," and so they panicked,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.970
and they did incredibly
stupid things throughout

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.270
that whole episode.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:36.780
But Dean is right in that regard.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.150
&gt;&gt; He also said that
the motive for breaking

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.640
into the McGovern headquarters
was to see

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.890
if the McGovern people had come
across some of the information

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:49.180
about the Elsburg psychiatric
break in, and they wanted to know

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:53.860
if they were going to get hit with
[inaudible] material from them.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.940
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I wouldn't
argue with him about that.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.560
I know that part of
the motive for the --

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.600
I think there were many
motives for what they wanted.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.780
They basically wanted
anything and everything.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.520
You can't just say, well
Watergate just happened because so

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.900
and so wanted this
particular piece of paper.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.880
There were lots of things
that they were looking for.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Thank you, and
thank you for your question.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.080
Let's take one from over here.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.180
&gt;&gt; So I guess some of
the strangest moments

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:20.350 position:56%
from a really strange presidency was
in, I think, 1970 after the bombing

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:24.160
of Cambodia and he has this weird
press conference, and he's staying

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.840
up all night calling like 50
different people and he decides

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.380
to go to the Lincoln
Memorial and talk face-to-face

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.300
with a bunch of student protestors.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.210
And I think it was in the
Oliver Stone film too.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.510
They kind of showed that as well.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.890
I was wondering, what
did you take from that?

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:42.530
What do you think Richard Nixon
was looking for in that encounter?

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:43.830
Why do you think he
went [inaudible]?

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.870
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I think the
key to that encounter happens

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:50.040 position:56%
after he leaves the Lincoln Memorial
and he goes up to the capital.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.570
And he's up at the capital and
he tries to get into the senate.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.160
He can't, it's locked, but he
goes to the house representatives

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.660
and he's brought his valet because
the whole purpose of this jaunt is

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.960
to show Manila the glories
of Washington at night.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:10.480
And so, he has him get up --
Nixon sits in the chairs below

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.950
and he has Manila get up on
the dias and give a speech.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:18.960
And as they're walking out and
leaving, there's a cleaning lady,

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.490
and she comes over and
she's carrying her bible.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:27.000
And she says, "Hi, Mr. President."

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.270
I can't remember whether she
asked him to sign the bible

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.790
or he just notices it and he says,

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.220
"Read your bible and
you'll be a saint.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:42.260
My mother was a saint," and Nixon's
mother throughout his life was sort

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.660
of his conscience, and she
had died only, I think,

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.260
two years before he
finally won the presidency.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.560
And throughout that night,
there's references in his ramblings

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:59.460
about his mom and you can make
sort of the psychological argument

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:04.300
that he was very concerned about
the fact that she would not approve

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.720
of him expanding the war in the
way that he did into Cambodia.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:14.610
That the death of the four students
at Kent State would be something

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.380
that she would really object to

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:23.010
and that he was expressing not only
tension but also some small bit

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.800
of guilt and shame about his mom.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.600
That's at least the way
that I've always interpreted

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.540
that remark; my mother was a saint.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.300
You be a saint too.

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Let's see if we can
get to a couple more over here.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Perhaps it would have been better

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.650
if Richard Nixon had
never become president.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:42.460
But given that he did,
I've always believed

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.340
that it would have been better for
Nixon, for the Republican party

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:51.230
and for the country, if he had
won in 1960 rather than 1968.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.140
Is that a sentiment
that you share or not?

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.050
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: Nixon was amazing
in that all three times he ran

00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:01.290
for president, he ran as the more
moderate candidate in the race.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.650
He was more moderate than JFK.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:06.820
He was more moderate than George
Wallace and later Hubert Humphrey

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:12.310
and he certainly was more moderate
than George McGovern in 1972.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:16.430
So he always represented
sort of the stayed center.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:20.420
And if he had gotten
elected in 1960,

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.170
I don't know how he
would have handled Cuba.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:27.350
It's awful to play those
hands out in retrospect.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:30.640
I know that he would have
supported the Bay of Pigs invasion.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.500
He always claimed that he
never would have let it go

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.820
on in a half assessed
way the way Kennedy did.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.190
It would have been a full
scale invasion the way

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.600
that Ike invaded Normandy.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.020
So you still might have
had the missiles of October

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.660
but they might have been
the missiles of April 1961.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.170
Instead if this provoked a
super power confrontation.

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:58.080
But he definitely was
a calmer man in 1960.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.380
Not a great candidate.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.770
Lost that race for a reason.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:05.000
Became really close
and actually believed

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.880
that he had actually won it.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Thank you.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.480
Sir?

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.780
&gt;&gt; So you had said that one

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.840
of Nixon's most admirable
traits was his resilience.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.090
So there were two great
comebacks in his career.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.880
One was after losing the
presidency in 1960 and then

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.830
after Watergate of course.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.610
How did he go about
engineering these comebacks

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.610
and why did the American
people largely accept them?

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:30.950
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: The first comeback

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:34.430
which Pat Buchanan has written a
book called "The Greatest Comeback"

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:35.730
and I would say that that's true.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.190
Maybe the greatest comeback
in political history.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:43.890
To come back from 1960 to 68.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:50.600
In 1968, you can't believe the
chaos that Americans had been in,

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.020
and what they wanted was just some
sort of semblance of normalcy.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:59.230
And you find that all, even the
most passionate liberal detractors

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:05.790
of Richard Nixon, Norman Mailer,
Hunter Thompson, were writing,

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.000
Walter [inaudible], were writing
on his behalf in the '68 campaign

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.850
and saying here is a seasoned
steady hand that may be able

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.760
to get us out of Vietnam.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:23.060
So I think that his ability to
present himself as a moderate,

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:28.600
as an experienced man
was what worked in 1960.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.640
I think the second comeback
is not terribly important.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:38.070
I don't think it will make
much difference in history,

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:41.210
but he really did show some
of himself, for example,

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.840
in the Frost/Nixon debates.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.480
If you've seen the movie or
the play, there's a moment

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.020
where David Frost very dramatically
takes his clipboard and throws it

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:55.070
on the floor and says,
"You have to lay more

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.940
of yourself bare here otherwise
you'll never forgive yourself.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.830
This is your opportunity,"
and he has

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.370
that great moment where
he says, "Yeah.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:05.140
I gave them the sword and they
stuck it in and twisted it,

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.600
and I would have done
the same thing myself."

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.580
So, he was never a man
to be underestimated.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.060
He had great raw political
skills, and like I said,

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.190
that tremendous resilience.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Thank
you for your question.

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:21.850
Sir, we just had time
for a few more.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:23.710
&gt;&gt; Couple of questions.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.390
The day Richard Nixon
died on April 22nd, '94,

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:31.060 position:56%
when did you hear the news about it?

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.360
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I don't know.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.660
I can't remember.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.070
Do you remember where you were?

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.210
&gt;&gt; I think -- I was
that home evening.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.150
[Inaudible].

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:40.450
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I was surprised.

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:42.700
I thought he might live on longer.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.150
That's a really a Brian
[inaudible] question.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:49.570
&gt;&gt; Yes. I was wondering did
you read any of his nine books?

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:55.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I read very closely
his memoir, and I think it's one

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.190
of the best presidential memoirs.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.490
It's called "RN."

00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:59.790
It's very big and thick.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.050
And if anything, he goes
too much into Watergate.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:05.270
You would think that he would gloss
over it but he really goes in.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.520
He also wrote another book later
in life called "In the Arena"

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.270 position:56%
which was sort of a secondary memoir

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.340
where he got some digs
in at his enemies.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.300
But the one that I
enjoyed the most or the two

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.570
that I enjoyed the most were
"Six Crises" which what he wrote

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:26.040 position:56%
after the 1960 lost and then another
book he wrote about great leaders

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.240
that he had met when
he was president.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.950
I think it's just called
"Leaders" if I remember correctly.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:37.350 position:56%
So RN, Six Crises, and Leaders would
be the three that I would recommend.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:38.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: Thank you.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:39.950
Thank you for your questions.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.520
Six Crises would certainly be
part of that first comeback.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.820
Sir?

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.690
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure how much you
discussed Gerald Ford in your book,

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.810
but how would you compare
and contrast Gerald Ford

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.340
as Richard Nixon's VP at a time

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:55.350
when everyone thought Nixon would
be leaving office versus Mike Pence

00:43:55.350 --> 00:44:00.240 position:56%
as Trump's VP while everyone wonders
how long Trump is going to last.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.770
Was Ford as acquiescence
as Pence has been?

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.070
&gt;&gt; John Farrell:

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:09.580
The vice-president's job
is a really tough job,

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.870
and I covered the White House.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:17.290
I was a political reporter for a
time before I became a biography.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:21.580
And you really have
to feel for them.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.090
I don't think that Ford
was too acquiescence.

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:28.100
In the last six months
before Nixon's resignation,

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:32.130
he was sending signals, and
one of them very famously.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.300 position:56%
At the time when Nixon was under
fire, he went out and he played golf

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.220
with Tipp O'Neal at a golf
tournament in Massachusetts,

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:45.220
and Tipp O'Neal was orchestrating
impeachment in the house,

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.880
and allowed the photographers
to take a picture of Ford

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.190
with his arm around Tipp.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:57.620
In the last three or four
weeks, he distanced himself,

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:02.070
did not fall on the
sword with Nixon.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:07.340 position:56%
I hesitate to make any comparisons
to Trump and Pence because we're not

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:11.090
at that same moment
of crisis and drama.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: I think we may just
be able to take one more question.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.290
Thank you, sir, for your question.

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:16.590
Yes?

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:21.240
&gt;&gt; Yes. What do you think would
have happened in the '68 election

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:30.730
if George Wallace was not
a factor and didn't run?

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:36.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I think that in the
end, the number of blue collar votes

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:47.520
that Wallace took from Humphrey
was less than the number of votes

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.410
that he took from Nixon
in the border states.

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:57.110
And so, if he had not
run, that would have meant

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:01.770
that Nixon would have taken those
border states and Humphrey ended

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:03.820
up taking those northern
states anyway.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.910
So I think probably Nixon
would have won no matter what.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:09.800
His message was not that
different from Wallace's.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: And the deep south,
the states that voted for Wallace.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:14.780
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: The deep south
had gone to [inaudible] in 1964

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:18.600
so the solid democratic staff
had been broken up already.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, the one chance Humphrey might
have had was [inaudible] throw it

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.760
into the house of representatives.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.750
&gt;&gt; John Farrell: I mean the
big threat to Humphrey was

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:30.610
that these blue collar
workers in Ohio and Illinois

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:32.790
and Michigan were going
to go for Wallace,

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.970
and in the end, they did not.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:39.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Elving: I hate to cut
off the questions but we do have

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:42.120
to give up the room as they say.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.420
Thank you all.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.220
We want to thank the
National Book Festival,

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.740
the Library of Congress, and CSPAN.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:55.510 position:56%
Thank you to CSPAN for having us on
tonight, and thank you Jack Farrell.
