00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.109
The business of growing up is something we
normally think comes to a close when we get

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.590
to 16 or so – and finally turn into those
fully finished products: adults. Up until

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.019
then, our growth is the subject of quite a
lot of collective fascination. Twentieth-century

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.900
psychology, beginning with the work of the
Swiss clinician Jean Piaget, pioneered an

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.189
approach to child development that meticulously
identified and labelled every principal stage

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.190
an average infant might go through on the
developmental journey of its earliest years.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.079
Thanks to this work, we now know that at six
months, a child will be able to sit up on

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.930
its own, pick up a small object (such as a
raisin) using a thumb and forefinger and recognise

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.539
its own image in a mirror, though it will
most likely take another three months before

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.260
it can drink from a cup on its own and understand
simple requests. By two, it will start to

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.199
say ‘I’ and ‘you’ and it will probably
be able to put on a hat by itself. Around

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.159
four, one can expect it to use sentences several
words long and quite possibly invent an imaginary

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.530
friend (an achievement that belongs to what
Piaget called the Symbolic Function Substage).

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.360
Between the ages of four and seven, children
begin to grasp abstract concepts like ‘time’

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.470
and ‘a country’ but typically make mistakes
around the use of ‘less than’ and ‘more

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.180
than’. Parents, uncles, aunts and grand-parents
tend to be deeply interested in these developmental

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.259
milestones – which become the stuff of family
legend. However, after about 16, the attention

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.439
society pays to the maturation of an individual
becomes ever more coarsely grained. The focus

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.770
shifts to external, material matters: we track
what someone gets in their university degree,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.270
what job they secure and how they progress
up the corporate hierarchy. Growing up becomes

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.490
synonymous with getting ahead. Yet, in truth,
we never stop having opportunities to grow

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.490
in an emotional – rather than material or
physical way. Perhaps between the ages of

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.950
19 and 21, without anyone really focusing
on this happening, we may radically rethink

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.819
our view of how to handle our parents’ shortcomings.
Or our view of envy takes a leap forward in

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.200
the middle of our 23rd year. Or, as we approach
33, lying in bed early one morning in a hotel,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.541
we amend our sense of who is to blame in certain
relationship difficulties. We may look more or

00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:33.950
less the same, but inside, slow, unheralded
moments of emotional growth can be going on.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.769
Unfortunately, we have nothing like the clear,
detailed stages to measure ourselves against

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.940
that babies and young children enjoy – and
that might give us the encouragement we would

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.750
need to note and foster stages of growth.
Yet, every adult life contains the potential

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.720
to acquire new emotional skills, each in its own
way as significant as a child mastering a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.450
quirk of language (in English, for instance,
saying ‘I thought rather than I thinked’)

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.110
or learning to ride a bicycle. To develop
emotionally involves a range of steps: learning

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.780
to understand and sympathise with oneself;
to take proper stock of one’s childhood

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.230
influences; to communicate flaws and eccentricities
to others in good time, to interpret others

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.980
beyond what they have directly said to us,
to recognise the hard edges of reality without

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.659
being destroyed by them, to accept one’s
needs for consolation and assistance, to achieve

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.640
a necessary degree of confidence, to know
how to despair without wholly giving up on

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.730
existence… We can imagine plotting the inner
journey like islands, each one of them marked

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.310
by settlements, which we should take the trouble
systematically to work our way around, as

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.870
we might the cities of Renaissance Italy,
or the beauty spots on the Pacific Highway.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.730
We’d tell our friends excitedly that we’d
learnt about Emotional Translation or had

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.870
achieved excellent grades in Communication.
We might throw a party when we’d learnt

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.000
how to do Cheerful Despair. Despite misleading
external signs, we aren’t, in fact, ever

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.580
done with the tricky business of becoming
that hugely important thing: an emotionally

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.780
mature person or, to put it another, simpler way, a
real grown-up.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.600
