[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:07.060
SPEAKER 1: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.150
We are so excited to
host Gonzalo Guzman, chef

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.010
and partner of
Nopalito restaurant,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.239
and his co-author of
the beautiful Nopalito

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.840
book, Stacy Adimondo.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.140
SPEAKER 2: Thank
you, [? Elia. ?]

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.370
So first question
I have is I want

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.520
to know what was your
first exposure to cooking.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.235
GONZALO GUZMAN: When I met
actually Chef Laurence, chef,

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:32.380
owner of Nopa right now.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.900
So I just came to his
kitchen, and just started

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.430
seeing a bunch of
things going on.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.250
And they were all just
pretty attractive to me,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.300
so I just decided that that's
kind of what I wanted to do.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.050
Because before that, I just
started working in restaurants.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.800
It was just a job.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.424
It wasn't something
that I wanted to do

00:00:55.424 --> 00:00:58.066
or something that
was in my head.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.920
But after seeing
all that, I realized

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.711
that that's something
that I kind of wanted

00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:04.140
to take serious and start--

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.920
yes, start taking more serious.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.390
And just start cooking and see
where that was going to go.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.829
SPEAKER 2: Did you have
previous experience before that?

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:14.620
GONZALO GUZMAN: No.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.335
I started as most people
when they first come here,

00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:21.820
washing dishes, which I
did in another restaurant

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.770
for like probably
a couple of months.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.640
And then they put me right
away into a prep station,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.280
and then a few months
later, I was line cook.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.650
And then I started
working all the stations

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.070
in that restaurant,
and that's kind of how

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.131
I learned what I now know.

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.620
STACY ADIMONDO: One thing that's
pretty neat that Laurence,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.010
the co-owner of Nopalito, says
in his introduction to the book

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.610
is that a lot of
Mexican immigrants

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.080
had come through his kitchens.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.990
And not all of them fall
in love with cooking.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.970
And he said he really
saw something special

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.730
in Gonzalo, in
that from day one,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.650
he had wide eyes and
a lot of curiosity.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.380
And he was really
excited to get into it

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.850
as a career and
a lifetime thing,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.010
rather than just
a quick way to get

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.600
himself settled in the
country and make some money.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.132
So that was, I think,
what inspired Laurence

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.590
to kind of say, I'm going to
keep this guy around and teach

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.580
him a few things.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.121
GONZALO GUZMAN: And
I was also raised

00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:19.250
by my mom and two
sisters, so all women.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.260
So I kind of had to--
since I was little,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.440
I remember doing all these
things that normally are just

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.700
for women in Mexico.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.930
The place that I was
born in, South Mexico.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.390
So, again, growing
in that kind of--

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.330
seeing all these-- the
way my mom was preparing,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.920
and going into the garden and
picking all these vegetables

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.334
and all that, it was in my--

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:46.500
I guess, in my life already.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.916
So it's not somebody
that I wanted

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:50.540
to do forever at that moment.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.565
But then it's always been
with me since I was--

00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:55.035
since I remember.

00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:56.410
SPEAKER 2: So is
that kind of how

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.909
you developed your
style of cooking,

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.040
is through cooking with your
family and all that stuff?

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.137
And then you got more trained
when you came here and started

00:03:04.137 --> 00:03:05.095
working in restaurants?

00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:05.970
GONZALO GUZMAN: Yeah.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.830
After like 10 years, I guess,
before we opened Nopalito,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.780
I worked in so many
different restaurants here

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.900
in San Francisco.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.850
But in the back of
my head, I always

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.410
had that idea of doing something
with Mexican food, which

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.740
that's the food that
I was raised with.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.100
But always doing everything
that way I was raised with too.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.610
And what I mean by
that is we will dry--

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.170
or plant our own
corn and dry it.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.510
And then we will cook it,
and then we will grind it.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.060
So pretty much everything
from scratch, and that's

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.250
kind of what I wanted
to do if I ever

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.290
will do Mexican food
or a Mexican-based kind

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.280
of restaurant.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.280
STACY ADIMONDO: I also
think one of the baffling

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.160
things about making Nopalito
work from the beginning

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.490
was that he had such a
high standard of that.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.220
It wasn't just, we're going
to grab tomatoes and make

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.610
a fresh tomato salsa,
because everybody expects it

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.860
to be at a Mexican restaurant.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.026
He sort of thought, well,
tomatoes aren't in-season,

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:05.710
so why would I use
them in the salsa?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.350
So they kind of operate the
same way that they would--

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.630
that Gonzalo did when
he was growing up.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.110
Where, literally,
what was around

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.470
was chopped down off a tree
or picked out of the ground.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.751
And that was the way
they liked to cook,

00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:21.459
and it was a way that
made sense to cook.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.580
So I think he's maintained
that in Nopalito,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.420
but at such a large scale.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.610
They have two restaurants.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.810
How many pounds of masa come
out of the kitchen every day?

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.530
GONZALO GUZMAN: Between
both restaurants,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.760
I think we do between 200 and
300 pounds of corn every day.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.480
STACY ADIMONDO: And it's all
organic corn, if possible,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.410
grown locally in
California and outside.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.620
That's a serious undertaking
to even find that much product,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.080
and do that by hand
just to start the day.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.460
That's with every single
element of the Nopalito cooking,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.940
is something that's
grown in-season,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.770
locally, and the
best possible product

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.080
that they could've found.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.090
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, and there's a--

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.890
your appetizer,
the garbanzo beans.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.720
You said they was traditionally
done with peanuts, but--

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.411
GONZALO GUZMAN:
Well, again, just--

00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:07.910
it's funny.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.160
I grew up in a really,
really small community.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.470
400 people.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.690
No electricity, no
water when I was there.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.740
So again, my dad and
my mom, sometimes when

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.090
they wanted to spend some
time in the family together,

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.680
they will just fry some
peanuts from our fields.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.680
And they will just fry
them with chili and lime,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.310
and that was kind
of like our dinner

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.824
sometimes, because
there was nothing else.

00:05:33.824 --> 00:05:35.990
But that's kind like the
idea of the garbanzos came.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.450
And also because we wanted to
offer something to the guests

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.040
when they will first
arrive to the restaurant.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.780
We didn't want to do
chips and guacamole,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.510
or salsas that most Mexican
restaurants or taquerias

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.310
do here.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.140
We wanted to give it more like--

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.890
original, I guess.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.160
The way I was raised,
but also give something

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.360
to kind of start
water their mouth

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.444
and start ordering
more drinks too.

00:06:05.444 --> 00:06:06.141
I was still--

00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:07.640
STACY ADIMONDO: And
the peanuts were

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.622
very difficult to find
organically in the quantities

00:06:10.622 --> 00:06:11.330
that they wanted.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.730
So he thought, how do I get
creative with something that

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.710
does make sense year-round?

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.540
And so he picked
chickpeas, fried

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.246
like as to mimic that crunchy,
little nutty kind of snack.

00:06:21.246 --> 00:06:23.510
GONZALO GUZMAN: So
my idea is different.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.030
SPEAKER 2: So you've
mentioned restaurants

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.920
you've tried when
you first moved here,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.260
and you even just did air quotes
to signify Mexican restaurants.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.980
What was your first thoughts
about Mexican restaurants

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.445
when you first moved?

00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:42.960
GONZALO GUZMAN: To me, I
thought it was Mexican food,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.120
but for a bunch of
other Mexican people.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.060
Because the way I
was raised, again, it

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.800
was totally different of what
I saw here in restaurants.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.867
Like corn tortilla tasted like
plastic to me, to be honest.

00:06:57.867 --> 00:06:59.450
I was used to really
tasting the corn.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.670
I was used to taste
the ingredient.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.480
Something that I felt like
I couldn't really find here,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.360
I will go to taquerias
or restaurants.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.570
And I will order
this sope, which

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.970
is pretty similar to
a traditional dish

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.050
that my mom will do when I
was little, called picadita.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.500
About the same idea, but
usually they're thin and--

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.460
thicker than a tortilla, but
thinner than the sope tortilla.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.560
And when I first
tasted that, because it

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.820
was the closest that I could
remember to my hometown,

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.820
I didn't like it at all.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.660
It was really doughy and it
didn't really taste like corn.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.860
It taste like
Play-Doh or something.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.100
So again, I just went
between restaurants

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.570
and I just couldn't
really find anything

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.942
that I felt like it
was Mexican food to me.

00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:49.418
Yeah.

00:07:49.418 --> 00:07:52.250
SPEAKER 2: So you
had a long process

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.175
of actually becoming Head Chef
of Nopalito and all that stuff.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:58.550
I do want to read something,
because I do love your book.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.720
And you said, "Mexican
food, at heart,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.560
is a labor-intensive
style of cuisine

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.300
from a hardworking people."

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.470
So how did you get
to where you're

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.216
at from where you started?

00:08:11.216 --> 00:08:13.880
GONZALO GUZMAN: You hear
these people saying,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.820
work smarter instead of harder.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.370
But I think if you combine
those two, you just kind of like

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.860
rush everything in a good way.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.930
And to me, it was
like working hard.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.540
Like working two
jobs in the morning,

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.290
at night, because I
knew I couldn't really

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.484
go to culinary school.

00:08:28.484 --> 00:08:29.900
And first of all,
because I didn't

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.340
speak any English at all.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.490
And second of all, because I
had to pay back a lot of money.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.039
But I also wanted to learn more
different type of cuisines,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.506
and that's why I went back
and forth between restaurants.

00:08:42.506 --> 00:08:44.630
Because I felt like that
was kind of like, I will--

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.360
that was my way to
just learn something

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.164
that I wasn't able to learn
from not going to school.

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:53.580
So I was working always really
hard, but at the same time,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.200
I was also taking some ESL
classes at city college

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.280
here just to learn the
language as much as I could.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.580
Because I felt like it
was really necessary

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.500
if I wanted to be
more than just a cook.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.107
I can always be a
cook, and I think

00:09:08.107 --> 00:09:10.440
there are really, really good
cooks, even better than me

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.480
maybe out there.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.700
But their challenge is the
language, and most of them

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.010
don't take that time
to go out there and try

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.450
to learn the language, which you
definitely need to communicate

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.070
with a lot of people.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:27.140
So that's kind of how
I became what I'm now--

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.510
people say I am.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.380
But it's just by working hard
in a smart way, and just--

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.136
so far, so good, so we'll see.

00:09:35.136 --> 00:09:41.380
SPEAKER 2: Well, you also said
that the cookbook and Nopalito,

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.240
the restaurant itself, is an
attempt to remember and honor

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.470
the way things were from--

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.650
I'm guessing you meant
your childhood in all that.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.525
GONZALO GUZMAN: Yeah.

00:09:49.525 --> 00:09:53.030
It goes back, again,
to the same idea.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.160
Everything from scratch
and not taking shortcuts.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.810
And that's kind of
how the restaurant is.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.380
Masa, but it's not just the masa
that we make in the restaurant.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.300
And I think that's probably
the only Mexican restaurant

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.580
maybe in San Francisco still.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.260
I'm not quite sure, but
that we grind our own masa

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.800
and we do the whole process
that a lot of people don't do.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.410
Their food is really good, some
of the Mexican restaurants,

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:27.620
but I think they still take all
the shortcuts that I was raised

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.930
not taking those shortcuts.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.470
And that's kind of
what I meant by saying

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.742
that you wake up in the
morning, you grind your own--

00:10:35.742 --> 00:10:37.700
I mean, you cook your
corn the day before then.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.405
I remember waking up, getting
this molino, that you now have.

00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:44.360
And then grind
this masa and then

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.910
pass it through
the metate, which

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.250
is another piece of equipment.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.220
And then to get it really
fine and make the tortillas.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.040
It's all these steps
that I feel like we do it

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.240
at the restaurant on
a different scale.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.140
Queso fresco, we will
make our own queso fresco.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.695
Churizo or things like that
that we do at the restaurant,

00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:07.190
that if I was doing it at
home when I was little--

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.130
Not anymore, because
now they all buy it.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.840
Because things change, and it's
been 20 years almost since I--

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.620
now there is electricity, and
there is water, and all that.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.255
But I am trying to keep that
idea, and just on a different--

00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:21.992
in a city.

00:11:21.992 --> 00:11:23.450
Which makes it a
little hard, but I

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:29.267
think that's the challenge that,
hopefully, people appreciate.

00:11:29.267 --> 00:11:31.100
Again, that's what you
can find in the book.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.710
You can make it as complicated
as you want it to be,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.346
or as simple as
you want it to be.

00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:36.470
You can just buy tortillas.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.151
You don't have to
make your own masa.

00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:39.650
But just so you see
it there and see

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.050
how much work it takes
to do a tortilla,

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.320
and appreciate more what
we do in the restaurant.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.180
STACY ADIMONDO: And
this goes back to--

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.580
I mean, one of the first
stories Gonzalo told me

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.720
when I met him was about a
typical day in their family

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.930
life when he was growing up.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.430
So his family owned
cornfields, and they'd walk,

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.250
starting at 5:00 in the morning
before the sun got too hot

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.630
and it was just
impossible to do anything.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.910
Walked to the cornfields,
tend the cornfields,

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.590
dry all the corn by
themselves from in the fields.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.020
Take it back, and then
there was one corn grinder

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.680
in his town of 400 people,
his village of 400 people.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.470
So this was not only a
ritual, but literally

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.300
like pure sustenance
for them, where

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.610
every dish was based off masa.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.370
Corn was just-- Gonzalo
says in the book,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.310
and I love this line, is that
he feels like he wouldn't feel

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.870
like a Mexican if there wasn't
corn in his house at all times.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.570
GONZALO GUZMAN: And it's true.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.500
At home, I always have
masa or tortillas,

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.190
because I need to
have some of that.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.470
I grew up with it, and it's
part of my life already.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.520
STACY ADIMONDO: Yeah,
and I think just

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.380
to think about taking
a shortcut, for him,

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.330
is just absolutely insane.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.137
And I think, in
some ways, it takes

00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:52.220
a little bit of convincing
for the average person.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.680
The first time you hear about
the process of making masa

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.080
from scratch, you're like,
I would love to do that.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.080
And then you're like, oh,
there's a lot of stuff to that,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.020
and I'm not sure I can really
fit that into my weeknight.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.300
But something that I learned
in the process of making

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.060
the book with him is
that it is a ritual,

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.670
and it's something that's
actually very simple at heart

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.190
and not difficult to learn.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.840
And once you kind of
get used to having

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.030
that as part of
your pantry, as part

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.280
of your staples of
cooking in your kitchen,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.860
you make a big batch on Sunday
night and then that's that.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.800
And you have it to use
in any number of ways

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.050
throughout the week.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.020
And the way that I think
it's used in Mexico

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.590
is so eye-opening.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.990
It's not just to press into a
tortilla and serve as a taco.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.080
We have a whole section
on masa in the book,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.260
and I work for a magazine
called Saveur that focuses

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.710
on international cuisine.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.290
And we ended up doing
a six-page story on--

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.720
actually I have it with me.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.890
We did a six-page
story that ended up

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.490
you know putting masa
on the cover and inside.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.890
And everybody sort of thought,
is there really that much

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:58.710
to say about it?

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.480
And there is.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.110
It's like all the different
types of corn that you can use.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.860
All the different ways
that you can use it

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.810
beyond tacos or quesedillas,
the words that everybody

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.030
is sort of familiar with
with Mexican cuisine.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.530
You can use it to thicken soups.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.130
You can use it to make a
number of antojitos, that

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.387
are the Mexican streets foods.

00:14:18.387 --> 00:14:20.720
Gonzalo says that they used
to fry little nuggets of it,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.370
kind of like gnocchi,
and just pop them

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.454
as snacks and [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:23.454 --> 00:14:25.744
GONZALO GUZMAN: It's kind of
like the base for anything

00:14:25.744 --> 00:14:26.450
you can imagine.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.950
And it's just,
again, like Play-Doh.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.080
You can make anything
or any figure you want.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.080
So same thing with masa.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.280
You can even eat
it as a dessert.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.400
There is a recipe that
didn't make it to the book,

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.300
but it's a drink that is base
of masa, water, and sugar.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.590
A specific sugar.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:47.080
But, again, it's kind of like
if there is nothing else to it,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.520
I think you will
survive with just masa.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.710
That's how I see it, and
that's why it's so- to me,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.300
it's so important
to have it with me.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.850
But, again, it's
also for you guys

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.815
if you wanted to play with it.

00:15:00.815 --> 00:15:02.690
Have some masa and start
playing with things,

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.980
and you'll see you'll survive.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.460
SPEAKER 2: The
cookbook's laid out

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.910
to where you start
off with the basics,

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.080
like, here's the groundwork
that you need to know

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.080
about getting into this.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.900
Like, first up, right up
here's what you got to know.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.310
Then let's build from there.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.384
I think masa-- is that one
of the first things in there?

00:15:23.384 --> 00:15:25.550
STACY ADIMONDO: Yeah, I
think it's pretty much one--

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.920
Well, after we kind of
introduce who Gonzalo is

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.420
and what Nopalito
is all about, we

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.260
go right into the wonderful
world of masa, essentially.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.090
And just talking
about how to make it,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.780
what it meant to him, his
stories about growing up

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.270
that we touched on, and all the
different ways that it's used.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.880
And then we kind of
expand that into a section

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.520
on the Mexican pantry,
which to me, was

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.780
one of the most eye-opening
things of the exploration

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.790
process of learning with him.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.450
Is that there are a lot
of unexpected ingredients

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.580
that I don't think many
people would associate

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.710
with Mexican right off the bat.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.650
Even just in the spice cabinet,
you might think of cumin,

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.830
but you wouldn't necessarily
think of cloves, or anise,

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.300
or marjoram, or all
these beautiful, musty,

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.700
and deeply-flavored
spices that go

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.460
into things like moles, and
sauces, and chili paste,

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.680
and braised meats.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.420
So all of a sudden, once
you start noticing that,

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.045
you taste the cuisine
very differently.

00:16:25.045 --> 00:16:26.544
You take a bite of
something and you

00:16:26.544 --> 00:16:29.119
think like, wow, this actually
has so many layers of flavors.

00:16:29.119 --> 00:16:31.160
Those spices are toasted
and then they're ground.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.280
And then there are a number--
we have a whole section

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.160
on dried chilis in the book.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
Because I think if you
think of Mexican cuisine,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.170
you think of jalapenos,
poblanos, serranos, maybe.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.840
But those are the fresh, green
versions of these chilis,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.520
and so many of them
are smoked, dried.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.540
They come in so many
different flavors.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.620
If you walk into a Mexican
market in San Francisco,

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.320
you'll see, literally,
a wall of dried chilis

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.510
that were treated
in different ways.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.720
Have different spice
levels, different sizes.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.089
And all of a sudden, it opens
up this entire other section

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.770
of salsas, chili
paste, and you just

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:14.750
begin to see how deep the
nuances of all of the pantry

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.810
staples and the spices run.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.060
GONZALO GUZMAN: Which, again,
sounds very complicated,

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:19.700
all that.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.660
I know.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.329
But as I said, you can make
it as complicated as easy.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.190
There are some recipes
that they're just

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.530
tomatillo and a chili,
and that makes a salsa.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.849
STACY ADIMONDO: Right

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.307
GONZALO GUZMAN: And probably
start exploring with that one,

00:17:30.307 --> 00:17:33.210
and then just change the chilis
and using the same tomatillo

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.125
ingredient or tomato,
just to get familiar

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:36.000
with the ingredients.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.800
And if you love Mexican
food, you'll love it.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.750
You'll love all these flavors,
and you'll start adding, little

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.350
by little, some other chilis.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.850
And why not maybe even
doing the masa if you wanted

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.260
to explore a little bit more.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.680
But it's definitely for people
that really enjoy cooking

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.834
and want to take that risk.

00:17:53.834 --> 00:17:55.500
STACY ADIMONDO:
Gonzalo, when I was sort

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.220
like, oh, I'm never going to
remember all these chilis.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.190
Where do I even start?

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.981
How do I know the
differences between them?

00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:02.487
He said, after a
while, it becomes

00:18:02.487 --> 00:18:04.070
like walking through
the grocery store

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.784
and looking at the potato bins.

00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:07.700
You know the difference
between a sweet potato

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.991
and a white potato and what
not, and he's like, it just

00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:11.000
becomes second nature.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.090
You just see them, and
you're like, right, right.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.564
Puya, arbol, this and that.

00:18:14.564 --> 00:18:16.730
GONZALO GUZMAN: Takes time,
just like every cuisine.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.789
STACY ADIMONDO: Yeah.

00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:19.580
SPEAKER 2: So with all
this different types

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.920
of masa and the
different chilis,

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.184
what was your thought
process like in what

00:18:24.184 --> 00:18:25.475
recipes to put in the cookbook?

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.550
GONZALO GUZMAN: I think I
tried to pick the ones that

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.390
were much easier, I guess.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:35.240
And some of them--

00:18:38.989 --> 00:18:39.530
I don't know.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.380
I mean, there is so many that
it was hard to pick through

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.830
like all these recipes.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.871
Because that's probably
they have all the recipes

00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:49.400
that we still have
in the restaurant.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.030
But I think at the
end, whatever we

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:57.870
felt like people will enjoy it
more and will have more of--

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.520
have access to ingredient-wise.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.867
Because there are some
recipes that definitely--

00:19:02.867 --> 00:19:04.700
I'm not even able to
do it in the restaurant

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.170
because I don't have
the ingredients.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.170
And if I do get them, I
don't get them as much.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.520
Like if I get some specific
chili from Mojacar,

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.741
I probably will do a
small batch for my house.

00:19:12.741 --> 00:19:14.240
So yes, we're a
staff mill because I

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.120
know people won't be able to
do it here with what we have.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.050
So we kind of picked
through the recipes just

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.970
based on what people will
have more access to here.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.917
Now you go to Mission St.
and you can get a bunch of--

00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:29.000
all these ingredients that
you'll see in the book,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.958
you'll find them there.

00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.727
And that's what the whole
idea, just to make it--

00:19:32.727 --> 00:19:34.310
STACY ADIMONDO: I
think a lot of them,

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.980
too, ended up being
the recipes that--

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.490
well, at least I thought Gonzalo
sounded the most sentimental

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.114
about and the most
nostalgic about it.

00:19:44.114 --> 00:19:46.280
He'd sit up straight in his
chair, and he'd be like,

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.954
oh, my mom used
to do this, and I

00:19:47.954 --> 00:19:49.745
couldn't stop eating
it right off the stove

00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:51.680
as she was cooking.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.050
It seemed like they
were almost the--

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.820
like the things he missed
about home the most.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.720
And also the things
that I think would

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.900
give the most wide range of
understanding of the cuisine.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.470
Like there's probably a
million different versions

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.480
of a quesedilla, but
we included three

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.167
or four thinking, per season,
there's one there for you.

00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:14.000
These show a couple of
different techniques.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.470
These show a couple of
different styles of filling.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.470
They're maybe from a
different region in Mexico.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.180
So we give a little
bit of variety,

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.670
but obviously you
could barely scratch

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.150
the surface of what's out there
to learn about the cuisine.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:26.270
GONZALO GUZMAN: Yeah,
being masa is still

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.330
the base of everything.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.115
STACY ADIMONDO: Yeah

00:20:29.115 --> 00:20:32.720
SPEAKER 2: So besides on of my
favorite quotes, "Don't panic,"

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.330
what should people know
going into the book Nopalito?

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.950
GONZALO GUZMAN:
Well, they should

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.740
know that they're getting into
something that is probably--

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.950
I mean, for some people
it may be easier,

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.106
because they're more
used to, again--

00:20:49.106 --> 00:20:50.480
they live in a
city where I think

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.210
there is a lot of Mexican
food, good or bad,

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.380
but still the idea is there.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.630
I think you going
to open something,

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.570
you're not going to be afraid
what you gonna find in there.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.250
Again, go and don't freak out.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.880
Just go and look at the
recipes or the ingredients

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.300
that you're familiar
with, and try

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.549
to play around with those two.

00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:11.120
And little by little, just--

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.890
don't read the whole
book, probably.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.420
Start with two or
three pages first,

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:18.230
and then take some time to kind
of get into your head recipes

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.110
and steps.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.610
And then little by
little, just keep

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.364
adding it to your-- just
like everything else.

00:21:23.364 --> 00:21:26.030
STACY ADIMONDO: I think a lot of
times when people read recipes,

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.340
they think they can't
veer off of exactly

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.300
what's in the recipe.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.350
And that if they do one part,
they have to do all 10 parts.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.060
What's wonderful
about Mexican cuisine,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.240
and slightly intimidating
about some of the recipes,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.160
is that there are
so many layers.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.890
So you start by toasting
a lot of ingredients

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.490
or frying some chilis, and
then you might grind something.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.010
And then you might add
a sauce, and then you

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.320
might have to work
with the masa.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.380
In the end, it seems like,
of course, a tostada.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:54.950
So simple.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.410
But really, the work that it
takes to get to some of them

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:58.940
is slightly challenging.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.520
It takes some time, but
you can break that down,

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.590
and you can say,
man I really loved

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.620
you know that braised
chicken tinga that

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.350
goes on top of a tostada.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.700
And by the tostada
shell, make the chicken.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.980
Or if you really
loved a salsa that

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.510
came with one of
the dishes and it

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.730
was mixed in with
shredded beef, you

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.090
can mix it in with shredded pork
and adapt a lot of the things

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.600
that you learned from the book.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.860
So I'd probably give the
advice, because there's

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.350
cooks of all
different walks, just

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.550
to feel free to take
little sections of it,

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.710
improvise off of
it, make something

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.380
slightly spicier or slightly
less spicy if you don't like it

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.240
that way.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.540
If you're totally obsessed
with one style of dish,

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.970
then just go on your own
journey with that style

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.080
once Gonzalo kind of gives
you the confidence to--

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.910
the base level.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.076
GONZALO GUZMAN: And keep
in mind that the first time

00:22:51.076 --> 00:22:53.230
that you do something,
it almost never

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.230
will turn out the way you
wanted it to turn out.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.105
It takes some practice,
and that goes with me

00:22:57.105 --> 00:23:00.130
too whenever I'm trying and
some new dish that I kind of--

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:04.144
I've seen it before in
Mexico, or I want to do it.

00:23:04.144 --> 00:23:05.810
It takes me two, or
three, or four times

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.280
until I get it the
way I wanted it to do.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.520
So I know in the pictures
it always looks nice,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.090
and when you do it, it
doesn't look just the same.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.530
But I think that
just keeping in mind

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.330
that that's going to be almost
the case with any cuisine,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.290
I guess, when you
try something new.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.250
So just don't be
afraid to not get it

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.000
right the first time,
and the second time,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.270
and the third time, or
maybe even the fourth time.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.580
It's just like
everything, practice.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.569
The recipes are there just to
guide you through the process.

00:23:35.569 --> 00:23:37.610
But again, there's some
techniques here and there

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.070
that you can have to
develop yourself as you

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.295
practice with what recipe.

00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:42.170
STACY ADIMONDO: Yeah.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.070
We have a joke in the preface
of the book about my first time

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.190
frying the salsa, which who
knew that that was even a thing.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.590
But you dump hot
salsa into hot oil,

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.910
and you can guess what happens
if you choose the wrong pan.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.910
My entire backsplash
in my kitchen

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.161
was like Jackson Pollock
from salsa a couple of times.

00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:02.868
GONZALO GUZMAN: The
trick is not to stop.

00:24:02.868 --> 00:24:04.050
Just put everything.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:06.020
Don't stop right there, because
that's when the-- you know.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.520
STACY ADIMONDO: It's
exactly the opposite

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.300
of what you would think.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.091
All of a sudden, when
it starts sputtering,

00:24:10.091 --> 00:24:12.230
you probably want to pull
off and stop doing it.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.891
But Gonzalo's like,
don't be afraid.

00:24:13.891 --> 00:24:16.390
Just dump the whole thing in
there and it's actually better.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.110
But I think at the
end of the day,

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.700
even if it is
slightly imperfect,

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.370
I still can't make a
perfect circle tortilla.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.610
I can't do it, and
I don't know why.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.160
But even if it is
slightly imperfect,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.130
I think it just-- food
tastes better when it

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.900
has a story behind it, really.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.100
And Gonzalo, every single
recipe in that book

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.920
has a story about it, and some
little moment of education

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.180
that gives you a window into
beautiful culture and cuisine

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:44.790
in Mexico.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.390
And I think it's just
so much more satisfying

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.910
to sit down at your dinner
table and serve your friends

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.530
and family that type of food.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.750
And say, here's the
background of it.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.240
I learned from this
amazing guy's story.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.760
And that, to me, is
what makes it special.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.940
SPEAKER 2: So what would you
say the overall goal is to reach

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.190
people with through this book?

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.106
What are you hoping
people will get out of it?

00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:10.110
GONZALO GUZMAN: I think it's
always been my goal just

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.702
to kind of educate
people about food.

00:25:11.702 --> 00:25:14.160
And with this book, I think
that's what we're trying to do,

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.630
is to educate people more
about what Mexican food is,

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.660
and what it takes--

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.530
what it takes,
again, to really--

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.510
what we do at the
restaurant, and what

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.720
I did when I was little.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.820
Again, it kind of
reflects my life,

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.640
but at the same times,
Nopalito's life,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.199
because that's what we've
been doing all the time.

00:25:36.199 --> 00:25:38.490
So, again, it's just to
educate people and kind of know

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.450
more of what we do
at the restaurant.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.300
And just to tell people that
it's not that easy when people

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.397
go into the place and
complain about the price

00:25:48.397 --> 00:25:49.230
that they're paying.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:50.688
Because I think
they have that idea

00:25:50.688 --> 00:25:52.110
with Chinese food
or Mexican food

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.680
that it's always
going to be cheap.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.950
But if you look at the
steps, and the process,

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.720
and the ingredients
that we use here,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.306
we use all the fresh ingredients
that we use in this book

00:26:00.306 --> 00:26:01.180
or in the restaurant.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.240
They're all local, so we work
with a lot of local farmers.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.670
We go to the farmers markets.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.970
Not myself, but Chef
Laurence goes, because I

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:10.590
don't have enough time.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.480
But we kind of work
together to see.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.360
He'll tell me what's new, and
we will add it to the menu.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.330
And that's kind of like,
again, how I grew up.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.630
Just by using what's in my
backyard, what we had there,

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.670
or we'll just grow it wild.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.600
So the end is just I think
we're not trying to--

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.052
personally, I'm not
trying to tell everyone,

00:26:30.052 --> 00:26:31.260
this is what Mexican food is.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.349
This is the best Mexican book.

00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:34.890
I think this is just
what Nopalito is

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.170
right now, and part of my life.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.660
And hopefully, people really
appreciate more the restaurant

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.230
and enjoy.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.210
And again, this is
just one little piece

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.820
of Mexican food from
the South, Veracruz.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.320
So there is so much
more about Mexican food,

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.820
and I'm sure there will be
another chef that will say,

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.280
oh this is Mexican food now.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.589
But, again, I know
that's going to happen.

00:26:55.589 --> 00:26:58.130
But I'm not trying to say that
this is the best Mexican food,

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.670
I'm just--

00:26:58.670 --> 00:26:59.560
Mexican restaurant, I'm sorry.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.893
STACY ADIMONDO: One thing you
must realize about Gonzalo

00:27:01.893 --> 00:27:04.430
is that he couldn't
possibly be more humble,

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.470
so I'm here to do
his bragging for him.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.510
And it is the best
Mexican book, by the way.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.660
GONZALO GUZMAN:
[INAUDIBLE], you guys.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.346
No, but honestly, you don't
see any flour tortillas there.

00:27:16.346 --> 00:27:17.970
And that's because
I grew up in a place

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.500
that there were no
flour tortillas.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.166
I didn't know there
were flour tortillas

00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:24.420
until I came to California.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.625
So that wasn't till
I was 15 years old,

00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:28.486
that's when I finally
made flour tortillas.

00:27:28.486 --> 00:27:29.610
But that wasn't in my head.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.350
That wasn't in my food.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.870
That's all like north of
Mexico, but it's Mexican food.

00:27:37.884 --> 00:27:40.050
It is Mexican food, but
it's just a different state,

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.420
different place, different--
it's still Mexico

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.590
so again it's a little place.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:48.150
But at the same time it's
what Nopalito is about.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:52.542
And, again, part of
my life there too.

00:27:52.542 --> 00:27:56.280
STACY ADIMONDO: I'm
in the food business,

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.280
I write about food for
a living, and I probably

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.890
would've thought I knew
something about Mexican cuisine

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.120
before I met Gonzalo.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.270
And I sort of felt like, well,
yeah, I don't know everything,

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.550
but I sort of get
the general concept.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:12.270
And something that Gonzalo says,
and we address in the book,

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.600
is I think a lot of people
assume it's very heavy.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.730
Everything's cooked in
lard, or deep-fried,

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.747
or there's a side
of rice and beans

00:28:19.747 --> 00:28:20.830
on the side of everything.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.680
And it's a gut bomb,
and you kind of

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.720
like eat it when
you're hungover.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.560
It's like really kind
of silly, and it all

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.970
starts with the chips and salsa.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.920
And I very, very, quickly
learned that that was not true.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.800
And of course those foods
are a part of the cuisine,

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:44.970
but it's a very fresh,
regional, varied cuisine.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.390
Something in the book that I
love is a chicken soup recipe.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.710
And there's a big chipotle
chili floating on top of it,

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.604
and there's homemade queso
fresco that's cut into cubes

00:28:55.604 --> 00:28:57.770
and put at the bottom of
it with chunks of avocados.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.350
So as you dip your
spoon in, there's

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.540
this melty piece of cheese
at the bottom of your bowl.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.307
It's just so wonderful, and
so nourishing, and so fresh,

00:29:07.307 --> 00:29:07.890
and different.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.420
And I just didn't know
that that existed,

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.300
even as a section
of Mexican food,

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.460
which sounded so silly
to say in retrospect.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.260
But I think you
know a lot of people

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.040
are missing that depth of
understanding the cuisine.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.310
So I think, at least,
I'm extremely honored

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.410
to have been able to
help him tell this story,

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.940
and to just be educated myself
to walk into a Mexican market

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.350
and be able to put some fun
ingredients on the countertop

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.830
and just kind of be like,
yeah, I know what I'm doing.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.780
It's so empowering,
and it also just helps

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.520
you connect to
this country that's

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.020
our neighbors, and our people.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.990
So many of them are so
humble and hardworking,

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.550
and they're not going
to brag for themselves.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.430
But I think there's
so much worth

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.120
uncovering in taking the time to
go learn about in this cuisine.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.660
So I'm very happy I
got to be part of it.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.710
GONZALO GUZMAN: Me too.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.455
And I've been happy
just to be around people

00:30:05.455 --> 00:30:11.880
that believe in me, and then
to help me to get this project.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.260
And now be chef/owner
of a couple restaurants.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.080
but again, there's so
many good cooks there,

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.004
but that's what they're missing.

00:30:21.004 --> 00:30:22.170
People that believe in them.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.290
And also, then, they need
to educate thier self

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.340
with a little more--

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.180
by going, at least,
to learn the language.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.690
Because that's one-- that's
something that they--

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.940
If we don't do it, then we
cannot really do much here.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.606
Even if we're really
good cooks or we're

00:30:37.606 --> 00:30:41.380
really good with anything, we
have to take that extra step.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.800
And that's what I'm
trying to prove, also.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.165
Myself, but to the
people around me.

00:30:46.165 --> 00:30:49.560
Kind of show them
that we can do it,

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.040
but we also have to
put hard work on it.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.712
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:53.712 --> 00:30:57.139
Is there one dish that
you'd want everybody who

00:30:57.139 --> 00:30:58.430
walks into the restroom to try?

00:31:01.202 --> 00:31:03.510
GONZALO GUZMAN: Masa.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.240
So whatever you can
find with masa, try it.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.780
So that's 90% of our menu, 95%.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.960
It's everything.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.440
Again, every dish
that you see there,

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.512
we're very proud of doing it.

00:31:16.512 --> 00:31:17.970
And I feel like if
it's there, it's

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.792
because we felt it's tasty, and
it's good, and it's delicious.

00:31:21.792 --> 00:31:23.250
But again, you go
into a restaurant

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.340
where we have other
cooks, and sometimes, they

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.010
might forget to put
salt [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.125
We try the food every
day, like every morning.

00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:32.140
We try all the dishes.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.098
But still, that's still
happens, unfortunately.

00:31:34.098 --> 00:31:36.030
Like if I'm not there.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.740
If someone is not
looking at them,

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.910
there will be cook that
hopefully we don't have--

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:45.650
but keep that in mind that
with as we can or I can,

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:50.160
I try to just make sure
that everything tastes

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.390
really good for everyone.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.100
But, no, I don't really have--

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.150
I mean, carnitas is
there just because people

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.550
who doesn't love pork.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.580
And then they said it
is the best carnitas,

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.600
but again, go and try it
and you make that call.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.250
STACY ADIMONDO: Yeah, carnitas
made the cover for a reason.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.536
Something that I love is seeing
the rotating ceviche offerings

00:32:11.536 --> 00:32:12.160
that they have.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.217
Because, again, that's part
of many cultures' cuisine.

00:32:15.217 --> 00:32:17.550
You can try a ceviche in a
lot of different restaurants,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.510
but I think I learned
something about Mexican ceviche

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.550
from Gonzalo,
trying his versions.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.430
One has grated carrots
in it that I just

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:31.090
thought was so special,
and unique, and unexpected.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.300
He has a lot with--
some of them are red,

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.270
and have these sort of
like smoky, oily kind

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.710
of sauces with them.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.690
And then others are
bright green, and fresh,

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.500
and really vibrant.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.860
And kind of like sour
and puckery in the mouth.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.370
And, of course, his
chips are the best chips.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.420
So it's really just a vehicle--

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.640
an excuse to eat chips,
but they're beautiful.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.140
GONZALO GUZMAN:
That's a good point,

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.880
because a lot of people, when
they go and have cevivche,

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.600
they always have in their
mind, tomato, onions, jalapeno,

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.330
and fish.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.240
Overcooked fish.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.740
To me, it's really
fresh everything.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.780
So it's whatever you
can find in-season.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.640
Right now it's asparagus.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.280
Why not just using
that in your ceviche?

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.060
If you cook it--

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.420
SPEAKER 2: Which
you have right now.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.586
GONZALO GUZMAN: Not anymore.

00:33:14.586 --> 00:33:15.469
We just changed that.

00:33:15.469 --> 00:33:16.260
No, we still do it.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:16.510
Sorry.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.218
We still have it.

00:33:17.218 --> 00:33:19.620
We just changed-- yeah.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.830
You're supposed to use what
you can grow it yourself,

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:23.790
or what's in season.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.490
And I think, why are you
using something else that

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.730
is not really in
season if you have it?

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.220
I don't know if it
makes sense, but just

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.020
use what you have
instead of trying

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.744
to eat tomatoes when they're not
actually really good and sweet.

00:33:37.744 --> 00:33:40.160
Just wait until the season,
it's going to come back again.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.784
STACY ADIMONDO: I think there's
a really neat component to when

00:33:42.784 --> 00:33:45.720
you go to Nopalito
about trying the dishes,

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.280
and the way the
menu is laid out.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.280
Because unlike, I
think, many cuisines,

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.190
you don't start with
a lettuce salad,

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.010
and then move on to a main
entree, and then eat dessert.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.130
It's sort of like you kind of
choose your own adventure of,

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.820
do you want to eat a
combination of street foods?

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.570
A very casual meal
in Mexico, I think,

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.200
is you eat a taco,
you to gordita.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.969
You eat a number of things that
the street vendors are making

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:11.550
or that you're making at home.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:17.217
Or you eat these larger plates,
larger-format meals that are--

00:34:17.217 --> 00:34:18.925
when Gonzalo was
growing up, kind of more

00:34:18.925 --> 00:34:20.630
of a weekend thing, I think.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.743
When they'd have an animal and--

00:34:22.743 --> 00:34:25.560
GONZALO GUZMAN: Yeah.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.690
I grew up eating
mostly vegetable,

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.190
because meat was
really expensive.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.190
And that's the other reason why
I didn't eat meat that much.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.815
But we will eat the mole
sauce without the chicken,

00:34:34.815 --> 00:34:37.190
and it'll be still
really good mole.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.230
But that was kind of the
reason, just because we

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.796
wouldn't have access to--

00:34:40.796 --> 00:34:41.712
STACY ADIMONDO: Right.

00:34:42.212 --> 00:34:44.540
GONZALO GUZMAN: We'll go
and maybe kill an armadillo,

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.829
make it into--

00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:49.840
Again, we will have to
go out there and hunt it.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.100
That's kind of like--

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:55.610
again, it's [INAUDIBLE],
but that's kind of why.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.110
STACY ADIMONDO: But it's neat
to navigate the menu, I think,

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.651
at the restaurant
for the first time.

00:34:59.651 --> 00:35:01.860
And sort of say,
we're going to combine

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.580
a number of different styles of
these smaller plates and street

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.840
foods.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.410
There's very few that I
recognized off first glance.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.780
There was like one taco on
the menu, one quesedilla

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.490
on the menu, and everything else
was these neat things that--

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.734
I was like, I think I--
do I know what that is?

00:35:17.734 --> 00:35:19.400
It's just fun to kind
of go there and do

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.860
it one way or the other,
and eat a number of street

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.180
foods and masa-based things.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.340
Or then try things
like the carnitas,

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.965
or carne asada, or [INAUDIBLE],
some of the braised meats,

00:35:30.965 --> 00:35:32.090
and that kind of thing too.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.355
So you should probably just
go on a number of times

00:35:34.355 --> 00:35:36.692
to Nopalito and see
what works for you.

00:35:36.692 --> 00:35:38.900
GONZALO GUZMAN: We did a
little twist here and there,

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.650
just because I know
it's not for everyone.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:45.350
But salads wasn't
part of my cuisine.

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:47.990
When I grew up, my salad was
a slice of tomato, lettuce,

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.870
and lime juice.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.020
But I know here, if I do
that, people will be like,

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.561
what is this?

00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:53.660
Or something.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.104
Again, for the
restaurants, we're

00:35:56.104 --> 00:35:58.520
going to have to have that
option also for the guests too.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.260
So I kind of had to
add a couple of salads

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.250
that I didn't grow up with.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.900
They're probably not
really authentic,

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.260
but again, we cook for the
guests at the end, too.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.970
So I kind of have to
make it work so it's

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.271
a win-win for both sides.

00:36:10.271 --> 00:36:12.742
AUDIENCE: So first of all,
my wife and I love Nopalito.

00:36:12.742 --> 00:36:14.450
It's our favorite
restaurant in the city.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:15.230
GONZALO GUZMAN: Thank you.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:17.688
AUDIENCE: We got engaged about
a year ago in San Francisco,

00:36:17.688 --> 00:36:21.020
and the first place we walked
to was Nopalito, so we love it.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.550
You learned growing
up how to cook

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.470
for yourself or for a family.

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:31.160
How did you learn to scale that
to cooking for two restaurants?

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.210
GONZALO GUZMAN: School.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.290
Yeah.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:39.660
Again, that was-- it's funny.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.130
I always tried to
learn something new,

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.410
and actually just
two years ago, I just

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:49.100
graduated from my GED,
high school diploma.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.960
Which, again, I didn't go to
school in Mexico or anything.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.290
Just here, so it was
also at city college.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:56.000
But math was one
of those classes

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.650
that I took two
semesters, because I

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:58.850
wasn't really good at it.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.310
And I'm still not good at it,
but I understand the basics

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.770
that I need for cooking.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:07.190
So that is kind of what
helped me to just scale it up.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.380
Because my co-chef,
which, again, I

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.061
learned a lot from him,
and he's part of this book.

00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:14.310
Because most of these recipes,
we worked them together

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.120
with Jose Ramos.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.950
But that was his challenge
too, like, we need 24 quarts

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:25.575
of salsa for tonight, but
our recipe says 1 quart.

00:37:25.575 --> 00:37:27.080
So what do we do?

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.310
So again, that pushed myself to
go to school whenever I could

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.720
and just to take math.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.430
And that's kind of how I did it.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.020
And same thing goes
for don't now I

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.470
have to manage people instead
of just me, and cooking.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:43.870
Being by myself, cooking for the
people and being on the line.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.070
So I knew now that I
needed to work with people,

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.680
and that's another challenge
working in a restaurant,

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.730
is managing.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.670
So funny enough, I took one
semester of psychology too,

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:53.170
just--

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.560
I don't know, but I
felt like that will--

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.340
And again, but going back
to the question, yes,

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.529
and I went to school
for basic math

00:38:02.529 --> 00:38:04.070
that you probably
already understand.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.682
But just using that as--

00:38:06.682 --> 00:38:08.930
AUDIENCE: So I've always
wanted to go to Nopalito,

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.850
but I have these
little rugrats that

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.610
hang out with me all the time.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:15.710
Do you feel like your
restaurant has options

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.440
that are accessible for kids,
or if not kids, people that

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.270
have a less-adventurous palate?

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:23.015
What would you recommend?

00:38:23.015 --> 00:38:25.140
GONZALO GUZMAN: Well,
there's always rice and beans

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.160
and cheese quesedillas for kids.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.000
But I have two kids.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.040
I have a boy and a girl.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.540
Myself, I push them
to eat anything.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.165
So if they come
with me, honestly,

00:38:34.165 --> 00:38:37.050
it's like, here, you
eat some ceviche.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.240
You eat some [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.640
But we have the options of
rice, beans, cheese quesedilla,

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.129
side of chicken.

00:38:45.129 --> 00:38:46.670
Things that we kind
of know they're--

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.540
STACY ADIMONDO:
Well, and I think

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.539
some of the dishes that
maybe sound like they're

00:38:49.539 --> 00:38:54.770
going to be complicated or spicy
actually have a sweet side too.

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:58.590
So like mole, I couldn't
imagine a kid not liking mole,

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.240
like licking their
fingers and making a mess.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.150
I think some of the
soups are really fun.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.650
There's a soup that has--

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:08.110
it sort of looks like--

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.160
I kind of think of it
as the Mexican ramen.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.315
It's got noodles,
and chicken, and--

00:39:12.315 --> 00:39:14.440
GONZALO GUZMAN: Which is
not on the menu right now.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.190
STACY ADIMONDO: Not
on the menu right now.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:20.450
But there's this fun
stuff, and it's colorful.

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:22.760
I find that the
restaurant is often

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.500
filled with families and kids.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.960
I think it's a real
community that is loyal to

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.010
and loves Nopalito.

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:32.333
And it's definitely kind
of come one, come all menu.

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:33.920
GONZALO GUZMAN: Chips and guac.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.555
I mean, kids love that.

00:39:35.555 --> 00:39:38.152
I start by that, and then
I think-- slowly I've

00:39:38.152 --> 00:39:39.610
seen families that
have been coming

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.950
to the restaurant for
now a few years already.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.260
When kids will just go
and order rice and beans,

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.597
and little by little,
parents started pushing them

00:39:48.597 --> 00:39:49.430
with something else.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.346
And now they're like,
oh, I love your ceviche.

00:39:51.346 --> 00:39:53.610
I'm like, okay.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.610
I think it's a great
first opportunity for you

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.945
to have your kids try that.

00:39:56.945 --> 00:39:58.750
And some of them get
addicted, actually.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.310
They start liking it.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.974
You'll see they like it more
than you will, probably.

00:40:02.974 --> 00:40:05.878
Yeah.

00:40:05.878 --> 00:40:07.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.550
So speaking of the
next generation,

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.970
what are your future plans?

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.940
Are there are going
to be more Nopalitos?

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.580
What else are you going to do?

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.800
No, no more Nopalitos.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.100
I think there's one Nopalito,
or now, is kind of two.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.850
But those two make one.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.400
Definitely, I don't think
there will be another Nopalito

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.480
restaurant.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.970
We're not trying
to build a chain.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.034
That's what I think--

00:40:33.034 --> 00:40:34.450
my partner is right
here, actually

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.590
will tell you that too.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:41.380
But definitely, there
is a things in my head.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.840
Hopefully, trying
to think of another

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.840
place where we can do
Mexican/California food.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.580
Kind of mix not really Mexican,
because I feel like this one

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.370
is Mexican food authentic
as much as we can.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.670
But I kind of want to get
into that of like maybe--

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:01.330
I don't know, different concept
of mixing California, which

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:04.900
have European and
French, and all this.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.950
But being Mexican ingredients
based off that place.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.440
But, again, that's just
in the head right now.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.690
There is nothing that
is happening yet.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:15.460
But, yeah.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.800
AUDIENCE: The idea is
of another cookbook?

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.587
GONZALO GUZMAN: No.

00:41:20.587 --> 00:41:22.920
STACY ADIMONDO: What about
the other half of the recipes

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.920
that you mentioned?

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.616
GONZALO GUZMAN:
Oh, they're there.

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:27.136
They're in the restaurant.

00:41:27.136 --> 00:41:27.949
Oh, no.

00:41:27.949 --> 00:41:29.490
I don't think so,
but you never know.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.000
So I'm pretty open to whatever.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.125
STACY ADIMONDO: Well, and
I think the cookbook just

00:41:33.125 --> 00:41:34.420
becomes a tool.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.160
It's a conversation
starter, I think.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.247
And that's something a
lot of chefs get very--

00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:42.580
They want to have everything
be perfect with their book,

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.421
and they want to make sure
everybody covers it and what

00:41:45.421 --> 00:41:45.920
not

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.050
But I think this book
just has its own spirit

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:56.500
of communal education,
sharing, getting the word out.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.650
Gonzalo kind of spreads the love
in the book, and he's not like,

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:00.340
me, me, me.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:00.850
My food.

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:01.360
My food.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.970
It's sort of like,
this region in Mexico,

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.600
or, the people who work
with me, or just, you

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.230
should know this
about our culture.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.640
So I think the exciting thing
about the book coming out

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.710
is just that it gives
another platform

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:17.620
to talk about all this
beautiful background and story

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.540
that I think a lot of
people don't know about

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.420
and should hear.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.920
GONZALO GUZMAN:
Yeah, but it's true.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.390
I'm not really
inventing anything new.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.520
All these things, someone
is making them in Mexico.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.780
I'm just trying to make
it work for San Francisco,

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.090
and using what's around here.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.132
But, again, you see
carnitas-- and I'm not

00:42:37.132 --> 00:42:39.340
saying this is the only
place you're going to see it.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:43.000
You go to Mexico and you're
going to see all different--

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.830
what we're doing is
just the techniques,

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:48.670
and fixing little
things here and there.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:52.040
Making it just taste
better, even if possible.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.842
So that's what it's about.

00:42:54.842 --> 00:42:55.716
SPEAKER 2: All right.

00:42:55.716 --> 00:42:57.702
Well, with that,
thank you guys both.

00:42:58.202 --> 00:42:59.285
STACY ADIMONDO: Thank you.

00:42:59.287 --> 00:43:00.870
SPEAKER 2: And thank
you everyone else

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.380
for coming and joining us.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:02.980
STACY ADIMONDO: Thank you, guys.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.063
GONZALO GUZMAN: Thank you.

00:43:04.063 --> 00:43:07.230
