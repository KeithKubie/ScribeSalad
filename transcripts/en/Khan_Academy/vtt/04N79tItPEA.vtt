00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.380
Draw a circle and label the
radius, diameter, center,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.740
and the circumference.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.427
Let me draw a circle.

00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:10.260
And it won't be that
well drawn of a circle,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.468
but I think you get the idea.

00:00:11.468 --> 00:00:13.220
So that is my circle.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.300
I'm going to label
the center over here.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.210
I'll do the center.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.170
I'll call it c.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.850
So that is my center.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.240
And I'll draw an arrow there.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.530
That is the center
of the circle.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.660
And actually, the
circle itself is the set

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.680
of all points that are a fixed
distance away from that center.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.630
And that fixed distance
away that they're

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.460
all from that center,
that is the radius.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.690
So let me draw the radius.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.960
So this distance right
over here is the radius.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.190
That is the radius.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.550
And that's going to be the
same as this distance, which

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.240
is the same as that distance.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.850
I can draw multiple radii.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.930
All of these are radii, the
distance between the center

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.810
and any point on the circle.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.060
Now, a diameter just goes
straight across the circle,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.700
going through the center.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.819
From one side of the
circle to the other side,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.770
I'm going through the center.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.050
It's essentially two
radii put together.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.060
So for example, this
would be a diameter.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.702
You have one radii, than
another radii, all one line,

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:20.660
going from one side of
the circle to the other,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.340
going through the center.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.070
So that is a diameter.

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:27.990
And I could have
drawn it other ways.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.410
I could've drawn it like this.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.790
That would be another diameter.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.790
But they're going to have
the exact same length.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.340
And finally, we have to think
about the circumference.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.650
And the circumference
is really just how far

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.780
you have to go to go
around the circle.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.880
Or if you put a
string on this circle,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.770
how long will that
string have to be?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550
So what I'm tracing
out in blue right now,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.150
the length of what I'm tracing
out, is the circumference.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.790
So right over here, that
is the circumference.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.950
And we're done.
