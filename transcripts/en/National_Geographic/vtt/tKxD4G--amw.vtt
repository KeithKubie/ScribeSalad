Richard Davidson:<i> There are
 very simple ways</i>

00:00:03.268 --> 00:00:05.872
<i>of cultivating positive outlook.</i>

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:10.876
<i> When you do those simple
 kinds of practices</i>

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:14.948
<i>we've shown that both behavior
 and the brain changes</i>

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.649
<i>and it doesn't take much.</i>

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.718
( Applause )

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:22.956 line:0%
<i>There are four constituents
of well-being that have been</i>

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.525
seriously neuroscientifically
investigated.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.493
And one of the
interesting things

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.162
about each of these four is

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.530 line:0%
we understand something
about the brain circuits

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.866 line:0%
that are
associated with them

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.035 line:0%
and each of these
circuits exhibits plasticity.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:41.240
The first is resilience.
We define resilience as

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.612
the rapidity with which you
recover from adversity.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.014
And it turns out that

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:51.350
people who recover quickly
from adversity do much better.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.687
They clearly have higher
levels of well-being

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.224
and we understand
something about

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.359
the brain mechanisms
that underlie this

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.563
<i>and we can measure this in
particular neural systems.</i>

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.699
<i> The amygdala is a
 region of the brain</i>

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.637
<i>which is critical for emotion,
in particular for threat.</i>

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.472
And we can measure the
time course of activation

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:17.610
in the amygdala and it turns out
that after a certain period

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.813
of doing simple forms of
mindfulness meditation

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.917
you begin to show a
more resilient profile.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.520
The second is positive outlook.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.456
Positive outlook is
being able to see

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:33.292
the innate basic
goodness in each other.

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:37.597
And being able to savor
positive experiences.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:41.033
So that when we have a
warm hearted interaction

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.335
with a loved one,
say in the morning

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:48.274
how long does that glow last?

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.444
Does it permeate
most of your day?

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:56.616
Or does it dissipate
very quickly?

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:02.856
There are very simple ways of
cultivating positive outlook.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:07.893
There are whole group of simple,
contemplative practices

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:13.366
that focus on generating
loving kindness and compassion

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:17.403
<i>for individuals who are loved
ones, who may be suffering</i>

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:20.806
as well as for individuals
who may be strangers

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.876
people you don't really
know very well

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.978
and then even individuals
who push your buttons

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.547
who are difficult people.

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:31.450
And envisioning them
in a genuine way

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.287
and cultivating the
strong aspiration that

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:38.457
they too be relieved of
suffering and are happy

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:41.227
and enjoy well-being.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.232
When you do those simple
kinds of practices

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:50.203
we've shown that both behavior
and the brain changes

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:52.338
and it doesn't take much.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.174
We published a study just
a couple of years ago

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.343
where we did this
training online.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:01.213
This is just a very simple
form of compassion training.

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:05.084
And we see that after
two weeks of training

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:08.087
where people are practicing
for 30 minutes a day

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:13.059 line:0%
<i> people behave in a more
 pro-social way on tasks</i>

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.228 line:0%
<i>that are designed to measure
 altruistic behavior.</i>

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:20.867 line:0%
And these changes in behavior
were highly correlated

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.368
with changes in the brain.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:26.138
<i>And these are regions that are
important for positive outlook</i>

00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:28.007
<i>and they show systematic changes</i>

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.543
<i> after just two weeks
 of modest training.</i>

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:34.847
<i> The third constituent of
well-being is something that</i>

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:39.552
<i>you might not typically regard
as important for well-being.</i>

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.855
But to paraphrase a subtitle

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:46.459
of a recent, important
scientific paper

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.696
"A wandering mind is
an unhappy mind."

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:53.899
Recent evidence suggests
and this...

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:57.536
this was collected
using smartphones and

00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:00.172
probing people with text,
simple text messages

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:01.807
as they go about their day.

00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:05.344
And they ask people
three questions.

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:08.614
One is, "What are you
doing right now?"

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:11.150
And they had to just
click off on a list

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.418
and indicate what
they are doing.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:16.956
Second question is, "Where
is your mind right now?"

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.557
Is it focused on
what you're doing

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:20.259
or is it focused elsewhere?"

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.195
And the third question is,
"Right now--

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:25.798
how happy or unhappy are
you, right at this moment?"

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.367
Those are the three questions.

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:31.803
The findings from
that study revealed

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:35.107
that the average American adult

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:38.710
spends 47 percent of
her-his waking life

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.913
not paying attention to
what they are doing.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:42.114
( audience laughter )

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:44.584
Forty seven percent of the time!

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.455
I would like to invite us
to consider the possibility

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.257
that we can do better!

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:53.258
( Audience laughter )

00:04:53.792 --> 00:05:00.199
And just imagine, the
cost in human suffering

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.636
in economic terms of that
kind of distractibility.

00:05:04.636 --> 00:05:06.839
It is staggering!

00:05:08.073 --> 00:05:11.811
If there's one
body of evidence that

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.212
we really have confidence in
it's that

00:05:14.212 --> 00:05:17.649
attention indeed can be learned.

00:05:18.116 --> 00:05:20.186
And one of the ways
to think about this

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:24.957
one of the most commonly taught
forms of mindfulness meditation

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.593
involves becoming aware
of your breathing

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:31.230
<i> where you focus your
 awareness on the abdomen</i>

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.199
<i>as it's rising and falling
 when you're breathing or</i>

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.603
<i>the sensations at the tip of
your nostril. I mean this is not</i>

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:41.074
the most interesting compelling
stimulus in the world.

00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:45.177
But, if you can pay
attention to your breath

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:47.813
you can pay attention to
almost anything else.

00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:51.717
And so, this is really a very
effective form of training.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:56.289
And, when you notice your mind
has wandered, which it will

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.593
you simply gently bring it
back to the object of focus.

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:06.532
It really is about the simplest
kind of practice imaginable yet

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:11.203
it has these profound effects
on the brain and on behavior.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.073
<i>The fourth is Generosity.</i>

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:19.078
<i> There is overwhelming
scientific evidence now showing</i>

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:22.047
that acts of generosity
promote well-being

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:25.051
they activate specific
brain networks and

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:29.922
it's the single easiest way to
get these networks activated.

00:06:30.222 --> 00:06:32.258
One of the things
that we've been doing

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:37.963
is exploring the nurturing
of generosity early in life.

00:06:37.963 --> 00:06:42.334
And we've developed a curriculum
for pre-school children

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.603
<i> that we call the
 "kindness curriculum".</i>

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:46.605
<i> This is a curriculum
 that includes</i>

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:48.708
<i>both mindfulness and kindness.</i>

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.611
<i> Now, why did we choose
 pre-school kids?</i>

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:56.715
There are three major periods
of increased plasticity

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:59.652
in the brain in the
early years of life.

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.553
<i>One is right around birth.</i>

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.391
<i> The second is around
 the onset of schooling</i>

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:08.060
<i> between the ages of
 five and seven years.</i>

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.829
<i> And the third is
 around adolescence.</i>

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:14.466
<i>These are periods when the
brain is radically reorganized</i>

00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:17.736
<i> and are opportunities
 for intervention.</i>

00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:21.206
So, that's one reason why we
chose the pre-school period.

00:07:21.206 --> 00:07:25.978
The second reason is that
there are robust data showing

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:31.784
that a child's ability at
four and five years of age

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:37.590
to regulate his or her own
behavior is a strong predictor

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.161
of major life outcomes when
they are in their early 30s.

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:47.532
In fact, it's a better
predictor than IQ

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:49.468
than grade point average

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:52.505
and standardized test
scores all put together.

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:57.543
And what it predicts
in the early 30s

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:01.413
are major life outcomes.
It predicts physical health

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:04.917
it predicts the likelihood
of substance abuse.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:10.122
It predicts the likelihood
of court-verified

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:14.427
criminal convictions in
large longitudinal research

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:18.697
and it also predicts
financial success

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:24.136
with very careful controls for
the socio-economic status

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.605
of the families of origin.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.607
<i> So, we have a moral
 obligation, I think</i>

00:08:28.607 --> 00:08:31.209
<i> in this culture to
 do everything we can</i>

00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:35.247
<i>to facilitate kids starting
out on a positive trajectory.</i>

00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:37.282
And one of the
things that we did

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:40.452
to assess the impact
of this curriculum is

00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:44.356
we needed to develop novel
measure of kindness

00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:47.159
and pro-social behavior
in these young kids.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:50.096
And so, we developed
what we call

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:53.265
the "Self-Other Sharing" task.
So, what is this?

00:08:53.665 --> 00:08:58.838
We chose a currency that
is valued very highly

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.139
among pre-school children.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:01.941
( Audience laughter )

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.309
Stickers.

00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:07.579
And what we did is something
incredibly simple.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:09.582
<i>We gave the kids two envelopes.</i>

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:14.186
<i>One envelope we had a picture of
themselves which is not on here.</i>

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:15.787
<i> And another envelope
 we had pictures</i>

00:09:15.787 --> 00:09:17.223
<i>of different kinds of kids.</i>

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:20.526
And we did socio-metric
ratings in each classroom

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:24.163
and we found out who each
child's best friend was, and

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:27.366
we found out who each child's
least favorite person was.

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:29.434
And then we also
had a picture of

00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:32.771
an obviously sick looking
child, which is shown here

00:09:32.771 --> 00:09:34.940
and we also had a
picture of a child

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.608
that we call the stranger child

00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:38.511
who the child had
never seen before.

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.747
And then we gave them a bunch of
stickers each time and we said

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.116
"Please place the
stickers in the envelopes

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:46.218
<i> according to who you'd
 like to give them to.</i>

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:48.353
<i> You can keep as many
 for yourself</i>

00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:50.623
<i>or you can give them to others."</i>

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.959
<i> What we found is
 the kids who were</i>

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.894
<i> randomly assigned to the
 kindness curriculum</i>

00:09:55.894 --> 00:10:01.033
showed more pro-social behavior,
more kindness on this task

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:05.604
than the kids who were receiving
the standard curriculum.

00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:09.074
And actually the sad fact is
that at least in the classrooms

00:10:09.074 --> 00:10:12.711
that we studied over the
course of the pre-school year

00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:14.513
kids who get the
standard curriculum

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:19.251
become increasingly selfish
as the year goes along.

00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:25.357
We also gave them other metrics
that measure self-regulation.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.327
And one of those metrics
is something that

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:31.430
many of you have probably
heard about before

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.967
which is a measure of the
delay of gratification.

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:40.406
And it turns out that a child's
ability to delay gratification

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.042
at four and five years of age
is one of the

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:46.912
strongest predictors of
these adult life outcomes.

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:49.548
And I'd like to just show
you a little video clip

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:51.950
that illustrates these
original experiments

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.819
for how it was originally done.

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:58.189
Okay, so here's the deal.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.859
Here's a marshmallow.
You can either wait

00:11:00.859 --> 00:11:02.928
and I'll bring you back another
one, so you can have two.

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:04.296
Or you can eat it now.

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:05.431
So, you can eat it now

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:07.566
or you can wait and I'll
bring you back two, okay?

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:10.602
Okay, I'll be back.

00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:14.006
( instrumental jazz music )

00:12:22.974 --> 00:12:26.378
( instrumental jazz music )

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:29.848
-Careful.
-Miss?

00:12:29.848 --> 00:12:31.083
Oh, what happened?

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:34.252
Oh, okay.

00:12:34.652 --> 00:12:38.090
( instrumental jazz music )

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:02.614
Oh, how good! You waited.

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:04.116
You get two!

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.218
Woman: Good job! ( clapping )

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.220
You can eat it.

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:12.424
You can eat it now.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.131
( Audience laughter )

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.900
Okay, very important skill

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.138
and it turns out that although
kids differ dramatically

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:28.339
as you can see in
their behavior

00:13:28.339 --> 00:13:31.676
this can be changed and
this can be learned.

00:13:31.943 --> 00:13:33.011
Thank you very much.

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.047
( Applause )
