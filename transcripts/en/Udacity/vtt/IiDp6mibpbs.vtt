00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.878
Here's a different type of problem that we can solve using the Pythagorean

00:00:02.878 --> 00:00:07.740
Theorem. A rectangle is three inches longer than it is wide. If the diagonal of

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.861
the rectangle is 15 inches long, what are the rectangle's length and width? Try

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:17.623
labeling this diagram with the appropriate expressions and then see if you can

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:22.091
solve for the length and the width. When you're entering in the length, the

00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:25.713
length will be the longer side or the longer dimension. And the width will be

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:27.830
the shorter one. Good luck here.
