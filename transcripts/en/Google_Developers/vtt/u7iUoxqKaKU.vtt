JENNIFER GOVE: Hello everyone.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.070
How are you all?

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.135
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:04.010
JENNIFER GOVE: Great.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.440
Such a wonderful crowd.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.960
Thank you so much for all
coming to my talk today.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.420
So my name is Jenny Gove and
I'm a User Experience Researcher

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.690
here at Google.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.960
I've been at Google, now,
this month, for 10 years,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.590
and I heard that
that coincides--

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.090
[CLAPPING]

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.833
Thank you.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.500
I heard that that coincides
with the number of years we've

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.825
been having I/O conferences.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:32.259
So, double anniversary,
that's really fun.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.200
So, this afternoon,
we're going to be talking

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.380
about developing great apps
and creating principles

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.280
of mobile app design that
I want to share with you,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.630
so that you can create great
experiences for your users.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.310
And why is this important?

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.160
Well, it's important
because there

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.170
are-- sorry-- there are over 1.5
million apps in each of the app

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.090
stores, as we know.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.750
So there's a lot of
competition out there,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.739
and you don't want your app to
suffer from usability flaws.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.170
I think usability flaws
and user experience issues

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.066
can contribute to the lack of
engagement that some apps have.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:17.680
So, for example, we've learned
that things like 25% of apps

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.810
sometimes don't get used more
than once, and 34% of apps

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.980
aren't opened more
than 11 times.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.840
So there's these
statistics that are around,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.460
with regard to app
engagement and re-engagement.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.180
We're doing a lot of work
on that issue, itself,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.530
at Google, with certain products
that we're bringing out.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.350
But I think it's also
on us to really work

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.920
on our user experience and our
usability issues in our apps.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.250
So I'm going to
tell you about three

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.790
things in the rest of my talk.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.560
I'm going to tell you a
story about an experience I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.500
had with an app recently.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.570
I'm going to tell
you about a study

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.990
that we ran to understand
what makes a really great app

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.410
experience.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.110
And I'm going to go through
some of the principles

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.990
that we have published online,
so that you can understand

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.560
some key things that you
can do to make your app

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.760
experience better.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.300
And within those
principles, I've

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.750
got a number of
resources for you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.170
as well that can help
you along the way.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.370
So my story.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.670
While I was on vacation
with my family--

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.970
here we are, we're having a
wonderful time in Florida.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.110
That's me and my
partner and my kids.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.510
And, before we
went on vacation, I

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.780
set up a series of
hotels for us to stay at.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.300
It was a self-driving tour and
I pre-booked these-- I did that

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.200
on my laptop.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.160
When I got to Florida, I
found that a lot of hotels

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.560
had started making great use
of new technologies-- apps

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.580
specifically-- in
order to give me

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.160
some really seamless
experiences on my trip.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.370
They do things now like
enabling me to check in,

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.980
before I get there-- so just
like I can for an airplane--

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.000
and enabling me to go straight
up to my room in order to open

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.260
the door, just with the app.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.280
That's pretty cool, I was pretty
blown away by these new things

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.660
that they were able to do.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.300
But, what happened when
I was on vacation was,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.480
the notification
to check in came

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.440
while I was standing
in line at something

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.695
like this, the roller
coaster at the theme park.

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:25.410
It asked me, did I
want to check in?

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.670
And it also asked me, did I
want to choose my own room,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.890
or did I want to let
them choose for me?

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.446
Well, back when I
booked, I remember

00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:38.460
there was a text field,
and it had asked me

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.540
if I'd got any
requests, and I put in

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.360
that I wanted to have
a sea view, because I

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.340
knew at the next hotel there was
this beautiful, pristine beach.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.270
I'd ordered a room
with a balcony

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.320
and I really wanted this
wonderful experience,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.140
looking out over the sea.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.700
But I didn't know whether
that experience on the laptop

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.050
would translate into
this app experience

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.220
that I was now faced with.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.110
I was a bit
concerned about that.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.430
And I thought that I might
have a better opportunity

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.580
of choosing my own room,
rather than letting

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.590
them choose for me.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.790
Kind of always better to take
it into your own hands, right?

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.160
So, I decided to choose my
own room, and the experience

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.660
that they gave me was pretty
good on a mobile device.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.670
It actually worked.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.410
I know this looks like it would
be quite challenging in terms

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.510
of real estate, but
it worked quite well.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.540
They clearly laid out
the different rooms

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.850
and they clearly labeled whether
the rooms were taken or open.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.070
There was only one
problem, though,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.450
and that was I had no idea
which way the hotel was facing,

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.610
in front of the sea.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.980
So, I was in line, and
trying to figure out

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.430
how I could solve this.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.730
Now there were some workarounds
that I didn't actually

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.120
think of at the time.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.940
Things like going to
look on Google Maps,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.470
maybe I could figure out,
or looking on Google Images.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.980
In this case, the hotel
is rather symmetrical,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.240
so, it would be quite tricky.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.210
I decided to use a kind of
rule of thumb-- or heuristic--

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.250
and I decided to think that, the
side with the most taken rooms

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.210
was probably the side
that was facing the sea.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.100
So, I decided to choose
room 730, over here.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.080
So we got to the hotel,
took up all our bags,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.440
you know what's going
to happen, don't you?

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.470
I got a view that looked
a little bit like this.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.560
Big disappointment.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.980
So what did I have to do then?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.780
Well I had to then go
all the way down, again,

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.210
to reception--
which I thought I'd

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.320
bypassed, by using the app--
and talked to the receptionist.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.650
They were extremely helpful,
lovely hotel, fixed it

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.770
for me, and in the end, we went
back up, a different floor,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.480
went in the hotel,
and I got a view

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.420
that was much more like this.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.369
Beautiful, huh?

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:56.410
This is actually Florida.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.320
It looks like the
Bahamas or something.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.950
It was really, really nice.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.180
So the in-person
guest service was

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.170
required-- human
intervention was required--

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.230
because the app hadn't
really delivered

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.910
the service I'd hoped it would.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.750
It had done so
well, I was really

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.230
taken with this new
technology I could use,

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.170
but it fell short, because
it hadn't delivered

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.440
this critical piece of
information for me, which

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.820
was, I just needed some
information on the map.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.120
In this case, I just needed
a view of the ocean, perhaps

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.830
a few waves.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.123
I just needed some orientation.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.900
So for me, it was
pretty critical

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.630
that my view was of
this beautiful beach,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.680
rather than this carpark.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.460
And it could have been
even more critical

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.200
than my very dear
to me vacation.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.620
It could have been an event
manager booking for a client,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.910
perhaps it could have been
people booking for guests

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.035
for a wedding or something.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.370
One lesson is clear,
and that's how

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.660
we, as developers
and designers, really

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.876
need to understand
the whole flow

00:07:05.876 --> 00:07:07.250
that our users
are going through,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.470
and where that breaks down.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.080
This had been really
cool, new technology,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.470
but I'd had to sort of backtrack
through the whole thing

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.240
and do those things that
the app was supposedly

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.950
saving me from doing.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.930
So really understanding
that experience

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.820
from beginning to end.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.960
And, I think on mobile, it's
really those little things

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.560
that we don't realize
we need to cover,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.950
and so that's why we
really need to understand

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.110
the user's perspective and the
user's experience with that.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.370
So, my talk is going to
be about things like that

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.950
and how we can fix them.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.380
Let me give you
a little history.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.410
A couple of years ago, we
found that a lot of experiences

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.000
on the mobile web were
particularly problematic

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.940
for people.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.330
And so, we conducted
a large study

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.650
and tried to understand
where things weren't being

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.130
implemented right
for the mobile web,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.330
and where we could
do better, and we

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.820
released a set of 25
principles for the mobile web.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.060
Those have done really well.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.880
People have used them as
a kind of initial step

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.470
in making a good foray into
providing a better user

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.560
experience on the mobile web.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.070
But as well as those
have done, we've

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.620
had people come
back to us and said,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.830
this is great for the
mobile web, but my app.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.990
What about my app?

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.770
Can you tell me about my app?

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.930
So I've had lots of calls
to do another study,

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.430
and a study on apps, so
that's what we've done.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.200
More recently, we've looked
at native apps in a study.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.970
And so the principles I'm
going to present to you today

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.419
are the result of that work.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.850
So in this study, we've been
able to understand patents that

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.960
lead to poor user
experiences, and then, luckily

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.200
and happily, we were able to
see where some companies have

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.190
implemented things
in a better way,

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.590
and understand why those
patents work better,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.670
and bring those to you as well.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.960
And it's important to us for us
to really understand this well,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.269
so that we can be
confident in the principles

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:03.810
that we're telling
you about, and you

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:09.140
can be confident in implementing
them in your own products.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.090
So in order to do this study,
we partnered with a company

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.500
called AnswerLab.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.240
They're a user experience
consultancy based

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.630
in San Francisco.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.490
And we partnered with
them because they

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.290
could help us scale,
because we wanted the study

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.250
to be pretty large scale.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.420
We studied interaction on
100 different apps on mobile.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.080
So these ranged from
large retailers,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.560
through to smaller
service providers.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.620
We looked at news apps, we
looked at many different sorts

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.080
of services, like
grocery services,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.390
travel services, retail,
small and big companies.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.550
We didn't look at
games as part of this,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.520
and that was on purpose, because
we felt that would weaken,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.027
or dilute, the principles.

00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:55.110
We think games probably
have a whole different set

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.960
of principles, so
aside from that,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.790
we looked across a wide
range of verticals.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.610
And we conducted these studies
in San Francisco, in Chicago,

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.170
and New York City.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:15.310
Now, there were 103 participants
that took part in this study.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.550
So, for a usability
study, that's really big.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.230
They came into the
lab, individually,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.020
each for 90 minutes.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.440
So that makes 155 hours
of usability studies.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.930
So, if you stayed up
all night and all day,

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.710
that would be almost a week,
with no breaks, or, in reality,

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:40.480
it's more like almost four
weeks of working weeks.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.410
So, a large study,
indeed, and that's

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.920
so that we could cover
these different verticals.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.880
And what did we
do in this study?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.490
Well, people came
into the study,

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.770
and during the 90
minutes, they were

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.570
able to use around
six apps for really

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.270
getting into some good
tasks for each of those.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.450
They brought in their
own phones with them,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.050
and that was because
we wanted them to be

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.360
really familiar with the phone.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.110
And we didn't want any
problems because it

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.734
was a different
device, or they weren't

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:10.250
used to the back button,
or anything like that.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:16.020
So we had about 50% on
Android, and 50% on iOS.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.780
And then, what did we do
when they were in the study?

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.890
So, we had different tasks
and different scenarios set up

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.160
for them.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.350
We did our best to make that
task kind of mean something

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.930
to them, as well, so that they
couldn't do, what we call,

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.490
satisficing, which
is just kind of doing

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.790
the task as soon as they
can, and in as quick a way

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.340
as they can.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.310
We wanted them to
care about the task.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.670
So we often talked to them about
things that they cared about.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.370
In this example, we
might talk to them

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.420
about their favorite
food and understand

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.110
what it is from them,
first, before then going

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.300
to ask them to see if
they could order it

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.180
for dinner that evening.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.570
And we had them
speak out loud using,

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.840
what's called in
usability terminology,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.120
think-aloud protocol,
and we did that

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.980
so that we could understand
the pain points that they

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.800
hit as they were going
through the different tasks

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.290
that they were
doing, and we could

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:14.680
understand where things flowed
really smoothly for them.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.810
So having done that, we took the
data-- there was a lot of data,

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.110
as you can imagine, from that
much usability material--

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.320
and we've collated it
down to 25 principles,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.570
so that this is something that
you can take, and understand,

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.120
and apply it to your own apps.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.940
We've categorized the
principles into six chapters,

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.160
but before I go
into them, I want

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.130
to explain how we
actually got to these 25.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.170
So, in order to make it
into the 25 principles,

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.230
we had to see that this was
a problem across a wide range

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.940
of verticals, and we
had to see that it

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.830
was a fairly common problem.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.650
We did encounter more
things than 25 things that

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.589
were problematic in
apps, but we wanted

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:01.880
to make sure that we were
hitting the biggest problems,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.020
and that we also saw
better ways that these

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.010
could be implemented.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:06.840
OK.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.175
So, the different
chapters that we have

00:13:10.175 --> 00:13:13.940
are around app navigation
and exploration,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:21.580
in app search, commerce and
conversions, registration,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:27.510
form entry, and usability
and comprehension.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.270
Now, we've got 25 of these
different principles,

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.210
but here, in this talk, I'm just
going to go into two principles

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.270
from each of the chapters,
and the rest of the principles

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.360
are available to you online.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.120
I've also pulled together
some resources for you

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.440
that can help with
implementation of some

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.390
of the things you see here.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.780
That might be a good time to
take a picture of the screen,

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.310
as it's a resource that you
can look into in your own time,

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.300
in more detail.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.810
OK, so let's starts off with
app navigation and exploration.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.530
So this chapter is really about
guiding users to the content

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.490
that they're looking
for, quickly.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.140
So we brought together
a set of key principles

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.040
to help you create effective
and delightful app navigation.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.430
So let's take a look
at two of these now.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.530
So, a feature that can be
really of great help to users

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.280
is auto detection of
location, but don't

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.790
assume that the location-based
task is necessarily

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.960
based in their current
location, without exception.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.760
I think we saw this too often.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.720
So it's a really
great thing to be

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.000
able to implement
and help create

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.070
a seamless experience for users
when they want something that's

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.680
located where they
are, but basically, we

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.530
saw it over-applied without
a way of enabling people

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.370
to change that location.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.430
So in this example, somebody
is looking for a hotel tonight,

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.100
and they're looking for a
hotel near where they are.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.750
And, unfortunately, while
they can change location,

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.070
the only way to do it is
probably go through settings.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.460
We saw this problem in,
not only travel apps,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.950
but we saw it also
in retail apps.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.080
We saw use cases of people
wanting to find something

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.776
in a store, but that
perhaps was located

00:15:16.776 --> 00:15:18.400
near where their
parents live, and they

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.390
wanted to figure out if it
was in the store near them,

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.840
so that they could tell
their parents about that.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.910
So just only providing
this, basically we

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.740
we're seeing too
many use cases that

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.540
were outside of the scenario.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.250
In travel, we saw it
where people would turn up

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.336
for their transportation, and
the hotel that they wanted

00:15:38.336 --> 00:15:40.710
to book was at the other end--
the other end of the train

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.150
line, and they had time
now to book the hotel,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.030
but they're not in the
place where they're

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.190
needing the hotel at the time.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.360
A much better
scenario is to still

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.080
enable people to use
their current location,

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.900
but to provide the resource
for them to change that well.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.120
So basically, great, great
technology here, that I

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.390
definitely encourage you to use,
but it's kind of over-applied,

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.140
without using some of
the screen real estate

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.970
to enable them to
change location.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.100
If you do want to use that
auto detecting location,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.390
then Google Places
API enables you

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.244
to discover that currently
supported location,

00:16:19.244 --> 00:16:20.660
and we've got a
short link for you

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.120
there to get to that material.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.200
So, another aspect of app
navigation and exploration

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.660
that we saw a fair bit
with apps is, moving people

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.130
from the app to the mobile web.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.840
And you can see in
the way I've written

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.000
this principle that there
are issues with doing this.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.779
It says, where app-to-web
transitions are needed,

00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:45.820
so where they are needed,
make them frictionless.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.690
So I think the idea here is, are
they really needed in each case

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:51.630
for doing it?

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.120
We're trying, here at
Google, to make technologies

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.890
to make this a lot smoother,
this transition where you need

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.300
to do it, but at
the moment, we still

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.950
see at least some sort
of performance hit.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.220
So, really consider
whether you have

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.819
to push people out
to the mobile web

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.660
when they're in their
app experience right now,

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.540
and then make them frictionless.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.040
So, in this example,
we've got somebody

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.410
who's checking in for a flight.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.750
This can be a quite
usual situation

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.060
where people are moved
out to the mobile web.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.869
But what we often saw, are
not just in travel apps,

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:27.140
in other scenarios, as
well, we saw the experience

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.900
change fundamentally.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.700
So we saw something like this.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.510
OK?

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.310
And it can sometimes
happen, I think,

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.950
because of the organizational
structure of teams.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.660
You know, this is the app team,
and this is the mobile web

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:44.290
team, and they haven't
been talking enough, right?

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.120
So I think some companies are
doing a better job of bringing

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.610
these teams together to
enable them to plan the user

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.680
experience, the look and feel,
and how content is laid out.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.250
And then, separating out for
the actual implementation

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.980
on different platforms.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.070
So, a much better
experience is when

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.470
companies have been really
thoughtful about this

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.930
and you can make that look
and feel very seamless, even

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:15.460
though you're just moving
right out to the mobile web.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.750
On Android, we're doing
some work on this,

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.370
and we've got some technology
called Chrome Custom

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.280
Tabs that you should look into.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.700
It's really helpful
for enabling you

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.020
to do things like changing
the toolbar color,

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.790
and exit and enter
animations, to make

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.780
that whole process of
moving from that app

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.260
to the mobile web more seamless.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.640
Moving on to the
second chapter, here.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.800
So, the importance of
great in app search

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.320
really can't be underestimated.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.190
So, let's talk about a couple of
crucial search implementations.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.760
So, prominently displaying
the search field.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.880
We found this back when we
did the mobile web study,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.480
about the importance of search.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.750
So, on the poorer
example, we have

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.840
search in a place where
people expect to look for it,

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.450
but it's not how they expect
to find it, as a piece of text,

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.950
here.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.680
What we saw in the
study was people kind of

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.120
did have some frustration
looking around for search.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.560
Sometimes it was
hidden under a menu,

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.310
and it sounds like one of
the most obvious things,

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.860
but I think what my summary
of what I saw in the study,

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:29.380
was that developers and
designers aren't implementing

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.550
a persistent search
field enough.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.040
We advise that a persistent
search field should be included

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.360
when searches are really
quite a significant part

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.280
of your experience
in your app, but I

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.450
think what's happening
is plenty of people

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.800
are thinking that search
is important, but not

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.230
that important to devote
the screen real estate to.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.130
So, check that out in your app.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.940
Should you be giving it more
prominence than you currently

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.480
are?

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.160
So we have advice on
this, in Material Design.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.170
And we have persistent search,
putting in a search field,

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.190
and we also have
expandable search, where

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.770
we have the looking
glass icon that can be

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.730
expanded for search, of course.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.980
Think about the prominence
of search in your app,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.200
and how much it really
matters to people when you're

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.400
making that decision
about which type of search

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.710
you should implement.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.950
And then, for
implementation details,

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.400
we have the search dialog
and the search widget,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.005
and this link will take you to
more information about that.

00:20:30.005 --> 00:20:32.710
And what about filter
and sort options?

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.130
Hugely important.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.850
Again, we often saw that they
were hidden, or sort of buried,

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.910
or further down, and
people couldn't get to them

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.090
as much as they needed.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.390
That's what our study, that
we just did recently, showed.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.760
We did see great
implementations of it,

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.570
but still, there's
more work to be done.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.830
Things like getting down
to 242 results for a shirt,

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.330
with no way to filter
or sort them further.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.950
So, a better
implementation is to have

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.460
a really nice, clear button.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.240
Filter.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.660
People can see that
quite clearly and easily.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.240
And then, this
example, for apparel,

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.530
you have this panel sliding
out with all the right sorts

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.340
of search options for them.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.630
So you could sort by best
match, latest collection,

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.455
that kind of thing.

00:21:16.455 --> 00:21:19.580
One thing I saw with
filters like this was,

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.420
some companies were taking,
for example, the sizing away,

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.492
when the inventory
wasn't available,

00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:27.200
and that caused a
problem for the people,

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.560
because they didn't
know if they would ever

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.200
have their size in stock.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.080
So imagine extra small
being taken away,

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.020
just because it wasn't
in stock, people

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.520
didn't know if it'd come back.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.510
Better experience for that is
something like enabling them

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.300
to, perhaps sign up to find out
when it is back in stock stock,

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.390
but certainly showing it, and
showing it in a stable state

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.390
is good.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.130
So here you have colors, and
price, and one other thing

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.020
I like about this design is
it's very clear when you're

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.320
clearing the filters, or
applying the filters, and then

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.500
a separate check at the top
in order to close the panel,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.840
so that there's not confusion
about what closing the panel

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.310
does.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.850
So, keeping on this
topic of search,

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:16.240
we have other methods that will
help people with their search.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.340
One of those is Adding
Custom Suggestions.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.270
That can be created from
data in your application,

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.370
so that can really help
people with their search.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.290
And another one is
Recent Query Suggestions.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.640
So all these technologies
and facilities

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.340
can go to make that
search experience better.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.450
So thinking through that
search experience in more depth

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.040
is a good topic.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.810
Commerce and conversions.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.750
So users expect a
really smooth in app

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:49.210
experience for finding, learning
about, and purchasing products.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.910
So let's look at
a couple of things

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.440
that the study revealed about
commerce and conversions,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.350
and helping to drive that
conversion experience.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:02.540
So, enabling comparison
shopping features.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.770
So in this example, on
the left here, we're

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.460
in a real estate
app, here, and people

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.320
are just-- they're only
able to scroll down and look

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.730
at the different homes.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.790
Anything they like, they have
to commit to memory, and people,

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.850
us, you and me, we're
all cognitive misers,

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.960
we don't like to use our
brains that much, really.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.620
And we're making the user
use their brain a lot

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.840
here, remembering where they
saw things and so forth.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.540
But we can do better,
and some of those things

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.920
that we saw that were
implemented to help people

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.030
in this way we're letting
people kind of bookmark items

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.350
that they saw, so that
they can compare them.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.450
It's still pretty difficult
on mobile to do this,

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.890
but still, anything
we can do helps.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.780
So the example I'm
going to show you here

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.320
had enabled people to compare.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.290
And then, you can see
it's quite constrained,

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.030
with the size of the
phone, but still, you're

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.860
bringing that
information together.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.330
It means they could ignore
all the other homes that they

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.410
didn't care about, and they
can compare the bedrooms,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.130
they can compare the bathrooms,
the cost of the home,

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.490
and so forth.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.330
We know this is needed,
because, in the study,

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.120
we saw people do
workarounds for this.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.970
So, in retail, we saw people
add items to their cart,

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.110
just so that they could look
at them all in the same place.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.210
And that was the users
that thought about doing

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.790
that, other people struggled.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.130
So we know this is needed.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.250
So think about the comparisons
and the browsing experience

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.308
that people are needing
within your app.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.710
And then, making it easy to
add and manage payment methods.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.380
I actually came across a poor
example of this the other day,

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.755
and it was when I
went to purchase--

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.780
I was going on vacation, again.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:57.850
I like to go on vacation--
and I was making a reservation

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.510
for a rental home.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.110
And I got to the point where
I needed to update my card,

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.820
so my model in my head was,
well, a new card had arrived,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.350
and it's simply the
same card as before,

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.780
it just had a new date on it.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.740
In my mind, my mental model of
my cards, that's the same card,

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.150
just needs replacing, it's
not a new payment method.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:24.070
So I expected to be able
to edit my existing card,

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.980
but there was no
facility to do that.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.820
So I kind of had to understand
the developer's model

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.750
that I needed to add
a new payment method.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.110
In this example,
the person has got

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.300
to the point where they're
supposed to be checking out,

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.370
but there's no way to edit
a card, or add a new card.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.040
That's somewhere else,
in some other settings.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.980
But most of us don't
think, well, I'm

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.730
going to wake up in
the morning and think,

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.470
I need to manage my payment
methods in that app.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.500
Kind of is a separate
activity, right?

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.500
We tend to think about
it when we need to do it,

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.040
when we come to pay.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.990
So, this is a problem here.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.400
So, in this example,
it's much better.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.990
There's an option to
edit existing cards,

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.540
to add a new payment method.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.380
And provide multiple payment
methods here, and lead people

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.260
to a very clean
form design, here,

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:23.080
when the user has chosen
to add a new credit card,

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.600
and they can even scan
their card if they wish to.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.860
So making that experience
nice and clean.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.860
Now, one facility that
we offer at Google

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.950
is Android Pay, so making that
a choice of one of the ways

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:40.390
to pay.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.090
The idea, here, is it's
really simple for the user

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.940
and seamless for the user
to pay through Android Pay,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.630
and I think there's a
talk about it here at I/O,

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:53.620
and there's more information
that you can get at this link.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.930
So registration.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.530
Registration is really popular
with companies and developers,

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.180
because it's seen
to be that that

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.710
is where we can get
engagement from the user,

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.140
and that's kind of where
the user commits to us.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.390
We've known for a long time that
providing these registration

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.540
barriers up front can be a big
hurdle for people to get to,

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.730
and it's better to offer
them something first,

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:21.330
so that they can start to feel
engagement from their side,

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.274
to the company.

00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:24.690
There's a couple
of other things I

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.930
want to talk about today
with regard to registration.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.760
So we saw users struggle with
signing in and signing up.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.750
It's a tricky thing, right?

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.420
We often saw users starting
to fill out a form,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.890
if they were provided
one, and realizing they

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.630
were signing in when they were
supposed to be signing up,

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:42.920
and vice versa.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.530
It's probably
happened to all of us.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.670
So we found better
experience when

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:52.540
people were just given the
option to sign in, or register.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.260
The words were very different,
they could differentiate them,

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.170
and then we could channel them
down the right kind of route,

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.340
so that they didn't
get into that muddle.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:09.570
We have lots of solutions
for registration and identity

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.090
at Google.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.960
We have a whole
identity platform

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.440
that I'd encourage
you to look at.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.300
It's basically an
auth system, and it

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.690
has several components and
different choices for you

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.670
to make.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.930
So one of these is
Sign-in for Android.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.630
It enables the user to sign
in with the same credentials

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.530
that they use on Google.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.610
The whole intent is to
make that process more

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.410
seamless and simple for them.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.430
And talking of that,
there's other ways

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.860
to make password authentication
a frictionless experience.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.340
We've all been in this
situation, where it just

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.940
doesn't work for us, and
it's quite painful on mobile

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.810
to keep putting your password
in and it's not working.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.460
It can be even worse in
apps, because we often

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.990
found that this was a place
where people were sent back

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.870
out to the mobile web, right?

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.770
So then, you're in
that loop again,

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.170
and that's even
more aggravating.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.270
So we've talked
about one solution

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.920
for easing enabling
people to sign in.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.860
Another one that we saw that's
becoming much more popular

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:14.320
is fingerprint sign
in, and, in our study,

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.940
people were pretty
happy about this.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.130
They liked the idea
very much of doing this,

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.160
so I think this is a
good thing to look into.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:27.210
And we have some more
implementation details for you,

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.625
here, by using fingerprint
scans on supported devices.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:39.410
And Smartlock is another
part of our identity system.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.650
It enables you to automatically
sign users in to the app,

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.990
using credentials
that they've saved.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.010
So that's another
really good one,

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.560
part of this federated
identity provision.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.000
And, if you haven't got
that far with users,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.650
there's also a Sign-in
Hints, and this allows

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.950
us to use the credentials API.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.680
It enables you to give hints
to the user for signing in,

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.200
for their username
and email address.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:12.520
Everything is done to kind
of ease that sign-in hurdle.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.040
So form entry.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.320
We've been talking in
design about form entry

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.290
for years and years.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:23.990
We did lots of work on
form entry for desktops,

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.730
and when we went
to the mobile web,

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.490
we kind of had to relearn
all about again and again.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.370
You'll remember when those forms
used to be really, really tiny,

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.780
and you have to expand
them to fill out the form.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.740
It's always been a little
bit better with apps,

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.330
because we've been
designing forms

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.780
from the get-go for
the mobile devices.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.010
But, I'm pleased to say, I
think we've come a long way,

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.480
but there are still things
we saw in our study that

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.320
could be improved.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.920
So I've categorized this under
building user friendly forms,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.940
and some of the
things I saw was still

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.960
some apps requiring users to
do a lot of work on their part.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.290
Putting that cursor in
several different fields

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.660
for their phone numbers,
and things like this,

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.390
takes a lot of effort
on the part of the user.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:10.800
And also, not paying out to see
what form fields were coming up

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.970
was a problem for users.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.670
It was hard for them
to sort of build

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.710
their mental model of what they
would have to fill in next.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.350
It caused them frustration
and was definitely a friction

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.664
point.

00:31:22.664 --> 00:31:26.990
So, better engagement,
here, is doing more work

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.130
on the back end.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:32.780
So, whether the user wants
to write in their phone

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.360
number with dashes in
between the numbers,

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.300
with spaces in
between the numbers,

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.740
or it's just one long field,
we need to cater for that

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.420
and make it-- it's a
little bit more work for us

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.460
on the development
side, but it makes

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.120
it a whole lot
easier for the user

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.680
to understand what
they're doing,

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.780
and not get an error returned.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.580
So also, where there are
errors, providing those inline

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.770
is really helpful.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:00.400
And here we have
an app that does

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.760
a really good job of moving
the form up the field

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.070
as the user fills
it in, and we found

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.356
that was very
advantageous to users.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.560
So, we have a lot of information
on creating great text fields

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.260
through Material Design.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.550
Talks a lot about
the different aspects

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.185
of creating a good form.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.980
And, specifically for places,
we can use Places Autocomplete

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.400
as part of the
Places API, again,

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.420
and this can really help
for filling in those form

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.814
fields that require location.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.410
Another aspect of form design
is matching the keyboard

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.420
with the required text inputs.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.260
This is a fairly
well-known thing to do,

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.700
but we still saw significant
apps not doing this well.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.260
So when the users put their
cursor in the credit card

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.340
field, and if you've
got this in your app,

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.350
you should check it out, is it
doing the right thing, right?

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.720
In this example, here, it's
not doing the right thing.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.170
The user is left
with this keyboard,

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:07.290
and they don't have any way of
getting the right keyboard up.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.810
Not usually, they hit the
number key over here and then

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:14.290
they'll get the keyboard with
the numbers along the top,

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:18.270
as opposed to designing
that appropriately,

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.930
and once the cursor is
in there, bringing up

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:27.780
the numeric keyboard for them.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.550
So little things like this, all
these little things on forms

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.750
really add up, and just
checking out your form design

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.190
in this way is really
helpful for people.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.870
So we've got information
on Specifying Input Method

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:43.490
Type, and the correct keyboard,
that you can find at this link.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.570
Then lastly, let's look at
usability and comprehension.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.890
These are those small
things that you can do,

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:57.260
that we saw in our studies,
throughout the app,

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.760
to make a more seamless
experience for users.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.680
It can be critical for
ensuring a good user experience

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.830
and not having users get stuck,
or abandon their experience,

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.139
at any point.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:14.820
This one's about providing
text labels and visual keys

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.219
to clarify visual information.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:18.570
So, we saw this earlier.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:22.300
In my story, I was specifically
missing a visual key.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.429
I just needed those
waves in the picture

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:30.080
to help me understand the
orientation of the hotel.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.560
Take a look at
this example, here.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.280
Just take a couple of moments
and decide for yourself

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.934
what you think those
icons represent.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.800
Some of them, perhaps
more obvious than others.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.120
Should we have a
look at the answers?

00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:02.260
Here we go, so, it's my trips,
book, club, and account.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.644
Did anyone get them right?

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:10.210
I think probably
account wasn't too bad,

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:13.560
but, the lesson here,
that we saw, is again,

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.870
I think it's over-generalizing.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:21.470
The rule that we would give
is when icons are vague,

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.650
then they definitely
need text labels.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.430
The trouble is in
saying when icons

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.520
are vague is, we all
have different levels

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.720
of understanding,
with regard that.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:36.950
You have to, I think, assume
that a lot of your icons

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.580
are going to be vague.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.020
I can give you an example.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.230
So, you know the
icon for filter,

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.660
that looks kind of like this?

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.630
You'd think that would
be fairly universal.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.450
It's drawn in quite
different ways,

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.810
across many different
apps, and we certainly

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.360
didn't find it universally
understood among people.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.200
So, I think we have to
change our kind of level

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.660
set with regard to the
number of icons in our apps

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.306
that need to have
labels, if people

00:36:05.306 --> 00:36:06.430
are going to understand it.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.030
And this is a very
great place where

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.330
you can do simple
AB testing, and see

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.730
the difference between
providing labels and not

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.800
providing labels.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.530
Here, we've got some
implementation details

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.900
for when you want to use
text and icons for buttons.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.890
So if you have that, there.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.160
And then, talking
of labeling things,

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.400
that always makes
me aware of making

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.910
my application accessible.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.520
We have lots of
guidelines here for you

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.415
to make sure your
application is accessible.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.230
And the last principle
I'm going to go into today

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.780
is asking for
permissions in context.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.500
So, this is something that
we enabled with Android M,

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.070
but we still see that
significant number of apps

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.030
aren't making advantage of it.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:58.960
It's been able to be
possible and iOS for a while

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.180
now, as well.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.050
So in this example,
the user has just

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:06.200
downloaded and open the app,
and they're immediately asked,

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.520
can their location be used?

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.300
So, perhaps this app
was suggested to them

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.230
by somebody else.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.900
They said, oh, this
is a really good app

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.960
if you want to learn
about home decor,

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.140
and it's got some really
cool things in you can buy.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.500
But it's kind of
similar to how we

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.690
would think of problematic
registration, right?

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.280
When you ask for that up front
and it's a hurdle to get over.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.720
This is the same
thing for users.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.420
It's like the developers saying,
provide me with your location

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:38.040
before I give you
anything else, right?

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.650
And users are often
going to say no,

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.316
because they don't
really understand why

00:37:41.316 --> 00:37:43.384
and they just wanted to
look around your app.

00:37:43.384 --> 00:37:46.030
So, a better way to
do that-- and you

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.130
can do that now,
because of Android M--

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.860
is being able to do that
in context at run time.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.390
In this example, we have
people searching for stores.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.690
So much better because the
user has their own motivation,

00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:59.190
right?

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.010
They want to be able
to find that store,

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.190
and then what happens next
is even more clear for them.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:09.900
There's a map that comes
up behind and it asks,

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.080
can we use you location?

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.910
Well, of course you can.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:13.790
Right?

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.820
You're much more likely
to get acceptance

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.140
if you ask in context.

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.320
We have lots of resources
for you for this.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.830
We have great little videos
and implementation details

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:28.660
about being able to request
permissions in runtime.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.810
And it's simply in
these principles,

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.580
because, although I know
many of you know about it,

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:38.010
we saw it a lot in the apps
that we studied recently, so,

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:40.550
that's why it's here.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:43.090
So that brings me to the
end of the principles I'm

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:44.881
going to go through with you.

00:38:44.881 --> 00:38:46.630
We've gone through
each of those chapters,

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.910
and you can find more of
these principles online.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.620
They're all online
at think with Google.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.230
And I made a short link
for you here, specifically

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.370
to the principles.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:02.743
Better Mobile User Experience.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.821
There's actually multiple
sets of principles.

00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:11.070
Let me tell you what there is.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.330
There's mobile app
principles, new set

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.270
of 25 mobile principles,
there's a new set

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:20.560
of 25 principles for retail--
that is both web and app,

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.050
again, we did a study,
and so we collated

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.210
the information
provided that, there--

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.250
and then there's the
mobile web principles

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.670
that we've published
previously, that you

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.000
might have already seen.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.250
All at this link, same link.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.940
And if you want more
implementation details

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.280
on the mobile website,
the principles

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.790
are also part of
our web fundamentals

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.560
site, and that particular link
I provided with you there,

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.835
provides additional developer
implementation details.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.940
Before I go, I want to
tell you about one more

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.280
story from the study.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.330
So, in the study,
a number of apps

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:03.960
that implemented the ability
to scan your credit card,

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.510
in order to pay.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:08.030
Now, we had a few
people in the study that

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:11.520
had used that before, and
come across it, and liked it,

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.880
but because this is
relatively new technology,

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.660
we had some people
that encountered it

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.260
for the first time.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.590
Now if you think about the
word scan, my most familiar

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.390
experience, I think,
with the word scan,

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.650
is when I go to the grocery
store and scan my credit card,

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:27.850
right?

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.550
And I'm putting my credit
card right next-- well,

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.230
putting it through another
machine, really, that's

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.753
scanning.

00:40:34.753 --> 00:40:37.240
Another place I know
of the word scan

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.980
is putting paper
on a photocopier.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.470
That's kind of a longer
ago, but still, that's

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.210
scanning, putting something
on top of each other.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:49.660
So the users come
to this request

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:52.010
to scan their credit card.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.930
That's their use
of the word scan,

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.187
and if you imagine them
trying to translate that,

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:57.770
often the first thing
that's asked is,

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.910
can we use your camera?

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.000
Well, is the camera
anything to do

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.370
with scanning my credit card?

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.120
Well, maybe, I don't
really understand it,

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.250
but, yeah, OK, you
can use my camera.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.630
And then, it asks you to
hold the credit card here, it

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.530
with scan automatically.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.810
OK, following the
instructions, no surprise then,

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:17.595
we saw three people
in the study do this.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:27.720
And they waited,
and they waited,

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.270
and they were
terribly disappointed,

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:34.710
because they thought it had
sounded so simple way to pay.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.990
And, this is just
about as understanding

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:41.080
what we're asking people to do,
and the language you're using.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.280
It's plain and simple usability.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.010
We'd all love this to
work, unfortunately

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:47.200
it doesn't work yet.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.460
But it makes sense, right,
what they were doing,

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.760
because of what they
were being told to do.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.890
So again, I return
to that point I

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.100
made earlier, which is
understanding the user

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.750
experience, end to end.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.290
Understanding the flow
and the pain points.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.520
Really important.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.221
Because I want you to
have an experience where

00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:11.550
you make a really good app
experience for your users.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:14.290
Not one where the
user is frustrated,

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.030
and not the kind
of frustration I

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:20.220
felt like after I'd used my app,
and gone up to my hotel room,

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.590
and seen that carpark
out of my window.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:26.530
I want you to be able to
make app experiences that

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:30.430
make people feel like life
is really frictionless, much

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.740
more like a view of the beach.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.850
And so, I want to end with
giving you three takeaways.

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:40.010
And these are three
steps that you can think

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:43.580
about doing after this talk.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.495
Taking a look at your
app and auditing your app

00:42:46.495 --> 00:42:48.880
against the 25 principles.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.360
Simply like, what are we doing
in each of these experiences,

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.900
and is it measuring up?

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.100
That's going to get
you a long, long way,

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.980
but your app is
unique, too, right?

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.990
So you have to really understand
your key user journeys,

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:06.250
and understand those
breakdown points.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.530
What I'd been provided
for my hotel app

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.410
was really exciting
to me, but I had

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:13.050
points that broke
down from me such

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:16.620
that it didn't end up
working that well in the end.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.230
And then finally, thinking about
doing your own user testing,

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.930
and this guide from
Google Ventures

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:27.630
provides lots of resources for
getting going for user research

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.200
and user testing, in a
really small scale way,

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.030
so that you can see the
good things that you provide

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.590
in the app, and celebrate those,
and also identify the pain

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:40.011
points in your app, so you can
think about how to fix them.

00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:41.010
Thank you for your time.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.860
