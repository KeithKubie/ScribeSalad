NATHAN RUNKLE: So my name
is Nathan Runkle.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.020
I'm the founder and executive
director of Mercy For Animals.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.630
And we are a national, nonprofit
animal protection

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.390
organization.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.980
And our mission is to prevent
cruelty to farmed animals, and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.330
promote compassionate food
choices and policies.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.920
So I want to talk for a few
minutes about how I got

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.910
involved in animal protection
issues.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.890
This is me in St. Paris, Ohio,
a town of about 2,000 people.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.300
I was born on a farm, come
from a long heritage of

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.800
farmers, four generations.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.500
In this photo, my father is, I
think, breaking all sorts of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.000
state and federal laws,
potentially--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.910
child endangerment.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.670
But growing up in this
environment, I always had a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.780
natural affinity and connection
for animals.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.790
I spent much of my childhood
exploring the nearby creeks

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.170
and streams and looking
at wildlife.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.670
And it was our dogs and cats
that were the first to teach

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.340
me that other creatures share
our needs and our desires,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.170
that they have curiosities,
senses of humor.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.600
And it wasn't something that
I had to study in school.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.650
But from a young age, I
witnessed the contradictory

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.570
view that we hold for animals.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.570
I saw that our family cared very
much about the dogs and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.000
cats that we had, but we did
not have the same level of

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.600
compassion or empathy or respect
for other animals.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.940
So both of my uncles
were hunters and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.440
trappers and fishermen.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.050
So from a young age, I witnessed
animals being

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.880
skinned while they were still
alive, having their heads

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.850
ripped off while they
were still alive.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.550
And most people in my social
circle did not afford those

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.230
animals much consideration.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.680
And that always felt
wrong to me.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.030
I thought that we could and
should do much better.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.940
There was a local animal
abuse case when I

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.020
was 15, so in 1999.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.540
That is what ultimately led to
me founding Mercy For Animals.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.930
And it was at a local high
school, and there was a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.680
teacher there who had an
agricultural class.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.900
And this teacher also
ran a pig farm.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.040
Now, one day he brought to
school a bucket of day-old

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.710
piglets to be used in a
dissection project.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.910
Now, these were piglets that
he had tried to kill that

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.730
morning on his farm.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.740
But when he arrived to the
school, one of the piglets was

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.340
still alive.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.480
A student in the class who also
did part-time work on the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.210
teacher's pig farm took the
piglet by her hind legs and

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.240
slammed her head-first into
the ground to try

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.800
to kill this piglet.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.590
Now, the piglet didn't die.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.880
Her skull was broken.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.990
She was bleeding out
of her mouth.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.680
She's in horrible distress.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.040
A few of the students who were
appalled by this act of abuse

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.110
took the dying piglet, left the
classroom, and took her to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.760
a teacher who was known as
being a vegetarian and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.740
sympathetic to animal cruelty.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.360
That teacher left the school,
went to a local vet office,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.800
and had the piglet euthanized.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.450
Now, following that case,
there were two counts of

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.710
animal cruelty that were filed,
one against the student

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.150
and one against the teacher.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.260
Now, the case generated a lot
of media attention and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.920
controversy in this small
farm community.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.810
And the pig farming community
rallied behind

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.770
the student and teacher.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.390
And they said, we don't want
animal advocates coming into

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.630
our town, telling us
how to do our jobs.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.250
The very first day of the trial,
the cruelty charges

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.010
were dismissed, because it's
considered standard

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.170
agricultural practice to kill
piglets by slamming them

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.870
head-first into the ground.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.240
And in Ohio, like at least 30
other states in this country,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.870
if something is considered
standard agricultural

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.090
practice, no matter how cruel
it is, it's exempt from

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.590
cruelty prosecution.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.050
So that case illustrated to me
that there needed to be a

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.580
voice for farm animals in
this community in Ohio.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.520
So since then, Mercy For Animals
has grown to having

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.240
over 100,000 members
and supporters.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.230
We have five offices
across the country.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.240
And we work to give a voice to
farmed animals in four main

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.030
areas-- through public education
campaigns, through

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.970
undercover cruelty
investigations, through

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.690
corporate outreach, and legal
advocacy efforts.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.540
All right, so there
you have it.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.740
Now, I want to start out by
talking a bit about animals

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.480
and our relationship
to animals and

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.480
why we should care.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.385
Now, Dr. Jane Goodall once said,
"we have to understand

00:04:24.385 --> 00:04:29.030
we are not the only beings on
this planet with personalities

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.500
and minds." Now as I'm sure
many of you are aware, Dr.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.510
Goodall spent about 45 years
in Africa living with and

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.380
studying chimpanzees.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.620
She was one of the first
researchers to give her

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.760
subjects names as opposed
to numbers.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.400
And she started to observe them
and find out that many of

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.380
the traits that we once held so
closely as being unique to

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.640
people are in fact not unique
and are very widespread in the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.070
animal community--

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.700
things like culture and empathy
and compassion, things

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.390
like not only using tools,
but creating tools.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.310
So Dr. Goodall started to tear
down these various boundaries.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.000
And I think looking at
this image really

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.710
illustrates it so perfectly.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.500
We know that other animals feel
cold, the cold of this

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.560
metal, the heat of the sun, that
they form relationships

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.640
and bonds, and that they, too,
deserve our consideration.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.400
Now, anyone who has shared their
homes with dogs or cats

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.220
knows this.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.420
We know how excited they are
when we come home, how eager

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.990
they are for their walks,
how playful they are.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.080
And this is, again, not
something that we had to study

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.700
animal behavior to know.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.230
And the scientific community is
finally starting to catch

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.240
up to what so many of us
have known all along.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.410
Just this year, the University
of Cambridge published the

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.310
Cambridge Declaration
of Consciousness.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.520
And essentially, this is
the first time that an

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.610
international group of prominent
scientists supported

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.370
the idea that animals are
conscious and aware to the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.590
same degree that humans are.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.330
Now, this was really
earth-shattering for this to

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.590
come out, because they found
that not only do mammals have

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.720
consciousness and dogs and cats,
but birds have the same

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.785
level of consciousness, and not
only birds, but fish, and

00:06:17.785 --> 00:06:19.570
not only fish, but octopus.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.440
So this whole notion, I think,
should give all of us pause to

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.000
really think about our treatment
of animals and our

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.230
obligation to them, and how we
can include them in our circle

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.480
of consideration and ethics.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.330
So what we do at Mercy For
Animals is help people step

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.380
back and think about farm
animals as individuals with

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.600
needs, and how we can respect
them and do due diligence in

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.410
protecting their interests.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.740
So I want to talk a little
bit about who

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.620
farmed animals are first.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.830
This is an image of the
wild ancestors of

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.040
the modern-day chicken.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.560
Now, most people just think
of chickens and

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.190
they think of barnyards.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.930
And Of course, these birds once
lived wild in the jungles

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.360
of Southeast Asia.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.190
And they lived in a world
that was very rich

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.840
with sound and color.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.110
And they lived in social groups
of about a dozen birds.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.860
And they were very active.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.910
Now, we manipulated these
animals to becoming almost

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.560
genetic Frankensteins of
what they once were.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.750
And I'll talk about that
a little bit later.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.420
But we see that, even through
hundreds or thousands of years

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.690
of domestication, these animals
still have the same

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.700
behaviors, the same desires.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.070
These are egg-laying hens that
live their entire lives in

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.350
tiny cages.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.760
And this is a photograph of them
about a month after they

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.820
were rescued.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.110
And we see that these birds
still want to perch, roost,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.960
dust-bathe.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.600
They spend the night in trees.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.690
Now, the more that we know about
birds, the more respect

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.690
we should have for them.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.760
We all know the term "the
watchful mother hen," and this

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.700
is a term that these birds
really have earned.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.470
They will give their lives
to protect their young.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.960
They have a very close bond
with their young.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.090
They actually start to chirp
and communicate with them

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.780
while they're still in the
eggs in the last few days

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.960
before hatching.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.880
We know that birds can recognize
100 other birds

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.780
based on their distinct
facial features.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.070
I think if most of us saw a
group of 100 chickens, we'd

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.280
think that they all looked
pretty similar.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.190
But to them, they look as unique
and different as each

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.940
of us do in this room to us.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.970
We know that they have
a language that

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.210
is unique to them.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.120
We know at least 30 different
calls that they have that are

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.080
unique for overhead predators
versus ground predators.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.280
They have a more intimate tone
and inflection that they use

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.039
with birds that they consider
to be their friends.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.409
We know that chickens understand
that recently

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.950
hidden objects still exist.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.860
They're not rocket science, but
this is beyond the ability

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.030
of small human children.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.070
That has led Dr. Bernard Rollin
to state, "contrary to

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.750
what one may hear from the
industry, chickens are complex

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.510
behaviorally, do quite well in
learning, show a rich social

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.600
organization, and have a diverse
repertoire of calls.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.330
Anyone who has kept barnyard
chickens recognizes their

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.330
distinct differences in
personality." And of course,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.840
anyone who has spent any time
with chickens knows that there

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.340
are some who like the attention
of people, who will

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.700
follow you around and peck at
your toes, wanting treats, and

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.100
others who would prefer
to be on their own.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.600
Now, the scientific community
is starting to catch up to

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.460
this notion.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.270
This is an illustration that
appeared in "The Washington

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.100
Post" in 2005, where the
scientific community called

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.130
for a remapping of the bird
brain, saying that about 90%

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.120
of the over-2,000 terms that
we use in referring to the

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.270
structure of a bird
brain is outdated.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.140
It needs to be reevaluated.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.030
So what we see on the right-hand
side of this

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.450
illustration is the traditional

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.520
view of a bird's brain.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.630
And we see that most of it we
thought was just used for

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.570
instinctive behaviors, that
birds were going around and

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.690
just acting by instincts, with a
very small amount being used

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.070
for cognitive behavior
or learning.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.310
But our new view, which we see
in the middle here, is that

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.960
over 75% of the bird's brain is
used for complex cognitive

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.210
behavior or learning.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.600
Now, pigs are also

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.740
intelligent, sensitive creatures.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.170
Some people say that they're
the fourth-most intelligent

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.700
creatures on the face
of the planet.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.890
We know that these animals have
strong bonds that they

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.840
also form with their young.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.490
We know that they have
a unique language.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.020
We know of at least 20 different
grunts or oinks that

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.600
they make that mean very
distinct things.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.480
And we know that they have
long-term memories.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.590
There was a study done at
Penn State University.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.870
They took a group of pigs
and they presented

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.660
them with three objects.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.680
One was a dumbbell, one was a
Frisbee, and one was a ball.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.920
And they taught the pigs to pick
up the Frisbee, to sit

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.690
next to the dumbbell, and
to jump over the ball.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.020
And they took those pigs away
for three years, without ever

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.880
seeing those objects.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.080
Three years later, they brought
them back, presented

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.030
them with the objects, and 100%
of the pigs, without any

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.950
retraining or prompting,
remembered those behaviors

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.480
that they were taught
three years before.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.820
Now, Dr. Donald Broom said,
"pigs have the cognitive

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.500
ability to be sophisticated.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.120
Even more so than dogs and
certainly three-year-olds."

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.070
He's talking about
three-year-old humans.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.420
Anyone who has children or
nieces or nephews knows just

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.520
how intelligent three-year-olds
are, how they

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.790
have a sense of humor
and curiosity.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.210
To think that that same level of
thinking is going on in the

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.390
mind of a pig should give
us all pause to

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.100
how we treat them.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.150
Now, researchers have taught
pigs how to play video games

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.810
using remote-controlled
joysticks, showing that they

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.550
understand cause and effect.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.750
Now, I have mixed feelings about
bringing an entire other

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.710
species into the video
game revolution.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.110
I think it's causing problems
for our own species.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.380
But nevertheless, there it is.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.400
And then, of course, we have
cows, I think some of the most

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.020
benevolent, peaceful creatures
on the planet.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.380
These are animals that,
again, form strong

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.710
bonds with their young.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.220
We hear story after story of
mother cows who have been

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.840
separated from their young,
not only bellowing out in

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.290
distress for days on end, but
jumping over fences and

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.590
traveling miles on end to be
relocated with their young.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.050
We know that cows have best
friends that they spend most

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.790
of their time with, and that
they show excitement when they

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.710
solve problems.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.740
And finally, I want to talk for
just a second about fish.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.820
Now, most people don't give
much thought to fish.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.160
And it's easy to really
disregard them, because they

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.140
inhabit a world that
is so different

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.900
from us, under water.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.540
They don't have the same ability
to express their

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.260
feelings through facial
features.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.640
They can't scream.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.350
But fish are not swimming
vegetables.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.320
And we know that these animals
suffer pain and fear and

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.090
distress in much the same
way that we do.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.950
They did a study where they took
fish and they injected

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.060
bee venom under their scales.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.150
And what they found is that
the fish's heart rate

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.290
elevated, that they started
swimming frantically back and

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.750
forth in the enclosure, and
rubbing that area of their

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.940
body against the enclosure.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.890
Their brains also release
natural painkillers.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:17.640
And they release oxytocin, our
natural feel-good drug.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.660
This is an illustration of the
structure of a fish brain

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.690
versus a human brain.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.460
What we see is that, though
they may be structured

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.230
differently, they still have
the same functions.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.420
So here we see that, on the
surface of the fish's

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.940
[INAUDIBLE] brain, there are
structures that serve

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.820
functions similar to the limbic
system of mammals.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.510
In mammals, these cerebellar
receptors are responsible,

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.940
among other things, for the
emotional evaluation of

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.170
information, and they play a
role in creating memories and

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:46.710
the learning processes.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.380
And we know, too, that fish can
use tools, that some of

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.365
them form life-long monogamous
relationships with other fish.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.830
And I say all this because
I think we've become so

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.360
disconnected from
these animals.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.360
Few of us will ever spend much
time with a cow or a pig or a

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.180
chicken, so it's good
to know this.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.360
But I really don't think it
matters all that much if these

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.990
animals can solve mathematical
equations, because these are

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.990
arbitrary tests that we've
created for other animals

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.450
based on our own intelligence.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.730
Jeremy Bentham said, "the
question is not can they

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.460
reason nor can they talk, but
can they suffer?" And I think

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.020
that we are at a time where
there's really no legitimate

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.360
debate now whether animals
can suffer.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.670
They have brains,
central nervous

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.130
systems, nerve endings.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.560
Pain to them is used in the same
way as it is for us, as a

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.960
way to move away from negative
stimuli to protect them.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.550
So I think the test that we have
as ethical, conscious,

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.150
moral creatures is, how can we
live on this planet and do the

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.570
most good and the least harm?

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:56.370
And knowing that farm animals
suffer pain, how can we in

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.130
good conscience ignore
their plight?

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.940
So what is the plight
for these animals?

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:06.150
Well, about 60, 70, 80 years
ago, most farm animals lived

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.330
relatively decent lives, outside
in small flocks.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.570
And this is an illustration
showing that.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.670
Many of them were even
slaughtered on the farm.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.070
But unfortunately,
much has changed.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.640
In fact, so few people are
involved in agriculture now,

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.910
less than 2%, that they're
removing it from the Census

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.840
Bureau occupational section.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.980
So with this change, and the
amount of meat that people are

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.850
consuming in this country, we've
seen a huge increase in

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.280
the number of animals being
killed for food.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.170
Now over eight billion, with a
B, farmed animals are killed

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.200
every year in this country.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.250
This is a graph showing the
slaughter rate of animals.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.110
Nearly 300 chickens are killed
every single second in this

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.470
country, over three pigs killed
every second, and a cow

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.310
every single second.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.430
Now, these numbers, none
of us can really grasp.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.840
As the saying goes, one death
is a tragedy, but a million

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.560
deaths, or in this case eight
billion, is just a statistic.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.190
It's really difficult for us
to relate to these numbers,

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.300
they're so mind-boggling.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.715
But it's one, and then one, and
then one, all the way up

00:16:17.715 --> 00:16:20.750
to eight billion.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.780
So gone are the days of the
idyllic barnyard scenes that

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.930
we grew up with in movies and
our children's books.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.890
And this is what a modern-day
farm looks like.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.940
This is a factory egg farm.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.450
And on this small piece of
property, you can find

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:43.460
millions of animals intensively
confined.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.250
This is what most people know
about our current agricultural

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.920
system, nothing.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.340
They're kept completely
in the dark on how

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.450
these animals are treated.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.270
And that's because the meat,
dairy, and egg industry spend

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.330
millions and millions of
dollars every year

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.360
spoon-feeding us ads about happy
cows and happy chickens

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.430
to mask the reality of this
institutional and

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.560
industrialized farming system.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.609
So what we aim to do at Mercy
For Animals with our

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.710
undercover investigations is to
pull back the curtains of

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:16.010
these facilities, and to shine
a bright spotlight on these

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.260
animals' plights.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.619
So now in industrial farming, we
see that animals are being

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:25.180
treated as commodities,
resources, machines, and

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.150
production units.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.870
This is a quote that appeared
in "National Hog Farmer"

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.925
magazine that said, "the
breeding sow should be thought

00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:35.540
of and treated as a valuable
piece of machinery whose

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:40.130
function is to pump out baby
pigs like a sausage machine."

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.610
And we see that these
intelligent, sensitive

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.070
creatures have been reduced
to just that, machines.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.870
They live their lives in tiny
crates where they can't even

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.050
turn around or lie down
comfortably for nearly their

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.630
entire lives.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:58.100
They resort to bar-biting,
banging their heads against

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.600
the wire and steel structures
of their cages, because

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.800
they've literally gone insane.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.630
We've created genetic
Frankensteins chickens.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.580
On the right here, we have the
modern broiler chicken, named

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.170
literally after the
cooking method.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.510
These are meat-type birds.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.860
On the left, we have the
modern-day egg-laying chicken.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.450
So what we've done is we've
taken these meat-type birds

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.930
and we've bred them to grow so
large so fast that many of

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.200
them can't even withstand
their own body

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.650
weight on their legs.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.080
Now, back in the 1950s, it
took almost 70 days for a

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.910
chicken to reach
market weight.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.940
Today, it takes about 47,
in some cases 35.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.420
They're continuing to chip time
off of these animals'

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.910
lives, and they're reaching
a much larger weight.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.860
So we essentially have
our baby animals

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.990
in obese adult bodies.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:56.180
And what we see is that they
suffer from leg disorders,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.510
heart and lung failures, and
they're in chronic pain.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.310
Now, a study found that 90% of
these broiler chickens will

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.210
eat feed that's laced with
painkillers to self-medicate

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.110
themselves, they're in
such chronic pain.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.260
And the same is true
for turkeys.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.560
This is a photograph taken
at a Butterball

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.640
facility in North Carolina.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.870
And this is where the tom
turkeys, or the male turkeys,

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.920
are used for breeding.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.910
Some of these turkeys
reach 90 pounds.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.230
They can hardly walk by the time
that they're slaughtered.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:29.110
Now, egg-laying chickens have
bred to be smaller birds, but

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.570
to produce an unnaturally
high amount of eggs.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.930
Now, before we domesticated
these animals, they laid about

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.700
24 eggs a year.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.250
In the 1950s, they would lay
about 120 eggs a year.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.680
Today they lay over
200 eggs per year.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.240
This takes an extreme toll
on their bodies.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.410
Their calcium is being used to
produce the eggs, so they

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.160
suffer from broken bones
and osteoporosis.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.030
And this is how 95%
of the hens in

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.300
this country are confined.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.540
They're kept in cages the size
of a file drawer cabinet, with

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.320
anywhere from five
to seven birds.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.820
They can't even spread
their wings.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.550
They can't walk, perch,
roost, dust-bathe.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.860
They can't do anything that
comes natural to them.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.835
And then we have cows that are
used for milk production.

00:20:12.835 --> 00:20:15.250
These animals are artificially
inseminated time and time

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.870
again, because cows, like all
other mammals, have to give

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.710
birth in order to lactate.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.760
So what happens to
these baby cows?

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.580
They're taken away.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.840
Many of them go into
the veal industry.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.370
The mothers live like this for
about five years, and then

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.090
they're slaughtered.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:35.145
I think this ad poses the
question rather bluntly.

00:20:35.145 --> 00:20:38.810
Do we need to be drinking
cow's milk at all?

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.950
We hear the term that milk
is nature's perfect food.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.360
And cow's milk is nature's
perfect food, if you're a baby

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.470
calf who's doubling in
size every few weeks.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.560
But when we think about it,
we're the only species to

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.250
drink milk past infancy.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.440
We're the only species
to drink the

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.250
milk of another species.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.340
And this has led to a system
of just absolute horror and

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.610
cruelty for these animals.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.510
Now, Ruth Harrison, in her book
"Animal Machines," said,

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.380
"if one person is unkind to an
animal, it's considered to be

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.510
cruelty, but where a lot of
people are unkind to animals,

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.770
especially in the name of
commerce, the cruelty is

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.330
condoned and, once sums of money
are at stake, we defend

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.790
it to the last by otherwise
intelligent people."

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.190
And I think that this really
puts into perspective our

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:26.050
current view and treatment of
animals in this country.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.780
Polls have been done by Zogby
and Gallup, Ohio State

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.350
University, universities across
the country, that find

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.730
that Americans oppose
animal abuse.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.700
93% of Americans say animals
deserve protection from

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.130
cruelty, neglect, and abuse.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.060
93%.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.620
I challenge you to find any
other issue in this country

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.670
where you can get 93%
of people to agree.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.610
But when it comes to
animals, we stand

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.690
united in that belief.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.675
But that belief does not reflect
our actual treatment

00:21:57.675 --> 00:21:59.920
of the majority of animals.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.890
So I'm going to show a short
four-minute video, and it

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.290
shows what happens on factory
farms and slaughter houses.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.910
Some of you may find it a bit
disturbing, but I think to be

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.770
ethical consumers, it really
is our obligation to take a

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.181
look at these systems.

00:22:15.181 --> 00:22:18.050
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.440
-In the next few minutes, you
will be given an eye-opening

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.030
look behind the closed doors of
modern farms, hatcheries,

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.210
and slaughter plants, revealing
the journey that

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.373
animals make from
farm to fridge.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.740
Crowded by the thousands into
filthy sheds, chickens and

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.670
turkeys are denied many of
their most basic natural

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.900
behaviors and needs, such as
fresh air and exercise.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.854
Sick or injured birds often
have their necks broken.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.210
Others are clubbed to death.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.610
At the slaughter plant, the
birds are dumped from their

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.130
crates, then roughly snapped
upside down into moving

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.200
shackles by their
fragile legs.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.920
From there, the birds are
dragged through an electrified

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.680
vat of water which renders
them paralyzed, but not

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.810
necessarily unconscious.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.020
They are then pulled across
a blade which slices their

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.530
throats, causing blood to
pour from their necks.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.240
The egg industry subjects chicks
to horrors few of us

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.490
can even imagine.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.660
Because male chicks don't lay
eggs and do not grow quickly

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.430
enough to be raised profitably
for meat, they are killed

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:31.340
within hours after hatching.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.340
Male chicks are typically thrown
into giant grinding

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.380
machines while still alive.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.250
Another killing method is to
drop male chicks into trash

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.460
bags to be smothered
or suffocated.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.320
The females have it even worse,
destined for a life of

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.000
prolonged cruelty.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.480
To reduce packing induced by
overcrowded living conditions,

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.200
workers use a hot blade or laser
to remove part of the

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.380
chick's beaks.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:59.710
This mutilation can cause both
acute and chronic pain.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.780
After debeaking, the birds are
moved to cages where they will

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.470
spend the rest of their lives.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:10.080
Nearly 95% of egg-laying hens
spend their lives confined in

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.530
tiny wire cages like this.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.380
The majority of today's
dairy cows are

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.970
confined on factory farms.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.934
Workers subject young cows to
painful mutilations and

00:24:23.934 --> 00:24:25.670
amputations.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.270
Here, a worker cuts off a cow's
tail, slicing through

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.270
her sensitive skin, nerves,
and bone without any

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.580
painkillers.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.250
Injuries and illness often
run rampant in filthy,

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.060
disease-ridden factory
farm environments.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.350
Cows too sick or injured to
stand are called downers, and

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.340
are often left to slowly
suffer and

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.890
die from their injuries.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.460
Calves on dairy farms are
dragged away from their

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.990
mothers and violently killed,
all so that humans can have

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.240
the milk instead.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.000
At a fraction of their natural
lifespan, the so-called spent

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.060
dairy cows are prodded onto
transport trucks and shipped

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.960
to slaughter houses.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.900
-Come on!

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.900
-Unreliable stunning practices
at the slaughterhouse condemn

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.660
many cattle to having their
throats cut and their limbs

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.675
hacked off while still
alive and conscious.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.380
For nearly their entire
four-month pregnancies, mother

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.700
sows are locked in narrow metal
stalls barely larger

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.480
than their own bodies.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.070
Soon after birth, piglets are
castrated by workers who cut

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:38.840
into their skin and rip
out their testicles.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.580
Next, the workers chop
off their tails.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.320
Both of these painful procedures
are nearly always

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.820
done without anesthesia.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.760
The piglets who become sick or
injured people or who are not

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.590
growing quickly enough
are killed.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.590
Common killing methods including
being slammed

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:54.855
head-first into the ground.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.580
Once pigs have reached
market weight,

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.940
they are sent to slaughter.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.660
At the slaughterhouse, pigs are
knocked in the head with a

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.770
steel rod, hung upside down, and
have their throats slit.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.300
Improper stunning condemns
many pigs to having their

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.300
throats slit while they are
fully conscious and suffering.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.330

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.020
NATHAN RUNKLE: Now, in his
book "Eating Animals,"

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.020
Jonathan Safran Foer spoke to
a number of factory farmers

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.000
about these issues.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.060
And many of them wanted
to remain anonymous.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.540
This is a quote from
one of them.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.960
"What I hate is when consumers
act as if farmers want these

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.490
things, when it's consumers who
tell farmers what to grow.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.650
They've wanted cheap food.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.860
We've grown it." And I think
when a lot of people see this

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.790
video, they're angry.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.120
And a lot of times, they direct
that anger towards the

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.840
individual employees in these
facilities instead of stepping

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.720
back and looking at the system
in a broader, larger view.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.600
What w found is that, in many
of these factory farm and

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.650
slaughterhouse environments,
the workers are victims of

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:34.590
this system in much the same
way as the animals are.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.260
Many of them are undocumented
workers.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.110
They take this work because
it's the only

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.150
work they can find.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.950
They work long hours.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.660
And what we see is that many
of them are very troubled

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.060
initially by what
they see there.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.760
And in fact, there have been
studies done that find that

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.090
many slaughterhouse and factory
farm workers suffer

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.340
from what's called
perpetration-induced traumatic

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.520
stress disorder, which is
essentially a form of

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.170
post-traumatic stress disorder
that comes about when people

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:05.180
are put in situations to do
things that they find morally

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.420
unacceptable.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.860
We saw this in some situations
with Nazis and executioners,

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.040
people that are in
war environments.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.850
We're seeing the same thing in
factory farm workers and

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.020
slaughterhouse workers.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.110
And as a result, we see
increased levels of alcohol

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.510
and drug abuse.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:25.070
We see increased numbers of
domestic violence disputes.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.430
So I think we have to ask
ourselves, if this system is

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.210
so unpleasant and violent
and cruel that it causes

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.210
psychological distress and
damage to the people that have

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.900
to work in them, what does that
say about the practice?

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.590
And is that something that we
should be supporting in a

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.590
civilized society?

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.510
The other thing that people say
is, this footage must be

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.000
old, this must be out of the
United States, this couldn't

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.110
possibly be happening
in the 21st century.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.935
We have laws and regulations
for everything, right?

00:28:51.935 --> 00:28:54.755
Well, unfortunately pretty much
all of this footage that

00:28:54.755 --> 00:28:57.310
you saw was taken in the
last five years alone

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.380
in the United States.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.040
This is just a snapshot
of the treatment

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.520
these animals endure.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.560
So what do the laws look
like in this country?

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.850
Well, unfortunately they
don't look very

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.480
promising for farmed animals.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.890
We have a system where
agribusiness is so large and

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:15.350
powerful that they've been able
to lobby so that state

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.060
and federal laws are written
in a way that

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.410
exempt farmed animals.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.160
So on a federal level, we see
that there's not a single

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.410
federal law that provides
protection to farmed animals

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.710
during their lives
on factory farms.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.330
There is a federal law for
transport and slaughter for

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:34.450
mammals, but it totally exempts
birds, which make up

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:38.900
over 95% of the animals used
for food production.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.550
So for the majority of these
animals' lives, no protection

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.520
on the federal level.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.770
The Humane Methods of Slaughter
Act exempt birds,

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.420
which means that many of them
have their throats slit and go

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.340
into the scalding tanks while
they're still alive.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.720
Now, all 50 states have
anti-cruelty laws, varying in

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.820
scope and definition.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.400
But most of them completely
exempt or largely exempt farm

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.280
animals from their protection.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.190
So similar to the case that I
described earlier about the

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.820
piglet being slammed into the
ground, we see that other

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.490
routine practices that cause
extreme suffering for animals

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.960
are allowed to happen on
a state level as well.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.940
Things like inflicting
third-degree burns on animals

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.730
that are conscious without
painkillers is deemed legal

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.170
because of exemptions.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.700
Castrating piglets, legal
without painkillers because of

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.340
exemptions.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.590
Now, to put this into context,
if you had a puppy that you

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.730
took to your local vet and
said, I'm here to have my

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:34.960
puppy neutered, and your vet
took your puppy by his hind

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.130
legs, held him up, took out a
scalpel, cut him open, ripped

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.060
out his testicles and hand the
puppy back to you, you

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.410
probably wouldn't be very
thrilled or excited with your

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.950
vet visit, and you'd probably
call law enforcement, and that

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.180
vet would probably be shut
down for malpractice and

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.040
charged with animal cruelty.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.960
But we do this to piglets
every single day.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.690
And these aren't even vets
that are doing this.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.230
These are untrained, unskilled
workers working

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.270
at an alarming rate.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.070
And then we have things like
cutting the beaks off of

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.450
chickens without
any painkillers

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:06.850
also allowed to happen.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:09.740
So we've handed the power to
decide what is cruelty and

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.860
what is acceptable to the very
industries that profit off of

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.470
using these animals
themselves.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.090
And it hasn't worked.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.640
Now, the good news is that we're
starting to see some

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.520
change on this issue
as consumers

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.220
wake up to these practices.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.720
In 2008, California passed
Proposition 2.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.210
And Proposition 2 was a modest
yet meaningful initiative that

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:35.510
said that calves raised for
veal, pregnant pigs, and

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.160
egg-laying hens had to be given
enough space to stand

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.300
up, turn around, lie down,
and extend their limbs.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.230
Now, that ballot initiative
passed by an

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.110
overwhelming majority.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.770
63% of California voters
passed Proposition 2.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:54.960
More people voted for Prop 2 in
2008 than voted for Obama

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.640
in California.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.270
And this law really helped
set a precedent.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:05.560
Since then, we've had nine
states pass laws banning these

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.140
tiny gestation crates for
breeding pigs, a number of

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.300
states banning battery cages for
egg-laying hens and veal

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.110
crates, also being outlawed.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.160
But there's still much
work to be done.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.060
Now, I want to tell
you a quick story

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:18.960
about this man here.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.950
His name is Virgil Butler.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:24.870
Virgil Butler worked for almost
10 years in a Tyson

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.830
slaughterhouse in Arkansas.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:31.000
And Virgil's job was to take
birds as they arrived in

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.790
crates and snap them into those
moving conveyor belts

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:34.990
that you just saw.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.370
Now, Virgil witnessed a lot of
abuse, not only the standard

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.990
mistreatment of these animals,
but he witnessed his

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.640
co-workers stomping on birds,
ripping their heads off,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.170
putting ice bombs in them and
watching them explode on the

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.400
slaughter line.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.870
And over time, Virgil started
to become very disturbed by

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:52.780
what he saw.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.880
He started having nightmares.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.850
And he said, I can't
be involved in

00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.900
this system any longer.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.180
So Virgil quit his job.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.550
He had no real financial
backing.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.080
This is his trailer that he
lived in behind him, in this

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.030
photograph.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.130
And he went vegan,
and he became an

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:11.000
animal rights activists.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.930
And he started blogging about
what he saw, not only to

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.530
expose the abuse, but as
self-therapy as well.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.010
And he started traveling the
country, sharing his firsthand

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.760
experiences with others.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.870
So I think that Virgil is one
of many examples of someone

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:29.490
who can be so invested and
involved in this system, but

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:33.930
can still be in touch with that
greater good that he has,

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.630
that spark of humanity.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.270
And he has made changes.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.950
And I think that if Virgil can
do this, any of us, no matter

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.160
where we are in our current
lives, can make changes, can

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.950
take steps to become
more compassionate.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.860
Now, we live in an era where
our forks and knives have

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.640
become, really, weapons
of mass destruction.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.990
We can use them for compassion
and kindness for animals, or

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.400
cruelty and exploitation.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.310
Now, I think if these were eight
billion dogs or cats

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.840
that were being subjected to
these conditions, there would

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.210
be such a public outcry.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.530
And we should have that same
level of outcry for farmed

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.980
animals as well.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.469
Now, "The Economist" put it
well, I think, when they said,

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.060
"few people would keep a hen in
a shoe box for her entire

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.670
egg-laying life; but practically
everyone will eat

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:27.880
smartly packaged, 'farm fresh'
eggs from battery hens." Few

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.800
of us in good conscience would
treat these animals in the way

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.620
that you've seen
this afternoon.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.730
But when we go to the
supermarket and we buy these

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.679
products, we're essentially
hiring someone to do this

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.960
dirty work on our behalf.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.050
So we have to ask ourselves,
do we feel comfortable

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.699
supporting this abuse
financially?

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.759
Because that's what we're doing,
is we're financing it.

00:34:48.759 --> 00:34:52.570
Now, our food choices
have a huge impact.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:57.740
The average American eats about
2,700 land animals in

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.730
their lifetime.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:03.030
So by making some dietary
changes, by eliminating meat

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.830
on Mondays, or reducing our meat
consumption, becoming a

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.050
flexitarian, or becoming a
full-blown vegan, we can help

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.850
spare animals this suffering.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.870
And this is an illustration
showing

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:14.690
those number of animals.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.000
And we really are at a
critical juncture.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.720
We're at a time when not only
is animal abuse rampant in

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.490
this industry, but the
environmental impact of animal

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:27.105
agriculture is very extreme
and severe.

00:35:27.105 --> 00:35:30.250
The United Nations published
a report, "Livestock's Long

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.500
Shadow," that found that
animal agriculture is

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.840
responsible for the release of
more greenhouse gases than the

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.430
entire transportation
sector combined.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:44.620
18% of greenhouse gases are
associated with the livestock

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:51.360
sector, so more so than cars,
trains, automobiles combined.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.150
So not only are we wreaking
havoc on animals and the

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.040
environment, but also to
our own health as well.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.250
And that's what's led the UN
to say that we should be

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:06.170
eating less meat to curb
global warming.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.980
And we see that it's not just
global warming, but it's a

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.290
waste of resources.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:13.090
We have to use so much water,
which is a scarce commodity,

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.380
and growing scarcer now
across the globe.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.960
We see that we're funneling so
much grain into animals to get

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.995
a relatively small amount
of meat in return.

00:36:22.995 --> 00:36:26.560
Now, this is an article that
appeared all over the country

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.670
recently, but this particular
screenshot is from Drovers

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.330
CattleNetwork.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:35.815
It's America's best business
source for beef producers.

00:36:35.815 --> 00:36:37.750
This is on the homepage
of their website.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.090
It says we will all
be vegetarian by

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.850
2050, scientists say.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.300
And this is not because
everyone chooses to be

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.460
vegetarian by 2050, but because
we simply will not be

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.340
able to sustain meat production
for a growing

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.720
population by then.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.530
So we're at a juncture where
we can either choose to be

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:59.860
innovative in solving this
issue, or we can be dragged

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.350
there by necessity, by the
collapse of our environment

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.330
and ecosystems and animal
cruelty just

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:06.570
being out of control.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.550
Now, thankfully there are some
real pioneers that are jumping

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.065
on the plant-based
diet bandwagon.

00:37:12.065 --> 00:37:14.960
We have Biz Stone, who I'm sure
all of you have heard of

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.190
before, who is a proud vegan,
an ethical vegan.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:23.350
We have Russell Simmons founder
of Def Jam Records,

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.830
who has adopted a plant-based
diet, former President Bill

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.640
Clinton, who is an outspoken
advocate for plant-based

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.490
eating, and then we have
billionaire Steve Wynn, from

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:37.500
Las Vegas, who is also jumping
on the veggie bandwagon.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.600
It's not just some of the
brightest minds and

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.840
entrepreneurs, but we have
sports athletes.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.910
The Houston Texan Arian Foster,
who is a proud vegan

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:50.700
now as well, showing that we
sacrifice nothing, not our

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.440
strength, not our health,
by eliminating meat.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.020
We gain everything.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.190
And we're starting to see the
new generation of college

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:01.990
students embracing this idea
and the need as well.

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:04.160
A recent study found that in
the last three years, the

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.410
number of vegans on college
campuses has doubled.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.930
The number of vegetarians
increased by 50%.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.770
And there are now all-vegan
dining halls in this country,

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:17.120
including one right here in
Texas at Denton University.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:22.340
And this is an image of the
Denton vegan dining hall.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.970
Now, "Washington Post" did a
survey that said, what will

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:27.490
future generations
condemn us for?

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:30.180
And they found that second only
to our treatment of the

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.150
environment is our treatment of
animals in food production.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.040
So I think that this is a
generational issue, like so

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.230
many social issues are.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.260
And this is one of our time.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.980
We have billions of animals that
are being subjected to

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.880
horrors beyond belief.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.890
And I think that future
generations will ask us, what

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.600
did we do to right this wrong?

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.590
I think that animal protection
is a social justice movement.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.050
Based on the number of
individuals that are suffering

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.700
and the degree of their
suffering, I think it's one of

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.730
the most pressing of our time.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.310
Unlike other social justice
movements, where those that

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.500
are being oppressed had a
voice in society to some

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.280
degree-- they could protest,
they could lobby, they could

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.910
ask for boycotts--

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.210
these animals can't do that.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.540
Now, you saw in this video
of factory farms and

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.580
slaughterhouses that these
animals kick and scream.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.710
They struggle and fight against
their oppressors to

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:23.230
the best of their ability.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:27.430
But they do rely on each and
every one of us to speak out

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:31.350
on their behalf within our
society and culture.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:35.990
We are in a situation where
we hold all of the power.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.320
And these animals are completely
at our mercy.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.970
Now, what we do with that power
is totally up to us.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:44.330
And with power comes
responsibility.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:47.570
And as Harriet Beecher Stowe
said, "it's a matter of taking

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:50.670
the side of the weak against the
strong, something the best

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.760
people have always done." And I
think it's hard to imagine a

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.770
group of individuals that are
weaker and more vulnerable

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:57.460
than farmed animals.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.550
So I encourage you to take the
side of the weak against the

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.680
strong, and make decisions and
take actions that will help

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.730
bring compassion and
justice to them.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:06.985
Thank you so much.

00:40:06.985 --> 00:40:13.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.800
NATHAN RUNKLE: I think we have
time for some questions if

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.050
anyone has any.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.620
Yeah, so Europe, I would say, is
about 10 years ahead of the

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.910
US in terms of addressing farm
animal protection issues.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:32.810
They, in some cases about 10
years ago, started banning

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:37.680
veal crates, battery cages,
gestation crates.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.440
And some of those are now taking
effect, some of them

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.800
last year, some of
them next year.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.840
So yes, they're starting to
address those issues.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.000
Now, we have other countries,
unfortunately, more developing

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.400
countries like India, that for
the longest time sort of held

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.150
as its root belief that animals
deserved compassion.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:59.460
Now we're seeing factory farm
interests, McDonald's, Burger

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.860
King, Wendy's, coming into
these countries.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.690
And meat consumption is
dramatically rising.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:06.360
And with that, we see
factory farming

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.970
coming into those countries.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.400
So for example, in India,
there's as many hens in

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.550
battery cages in India
as there are in the

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.040
United States now.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.030
So we see some countries that
are leading the way and ahead

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.470
of us, and then we have others
that are actually just sort of

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.300
catching up with factory
farming.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.550
So it's an issue that needs
to be addressed globally.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:33.040
Yeah, I don't know all the
specifics of their other

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.630
economics there.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:40.490
But one issue is, you can look
at grids and you can see just

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.550
how meat consumption has
dramatically increased in the

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.240
United States.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.440
Now, the good news is, since
2007, meat consumption in the

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.320
US has started to decline,
really for the first time.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.700
We're now killing about 400
million fewer farm animals

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.850
than we were in 2007.

00:41:55.850 --> 00:42:00.060
That's about a 12% decline.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:03.770
In Latin America, my guess would
be that they're probably

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.610
eating more cows than
they are chickens.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.310
And those are animals that you
can have out in a grazing area

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:14.170
more, which costs less than
these intensive factory farm

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.420
systems would.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.680
It's a great question.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.110
Sort of like the quote from the
anonymous factory farmer,

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.950
it's not that farmers are run by
a bunch of sadistic people.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.370
These are people that respond to
the marketplace and supply

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:33.260
and demand.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.440
So we see the plant-based food
market just dramatically

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.810
exploding as people become
more aware of it.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.130
Bill Gates actually--

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:44.680
this is not a joke--

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.060
recently said that, really,
the future of food is in

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.270
plant-based proteins and
things-- again, looking at the

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.490
environmental impact,
the cruelty issues.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.210
So I think we're going to
see more of that grow.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:58.980
In terms of these cage-free,
free-range, so-called humane

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.330
meat products, it's a
business decision.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:04.550
But ultimately I think it's a
business decision that is

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.400
helping animals to
some extent.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.700
They're getting them out of
these really intensive

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.160
confinement systems.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.050
But I don't think that the
typical cage-free or

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.850
free-range egg facility looks
like what most people think it

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.200
should look like, because you're
absolutely right--

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.340
they're the same big-interest,
the big factory farms that are

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.510
producing these eggs.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:28.380
And we've done investigations
at these places.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.220
They'll have one shed on the
same property that are battery

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.400
cages, and the next shed will
be the cage-free eggs.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.740
And they'll have literally tens
of thousands of birds in

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.220
windowless sheds.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.280
They're not in cages, which
is an improvement.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.880
Some of them have perches.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.260
They can walk around, but
they're not frolicking out in

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.730
the field like most people
would imagine.

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:54.420
So I think it's progress, but
it's certainly not perfection.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.130
And I think, overall, we need to
at least be decreasing the

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.020
amount of animal products
that we're using.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.230
It's about efficiency.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.930
These are factory farms.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:09.360
They're the model
of efficiency.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.210
And if they can mechanize
everything and have animals in

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:18.830
a smaller area, it takes less
labor to get the job done.

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:23.260
It takes less heating
and electricity to

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.130
operate those units .

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:26.625
So it's all about efficiency.

00:44:26.625 --> 00:44:29.040
I mean, certainly there's
land available

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.290
to give these animals.

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.040
I don't think that the world
or life is ever in

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.470
black-and-white terms, and
we understand that.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:44.970
Now, we certainly think that
a vegan diet is, in most

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.640
situations, the most ethical,
compassionate, environmentally

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.480
friendly choice that
we can make.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.825
So of course we hold that
as the gold standard.

00:44:52.825 --> 00:44:56.930
But we understand that there are
gradations along the lines

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:57.910
of agriculture.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:00.880
We have intensive factory
farm systems, which is

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.055
unfortunately how the vast
majority of food is produced.

00:45:04.055 --> 00:45:06.390
It's like I said, 95%
of egg-laying hens.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.040
We've got pretty much all
the broiler chickens.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.160
About 80% of pigs are
intensively confined.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.750
This is the gold standard.

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:16.925
These other situations are such,
really, the monopoly

00:45:16.925 --> 00:45:19.950
that you have to go out
of your way to find.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.700
So we think people need to know
what the choices are.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.250
But is a cow that's lived out
her entire life in pasture and

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.960
then was killed on the farm
better than a factory farm?

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.610
Absolutely, it's better.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.280
Do I think that we should be
killing the cow rather than

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.480
eating carrots?

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.790
Probably the carrots
is a better

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:39.610
choice for me, ethically.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.540
If I don't have to take
a life and be

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.040
violent, probably wouldn't.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.410
But there are people that just
don't share that belief.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:51.230
And I think for them, doing,
again, as little harm and as

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.200
much good as possible is really
what we should be

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:53.660
looking at.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:58.900
And certainly, whether you're
a die-hard meat-eater or a

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.820
vegan, we can all probably agree
that this factory farm

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.950
system just doesn't fall
into line with what

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:06.200
is ethical for us.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.730
Yeah, it's true.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:15.540
A lot of these animals still go
to the same slaughterhouse.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.060
Some of them are killed
on the farm.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.940
But again, that's such
a small percentage.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.250
So yes, a lot of them go to
the same slaughterhouses.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:25.480
For egg-laying hens, most of the
chicks still come from the

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.260
same hatcheries.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.560
So all the male chicks are
still ground up alive.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.930
They still have their
beaks cut off.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:37.050
So there are built-in, I think,
moral issues that we

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.970
have to look at with animal
agriculture to begin with.

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:41.910
And those are things that we
have to sort of come to terms

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.590
with what we're comfortable
with.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.420
There is an amount of domination
and exploitation

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.310
that's involved in any

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:52.810
agricultural system, of course.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.430
So you're absolutely right.

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:57.740
I think it does boil down to,
are we OK with some amount of

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.590
violence to animals for food,
or do we just want to remove

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:02.590
ourselves completely
from that system?

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.850
I've chosen to remove myself
from that system.

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:08.470
But to say that all farms are
exactly the same I think

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:10.900
probably oversimplifies
the issue a bit.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.360
But those are things that we
should all just be aware of as

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.610
conscious consumers, yeah.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.330
Yeah, it's a great question.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:26.490
And a big part of why meat,
dairy, and egg products are so

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:29.460
cheap is because they're
subsidized by the government.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.210
If we were actually paying the
true cost, those products

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:33.740
would be much higher.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.290
So I think that's a whole issue
that we really need to

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:39.770
take a critical look at.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:43.760
But there's obviously a vegan
diet that can be very

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.310
expensive, that you're
eating a lot of niche

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:48.430
meat-alternative products
that are made.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:52.400
And then you can have one that
is based more on beans and

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.530
nuts and legumes and vegetables
and things that

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:57.210
can, in some situations,
actually be

00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:59.630
cheaper to eat that way.

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:03.330
But in terms of addressing this,
there are a number of

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:05.960
companies now-- one
is Beyond Meat--

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.220
that is looking to make
meat-alternative products that

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:13.250
are cheaper than meat
products are.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:17.800
They have no fat, no
cholesterol, high protein,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.420
really being innovative in
addressing these issues.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.240
And then some of it is
supply and demand.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.330
And the more it's a niche
market, the more it's going to

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.540
cost to create each unit.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:30.045
So I think that there's
sort of a number

00:48:30.045 --> 00:48:30.990
of answers to that.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:39.010
But again, I think that
Americans, and just our whole

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:42.440
humanity, really, have proven
time and again that we can be

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.500
creative in solving
a lot of problems.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.700
I think Google is a great
example of doing things that

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.530
people once thought
were unheard of.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:52.620
This is an issue where I think
if we put the time and

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:56.840
attention and resources, it can
be solved rather quickly.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.650
And I think we're starting to
see, in some ways, capitalism

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:04.070
and these inventive companies
starting to jump in and

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:05.320
address it as well.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.400
So we have a multi-prong
approach.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:16.640
Again, these are complicated,
deeply rooted issues.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.080
So to say that there is a
one-size-fit-all answer that's

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.770
going to address this in any
sort of timely manner I think

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.820
is probably oversimplifying
it a bit.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.410
So that's why we have the four
areas that we work in,

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:30.680
education being a large
component of that.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.520
Getting people to see what's
really going on and

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.310
encouraging them to reduce or,
ideally, eliminating their

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:38.100
meat, dairy, egg consumption,
that's really the root cause

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.500
of all of this, obviously.

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.970
But we understand that the
world is not going to go

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.280
vegetarian or vegan, certainly
not overnight.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.640
And we think that these animals
that are here right

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.550
now, suffering as individuals
with needs and interests,

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:56.030
deserve to be treated with as
much care as we can give them.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:50:00.480
That being said, changes happen
slowly over time.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.620
So we view banning some of the
worst factory farm practices,

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.935
like these battery cages for
egg-laying hens, where they

00:50:06.935 --> 00:50:08.980
can't spread their wings, or
gestation crates for sows,

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.510
where they can't turn around,
or tail-docking, cutting the

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.230
tails off these animals without
painkillers, as being

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.630
really unethical practices that
we should be moving to

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:21.450
end right now, and that we can
start to reduce the amount of

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:24.170
suffering that these animals
are subjected to, because

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:26.500
these are real animals,
real lives, the stakes

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.870
are real for them.

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:30.700
And though giving them a few
more inches of space might not

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.080
solve all the problems-- and we
certainly don't think that

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.280
that is the case--

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.010
we do think that it reduces
the sum total of suffering

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:42.020
that they're subjected to, as we
move towards a reduction in

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:45.190
animal products, and hopefully
more people starting to

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:46.470
eliminate these products.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:48.510
So multi-prong approach.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.920
And within that, we have
legislative initiatives.

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.900
We have corporate outreach
initiatives, looking at

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.640
different power-holders and
stakeholders in this, and how

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.550
we can affect change
within that.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:04.460
It's a great question.

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.820
A lot of the success that we've
seen, like Proposition

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.910
2, which I mentioned before,
are citizen-driven ballot

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:13.690
initiatives.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.600
A lot of the states where
there is a large farming

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.130
community, the legislature is
not voluntarily going to push

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:23.360
through any sort of restrictive
measure that would

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.390
challenge such a big
industry there.

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:28.550
So they require ballot
initiatives to come in,

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.490
because again, consumers are
really on the side of change,

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:33.870
even when big business isn't.

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.700
But the problem is is that only
about half the states in

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.930
this country allow ballot
initiatives.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:42.920
And some of the states, like
Iowa, that has the largest egg

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.710
production and the largest
pork production in this

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:47.860
country, do not have ballot
initiative processes.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.650
And their legislature is very
much controlled by big ag.

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:55.750
So the pathway to affect
legislative change there

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.900
becomes very challenging.

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.980
There is a federal
bill right now.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.290
It's regarding egg-laying
hens.

00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:06.490
It's not a perfect bill by any
means, but it would set the

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:10.800
first federal standards for
animals on factory farms.

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.870
It would increase the amount
of space that hens have in

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.190
these cages.

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:17.260
That is really the first federal
bill that has found

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:23.530
its way to Congress for farm
animals in over 30 years.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:27.630
And the pork and the beef
industries are fighting

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:30.150
desperately against that bill,
because they don't want to see

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:32.380
any sort of precedent
set on it.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:36.440
So it's challenging, as we
know legislation can be.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.870
There are a number of
states right now--

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:40.630
I think New Jersey is one of
them-- that are considering a

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:44.060
gestation crate ban in
their legislature.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.780
So that's the main one
that comes to mind.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.480
I don't think, unfortunately,
that Texas has anything

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.520
currently that's pending
for farm animals.

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.040
So that's sort of the
situation with

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.290
legislation right now.

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:04.820
Yeah, it's a good question.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.680
We're not against
food production.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.480
Everyone has to eat.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.120
And there are such
thing as tofu

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.000
factories that create jobs.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.800
There are things, soy milk
factories that create jobs,

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.840
carrot factories that
create jobs.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.030
So this isn't getting rid
of a bunch of jobs.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:27.930
It's a shift in the economy,
in where those jobs go.

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.830
NATHAN RUNKLE: Exactly.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.760
That's exactly right.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.160
By one industry shrinking or
doing away, a lot of times

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:41.040
other industries take their
place that are more

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.400
environmentally sound, are more

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.900
progressive, are more ethical.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.030
So that's really what
we're looking at.

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:47.420
So we're just looking at a shift
and a humane economy.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.440
Yeah, I think we do the
best that we can.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.440
This isn't a competition
or a purity test.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.490
So we can eliminate
meat, great.

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:05.530
If we can reduce it on Mondays,
Tuesdays, and/or

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:10.350
Wednesdays, great, because we
don't want anyone to feel

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:10.960
overwhelmed.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.360
We don't want people to feel
like either I'm part of the

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.160
vegan team or I'm part of the
I'm gonna eat factory farm

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.890
products every meal and not
care about the issue team,

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:21.420
because that doesn't solve
anything either.

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:24.140
So I think that's really
the take-home message--

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.390
do the best that you can.

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.850
Yeah, well, our Texas offices
is in Dallas, so we do a lot

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.490
of work in Dallas.

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:39.060
But there are organizations here
that are doing events,

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.320
meet-ups, all sorts of things.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.190
I think Compassion
Over Killing has

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:43.960
a coordinator here.

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:47.480
Last year, there was an Austin
vegetarian festival.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.380
I'm not sure if it's happening
again this year.

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.690
But Google it.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:55.670
Yeah, there's certainly
stuff going on.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:57.490
And Mercy For Animals hopefully
will be doing a lot

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.818
more grassroots work in Austin
in the very near future.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:04.240
Thank you so much
for your time.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.490
I really appreciate it, guys.
