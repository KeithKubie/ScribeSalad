00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.530
Mhmmm, breakfast.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.460
Nothing like starting off the day with some
whole grain oats, vitamins and nutrients.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.340
I mean surely nobody has anything bad to say about the most important meal of the day!

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.840
Breakfast seems pretty non-controversial.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.720
But ask someone who has it everyday to just
skip it?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.160
Absolutely not.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
Sorry, I like my English muffins.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.060
Little bit of peanut butter. Tiny bit of honey. Sorry.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.480
Besides, there’s all this news about how
breakfast is good for your health.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.260
I mean, except when there’s all this other news about how it's not.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.260
Now, most of these headlines claim to be based
on the results on scientific studies, so what’s

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.420
going on with this back-and-forth research?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.640
The most recent study that headlines went
wild with claims that skipping breakfast leads

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.089
to heart disease.

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.659
The study examined the health and diets of
around 4,000 middle-aged bank workers….which

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.630
might be because a Spanish bank was partly
funding the study.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.789
The researchers found that those who did not
eat breakfast had more plaque in their arteries,

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.270
putting them at higher risk for heart disease.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.860
But, looking more closely, there are some
caveats to the study.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.000
Like, only 3% of the participating bank workers self-reported as having skipped breakfast entirely.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.960
Many of those studied ate a low-calorie meal
in the morning.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.320
And all of the data was gathered by having
the participants self-report on what and when

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.280
they had eaten over the previous 15 days.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.640
Now I don’t know about you, but I don’t even remember what I was eating at the beginning of this video.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.220
Oh right.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.260
Gross.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.340
The lead researcher of the study also admits
that the results aren’t directly related

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.119
to eating breakfast per se.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.320
It has more to do with what happens when someone
skips breakfast.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.549
He said that skipping breakfast disrupts the
body’s internal clock, prompting people

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.609
to consume more calories throughout the later part of the day than they normally would.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.079
But other researchers have said that there
doesn’t seem to be anything in this particular

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.600
study that provides evidence for that theory.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.340
This of course is only the latest study to
examine the great breakfast question.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.619
Researchers have been fascinated about our
morning eating habits for decades.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.280
The first big study on the subject was carried
out in Alameda County, California in the 1960s.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.760
Researchers documented the everyday habits of the county residents and found that eating

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.159
breakfast tended to be associated with improved
health and longer lifespans, as did getting

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.769
a good night’s sleep and exercising regularly.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.670
And since then, multiple studies have tried
to determine if skipping breakfast can be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.100
associated with weight gain and overall poorer
health.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.920
But it turns out there is no conclusive proof
that this is the case.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.840
For example, one recent study looked at the
eating habits of 12,000 Canadian adults, and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.650
the conclusion was that "breakfast consumption was not consistently associated with differences

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.440
in body mass index or overweight prevalence."

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.590
So if you love breakfast, load up on the bacon and flapjacks.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.640
And if you don’t, enjoy that sweet, sweet
20 minutes of extra sleep in the morning.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.349
There is no real scientific proof to back
either lifestyle.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.140
So you should probably ignore the headlines
and do whatever works for you.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.000
Now whether you skip breakfast or not, you have to eat eventually, so check out this video

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.510
on the healthiest diet in the world.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.379
It’s about way more than just food.
