00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.103
(fast tempo symphony music)

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.938
(applause)

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:42.976
Sarah:Thank you all.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:47.280 line:0%
My work initially started
with using satellite imagery

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.749 line:0%
to map ancient landscapes.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.920
I've been working in Egypt
for 15 years.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.456
I have to say that
I never expected

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.491
to be doing looting mapping.

00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:07.534
But I got started almost at
the beginning of my PhD work.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:10.036
The site you see in
the lower left-hand corner,

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.570
is called Tel El-Tabila.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.740
It's located in the
northeast Egyptian Delta

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.044
about two hours
to the northeast of Cairo.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.947
It's a multi-period
archaeological site.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:26.452
Dates to primarily to the late
period, so roughly 600 BC.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:30.189
When the Napoleonic Expedition
visited Egypt in the 1800s,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.824
the site was fairly large.

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:35.461
Over 1000 by 1000 meters
in size.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:40.533 line:0%
Over time, due to agricultural
growth and encroachment,

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.770 line:0%
the site has been decreasing
and decreasing in size,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.672 line:0%
and you can actually
see just how much

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:49.876
the site has shrunk
in the last 200 years.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:53.012
This is one site in Egypt,

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:57.150
and look at the number
of square meters - it's shrunk.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.418
And we've been able to
track this using old maps,

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:02.021
old spy photographs
from the 1960s,

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.690
declassified information,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.193
aerial photographs,
as well as satellite imagery.

00:02:08.193 --> 00:02:10.529
And as I continued with
my thesis research,

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:14.701
I realized that
this was not just the
story at Tel El-Tabila.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.403
This is the story of many,
if not all,

00:02:18.403 --> 00:02:20.740
of Egypt's archaeological sites.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.309
And this is not just
the story of Egypt.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.979
This is something that's
going on all over the world.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.182
Of course my work
focuses in Egypt,

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:32.117
but we're beginning
to do work in other countries,

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:33.720
and this is a global problem.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.422
So that's the take-away
I want you to have today,

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.825
is that this is something
that is going on

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.828
all over the world,
and we now have

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:46.900
the technology, tools, and
resources to map the problem

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.069
and begin to strategize
about ways of stopping it.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.971
Because ours is truly
the last generation

00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.140
that will be able to
do something about it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.110
before these sites
are gone forever.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.745
When we think of
Egypt, of course

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.381
we always think of Egypt's
greatest discovery,

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.450
that of the tomb of King Tut.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.087
But what's interesting, and
no one really knows this,

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:12.525
is that the tomb of King
Tut was not totally intact,

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.562
it had actually been
looted in antiquity.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.063
That's something else
that we need to bring up.

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:22.167
A lot of looting that goes on
on archaeological sites,

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:23.636
this is not a modern phenomenon,

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.172
this is something
that's been going on.

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:28.674
This is a very human trait.

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:31.477
When Howard Carter
opened King Tut's tomb,

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:35.014
and looked at the vessels
that contained unguents -

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.583
ancient perfumes and creams,

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.952
there were actually
finger marks.

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:41.521
You have to think, if you're
going to take something

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:44.056
from King Tut's tomb and
you walk into the market

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:46.725
with a gold scarab with
King Tut's name on it,

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.927
people are going to
wonder where it came from.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:52.698
Versus a handful of an unguent
that you can easily sell on.

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:54.767
I'm just bringing that up
as an example to show that

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:58.805
there's a great history of this
going on in Egypt.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:07.279
In January of 2011, my
career changed quite a bit.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.116
Following the Egyptian
revolution,

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.984
we started hearing rumors

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:14.687
of archaeological sites
being looted.

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:18.791
We didn't know what was
rumor and what was truth.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.726
Of course everyone
here knows about

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:23.396
the Cairo museum, with
objects being taken.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.831
The Egyptian government
has done an incredible job

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.133
in tracking these objects down.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.335
They've managed to find

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.036
many of the objects
that were taken,

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:35.074
and they're actually going
on display at the Cairo museum.

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.510
With support from
National Geographic,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.312
as well as Digital Globe,

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:42.448
they're a very large provider of
high-resolution satellite data,

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:46.118
we were able to get a hold
of satellite images

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:49.956
showing that there
was looting going on.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.925
The question that we
started asking is,

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.860
"What's the scale?"

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.329
"Where is it happening?"

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.331
And "Why is it happening?"

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.599
As I've been doing this
research, I've learned

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.936
this is not a straight-forward
black or white issue.

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:07.039
What would we do if we were
villagers and times were hard?

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.275
What would we do
to feed our families?

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:12.078
This is an issue
that's tied in very deeply

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.547
with economic development,

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:18.550
with local opportunities
for individuals, education.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.119
We can't really point the finger

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.288
at any one individual
or any one entity.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:27.326
This is something much
more complicated than that.

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:31.597
My work started off being
focused on two main sites.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:35.434
One area being the pyramid
fields just south of Cairo

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:38.170
and an area called el-Lisht,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.671
which is about two
hours south of Cairo.

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.707
It's a very well-known zone for

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:44.209
the Middle Kingdom,
roughly 1800 BC.

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:46.712
But since then, it's expanded.

00:05:46.712 --> 00:05:49.715
I'll talk more
about that shortly.

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:52.518 line:0%
Here you see before
and after imagery.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.186 line:0%
We have to be very careful

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:57.056 line:0%
when we're doing this mapping
in recognizing

00:05:57.056 --> 00:06:01.126 line:0%
when looting has happened,
when it has taken place,

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:03.763
and acknowledging
that a lot of looting

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:05.765
that's gone on in Egypt
and elsewhere of course

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.967
has been going on
for a long time.

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:11.937
Fortunately, I had really good
satellite imagery coverage

00:06:11.937 --> 00:06:14.440
for most of the main areas
of Egypt,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.744
and also, there's wonderful
open source online access

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:20.613
to satellite data with resources

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:24.150
like Google Earth and NASA's
Visible Earth program.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.520
This data is available to
everyone all over the world.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.055 line:0%
You can see
comparing this image,

00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:32.391 line:0%
this is from south Abu Seer,

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.259 line:0%
just a little bit
south of Cairo.

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.629 line:0%
This is an image from 2009.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:42.835 line:0%
The image on the right is an
image from February 15th, 2011.

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:46.372 line:0%
And you can see there are
about 220 looting pits.

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:48.007 line:0%
It's pretty easy to see it.

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.842 line:0%
You see a black rectangle

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:53.012 line:0%
surrounded by
a doughnut of earth.

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:55.981 line:0%
We go in,
we actually use a tool,

00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:58.751 line:0%
draw the number of looting pits,

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.454 line:0%
you can actually see in
the upper right-hand corner,

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:05.057 line:0%
bulldozing marks,
which is, again,

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:08.393 line:0%
a sign of more
organized activity.

00:07:08.393 --> 00:07:10.329
This is another
thing we're tracking,

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:11.563
who's doing the looting?

00:07:11.563 --> 00:07:13.598
Is it gangs of youths
going in digging up

00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:16.736
a few looting pits,
trying to find treasure,

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:20.006
versus organized
criminal activity?

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:23.042
What we're seeing in Egypt,
and indeed in many
parts of the world,

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:25.077
is that looting is changing.

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:28.414
It is a global problem,
and it is something that

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:33.052
has deep connections with
global criminal activities.

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:36.555
With the support of Deborah

00:07:36.555 --> 00:07:39.357
at the Capitol
Archeological Institute

00:07:39.357 --> 00:07:40.826
and the International Coalition

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:43.362
for the Protection of
Egyptian Antiquities,

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:47.399
at the very kind invitation
of Egypt's foreign ministry,

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:51.370
in May of 2011, we went to Egypt

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.339
to meet with a number
of officials and also

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.975
to visit some of these
looting pits on the ground.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.743
A really critical part
of satellite imagery,

00:07:58.743 --> 00:08:00.746
of course, is ground truthing.

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:04.016
You go and you examine
for yourself to see,

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:07.420
is what the satellite imagery
is showing what you think it is.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.988
What people might not know

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.090
is the incredible
deep knowledge

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.527
that local people in Egypt
have of their history.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:16.962
Many individuals,
as it turns out,

00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:18.730
who were involved
with the looting,

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.700
or at least we think were
involved with the looting,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.736
had experience with
archaeological excavations.

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.605
They knew where
to look for tombs.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.407
You can see us standing
in front of it.

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.743
That's definitely
my unhappy face.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:31.677
(chuckles)

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.479
I prefer to be digging.

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:35.881
You can see it's fairly deep.

00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:37.516
They knew exactly where to go.

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:40.852
The big question, then, is
"Were these tombs intact?"

00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:43.355
How can we really know if, when
we get there, they're empty?

00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:46.825
You can see where I'm standing
on the left-hand side,

00:08:46.825 --> 00:08:49.261
you can see bits of human bone,

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:52.932
little bits from sarcophagi,
broken pottery.

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:55.734
By the way, you can't
see it from this picture,

00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:57.402
but they had fresh breaks,

00:08:57.402 --> 00:09:01.574
so I think many of these tombs
that have been looted

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:06.012
actually were partially
to almost fully intact.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:08.981
This gets at a really
crucial issue for mapping

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:11.883
archaeological site
looting all over the world.

00:09:11.883 --> 00:09:15.521
The most important thing
that we need is an inventory.

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:18.023
Not just of the objects,
which is absolutely crucial,

00:09:18.023 --> 00:09:20.092
but an inventory of the number

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:22.160
of archaeological sites
in that country.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.530
And what may be
shocking to hear is that

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.333
there's no single country
in the entire world

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:29.402
that has a comprehensive
database of

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:33.506
every single known
archaeological site.

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:35.273
This is the 21st century.

00:09:35.273 --> 00:09:38.743
This information should be
open, it should be online,

00:09:38.743 --> 00:09:42.949
and we simply don't
have this information.

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:47.887
I want to show you a
little bit about how much
things have changed

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:50.256
in the last three years
at one particular site

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.890
and then talk to you about

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.959
what we're doing
about this right now.

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:55.861
And how we're hoping
that this work

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:59.231
will change public perceptions
and hopefully,

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:02.734
in working in conjunction
with the Egyptian Government,

00:10:02.734 --> 00:10:06.672
begin to protect some of these
sites that are under threat.

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:08.807
This is an image
of a very well known

00:10:08.807 --> 00:10:10.642
archaeological zone, Dahshur.

00:10:10.642 --> 00:10:13.145
They're a series of
Middle Kingdom pyramids,

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:15.814
again these are from
roughly 1800 BC.

00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:19.385
The top image is from 2009.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:22.021
You can see the
tip of a pyramid,

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.157
just the black edge just
to the south of the image,

00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:27.026
you see what looks
like looting pits.

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.027
Those aren't.

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.596
Those are actually
exposed tomb shafts.

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:33.131
And things look okay, you
don't see much looting.

00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:36.468 line:0%
Flash ahead to May of 2011.

00:10:36.468 --> 00:10:38.337 line:0%
We're starting to see
some looting pits.

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:40.439 line:0%
Not many, maybe 15 or 20.

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:41.940
Not too bad.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.078 line:0%
2012, maybe 100 to 150 pits.

00:10:47.078 --> 00:10:51.116 line:0%
But 2013, things start
getting really bad.

00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:53.852 line:0%
We see about 450
to 500 looting pits,

00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:55.453 line:0%
and even more concerning

00:10:55.453 --> 00:10:59.358 line:0%
is the significant extension
of the cemetery.

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:01.226 line:0%
This is an illegal cemetery.

00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:02.727 line:0%
This is a big problem in Egypt

00:11:02.727 --> 00:11:04.096
and in many parts of the world.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:05.965
There simply aren't
enough places

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:09.535
for the Egyptians to bury
their dead, so there's a lot

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:13.005
of illegal encroachment
on archaeological sites.

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.706
What do we do about this?

00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:17.910
How do we begin to
map this problem?

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.878
With generous funding
from National Geographic,

00:11:19.878 --> 00:11:23.649
we are in the midst of
the first comprehensive

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:27.485
looting mapping project
for an entire country.

00:11:27.485 --> 00:11:29.087
We're using satellite imagery

00:11:29.087 --> 00:11:31.457
that's openly available
and online,

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:34.860
using Google Earth,
as well as additional sources,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.896
and we're going back
12 years in time,

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:40.065
from 2002 to the present.

00:11:40.065 --> 00:11:41.233
And we're looking at

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.268
every known archaeological site
in Egypt

00:11:43.268 --> 00:11:44.770
plus many thousands of others

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.905
that I've been able to find
through my research,

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:50.309
and looking at the history of
site looting all over Egypt.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:53.112
And what's
fascinating, right now,

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:56.548
if you don't know the time
period of a looted site,

00:11:56.548 --> 00:11:59.918
you simply can't
begin to think about

00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:01.821
what objects might
be looted from it,

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:04.723
and you can't inform
Interpol and the Carabinieri

00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:07.159
and US Customs
and international authorities

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:08.727
as to what might be taken.

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:11.964
What we do know from all of
these thousands of known sites

00:12:11.964 --> 00:12:13.566
is their time period.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.634
So we can go to international
entities and say,

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:19.572
"We have 57 sites
from 600 BC

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.774
that have
extensive site looting.

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:25.777
Here is a typical tomb group
from the late period.

00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:28.079
It would have
a stone sarcophagus.

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:29.548
Here are the types of pottery

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:32.083
that come from
that particular site.

00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:35.487
Here are the shabtis, here are
other objects and artifacts

00:12:35.487 --> 00:12:36.722
from that time period."

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:38.323
So we can begin, from space,

00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:41.160
even though we can't zoom in
and see a single pot.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.729
Based on the time period
known from that site,

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:46.798
we can begin to come
up with inventories

00:12:46.798 --> 00:12:50.035
for international
authorities to look for.

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:52.037
What about more broadly?

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:54.906
With generous funding from the
National Science Foundation,

00:12:54.906 --> 00:12:57.042
I will be working directly with

00:12:57.042 --> 00:13:00.279
the Egyptian Ministry
of Antiquities

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:04.250
to set up training programs
for young Egyptians.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.052
These are the men
and the women

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:10.822
that are really the true
unsung culture heroes

00:13:10.822 --> 00:13:15.160
of post- and
pre-revolution Egypt.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.463
There's a gentleman
named Omar Farouk,

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.464
who's a very dear
friend of mine.

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:21.900
He is our head fixer in Luxor.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.302
His family has been doing

00:13:24.302 --> 00:13:26.972
archaeological work in Egypt
for 150 years.

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:30.375
His great-grandfather
was Petrie's<i> reis</i> ,

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:34.913
the chief-boss Egyptian
who worked with Petrie,

00:13:34.913 --> 00:13:38.783
the grandfather of
Egyptian archaeology.

00:13:38.783 --> 00:13:41.387
Omar and a group of young men,

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:45.523
just after the revolution
started, were under gunfire,

00:13:45.523 --> 00:13:48.393
an attack,
at Karnak Temple in Luxor.

00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:52.765
And they actually managed
to fight off a gang of looters,

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:55.800
risking their own lives
to protect this site.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.237
There are so many dozens of
stories like that all over Egypt

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:00.806
so we're hoping through
educational initiatives

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:02.807
to work with young
Egyptian men and women,

00:14:02.807 --> 00:14:04.743
to provide them tools
and resources

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:07.446
like Google Earth
and other resources for them

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:10.715
to be able to take part
in protecting their sites.

00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:12.484
So more broadly, what do we do?

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:14.753
We're hoping that this
is just the first step.

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:16.855
What we want to do
is we want to create

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:20.125
crowd-sourcing opportunities
for the world,

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:22.428
so it's not just me
and my students

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.530
doing this work in my lab,
but actually

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.266
students and individuals
from all over the world

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:31.904
can help in the search
for looting everywhere.

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:33.372
We also want to emphasize

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:36.207
just how important it is for
countries all over the world

00:14:36.207 --> 00:14:38.277
to have good site-inventories.

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:40.846
Because if you don't know
where your sites are,

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:44.983
how in the world can you
begin to protect them?

00:14:44.983 --> 00:14:47.352
While I would love to get back

00:14:47.352 --> 00:14:51.356
to my search
for settlements and pyramids,

00:14:51.356 --> 00:14:54.426
this is very important for me,

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:58.264
and certainly something
that I know

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:01.600
I will be devoting
the rest of my life to doing,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.569
and with new technologies
and new advancements,

00:15:04.569 --> 00:15:06.572
this is something that simply

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:10.976
would not have been possible
15 to 20 years ago.

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:12.844
I think the urgency is here.

00:15:12.844 --> 00:15:16.215
It's time for our generation
to do something about this.

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:18.117
Because as we've
been able to map,

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:20.152
every day we're mapping
thousands of looting pits,

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:24.757
we're seeing over a 1000%
increase in site looting

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.624
since the start
of the revolution.

00:15:26.624 --> 00:15:28.760
And billions of dollars
in antiquities

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.530
that we've estimated to date,
that have been stolen.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.299
And if we think
this is Egypt alone,

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:37.268
and you begin to scale that,
all over the world,

00:15:37.268 --> 00:15:40.305
I couldn't give a number right
now off the top of my head,

00:15:40.305 --> 00:15:42.374
but it would be very large.

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.376
This is a global issue,

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:47.012
and the time is now
to do something about it.

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.547
Thank you very much.

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:50.148
(applause)

00:15:50.148 --> 00:15:54.954
(mid-tempo music)
