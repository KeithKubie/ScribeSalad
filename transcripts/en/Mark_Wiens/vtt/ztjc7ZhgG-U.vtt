00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
[Mark] And you can just see all of those juices just mingling together within the bun.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.830
What's up everyone it's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.789
It is a blazing hot afternoon, and I had a little bit of a craving for a burger,

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.600
so we are on our way to go eat a delicious burger in Bangkok.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.800
We're going with Ying, and Phoenicia and Dwight as well right now.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.800
Dwight and I actually had a craving for burgers since yesterday,

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.400
so we had to make that craving come true!

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.549
Oh yeah, I can actually smell the grilling onions from down the street

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.930
[Ying] Yeah!

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.000
[Mark] We made it to this place which is called Daniel Thaiger,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and Daniel Thaiger is a street food hamburger truck.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.500
And they're kind of, kind of were the pioneers when it comes to the Bangkok burger movement

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.010
Burgers are very popular in Bangkok now

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.960
and they were some of the pioneers, and they still serve one of the best burgers in Bangkok.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.099
They have kind of shifted a number of different locations

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:38.880
But their location right now is right on Soi 30/1, which is actually right on the outside fence of the Philippine Embassy.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.020
And they have a truck set up,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.130
they have a nice little seating area, a couple of tables, or you can just kind of stand around here and eat.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.500
So here's the menu and you can either choose beef or pork, and then they have a couple of different set burgers:

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.070
the Thaiger, the Mr. Steve, the Cowboy, the Sumo Oat, and then some other toppings that you can add on.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.180
Trying to contemplate which burger to order ... I'm thinking of just going with the Thaiger.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.000
But I may have to ... actually, it might have to be the Mr. Steve because of that bacon.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.890
Okay Mr. Steve it is, maybe with an extra patty.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.200
My mouth is watering anticipating this burger.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.899
You can just hear the sizzling of that beef and the aroma.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.629
Maybe it's because Bangkok is so humid,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.619
literally the aroma of beef just fills the entire air.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.000
So we had to snack on some french fries as we're waiting for our burgers to finish cooking.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.950
Humidity. It's like half water in the air and half burger juices.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.920
It's like burger humidity, that's what it is!

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.520
Oh yeah, the burgers have arrived. Dwight has already started eating his burger

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.400
How is it man? So I can just increase my anticipation.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.900
[Dwight] Umm it's great, and it's getting better.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.900
[Mark] Haha!

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.580
[Dwight] As usual I've ordered mine medium, I think you order yours a little rarer than this, but this is how I like it,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.080
[Mark] Oh what is this dude?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.100
[Dwight] Animal style fries with some crispy bacon, jalapenos and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.960
their Thaiger sauce all over them.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.580
[Mark] Oh wow! Should we try this real fast before

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.240
we're dipping into the burger?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.600
[Dwight] I'm double-fisting already so...

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.700
[Mark] Okay, I will hold this. Let's just sample this immediately.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.380
There are jalapenos on here, there's bacon, there are onions

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.040
and some orange-y sauce.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.440
Oh yeah!

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.739
Well, that's awesome.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.600
Really crispy fries, but it's not too oily, not too greasy

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.440
and then, yes, good bacon, really crunchy bacon on there,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.100
sour jalapenos and then just fried onions.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.260
I got the Mr. Steve and I decided to go with the double patties which I'm not sure...

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.780
yes, it was definitely a necessary move. And then I got them medium rare.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.079
Oh and already just feeling my fingers on the bun, you can feel the bun is really soft.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.459
It is a brioche-style bun, and then they wrap it in a piece of paper,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.309
and there is bacon on here, the two patties, cheese right in the middle of the patties, sauce,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.510
there are tomatoes and lettuce, and you can just see all of those juices just just mingling together within the bun.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.920
[Mark] I'm gonna need to lean over for this one

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.580
[Ying] Mm-hmm.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.580
[Mark] I'm gonna need to lean over a little bit.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.980
All right, my first bite.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.300
Oh wow!

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.300
That's incredible!

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.920
Mmm, the bun has a really nice buttery flavor to it.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.440
It's really really soft, and then the meat is so tender

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.280
Oh that meat it's so juicy and tender. One of the things that they really emphasize here is that they always use

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.320
freshly ground beef. So it's never frozen, never frozen patties, and

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.689
just fresh, ground beef. And they seasoned it with just, I think, some salt and pepper, and then she

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.640
she fried it in some Worcestershire sauce I think. And I think that was about it and

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.500
It is just like simple perfection in a bun.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.709
That is amazing. There's so much meat

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.120
within this bun!

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.129
This is a burger where it it does get a little bit of messy, so you definitely need to have some tissue on hand.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.560
All right.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.600
That's almost everything you want in a burger.

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.309
It's so juicy, and then the meat is so fresh tasting,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.500
the bacon is crispy, but thick at the same time,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.100
and then the sauce is a little bit tangy,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.200
a little bit mayonnaise-y,

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:36.020
and then, yeah, cheese to wrap it all up, and then just multiple juices coming out from everywhere.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.810
I'm getting to the bottom portion of the burger, loving every single bite of it, and I think it's time to

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
release the burger from the paper.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.080
Oh yes, oh!

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.080
There's just a pool of juices and sauce at the bottom.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.360
Oh but what I'm really loving about this burger

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.780
is, well the beef is definitely the highlight, but the beef how it's medium-rare cooked,

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:08.599
it's so juicy and so so tender. It's kind of like half ... it tastes like like grilled

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.490
tartare, like minced ... Oh, it's just, it's just awesomely good.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.320
Oh baby.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.220
So incredibly juicy.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.769
Hmm. I'm down to my final bite.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.199
I'm just gonna soak up a little more of those juices and sauces from the bottom of the paper.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.540
Ho ho ho oh yeah

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.640
I wouldn't say that you have to order the two burger patties,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.640
but I would say that it was well well worth it.

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:53.178
It was incredible to have that much meat within the burger and that much juicy fresh meat as well.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.180
I think that's definitely what really stood out to me is the beef.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.340
Ah, just you can taste the difference between frozen beef and beef that's freshly ground, never frozen.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.120
Really good burger. I actually rarely ever eat burgers,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.280
even though I do fully enjoy burgers, and this was an amazing burger

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.920
