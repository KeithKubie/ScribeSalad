00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:04.515
5 cubed is 125, that's because five

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:09.014
cubed equals five times five times five.

00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:13.642
Two to the fifth is 32,
two to the fifth is two

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:17.698
times two times two times two times two.

00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:23.053
One to the seventh is one,
that's because one times one is one.

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:27.500
No matter how many times we multiply
one by itself, it still equals one.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.026
Four to the fourth is 256,
that's because four to

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:36.467
the fourth is four times
four times four times four.

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:39.531
These are easier to do
with a calculator but

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.602
here are some tricks to
do them by hand too.

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:46.079
You can pair things together,
so two times two is four and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900
then four times four is 16.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.510
And then I have one two left over, so

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.690
four times four times two is
16 times two which is 32.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.107
Same thing with five,
five times five is 25 and

00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:04.617
then we multiply it by five,
25 times five equals 125.

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:07.279
