♪♪

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.734
Wood: A JACKHAMMER USES A LOT
OF FORGED STEEL PARTS,

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:09.467
WHICH ARE PREFERABLE
TO CASTINGS OR PLATE STEEL

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:11.167
BECAUSE IN THE PROCESS
OF FORGING STEEL,

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.100
THE GRAIN FLOW OF
THE STEEL CONFORMS

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.667
TO THE SHAPE OF THE PART,
MAKING IT MUCH STRONGER.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:18.234
A JACKHAMMER HAS
OVER 60 PIECES,

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:20.534
WHICH ARE HELD TOGETHER
BY SEVEN BOLTS.

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:23.968
WHY BOLTS? BECAUSE IF YOU
WELD A JACKHAMMER TOGETHER,

00:00:23.968 --> 00:00:26.200
IT WOULD VIBRATE ITSELF APART.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.167
THE BOLTS ALLOW
FOR VIBRATION.

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:31.534
COMPRESSED AIR
GOES INTO A CHAMBER,

00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:34.300
AND A PILE DRIVER PUSHES THE BIT

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.767
INTO THE CONCRETE
TO BREAK IT UP.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:37.467
AND THEN THERE'S
A VALVE THAT FLIPS.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.501
THIS COMPRESSED AIR
THEN SENDS THE PILE DRIVER

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:42.000
BACK AND THE BIT BACK UP.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.534
AND THAT JUST KEEPS
GOING IN KIND OF

00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:45.734
WHAT'S CALLED
A SELF-RECIPROCATING MOTION.

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.801
THIS HAPPENS 25 TIMES A SECOND.

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.667
THE JACKHAMMER WORKS
OFF NEWTON'S LAW --

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:51.834
FORCE EQUALS MASS
TIMES ACCELERATION.

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:53.367
THE MASS IS THE BIT,

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.267
BUT THE ACCELERATION IS WHAT
THE AIR PRESSURE PROVIDES,

00:00:56.267 --> 00:00:58.734
AND THAT'S A HELL
OF A LOT OF FORCE.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:00.834
THE BUSINESS END OF A JACKHAMMER

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:03.767
IS THE FRONT-END ASSEMBLY,
AND THAT HAS A BIT.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:05.601
NOW, THAT BIT POUNDING
THE CONCRETE

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.534
CAN BUST UP TO
FIVE INCHES OF CONCRETE.

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:12.868
Narrator: OUR TEST LABORATORY
SCIENTISTS WILL NOW DEMONSTRATE.

00:01:12.868 --> 00:01:15.334
THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES
OF JACKHAMMER BITS,

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:17.367
EACH DESIGNED
FOR A SPECIFIC JOB.

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:19.534
TWO OF THE MORE COMMON
BIT TYPES INCLUDE

00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:23.167
THE POINTED BIT
FOR GENERAL BREAKING

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:24.767
AND A FLAT-TIPPED BIT,

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:29.734
WHICH ALLOWS DIRECTION CONTROL
FOR FINAL EDGE FINISH.

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.734
THESE THINGS ARE HARD TO USE
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO ATTACK

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:34.267
FROM AN ANGLE TO PREVENT THE BIT
FROM GETTING STUCK.

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:35.467
BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT
TO CONTROL IT

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:36.934
SO IT DOESN'T RUN AWAY FROM YOU.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:38.300
IF YOU'RE GONNA
BE JACKHAMMERING,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.133
WEAR YOUR SAFETY EQUIPMENT.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.701
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU TEXTING
AND OPERATING A JACKHAMMER.

00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:45.634
THE JACKHAMMER CAN BE
VERY DANGEROUS.

00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:47.367
IT CAN DESTROY YOUR HEARING.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:50.167
YOU CAN LOSE YOUR EYESIGHT.
YOU CAN PIERCE YOUR FOOT.

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:51.634
I HATE JACKHAMMERS.

00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:54.667
WHEN THEY TELL ME TO DO IT,
MY SMILE TURNS INTO A FROWN.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:56.567
I'VE ACTUALLY HAD SOME
EXPERIENCE JACKHAMMERING,

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.267
AND IT SHAKES
YOUR ENTIRE BODY.

00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:01.300
YOU CAN'T REALLY THINK STRAIGHT
BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN'S BEING

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.868
RATTLED AROUND
INSIDE YOUR SKULL.

00:02:02.868 --> 00:02:06.901
IT CAN CAUSE A CONDITION CALLED
HAND-ARM VIBRATION SYNDROME

00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.634
FROM ALL THAT
POUNDING UP AND DOWN.

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:11.400
AND THAT'S A LOT OF SHOCK
FOR YOUR BODY TO ABSORB.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE
THE JACKHAMMER OPERATOR

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.501
TAKING A BREAK.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.434
YOU THOUGHT HE WAS
JUST SOME LAZY GUY.

00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:17.801
YOU TRY HOLDING ON
TO THAT THING.
