00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.820
It’s the moment we’ve all been waiting
for: male birth control is on the way, and

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.959
it’s headed to human trials next year!

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:16.410
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and it seems
like we’ve been hearing about the idea of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.240
male birth control for years now.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.400
I hadn’t heard anything about it for a while,
so I was kinda starting to assume it was just

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.429
a pipe dream - but apparently, research is
still underway, and if all goes as planned

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.140
- it’ll be entering human trials as soon
as next year!

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
This particular drug, is called Vasalgel - and
it’s not like any birth control pill you’ve

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.340
seen before.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.560
It’s actually not a pill at all - it’s
a nonhormonal gel, that doctors inject into

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.390
the vas deferens, which is the tube that sperm
swims through.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.990
In that regard, it works exactly like a vasectomy
- but instead of physically cutting the vas

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.870
deferens, they just plug it up with this gel.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.420
It’s less invasive and way more reversible
than a vasectomy, and it’s also long-acting,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.420
meaning once the gel is in there - it stays
there for years, until you decide you don’t

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.660
want it anymore, at which point doctors can
flush it out with another injection.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.290
They’ve been doing rabbit studies on this
drug for over a year now, with successful

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.920
results - and they’re currently in the process
of testing it on baboons.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.350
So far, things are lookin’ good!

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.670
Three male baboons have now been on the drug
for 6 months, with plenty of opportunities

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.000
to mate - and no pregnancies thus far.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.050
They also just started a new study, which’ll
involve 8 additional baboons, each of whom

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.630
will have access to fertile females for a
period of 3-6 months.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.961
The final step in the process, which begins
next month - is to flush the drug out, and

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.510
make sure the reversal actually works.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.620
By the end of 2014, they should have a lot
more information on the effectiveness of Vasalgel

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.920
- but if all goes according to plan, they’ll
be starting clinical trials with humans next

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.860
year, with the ultimate goal of having it
on the market and available, as early as 2016.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.030
I gotta say - as overjoyed as I am about the
prospect of male birth control, I do wonder

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.720
why it’s taken so long to develop something
like this.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.950
But hey - who am I to complain?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.270
At this point, I’m just happy somebody’s
workin on it.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.780
Now - switching gears for a second, I wanna
remind everyone out there watching this, that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.799
I host another another show here on the TestTube
network - aptly titled TestTube.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.050
It’s a lot like Dnews - but more focused
on current events; however there is still

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.759
some science stuff in there, like this episode
Trace hosted about what the phrase “autism

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:26.730
spectrum” actually means.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.690
You can find that, along with many other episodes,
over at youtube.com/testtubenetwork.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.040
And in the meantime, if you guys have any
questions, comments, anything you wanna say

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.730
about this episode - let us know in the comments
below.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.990
Otherwise, thanks for watching!
