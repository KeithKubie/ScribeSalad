00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.910
Welcome back.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.330
Actually, before I teach you how
to figure out how high the

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.300
ball went-- and you might
already be able to figure it

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.450
out-- I want to show you
really kind of a more

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.080
intuitive way for figuring out
how fast the ball went.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.470
I used the equation this first
time, just to really show you

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.810
that this equation can be
useful, but I personally

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.430
always forget equations, so I
find it very useful to have

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.750
kind of a common sense way of
figuring it out, as well.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.650
And really, this equation was
derived by coming up with a

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.440
common sense way-- I don't know
if that last statement

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.440
made sense, but let's move on.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.200
Let's say that same problem, but
let's just think about it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.170
without our equations, because
that's always a good fall back

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.520
when you're panicking in the
middle of the exam, and you

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.190
can't remember if an equation
had a 1/2, or a 2, or a minus,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.820
or a plus, or t, or t squared.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.470
It's good just to think about
what's happening.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.770
So when I throw a ball straight
up-- I have a, let's

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.770
say it's a baseball, it looks
like a baseball-- and I throw

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.050
it straight up where my velocity
initial is equal to--

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.790
well, let's say that
this the variable.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.300
This is my initial velocity,
v sub i.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.380
What's going to happen?

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.250
As soon as I throw it up,
it's going to start

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.760
decellerating, right?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.110
Because I have the force of
gravity decelerating it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.660
immediately-- so, with gravity,
we're saying minus 10

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.640
meters per second
squared, right?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.360
This ball is going to keep
decelerating until its

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.560
velocity goes to 0, right?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.460
The ball, if we were to graph
time and distance, where this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.182
is time, and then this
is distance.

00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:44.600
Right?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.620
At time zero, we're
on the ground.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.510
The ball starts off going
really fast, then starts

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.170
slowing down, then its velocity
goes to 0, and then

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.856
it starts accelerating in the
negative direction, and it

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:02.890
starts going fast, and bam--
it hits the ground again.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.340
What happens is that the ball
starts fast, and starts going

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.699
slower, slower, slower, slower,
and slower, until its

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:15.180
velocity is 0, and then it
starts-- you could say

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.750
reaccelerating in the opposite
direction-- or decellerating,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.185
really-- but reaccelerating in
the opposite direction, and

00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:21.520
then it hits the ground.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.350
Actually, we know-- assuming
nothing about air resistance,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.170
et cetera et cetera-- that the
velocity that it hits the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.390
ground with is the same velocity
that it left your

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.220
hand with, just in the
opposite direction.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.410
So there's a couple of
interesting things here.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.300
The time at which its velocity
is at 0-- so that point right

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.080
there-- that's going to
be at t equals 2.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.410
We know that this shape is
actually a parabola, if you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.430
remember that from
algebra two.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.350
Why is that a parabola?

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.460
What was the equation for it?

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.300
We figured out the equation
using that previous formula.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.510
I don't want to use it this
time, but what was that

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.490
previous formula?

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.120
It was change in distance
is equal to vit plus at

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.230
squared over 2.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.570
It's a parabola, but I think if
you had thought about it,

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.850
you would have realized
also it's a parabola.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.050
And it points downward because
a is negative, so the t

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.710
squared term is negative--
that's why it opens to the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.166
downward side.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.850
I think that might make
a little sense to you.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.600
So what we could figure out
is, if we're given a t, we

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.200
could say well, half of that
number-- let's say that t

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.230
equals 10 seconds.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.380
So we know that in 10 seconds,
the ball left my hand, went up

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.650
some distance, and then came
back down and hit the ground.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.490
What we also know then, though,
is that t over 2 at 5

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.860
seconds, the ball was
essentially stationary for

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.890
just a moment-- its velocity had
decelerated, decelerated,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.560
decelerated, and hit 0, and then
right before it started

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.670
reaccelerating again, or
reaccelerating downwards, its

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.835
velocity was 0 at the
time t equals 0.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.340
The fact that the ball
decelerated from my initial

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.510
velocity to 0 in 5 seconds--
what does that tell us?

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.360
Well, we have the very simple
equation, you know, change in

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.960
velocity is equal to

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.380
acceleration times time, right?

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.010
You probably knew that before
watching any of these videos.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.615
And the change in the
acceleration, well, that's

00:04:30.615 --> 00:04:35.690
just the final velocity minus
the initial velocity is equal

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.460
to the acceleration
times time.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.610
In this situation, what's
the final velocity?

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.120
Remember, we're not going to
go all the way here-- we're

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.900
just figuring out from here
to time equals 2, right?

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.900
So what's the final velocity?

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.870
We're saying that point is where
the ball is not going

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.865
up, and it's not going down,
so its final velocity is 0.

00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:59.160
So, 0 minus initial velocity
is equal to acceleration--

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.700
acceleration is the acceleration
of gravity--

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.805
minus 10 meters per
second squared.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.100
I know it's a little confusing,
because I'm using

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.610
the same t, but let's say that
this time is t sub 0, just to

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.490
kind of make sure it's not a
variable, it's actual time.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.820
So this is t sub naught
over 2, right?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.480
Because the ball is motionless
right at the peak of its--

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.700
we're not an arc, but right
at the peak of its travel.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.370
So, it's acceleration times
time, but at this time, the

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.365
time is going to be t
sub naught over 2.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.980
Once again, the 0 doesn't
matter, and we can multiply

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.920
both sides times negative 1.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.290
We get plus vi, and we get vi is
equal to 10 divided by 2--

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.165
5 meters per second squared
t sub naught.

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:09.730
Which was exactly what we got in
the previous video when we

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.800
used this formula.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.000
And I think it makes sense to
you -- hopefully, this was

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.620
kind of an intuitive way of
thinking about what happened.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.850
Before actually I do the
distance, I actually want to

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.080
graph what's happening, because
I think it just dawned

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.620
on me that that might be
something that will give you

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.770
more intuition.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.785
I'm all about giving you
intuition so you never forget

00:06:27.785 --> 00:06:30.030
this stuff.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.140
So this is, if we were to
graph-- that's an ugly looking

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.800
axes, but I think you'll get the
point-- this is distance,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.000
this is time.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.486
We already said it's going to be
like a parabola, like that.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.890
Right?

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.610
Where this is t sub naught over
2, this t sub naught.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.330
It launches really fast, then
it slows down, and then it's

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.360
motionless right here,
and then it starts

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.580
reaccelerating downwards.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.470
If that's the distance,
what does the

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.790
velocity graph look like?

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.530
The velocity graph, I'll draw
right below-- I'll draw it in

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.144
another color, just
for variety.

00:07:09.144 --> 00:07:10.394
That's a bold.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.440
So over-- actually, that's not
how I want to draw it.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.400
I have to draw the negative
side, too.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:33.950
So this is time, and then this
axis is velocity, so we start

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.480
off at a positive
velocity, right?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:43.450
We start off at v sub i, and
what's going to happen here is

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.180
the velocity decreases at
a constant rate, right?

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.797
And that rate is just the
rate of acceleration.

00:07:48.797 --> 00:07:57.440
The velocity decreases until
at t sub naught-- let me

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:03.190
switch back to yellow-- at t sub
naught-- woops, I'm using

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.850
the wrong tool, it actually
looked like I was drawing

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:10.740
something-- at t sub naught,
the velocity now is

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.130
negative vi, right?

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.930
Remember we said, when the ball
comes back down, it's

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.500
going at the same velocity,
just at

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.150
the opposite direction.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:23.040
This point right here, which is
t sub naught over 2, that

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.560
corresponds to this
point, right?

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.550
Which makes sense, because
that's the point at which the

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.915
ball has no velocity.

00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:32.200
And look, the velocity is 0.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.100
So the ball starts going up
really fast, slows down at a

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.960
constant rate, and what is
the slope of this line?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.130
Well, the slope is just the
acceleration, right?

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.419
Because velocity is the
acceleration times time.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.390
And then it's stationary for
just a moment, because its

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.060
velocity is 0, and then it
starts accelerating-- or you

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.150
could say decelerating, or
accelerating in the negative

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.780
direction-- until the
point that it's

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.240
going at v sub i down.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.634
And of course, if you were to
graph acceleration-- if I were

00:09:02.634 --> 00:09:06.540
to graph acceleration
over time--

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.930
acceleration is constant.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:11.705
It's right here.

00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:14.890
Let me just get a line tool.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.850
Acceleration is just a constant
minus 10 meters per

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.420
second, so it's going
to look like that.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.420
And it's just the slope
of this line.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.370
If you know calculus, it'll make
sense to you that this

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.475
line is the derivative of this
line, or this curve.

00:09:28.475 --> 00:09:30.570
This line is the derivative
of this curve.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.990
And even if you don't know
calculus, I think it makes

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:38.010
sense to you that this is
the slope of this line.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.920
And just so, if you haven't
learned calculus, a derivative

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.460
is just to a way of figuring out
a slope at any point along

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.770
the curve, so it's nothing
too fancy.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.770
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
