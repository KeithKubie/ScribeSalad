00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So as usual, we're going to make an inventory of concepts in the game.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This time I'm going to try to break things out a little bit,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I'm going to talk about low-level concepts,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
high-level concepts, and mid-level concepts.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
As we saw in the discussion forums

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
there's always a question of where do you want to start.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Do you want to describe the low level first and build up from there?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Do you want to describe the high level first and build down?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I think for this case we'll take more of a middle out approach.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, at the mid level there's the concept of current state of the game.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're sort of inching towards a search problem,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and we know that we have to represent states for a search problem.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So, we want to know the current state of the game.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If we're thinking of search problems

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
then we also have to know about actions we can take.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We know that there are two actions: Roll and hold.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, here's some candidates for what's in the current state.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
First, the things that were on the scoreboard.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The scoreboard, remember, had three things.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Then the player whose turn it is, we might want that to be part of the state.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The previous role of the dice, whether I just rolled a five or something else,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that might be part of the state.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The previous turn score, how much did the other player just make on their turn?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So, all of these are possibilities.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You might be able to think of other possibilities.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I want you to tell me which one of these are necessary to describe the state of the game.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I guess I should say here that we're assuming that the goal of the game,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the number of points you need win, we're assuming that's constant

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and doesn't need to be represented in each individual state.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We just represent it once for the whole game.

00:01:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Which of these are necessary for the current state?
