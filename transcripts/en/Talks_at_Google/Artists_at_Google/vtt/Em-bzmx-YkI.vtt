&gt;&gt;male speaker 1: Hey, hey hey.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.650
&gt;&gt;male speaker 2: Thank you.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.650
[Applause]

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.189
&gt;&gt;Female speaker: Hi, my name is Claire Stapleton.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.170
I'm delighted to welcome Peter Hedges and
Joel Edgerton to Google today,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.980
and to talk about their new film
which you just saw the trailer for,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.160
The Odd Life of Timothy Green
which Peter wrote and directed,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.160
and Joel stars in.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.400
So, to quickly introduce these our esteemed
guests:

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.730
Peter is a novelist, playwright, and filmmaker.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.570
His first novel What's Eating Gilbert Grape
became a movie in 1993

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.080
with Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.210
He was nominated for an Oscar in 2002
for best adapted screenplay for About a Boy,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.219
and he made his directorial debut in 2003
with Pieces of April.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.860
Joel is an Australian actor
who's been in Star Wars Episodes Two and Three,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.059
he had a very memorable role,
and in 2010's critically acclaimed Animal

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.449
Kingdom,
and he'll also be playing Tom Buchanan

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.570
in the upcoming Baz Lurhmann adaptation
of The Great Gatsby.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.601
So, before we get into the odd life,
I just want to talk about your career Peter,

00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:00.309
and we have a couple clips from your movie
history

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.660
and what really struck me about your career
is that you've written in so many different

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.370
forms,
started as a playwright, you've written a

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.550
few novels,
screenplays, you've adapted novels to screenplays.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.480
So let's start with a clip from the first
movie you wrote

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.560
What's Eating Gilbert Grape.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560
Let's roll the clip.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.560
[pause]

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.560
[Applause]

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.560
&gt;&gt;Peter: Mm hmm.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:31.360
&gt;&gt;Claire: So to start us off, I was just curious
to hear

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.780
about the process of adapting your novel to
the screen

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.220
and what that was like, what that experience
was like.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.840
&gt;&gt;Peter: Well, Gilbert Grape, What's Eating
Gilbert Grape was my first novel

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.050
and I had the opportunity to write the screenplay
but because I came from writing for the theater

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.660
I liked writing dialog and I was working with
a great filmmaker,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.290
Lasse HallstrÃ¶m who's Swedish
and wasn't as interested in dialog

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.730
because film is ultimately a visual storytelling
experience.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.990
So it was great, it was great.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.170
It was hard.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.570
I started writing and Johnny Depp was a big
fan of the novel

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.790
and committed to do the film before the screenplay
was done,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.390
so we were in pre-production
and I'm still trying to figure out how to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.720
format a screenplay,
and before we knew it, we were filming.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.780
And it was a great education because the novel
is written

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.510
from kind of a Holden Caulfield-esque first
person narrator voice.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.920
Gilbert's very angry and he exaggerates everything.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.930
He's quite unreliable, and Lasse said, "Look,
when we make the film,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.170
you can't make it in the tone of the book
because then we'll be making fun of everyone,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.150
and I can't, I just can't make fun of these
people."

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.630
And so that was probably the most--well first
of all learning

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.140
how to to tell the story visually, and in
the cuts,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.590
and with the fewest words possible was one
of the challenges.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.420
And the other was this, this education in
tone

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:29.090
and how to tell the story so it would--it
wouldn't be making fun of the people

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.440
the way Gilbert was.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.150
To go from the first person unreliable to
sort of a third person kind of experience.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.110
&gt;&gt;Claire: Mmm hmm.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.069
Cool, very cool.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.880
So next we're going to move on to your directorial,
feature directorial debut, Pieces of April.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.440
So let's roll that clip.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.440
[Pause]

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.340
&gt;&gt;Peter: Thank you.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.340
[Applause]

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.990
&gt;&gt;Claire: Patricia Clarkson is so good.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.990
[Laughs]

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.340
&gt;&gt;Peter: She's so good, we actually shot that
scene in thirty minutes.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.630
The entire scene.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.790
&gt;&gt;Claire: So actually leads into my next question,
about making this your first directorial feature

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.740
and sort of how you chose that
and what kind of stories are you attracted

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.750
to more generally?

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.989
&gt;&gt;Peter: Well, I'm attracted to stories about
people,

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.410
people that are ordinary that--eh--maybe have
extraordinary moments.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.790
I don't really like writing about extraordinary
people

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.990
but more maybe because I feel ordinary
and everyone I know is kind of ordinary--no,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.850
you're not ordinary--I'm sorry.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.180
But this particular story, I had been greatly
inspired

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.610
by a really beautiful Danish film called The
Celebration

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.490
Thomas Vinterberg wrote and directed.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.750
It was the first film made with a sort of
cinematic school called the Dogme school

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.250
where you shot with digital cameras and available
light.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.070
It's a really brilliant film, I--just it's
a masterpiece.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.400
And so I'd wanted to direct ever since I'd
written Gilbert Grape,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.530
and this particular story was born out of
trying to pick up a girl on the subway

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.449
before--long before I was married, I'm happy
to say, LONG before I

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.280
even met my now wife, and also born out of
the fact

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.440
that my mother was dying of cancer when I
rediscovered

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.320
the notes for this movie, and while it's not
about my mom,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.740
it's kind of a tribute to my mom.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.250
We shot it for three hundred thousand dollars
in sixteen days

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.410
and that particular scene was the one they
showed

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.340
when Patty was nominated for an Academy Award
and I'm quite proud of it because that was

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.120
the scene--it was the one scene in the movie
I actually knew how to shoot .

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.430
And we went to shoot it my way and Oliver
Platt pulled me aside

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.330
and said,"Peter, what are you doing?"
and I said, "I have this great concept for

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.389
the scene,"
and he said, "No, no, no.

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.000
It's much simpler."

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.889
And so I threw out my plan and went with a
simpler approach

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.960
and it's just one of those great examples
where others teach you

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.830
and that's probably why I love going from
novel writing to film making

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.620
because when you make a film you are taught
by the people you work with.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.940
I think a lot like what you feel here, working
here.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.300
That I have in a kind of very intense, very
focused period when you are filming.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.910
You just every day, you have the light, you
have the time you have,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.220
and you get what you can get.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.220
And you hope.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.180
&gt;&gt;Claire: I was reading that you said that
making a film is sort of like writing a novel

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.280
with a group of people?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.280
&gt;&gt;Peter: Yes.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.420
&gt;&gt;Claire: I find that a very interesting comment
so I was wondering if you could tell us a

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.420
little more about that.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.420
&gt;&gt;Peter:Well it is.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.680
The great part of film making is this business
of other people.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.830
And you end up, you have your intention,
I mean, I always have a hope when I start

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:07.180
to tell a story
that it will end up something like what I

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.970
hope it will end up like.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.139
But it always gets changed, and seasoned and
influenced

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.780
by the people with whom you work.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.840
And so there are moments, for instance in
our new film,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.150
or any of the other films,
that I didn't anticipate.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:30.100
So you basically are setting the table,
or if you think of it as a party metaphor,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.930
you're planning a party, you invite a bunch
of people,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.230
and you hope for the best, you know.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.229
Sometimes the party has a theme, and sometimes
people come in costume.

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:45.390
&gt;&gt;Claire: So as you're dreaming up a story,
do you think in different formats and forms?

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.330
Do you think this story is a novel versus
film versus a, you know,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.590
what you're going to tell your kids before
they go to bed or?

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.310
&gt;&gt;Peter: Great question.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:08:01.620
The story begins to dictate whether it's a
play, or a novel, or a film,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:08.639
and it usually is--if you're going to spend
a lot of time with thought and how people

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:12.902
think,
that's going to become--more likely to become

00:08:12.902 --> 00:08:14.880
the novel.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.530
If I imagine it all taking place in a room,
with really great protracted conversation,

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.800
that's probably going to be a play.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.180
And then--but sometimes those things cross
over too,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:36.509
but my job is to try to get myself ready
so that I'm as open as possible for the story

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:38.449
that occurs.

00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:45.470
And to get out of the story's way, in a sense,
to, you know I have my hope of what it's going

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:51.360
to be,
but it will change over time, because, you

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.759
know, you think it's going one way,
and then it gets pulled another way.

00:08:56.759 --> 00:09:02.640
So just trying to stay true to it,
and, I think what I hope for when I tell a

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.740
story
is that it will be useful to you in some way.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.459
And my hope is that if it's useful to me and
to the people around me,

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:17.269
the people who first read or you know watch
the first cut,

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:23.189
if it's working with them, then I'm hoping
that my world isn't so rarefied

00:09:23.189 --> 00:09:30.870
that nobody else in the world will respond.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.930
But ultimately the hope is that the story
that I'm working on,

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:41.959
because each thing takes years always, will
change me in some way, you know?

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:44.069
That's kind of the secret hope.

00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:45.069
Sometimes--

00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:47.139
&gt;&gt;Claire: That's so poetic.

00:09:47.139 --> 00:09:48.369
&gt;&gt;Peter: Wow.

00:09:48.369 --> 00:09:51.529
Well, here we are, trying to be poetic.

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:56.079
&gt;&gt;Claire: Okay, let's fast forward to your
recent film

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:59.209
starring Steve Carell: Dan in Real Life.

00:09:59.209 --> 00:10:00.209
Let's roll it.

00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:01.660
[Pause]
[Applause]

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:08.499
&gt;&gt;Claire: You really, now that I think about
it,

00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:11.709
you really have the best women in your repertoire.

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:15.029
Emily Blunt's also in that one, one of my
personal favorites,

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:17.249
but Juliette Binoche is amazing.

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:22.679
&gt;&gt;Peter: Probably--the truth is, before I
knew he existed,

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:24.589
I wanted to be Joel or the equivalent.

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:28.850
I wanted to be an actor, and I trained to
be an actor.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.769
The joke in drama school was the harder I
worked, the better everyone else got.

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:35.839
[Laughter]
So--but what happened was I went to school

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:39.800
with some pretty remarkable people,
Mary Louise Parker was in college with me,

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.910
Joe Mantello who directed Wicked on Broadway,
he's one of our great directors,

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:50.100
and I started writing plays for my friends,
and that's how I became a wri--I didn't set

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.240
out to be a writer,
I just wanted to be a part of that collective

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.069
experience of making theater,
and I also felt like I could create roles

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:03.529
for my friends
that would show other sides of them

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:08.259
that maybe people, maybe my teachers hadn't
seen yet.

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:12.619
So it was--that was the only goal to create
work

00:11:12.619 --> 00:11:15.850
and create work for my friends.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.889
In many ways, it's the same thing I'm doing
now,

00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:25.559
it's just I get to write something
and then I get to work with someone like Joel,

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.660
and Jennifer Garner,
and all the different actors I've gotten to

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.790
work with,
I didn't go to school with them, I didn't

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.649
know them
but I know their work, sometimes I don't their

00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:38.569
work,
and I meet them through the audition process.

00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:42.779
That is--that goes back to that notion of
other people

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:51.139
and you know I feel the most vital,
the most alive certainly in my work when I'm

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:56.839
actively engaged
with people who are better at what they do

00:11:56.839 --> 00:11:59.130
than I could ever be.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:04.600
And--and--and there's a story,
there's an intention to tell that story

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:11.079
and then there's that process of life and
the different people coming together

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:14.139
and you end up with what you end up with.

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:20.490
That scene that you just saw, that was the
last scene we filmed, you know,

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.230
in Dan in Real Life and anyway.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:31.759
I particularly love writing for actresses,
I just think there are so many,

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.970
ha, how many great actresses.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.749
I mean, there are just so--
you fell it when you go to cast a movie you

00:12:37.749 --> 00:12:39.299
go,
"Well, there's a couple of guys who could

00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:45.259
play that part,"
and then there are so many great women acting,

00:12:45.259 --> 00:12:46.850
and not enough great roles for them.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.850
So--

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.170
&gt;&gt;Joel: That seems to be more the point to
me as well.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.290
&gt;&gt;Peter: That there aren't enough roles.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.389
&gt;&gt;Joel: That there isn't enough--

00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:54.800
&gt;&gt;Peter: It's true.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.589
&gt;&gt;Joel: --great roles for women, in comparison
to the roles

00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:01.850
that are written for men.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:07.889
'Cause I think the movie business is more
like the stock exchange

00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:12.550
than anyone within the industry or the artists
within the industry

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.290
would care to--like it to be anyway.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:23.759
It's like we're all like stocks on the market,
you have a certain stock and then men and

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:28.279
women have different stock
because it relates to what the audiences want

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:31.209
to see,
and I think the studios are fixed on this

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:39.110
idea that my stories need to be driven by
men,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:45.079
because that's what audiences want to see,
which is not necessarily true.

00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:49.759
And I think a lot of women that I know who
are actresses,

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:56.569
who are actors, feel like a lot of the times
the role of a woman, you know, in a lot of

00:13:56.569 --> 00:14:01.369
studio type movies
is to the woman who sits around home fretting

00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:04.670
about the guy who's the cop,
who's actually doing all the cool stuff in

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.269
the movie
and those kind of just sort of side car roles

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:14.059
to men,
who are the engine of a movie, which is a

00:14:14.059 --> 00:14:15.059
shame.

00:14:15.059 --> 00:14:21.069
And to the point where I actually think it's
much tougher

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.569
to be an actress than an actor.

00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:24.699
&gt;&gt;Peter: Definitely.

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:26.610
&gt;&gt;female speaker: What do you do to change
it?

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.610
&gt;&gt;Joel: What do you do to change it?

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:33.040
You write the roles like guys like Peter
and you give them the chance to make movies.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.699
Yeah, that's it and I think that the way to
change anything

00:14:36.699 --> 00:14:44.339
is at the base, and the base of all things
movies is the script,

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:50.379
and unfortunately, I think a lot of Hollywood
doesn't value the screenwriter

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:59.649
as much as they should in the process,
and sometimes kind of puts the cart before

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:04.029
the horse in a way
in that movies sometimes start being shot

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.759
before the script is finished.

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:10.610
Which to me, is a big problem, but we don't
need to get into that,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.610
I've said my piece so [laughs]

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.519
&gt;&gt;Claire: So Peter do you write with that
in mind?

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:16.839
The inequality facing actresses?

00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:24.910
&gt;&gt;Peter: Well, I do, but--but mainly because
there's so many actresses

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.689
I want to work with.

00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:37.329
I don't think that I can single-handedly change
that much, but the stories that I am drawn

00:15:37.329 --> 00:15:39.730
to,
and the characters I care about often are

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.730
women.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.369
The people in my life that most astonish me
over and over again,

00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:50.350
apart from my children who happen to be boys,
are women.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:58.189
So, my favorite playwright, Tennessee Williams,
wrote the greatest roles for women of any

00:15:58.189 --> 00:16:03.999
writer I think perhaps ever.

00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:10.350
But ultimately what you want to put down anytime
you put something down on the page,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:15.779
you want to put down, male or female, old
or young, a part that an actor,

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:22.950
a really good actor, would want to play,
I think that because the only way that the

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:29.169
stories I write get made,
are if actors of a certain caliber want to

00:16:29.169 --> 00:16:30.339
be in them.

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:32.889
So it's incumbent on me to put something on
the page

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:36.600
that they go, "I can't wait to play this role."

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.500
But I think that makes me a better writer
because if you're putting something on the

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:47.509
page that an actor want to play,
you've given them a lot to do, a lot of range,

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:50.670
or a lot of places they get to go.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.970
And that means then that the script's gonna
presumably have more depth,

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.939
more surprise, more nuance, more meaning.

00:16:57.939 --> 00:17:01.709
And all of those things are the stuff of the
movies I like.

00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:05.710
I like movies about people, and sometimes
they're sweet,

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.190
and sometimes they're funny, sometimes they're
darker,

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:15.360
but ultimately, I go to movies because I want
to be reminded of what it means to be alive.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.900
&gt;&gt;Claire: Okay.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:22.810
Okay, let's switch gears and talk about The
Odd Life of Timothy Green.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.661
Maybe Joel you could tell us a little bit
about the story

00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:25.720
for the folks that haven't seen it.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.459
&gt;&gt;Joel: I didn't write it.

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:31.890
[Audience and Joel laugh]

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.330
The Odd Life of Timothy Green--this is where
you get to find out

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.420
why actors get given words to say.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.540
Because they're not very eloquent when they
make stuff up for themselves,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.770
so here we go.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.780
The Odd Life of Timothy Green,
written by the wonderful life of Peter Hedges,

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.860
look, it's a story about a very deserving
couple,

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:59.630
who unfortunately can't--find out they can't
have a child, of their own, by normal means.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.480
And in a way to get over the grief of the
news,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:07.790
they dream up, in their living room, over
a bottle of wine,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.080
the kind of child that they might have if
they could have a child.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:17.410
And the dreams are for a kind of a wonderful
child.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:23.370
And then to pass through that and get over
that, they bury these ideas in the garden,

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:32.510
and by a twist of magic fate they're delivered
this child

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.770
and the child, as they--bring this child into
their home--

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.970
See, now you know what I was talking about--

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.830
&gt;&gt;Peter: You're doing great.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.230
&gt;&gt;Joel: Am I?

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.230
&gt;&gt;Peter: Yes.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.230
[Audience laughs]

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.420
&gt;&gt;Joel: Thank you, thank you.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:52.370
Starts to teach them a lot about themselves,
and it, not only them, but transforms-- this

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:59.550
young child Timothy transforms this town
and it's a movie that's really about a lot

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:05.900
of things that are so true
to family and real life, but it has a wonderful

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:11.740
kind of magic dust to it,
in the same way that E.T. had for me, or It's

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.740
a Wonderful Life.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.450
And it's a very positive and optimistic film.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.370
There you go, that's all I'm gonna say.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.180
&gt;&gt;Claire: So, you of course play Timothy's
father,

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.810
and I think we have a clip of your sort of
going out there

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:30.930
with your little son, taking him to school.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.130
Let's roll it.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.190
[pause]

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.260
[Applause]

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:40.300
&gt;&gt;Claire: Can you tell us a little bit about
your character

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:47.140
and kind of working with Jennifer to create
the portrait of these two people?

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:58.190
&gt;&gt;Joel: Yeah, well, Jim is just a good guy,
and he is --look, I saw Jim as a bit of an

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.530
"everyman",
you know so much of this film is very relatable.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.340
It's a town that is a town near you--sorry
I'm spitting--

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.240
it's a town that's a town near you that you
can relate to,

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.480
populated by people that you feel you know.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.720
And Jim is that guy who is just well deserving
guy,

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.420
there doesn't seem to be a mean spirited bone
in his body and almost to his own detriment,

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:27.990
he has an inability to kind of be really assertive,
particularly with his father, which is a very

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:35.720
relatable issue I know to a lot of people
and myself included sometimes, and to his

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.660
boss at work.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:44.820
And he has a lovely wife who is played by
Jennifer Garner,

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:51.890
who's just, I can't say enough good things
about Jennifer.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:58.580
Whatever you get from her onscreen as a good
person and as a warm kind of force,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.640
is exactly what she's like in life and as
a mother,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:09.350
and so she's kind of like almost the most
tailor made person for this movie, yes?

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.860
&gt;&gt;Claire: It's an amazing cast.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.180
As you mentioned,
Jennifer, Ron Livingston, Diane Wiest, Rosemarie

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.180
DeWitt, Common,
and so Peter, I'm wondering if you can tell

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:25.250
us a little bit more about this project
and directing it, experience?

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:31.970
&gt;&gt;Peter: Well, what--when you cast a film
what you try to do is put people in that you

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:37.260
would run to work with every day,
wake up every day and look at the call sheet

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.470
and go,
"oh my God, I can't believe today we get Dianne

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.720
Wiest."

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.300
And on this film, because they--we had Joel
and Jennifer everyday,

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:52.490
I think there may be one day that neither
of you worked,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.290
but you were there all the time,
which was great.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:22:01.980
And we had C.J., the incredible boy
who plays Timothy, who had been in my previous

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:02.980
film, Dan in Real Life.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.270
I met him when he was six and he's only been
in two films.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.600
&gt;&gt;Claire: Such a wise little dude.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.300
&gt;&gt;Peter: He is the wise little dude.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.760
And he kept us very honest, he also kept us
from swearing on the set--

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.400
&gt;&gt;Joel: Well--

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.400
&gt;&gt;Peter:--but he was great!

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:27.080
And again,
the cast in this film is--every cast I've

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.690
had on the three I've gotten to direct,
and even Gilbert Grape cast is staggering

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:37.180
when you look at it twenty years later,
you go, âHow did we have all these people?"--but

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:45.490
this cast is very special to me
because I'm still the guy who wanted to be

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.450
an actor, whose trying to write roles
that actors I want to hang out with will want

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.350
to play.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.240
It's a great job,
because there they are.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.250
Everyone who came to this film came for the
right reason,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:04.340
they understood what the film was, and at
times they understood it better than I did.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.890
Ron Livingston who plays, well, really kind
of a jerk in the movie.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:14.600
Kind of the anti-Jim,
Jim's boss, he brought things to the role

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.970
that I could never have imagined.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.100
Rosemarie DeWitt in the same way plays Jennifer's
sister.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.270
And so, these actors got to play with each
other

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.700
and while it is a fairytale and it's a sweet
movie,

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:35.100
I wanted it to be rooted from the very beginning
in something very real and very true.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.260
And so, there's a lot of joy in the movie,
and there's a lightness of a Vivaldi-esque

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.080
kind of skip to the movie,
which was my intention 'cause I just think

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:53.810
there's a--there's so much leaden,
dark clouds just hanging over everything that--I

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:58.220
think it's possible to look
at some of what we're in the middle of a bit

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.220
differently.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.650
And Timothy does that, right?

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:05.500
So we cast a kid who can be so disarming,
and he can kind of say, âGee, maybe it's

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.930
not exactly the way you think it is,
maybe it's also this."

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.320
There's a wonderful moment where he goes--his
dad forces him to be on the soccer team,

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:19.560
he has no business playing soccer, because
they imagined their kid

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.730
would score the winning goal.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.410
So he's on the soccer team,
and he goes and he forces, Common's the soccer

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:29.430
coach, does a great job,
and Timothy goes out for the first practice,

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.430
and he keeps falling.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.800
He falls repeatedly.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.990
And the parents are just like in agony,
going "[choking noises] Ah this is awful."

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.020
And the coach is horrified,
and Timothy's smiling, and they say to him,

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.080
âWhy are you smiling, why're you smiling?"

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.000
And Timothy says, "I can only get better."

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.850
And I could apply that to all sorts of instances
in my life,

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.540
if I had that wisdom, you know, some kids
have that wisdom

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.540
and some kids don't.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.780
Some kids have bigger black clouds hanging
over them

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.910
than any adult we know.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:10.820
So, it felt like, when you can put those actors,
you know, you get to play with them.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.230
It's why LeBron James wants to play with Dwayne
Wade and Chris Bosh basically,

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.470
and everyone gets upset about it, but I also
understand it,

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.820
because you want to play with people who know
that you know they're going to pass you the

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.820
ball.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.220
They're going to make you better.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.580
You also know that you're going to have to
bring your "A" game at every moment.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.940
When Dianne Wiest walks on a set,
if I donât have, if I'm not at full throttle,

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.490
I'm gonna get crushed.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.100
Not because she's mean, she's not mean, she's
that brilliant.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:47.330
So you just, the crew, everybody, whenever
she was on, everybody just had a little pop

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:51.240
in their step
because Dianne Wiest, one of our great actresses,

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.920
was in the room.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.940
What you want is to not be the smartest person
in the room,

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.330
which is frequently easy for me, it happens
all the time,

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.300
and you want to be with people who make you
better.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.620
When I was a kid, I lived next to Lee and
Larry Silverstein, they were two years older

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.300
than me,
they were the best athletes, they were the

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:15.600
smartest kids, and I hung out with them,
and I lost every football game, every baseball

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.590
game, every basketball game, every chess match.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:26.250
They crushed me all the time, but then when
I went to play with my peers, I was unstoppable,

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.470
because I'd played with the Silversteins,
and so.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.290
It's nice being at Google,
because when you walk around and you feel,

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.560
you feel the energy here, that's what you
all are doing.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.000
You're playing with the Silverstein's, and
you are playing with people who are making

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.310
you better.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:47.190
And that is one of the things I've learned
after thirty years of doing this,

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.720
is that it's okay to need help, and it's okay
to work with people

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.770
who are going to make you better.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:58.510
And if you're--you have to have enough ego
to believe your ideas worth putting out in

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:04.280
the world but you have to have enough humility
to realize that you can't do it alone and

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:15.810
it won't be half as good as you imagined it
if you allow it to be impacted by people who

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:21.590
share an intention
and who are not malicious, but ultimately

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.090
desiring to be a part of making something.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.059
And ultimately, Timothy Green, what Timothy's
real message

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:31.630
is that we need to be making again, we need
to be making things.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.710
And it's not a big preachy part of the movie,
but it's some part of the movie I'm really

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.150
proud of.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.491
And one of the things that Joel won't say
about himself, I'm going to brag about him

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.560
for a second because he's one of the greatest
actors--

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.110
&gt;&gt;Joel: In this room.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:49.460
&gt;&gt;Peter:--I can ever imagine I'll get to work
with, [Claire laughs] and he says he's not

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.820
a writer,
I've read his screenplays.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.811
He's an amazing writer, he's going to be directing,
he's got a collective in Australia, they're

00:27:55.811 --> 00:27:59.170
going to be making very very important films.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:00.170
They already are.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.170
And--

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.170
&gt;&gt;Joel: We have our own YouTube channel.

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.170
[Laughter]

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.820
&gt;&gt;Peter: I think there will come a time in
your lives, those of you sitting here,

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.330
when you remember back, not just when Peter
Hedges was here talking about himself,

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.890
but when you sat in the presence of Joel Edgerton
and I really felt it when I met him,

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.490
was so thrilled Disney let me cast him.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:23.970
And then he gives this great performance
and now I get to tour the country with him,

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.540
and realize that I'm playing with the Silversteins,
he just happens to be about fifteen years

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.540
younger than me.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.310
&gt;&gt;Claire: I predict a buddy cop comedy for
the two of you to star in.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.170
[laughter]
Oh I actually did want to ask about the theme

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:42.640
of making things,
there's like this elemental quality of creating

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.010
stuff,
I mean even when Timothy is sort of spreading

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.860
his arms out
and looking at the light, it's almost like

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.180
he's receiving some sort of divine inspiration.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.820
I'm wondering if there's some mystical theory
of creativity going on here?

00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:00.870
&gt;&gt;Peter: No, I don't think it's anything mystical
other than my mother,

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:05.210
when she was very sick would--and we were
spending all our time trying to get

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:10.860
new treatments and find new doctors and do
what you do when someone you love is, you

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:16.390
know, failing physically--
she would constantly be asking me, or calling

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.711
me and saying, âWhat are you making?"
and I'd say, "Well, I'm working, I've got

00:29:19.711 --> 00:29:23.410
a doctor on the other line so can you--?"
and she'd say,"No, no, no.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.410
Forget it.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.470
I want to know what you're making."

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:34.800
And in my, those moments, true story, in those
moments when I really miss her

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:42.360
the conversation I imagine at the end of the
day is what I tried to make that day.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:48.000
And I just think that is--you know you can
make life, you can make a family,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.680
you can make a charity, you can make something
and I think that is,

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.180
that's when I feel the most vital when I'm
a part of making something,

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:05.400
that's when I feel the people in my life are
the most vital when they're engaged in the

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.400
making.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.800
And it's not so much the selling of something,
we're in a stage where we're out talking about

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.460
our film,
which is kind of the act of selling,

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.830
[Joel coughs]
but we're also trying to make you aware of

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:20.260
what we made,
which is maybe a nicer way of saying it, but--

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.500
&gt;&gt;Joel: It's a double make.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.500
&gt;&gt;Peter: It's a double make.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.280
But I think we both agree, and I'm sure you
agree too,

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.290
that the moments that you most treasure are
those moments where you're fully engaged,

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:37.620
and something is emerging and you quite don't
know what it is and it's bubbling forth,

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:45.010
so that's what in it, without actually preaching
about it--I'm the son of a minister

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:52.390
so I'm not trying to preach in my films--
but I do, that's one of the things my mom

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:57.680
taught me,
is to always be making or appreciating others

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.960
who are making,
encouraging others who are making, and so

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.170
I tried to put a little of that in our film.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.170
&gt;&gt;Claire: Very cool.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:13.270
So, I think we have one last clip, um, of
the movie, so let's roll it.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.740
[pause]

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.210
[applause]

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.140
[Joel laughs]

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:23.670
&gt;&gt;Claire: So Peter, you've had kids in a lot
of your works,

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:29.500
so I'm wondering if you have thoughts,
or rules around how you write kids to be so

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.810
kind of believable
and--Timothy is obviously a unique

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.930
and special little person, but still?

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:44.620
&gt;&gt;Peter: There's nothing I do differently
for a kid role that I wouldn't do for an adult

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.620
role.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.200
Kids are people too, turns out, surprise!

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.170
But they really are.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:54.590
Joel said something really great in--was it
Houston or Atlanta?

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:59.840
But he was talking when he said,
because he's often asked, âHow can you play

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.020
a father, when you know,
how do you play a father if you're not a father?"

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:09.429
But he's got a great answer for it,
but at one point he said, "I don't understand

00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:19.610
people who have no patience for kids,
because they were kids once."

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:24.070
So the hard thing when you make a movie like
this,

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:32.929
and put a kid in it, is--Jennifer said it--
when you cast a kid in a movie, you're responsible

00:32:32.929 --> 00:32:35.290
for them for life.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.430
Because this movie could change their life
in ways,

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:46.740
I mean you never know, some movies come out
and nobody sees them, but- but-weâre very

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.820
careful when we cast,
I am when I cast a kid.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.790
I always meet the parents.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.250
Get to know the family.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:57.380
Is it a family, is the kid really the person
who wants to be in the movie,

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:02.450
or is it the parents who need the kid to make
the movie so they can live off the check?

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:06.240
Which is sometimes the case, or they need
their kid to become somebody

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.380
so they can fill the hole that they have in
their own life.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.810
&gt;&gt;Joel: Which is a lot of what the movie's
about too.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:13.810
&gt;&gt;Peter: Which is what the movie's about.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.810
&gt;&gt;Joel: It would be ironic if you chose a
child like that.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.960
&gt;&gt;Peter: It would be [laughter] a bit ironic,
and a bit sad.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.110
But I remember when we cast C.J. because I'm
so fond of him,

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:29.360
I've known him since he was six years old,
and I got very emotional when it was so evident

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.900
that he needed to be Timothy.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:38.179
But I had that moment of thinking, "Oh, you
know, have--is this going to, you know, ruin

00:33:38.179 --> 00:33:40.520
his life?"

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.040
And so far, it's not ruined his life, it's
enhanced it.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.200
It's certainly enhanced all of our lives.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.830
He just comes from a great family, and he's
a great kid,

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:58.780
Odeya, too, plays the young girl, just amazing
family, just amazing kid.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:03.270
So, they make us better, I think they make
us more honest.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:08.220
You know you want people who, again it's like
when you play

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:12.230
with people who are better than you or smarter
than you

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:17.809
or have more experience than you, have a purer
heart than you,

00:34:17.809 --> 00:34:19.399
they impact you.

00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:25.559
And hopefully we were good guardians of them
too.

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:32.619
&gt;&gt;Joel: And children, from an actor's perspective,
I think a lot of actors are kind of grown

00:34:32.619 --> 00:34:39.569
up children in that you're a person
who's managed not, hopefully, to not lose

00:34:39.569 --> 00:34:41.539
touch with an imagination.

00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:48.369
A child has a purity of imagination and in
fact a kind of play in their life

00:34:48.369 --> 00:34:53.339
that isn't fused with too much shame and shyness
and embarrassment

00:34:53.339 --> 00:34:57.300
and you know, you see it with kids in your
life, with nephew and nieces or children,

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.150
that at some point a sense of judgment, a
kind of outward kind

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:06.269
of judgment and shame and embarrassment
starts to grow in them where,

00:35:06.269 --> 00:35:12.210
once upon a time, they'll climb a tree and
pretend to be a monkey--Oh a friend of mine

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.700
told me this--
the reason I'm saying this--A friend of mine

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.880
told me this terrible story
about how he used to balance on this sort

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.210
of play swing thing,
and pretend to be a monkey and pretend to

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:26.640
be eating things out of his hair
and scratching his armpits and stuff, and

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:33.160
one day, at the age of eleven or something,
looked up and saw the entire neighbor's family

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.609
looking at him from their kitchen window and
laughing at him,

00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:40.200
and it was a day he realized he couldnât
be a monkey any more [Peter sighs sadly]

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.519
and I find that really funny, but really really
sad

00:35:43.519 --> 00:35:48.480
and that's to me the part that some actors
thankfully don't lose,

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:54.289
is that switch that allows them to really
indulge in being someone else,

00:35:54.289 --> 00:35:57.430
or dressing up, or being weird and wonderful
and embarrassing themselves

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:58.769
without too much shame.

00:35:58.769 --> 00:36:04.150
So, as a grownup person, being in a movie
when you work with a child,

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:07.589
oftentimes they'll really educate you again
about

00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:13.369
really making sure that that avenue that you
have to your imagination is really pure,

00:36:13.369 --> 00:36:17.640
because there's no teaching a kid how to say
lines, because that's artificial,

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.619
they need to just really be kind of in the
moment and they are,

00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:27.289
and they can be, you know,
there are times where I walk away like, "I

00:36:27.289 --> 00:36:32.310
was such a faker today and that kid just really
schooled me."

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.000
[Joel laughs] I'll talk to you outside you
little--

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.079
[Peter and Joel laugh]

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:42.460
&gt;&gt;Claire: Has being a dad changed or influenced
your approach to storytelling at all?

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:47.769
&gt;&gt;Peter: Oh, very much so, although my teenaged
boys are desperate for me to do something

00:36:47.769 --> 00:36:48.819
very cool.

00:36:48.819 --> 00:36:54.079
[laughter]
They really want dad to do something cool

00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:55.079
and um--

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.530
&gt;&gt;Joel: You'll have to stop making stuff and
start destroying stuff.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.800
&gt;&gt;Peter: I know, that's right, I'll have to
blow something up in the backyard.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.290
"My dad's cool!"

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:09.420
But it has affected me, this particular story,
a lot of what the parents go through, the

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:17.369
desire to give the kids,
to fill the hole from their childhood through,

00:37:17.369 --> 00:37:21.790
live through their child,
be over involved, particularly in terms of

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:26.900
athletics or anything artistic,
that's I mean, those are my mistakes, and

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:32.859
those are my mistakes
that I've just translated into Jim and Cindy

00:37:32.859 --> 00:37:34.200
Green's mistakes.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:40.239
And they're a bit more horrific, personally,
because there were some moments

00:37:40.239 --> 00:37:47.180
where I'm really ashamed of how lost, how
I lost touch with where my kids were

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:50.950
because I was so caught up in where I need,
where I was.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:54.730
And part of why I wanted to make the film
was I thought if I,

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:59.819
well, one, I thought if I could shine the
light on some of those mistakes,

00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:04.720
maybe it would be useful to you, if you have
children

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:10.349
or if you have issues with your parents that
you've carried around for a long time.

00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:14.800
Maybe it will shed light on why parents get
lost in their kids,

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:21.859
and also how kids, for the kids who watch
this story, can look at their parents

00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:25.760
and see how imperfect they are but well intended.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.230
Most parents are really well intended and
the mistakes they make are,

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:35.369
they're doing the best they can, it's just,
they're committing incredible parental crimes.

00:38:35.369 --> 00:38:43.029
So, my kids, yeah, you know they, they've
had a big influence on me,

00:38:43.029 --> 00:38:47.259
and so they've impacted what I do.

00:38:47.259 --> 00:38:48.259
Definitely.

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:50.690
&gt;&gt;Joel: What was the names of those neighbors
you grew up with?

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:51.690
&gt;&gt;Peter: The Silversteins.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.079
&gt;&gt;Joel: Yeah, I think, I've met Peter's kids.

00:38:53.079 --> 00:38:55.220
I think you've brought up a couple of Silversteins.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.220
&gt;&gt;Peter: Yeah.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.819
&gt;&gt;Joel: Yeah, they're exceptional young men.

00:38:57.819 --> 00:38:59.670
&gt;&gt;Peter: They're pretty great.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:05.299
&gt;&gt;Claire: So we have a couple minutes left,
so if anybody has a question, use the mic.

00:39:05.299 --> 00:39:12.570
&gt;&gt;male #1: I'd like to, I'm curious from both
you, if you had complete artistic control

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:17.869
without micromanagement of producers and people
that wanted to fund your movies,

00:39:17.869 --> 00:39:21.690
if you could make exactly the movie you want
to make, for its own sake,

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:26.160
without worrying about focus groups and, you
know, audiences and everything,

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.970
what is your dream project that you'd love
to do just for art's sake itself?

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:34.980
&gt;&gt;Joel: Whoa, well when work with a studio,
I'll just say this,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:41.450
Mickey definitely had one eye out on everything
that was going on with this film.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.940
You know, there's generally a great complicity,
you know if you come

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.900
with the right ideas, the right people the
whole studio system

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.609
can actually be really wonderful.

00:39:50.609 --> 00:39:54.009
But personally, you know,
I have a company in Australia, Blue Tongue

00:39:54.009 --> 00:39:58.720
Films, and we make our own stuff,
and we've had a lot of kind of artistic kind

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.960
of license to do what we want
back home in Australia, there's not a lot

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.599
of people meddling.

00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:09.390
I find the more money
in the project, the more meddling there is.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:14.920
so, I have a ton of dream things
that I'd love to do and I feel really blessed

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.789
because I'm in the process
of developing those things and I've got a

00:40:18.789 --> 00:40:22.599
project happening at the end of the year
in Australia which is just being financed

00:40:22.599 --> 00:40:26.809
which we'll make,
and another one I hope to make next year and

00:40:26.809 --> 00:40:31.109
I feel like there's a completely unimpeded
situation

00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:34.410
going on there, I just hope that I get the
actors that I want.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:38.200
&gt;&gt; male #1: And by the way, part of the question
is, you have carte blanche

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.799
to get location permits, actors, whatever
your dream is, what do you envision you would

00:40:43.799 --> 00:40:44.799
love to make?

00:40:44.799 --> 00:40:46.670
&gt;&gt;Joel: I think I have to start dreaming bigger.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:50.739
I have to get a bit more Baz Buhrmann
and less Joel Edgerton.

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:53.390
I think that the low budgetness of Australia
makes

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:58.989
a lot of people start to think, "Okay, how
do I craft a story out of fifty-eight cents,"

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.960
rather than "anything is
possible."

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.910
I know what you're saying [stutters/mumbles]
I'd like to do

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:11.309
a big Shakespeare kind of, you know, historical
epic I think, you know.

00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:13.710
And have a sword in my hands.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.710
[laughter]

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.579
&gt;&gt;Peter: I love limitations.

00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:22.380
I don't, I haven't experienced,
people always say,"Well you made Pieces of

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.069
April and that's pure and making a studio
film wasn't pure."

00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:31.150
They don't feel any different to me, except
one, people actually got to be paid,

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:37.849
and they had nicer accommodations.

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:42.470
I think what I would do if I could have a
dream, it would be,

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.079
I would think of all the people I've ever
worked with that I loved working with

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:49.569
and they'd all be on the job.

00:41:49.569 --> 00:41:54.349
And then I would make a list of people
who I've always wanted to work with, one would

00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:59.880
be Donna Reed, she died in 1986,
so we'd have to resurrect her, [laughter]

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.640
because she seemed like a great person-

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.839
&gt;&gt;Joel: Good on you mate.

00:42:02.839 --> 00:42:09.619
&gt;&gt;Peter: And you know, when I think of a project
I think of people.

00:42:09.619 --> 00:42:17.220
It's not that I would ever have a vision that
I would to have it all my way.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.769
I don't want it to be my way.

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:23.569
I'll write a novel if I want it to be my way.

00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:31.529
But it would be going to work with people
and letting them know that we are all

00:42:31.529 --> 00:42:34.450
going to be surprised.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:40.749
We're going to work on the highest level
and if we succeed we're all going to share

00:42:40.749 --> 00:42:41.749
in the success.

00:42:41.749 --> 00:42:42.749
&gt;&gt;Joel: Cool.

00:42:42.749 --> 00:42:45.650
&gt;&gt;Peter: I'm maybe not answering your question,
I'm talking about

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:47.599
a way of working.

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:50.819
There's just so many people I've gotten to
work with

00:42:50.819 --> 00:42:56.210
over the years that if I could just put them
all in a room and we could all just show up

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.809
and I'll come with a story and we'll figure
it out.

00:42:59.809 --> 00:43:04.461
&gt;&gt;Joel: Maybe we'll do that exactly what you're
saying but in space.

00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:05.461
[laughter]

00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:06.461
&gt;&gt;Peter: In space.

00:43:06.461 --> 00:43:11.410
But I will tell you limitations are so useful
and the scenes I'm most proud of in almost

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:15.989
every film I've made
are ones where we were up against insurmountable

00:43:15.989 --> 00:43:18.099
odds,
particularly in Pieces of April where every

00:43:18.099 --> 00:43:23.339
day
the solutions we found were borne out of time

00:43:23.339 --> 00:43:30.329
and talent and the weather and the light,
the technology made us better.

00:43:30.329 --> 00:43:35.240
And I think that if you came to me and said,"You
can have all the money and all the time,"

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.650
I would have more trouble coming up with something
then if you came to me

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:39.650
and said, "You've got two weeks.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.059
You've got Meryl Streep and Joel Edgerton,
C.J. and

00:43:43.059 --> 00:43:46.430
John Tolz as your DP, and you can shoot it
in your hometown."

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:47.430
BOOM!

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.859
I'm --I'm--I'm going [makes rocket and explosion
noises]--I got ideas.

00:43:49.859 --> 00:43:50.859
&gt;&gt;Joel: I'm already in Iowa.

00:43:50.859 --> 00:43:51.859
&gt;&gt;Peter: You're already there.

00:43:51.859 --> 00:43:52.859
&gt;&gt;Joel: I'm already there.

00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:53.859
[laughter]

00:43:53.859 --> 00:43:56.009
&gt;&gt;Peter: And Meryl's very happy to be working
with you, in my dream.

00:43:56.009 --> 00:43:57.009
[Laughter]

00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:58.009
&gt;&gt; male #1: Thanks.

00:43:58.009 --> 00:43:59.009
&gt;&gt;Peter: So.

00:43:59.009 --> 00:44:00.009
Great question.

00:44:00.009 --> 00:44:04.019
&gt;&gt; male #2: So, looking at the film itself,
I thought it was amazing

00:44:04.019 --> 00:44:07.249
and my mind like raced back to like classics
of children's lit,

00:44:07.249 --> 00:44:10.599
things like Bridge to Terabithia, like Mary
Poppins.

00:44:10.599 --> 00:44:13.819
Was that like in your mind when you were working
with the screenplay,

00:44:13.819 --> 00:44:18.559
or how did you capture that sort of feeling
from children's lit in the film?

00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:25.309
&gt;&gt;Peter: True story, and I'm hesitant to say
this because I would in no way even

00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:28.099
suggest that Timothy Green is a classic.

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:31.079
That's not for me to determine, or you even.

00:44:31.079 --> 00:44:36.900
Time determines what's a classic, but I very
much woke up one night

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:42.320
in my home having had a dream where I was
directing and it was a bigger movie than I

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.420
ever directed
and my wife said,"Why are you up?" and I said,

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.410
"I want to make a classic."

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:53.510
And she said,"What do you mean?" and I said,
"You know E.T., Wizard of Oz, It's a Wonderful

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:56.650
Life,
one of those movies,"and this is really probably

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:00.319
what I meant," One of those movies that you
watch and re-watch,

00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:03.230
you go back to time and time again.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.290
That's what I want to do."

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.880
She said,"That's great," and then she went
back to bed.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.760
And I was still there,
and she said, "Why aren't you going back to

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.760
bed?"

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.819
And I said, "Well , there's a problem, I donât'
really come up with

00:45:12.819 --> 00:45:14.269
those ideas."

00:45:14.269 --> 00:45:16.400
Because I don't.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.470
Because each of those stories has a magical
element to it.

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:24.289
Couple days later, I met the then president
of Disney for breakfast, he said, "Come home.

00:45:24.289 --> 00:45:25.289
Come back to Disney."

00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:28.819
I said, "That's great, but I don't really
have an idea.

00:45:28.819 --> 00:45:31.740
The things I'm writing right now are a bit
dirty, a bit

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.019
inappropriate, and I just don't have a Disney
idea.

00:45:34.019 --> 00:45:35.019
But if I have one, thank you.

00:45:35.019 --> 00:45:37.780
I love working there.

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.950
It's a great
place to work, but I just don't have a story."

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:42.950
That was fine.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:47.859
A couple days later I had a lunch, or not
even a lunch, it was like a bagel, with producer

00:45:47.859 --> 00:45:51.440
Scott Sanders who brought
along another producer Ahmet Zappa.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.089
And Ahmet Zappa said, "Can I tell you a story?"

00:45:54.089 --> 00:45:59.099
He said, "I was in the shower, and this idea
came to me, and I want to tell it to you."

00:45:59.099 --> 00:46:02.700
And he told it to me, started about the couple
who can't have a kid and they plant the ideas

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.619
about the kid in the
ground and I went, "Stop.

00:46:06.619 --> 00:46:07.619
I don't want to hear anymore.

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:08.619
I'm in.

00:46:08.619 --> 00:46:09.769
I got it."

00:46:09.769 --> 00:46:14.450
And I basically adopted that idea and ran
with it.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:19.900
And--but all the while hoping
that I would make something for adults, a

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.799
movie for adults that kids would love to see
with their adults.

00:46:23.799 --> 00:46:26.550
One of
the--with their adults--kids would want to

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.660
see with their adults--"You're my adult"--
with their parents

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.079
or their family.

00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:38.440
But make a movie that families might see or
prospective parents might see, that could

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.249
be--because
everybody was a kid once or is a kid.

00:46:41.249 --> 00:46:44.999
And everybody is a parent, and if they're
not,

00:46:44.999 --> 00:46:47.640
they at least have parents or had parents.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.269
So I thought this is--I'm kind of hitting
everybody.

00:46:51.269 --> 00:46:56.900
But what Ahmet
brought was this magic element and I just

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.499
kept noticing that the movies that I go back
to in that way--

00:47:00.499 --> 00:47:05.479
for that kind of emotional, and spiritual
sustenance all have a magical element

00:47:05.479 --> 00:47:09.390
so I thought why not --why not try that.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.950
I'd spent twelve years writing a really dirty
novel

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:15.880
and I kind of needed to take a spiritual,
creative bath.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.220
And that's what The Odd Life of Timothy Green
was so I feel clean again

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.740
and ready to go do bad bad creative things.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.740
[laughter]

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:25.740
So.

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:26.740
&gt;&gt;Claire: Okay, thanks so much.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:27.740
&gt;&gt;Peter: Thank you.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:28.740
Sorry, sorry.

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.740
[Laughter and applause]

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:30.740
I know.

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.430
I don't get out much.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:35.289
&gt;&gt;Claire: So I think the movie comes out in
two weeks, I don't know if I'm supposed to

00:47:35.289 --> 00:47:36.289
say that.

00:47:36.289 --> 00:47:37.289
&gt;&gt;Peter: August 15th.

00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:38.289
&gt;&gt;Claire: Great.

00:47:38.289 --> 00:47:39.289
Thanks so much.

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:40.289
&gt;&gt;Joel: Thank you

00:47:40.289 --> 00:47:41.289
&gt;&gt;Peter: Thank you.

00:47:41.289 --> 00:47:42.289
[Applause]

00:47:42.289 --> 00:47:42.293
&gt;&gt;Joel: You were great.
