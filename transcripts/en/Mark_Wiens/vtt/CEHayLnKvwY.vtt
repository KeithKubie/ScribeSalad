00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.890
- [Sonny] Our cooking tools.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.670
- Hopefully we don't
turn into the chickens.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.714
We're both kind of red in the face.

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:06.610
- Yeah.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.890
- [Mark] Alright then.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.723
- [Sonny] The moment of truth.

00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:11.960
- What is amazing to me how
perfectly golden that skin is.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.790
We're moving on now to
the green papaya salad.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.870
- [Sonny] Look at all these chilis.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.217
It's almost unbearable pain, man.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.430
(coughs)

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.077
- Wipe my tears.

00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:22.160
(laughs)

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.513
Good morning!

00:00:26.513 --> 00:00:28.720
Hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.330
- This is Mark Wiens,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.940
I'm Sonny from the Best
Ever Food Review Show.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.116
I'm sorry, this is your
show, you should take that.

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:36.962
- (laughs) But it is
going to be an awesome day

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:38.300
hanging out with Sonny today.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.750
So, one of the most popular
things to eat in Thailand

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.280
is called som tam, which
is green papaya salad

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.498
with grilled chicken.

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:45.331
- [Sonny] Mmmm.

00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.300
- But we are going to eat
not your ordinary versions

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.470
- Of either.
- Of either.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.920
So, we are on our way first
to go eat grilled chicken,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.710
and this is going to be,
it's a very unique, actually,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.990
it's very old, right, Ying?

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.823
- Mmmhmm.

00:00:58.823 --> 00:01:00.430
- It's like a very, very
old style that's almost

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.440
impossible to find now.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.710
I've never had it before.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.380
It's about an hour drive
outside, on the outskirts

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.050
of Bangkok, towards Nakhon Phanom.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.481
Or is it in Nakhon Phanom?

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:09.314
- In Nakhon Phanom.

00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:10.160
- Its in Nakhon Phanom, okay?

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.230
So it's going to be about an hour drive.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.688
(engines revs)

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:15.271
(upbeat music)

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.310
(car door clicks)

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.350
- Ooh, oh!

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.630
Immediately, step out of the car,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.166
you can hear the chicken,
the roosters crowing.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.666
(speaks foreign language)

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.593
Oh, we gotta go.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.424
(upbeat music)

00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:38.460
(speaks foreign language)

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.760
We got here in perfect time,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.860
and he just finished a batch

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.430
but that means he's
gonna start a new batch.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.150
And uncle is very friendly.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.978
He's just arranging while
we're getting kind of

00:01:46.978 --> 00:01:49.630
- Ashed on
- Bathed in ash.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.600
But he's preparing.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.433
What is it?

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:53.980
It's almost like a tub.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.400
A tub of a grill or smoker,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.340
where he's going to grill the chicken.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.087
This is the main batch.

00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:01.630
He's got another batch going over here.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.647
(speaks foreign language)

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:07.377
Kind of like actually not even grilled,

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:12.377
it's baked chicken in rice grass.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.875
Smoked in rice grass.

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:17.690
- But just the fact that outside is ashy

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.460
but the inside is still,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.610
I mean it looks really clean, right?

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.610
- [Mark] Yeah it is.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.701
- So it's just gonna kind
of steam up in there?

00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:27.470
- Smoke and steam.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.680
He takes the raw chicken,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.530
I think which they've already
marinated in some spices

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.940
and some juices,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.220
and then he takes a couple
skewers, pokes them through,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.470
and that's gonna kind of hold it together

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.350
so that it holds up as he puts it upright

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.977
onto a little pole
sticking out of the ground.

00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:46.560
(upbeat music)

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.340
- [Mark] Okay so he says it
takes about an hour to cook.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.380
- One hour?
- [Mark] One hour to smoke.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.886
- That sounds about right.

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:58.469
(upbeat music)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.930
- All the chickens in
their vertical positions,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.927
and then he's lidded
all of them with those

00:03:04.927 --> 00:03:07.460
oil, old oil drums.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.270
And now he's just stuffing into,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.260
stuffing into this entire, like trough,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.320
the dry rice grass,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.500
which they're then gonna just like ignite,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.750
and that's just gonna go
up in a cloud of smoke,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.503
but release all of that
flavor into your chicken.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.863
He disappeared for a while.

00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:38.650
(speaks foreign language)

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.630
- Had to order more,
they said they sold out.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.463
- [Mark] What?
- Yeah.

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:44.590
By the way Sonny, we had to
pre-order these chickens.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.570
- Oh, you guys did pre-order?

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.540
- They're completely sold out.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.890
- Oh man, I was so worried.

00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:52.300
- You cannot just show up
here and get a chicken.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.630
They're all sold out, right, Ying?

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.368
They're all sold out
before they start selling.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:56.275
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:57.108
- [Sonny] Let's find, like a,

00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:58.660
is there a restaurant somewhere?

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.493
- [Mark] It's only take-away

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:00.650
It's only take-away actually.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.860
- We're on the side of the road,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.090
and there's like three
big burning troughs,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.156
and that's all that's here.

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:06.530
And there selling out.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.773
What's crazy is he's going to
set this on fire in a second,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.980
but there's more grass
right there and right there,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.100
like it's all directly
around and under this roof,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.480
and next to this tarp.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.070
Like, I don't know how
he keeps it contained

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.903
right in here,

00:04:20.903 --> 00:04:23.490
'cause there's flammable
stuff everywhere around here.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.323
And it looks like this
tarp has been through

00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:26.773
some tough days though, this is already.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.610
Wait, that's it, just a match?

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.360
- [Mark] Just a lighter.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.310
- [Sonny] Oh, whoa!

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.840
- Wow that is hot, and
it's coming fast (laughs).

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.910
It's moving down fast.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.540
You can see how that fire,
that fire just spread.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.500
Hopefully we don't turn into the chickens.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.430
But we are kind of bathing
in the smoke with them.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.752
- [Sonny] We're roasting
a bit, just a little bit.

00:04:50.752 --> 00:04:53.015
- (laughs) We're both
kind of red in the face.

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:55.080
- (laughs) Yeah, totally.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.991
Once the flame goes
by, the remainder here,

00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:00.680
you can put your hand right next to it.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.513
It's not hot at all.

00:05:01.513 --> 00:05:02.970
- The chicken is completely,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.270
wow that's a lot of smoke.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.230
- Power through, dude, it's for the views.

00:05:09.405 --> 00:05:10.500
(laughs)

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.020
- This is like, whoa.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.026
- Oh that took a while.

00:05:15.026 --> 00:05:17.180
- (laughs) But yeah, 'cause the chickens

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.013
were completely raw.

00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:19.880
It's not like this is the
finishing process, you know?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.450
Like, this has to cook the
chicken all the way through.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.283
- Right.

00:05:24.283 --> 00:05:26.660
Yeah that takes a lot of
heat and a lot of time.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.970
- Okay, let's move.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.470
- Yeah let's move.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.960
- So he'll clear the old batch,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.230
then he'll add more grass
and then burn that again,

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.850
probably a couple of times
because it takes about an hour

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.340
to smoke, and I guess that's enough heat.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.330
That provides enough heat

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.930
and smoke and cook the entire chickens.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.220
He'll show us that whole process.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.910
The first batch of rice grass
has completely burned through,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.330
so he's gonna re-add, re-stock it,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.220
re-fill it with rice grass.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.570
I didn't know if I should
say hay for dried rice grass,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.190
I didn't know if it was
a specific type of grass.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.530
Sonny just looked it up,

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.630
thanks to Google we now know that--

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.010
- Grass that has been mown
or dried for use as fodder.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.540
- [Mark] And that's the definition of hay.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.350
So we can call dried rice grass hay.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.400
- [Sonny] Absolutely.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.340
- [Mark] Uncle has handed
over the lighter to us.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.070
- The cooking utensils, right here.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.840
- This is the like a lot of,
what is it, responsibility.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.673
- Yeah.

00:06:20.673 --> 00:06:22.280
- We have a lot of
responsibility in our hands.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.779
- So right from the corner.

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:25.752
- [Sonny] Yeah, it just takes a little bit

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.016
and then it, yeah that's it.

00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:29.766
(dramatic music)

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.340
- As we wait for that
chicken to finish roasting,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.240
or smoking we're just going to come over,

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.980
they actually sell the
chickens in the front

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.714
at the, sort of the main road.

00:06:43.714 --> 00:06:46.297
(bag crinkles)

00:06:48.936 --> 00:06:49.769
- Is that good?

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:50.670
- Yeah.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.620
- It's satisfying the urges for now.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.440
- Crunchy and a little bit like,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.472
has like a little sweet glaze to it.

00:06:56.472 --> 00:06:58.040
- Mmm.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.940
I agree with that.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.873
- That's good.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.477
We have opened that gong.

00:07:03.477 --> 00:07:04.310
- [Ying] Pong!

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.290
- Typically, what they would do,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.760
is they would bring the chickens from,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.440
because they don't have the
chickens at the same place

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.810
where they distribute the chickens

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.800
because it's so smoky.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.219
- Yeah, people would get smoked out

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:13.653
that they would get black lung.

00:07:13.653 --> 00:07:14.870
There would be law suits.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.440
It would be a big issue.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.423
- So, what they typically do is

00:07:18.423 --> 00:07:19.770
bring the chickens here.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.060
This is where they chop them up.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.660
They put them into the styrofoam boxes.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.820
They give you your sauces,

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.310
they chop up your chicken,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.960
and then this is where you pick it up.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.130
But since we are planning
to eat the chicken

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.810
directly from the bed,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.060
directly from the trough,

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.640
Ying was extraordinarily smart.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.540
She got the empty box
with the banana leaf,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.373
with the sauces,

00:07:40.373 --> 00:07:42.370
and khao neow, sticky rice,

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.190
which is also a necessary component.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.890
Now we're going to back to the grill

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.190
and we're going to go eat.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.293
- [Ying] Okay, time to go.

00:07:50.293 --> 00:07:51.250
- Okay it's ready, we gotta go.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.083
- Let's go.

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.400
- Let's move, we got to go now.

00:07:54.316 --> 00:07:55.574
(laughs)

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:59.010
(speaks foreign language)

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.210
- [Sonny] You got on the motorbike.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.337
You got the lucky one, we gotta run.

00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:04.920
(upbeat music)

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.065
- He's gonna lift the lids.

00:08:08.065 --> 00:08:10.400
(dramatic music)

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.850
Kind of delicately so that
not too much ash spreads,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.270
but that's just incredible.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.710
I love the contrast because it's so black,

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.430
and then just that golden chicken.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.163
It looks like it's back in a nest.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.280
- So he cinches the wings,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.840
picks it up, super easy.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.361
- And hangs it on the shed.

00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:29.111
(dramatic music)

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.280
After he lifts it out of the nest,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.400
he hangs it up here, kind of on the shed,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.440
and you can just see how golden,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.440
how beautiful that skin is.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.470
But then he wipes it with
a little sponge to get that

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.980
kind of extra ash off.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.140
They smell unbelievable.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.290
You can really smell the
aroma of lemon grass.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.200
And my arm is just
getting dripped all over

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.223
with chicken juice.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.650
I'm gonna lick my arm.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.903
Oh, wow.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.123
Dude that's--

00:09:09.123 --> 00:09:09.956
- Good, hold on, let me lick your arm.

00:09:09.956 --> 00:09:11.920
- [Mark] Dude, you got to try my arm.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.477
- No, I'm not touchin' it. (laughs)

00:09:14.477 --> 00:09:15.940
Are you shooting?
- [Mark] Yep.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.160
- Oh hey guys.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.010
Are they stuffed?

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.040
- [Mark] If they are
stuffed, it's only like

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.650
lemon grass and herbs, I believe.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.873
- I looked in the hole.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.210
In the cavity here,

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.580
- [Mark] I believe that
is lemon grass inside.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.491
- Look at the yoga,
the contortionist moves

00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:34.700
that's going on here.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.510
They put the legs back
into the body cavity.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.490
I've never seen that before.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.630
Is that a common thing here?

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.500
- [Mark] Yeah, in Thai,
they do that quite often.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.738
Just to keep, to hold
the chicken together.

00:09:43.738 --> 00:09:45.250
- What?

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.410
- [Mark] So that they don't flop around,

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.660
and then the drumstick would fall off.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.420
- So are their feet, the
whole feet gonna be in there?

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.240
- [Mark] Yeah the feet
are stuffed in the cavity.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.750
- When do we eat though?

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:54.583
- Right now.
- Soon.

00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:55.999
Okay good.
- We're eating him.

00:09:55.999 --> 00:09:56.832
(laughs)

00:09:56.832 --> 00:09:57.665
This is ours.

00:09:57.665 --> 00:09:58.498
Unhook this guy.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.644
Yes, dude.

00:10:00.644 --> 00:10:02.580
And this is right out of the smoker.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.163
Set this into our tray.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.930
Head up or head down, okay.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.122
Look at that!

00:10:09.122 --> 00:10:11.790
(upbeat music)

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.630
I'm just amazed at the skin and how

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.480
beautifully golden,
crunchy, perfect it looks.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.080
Should be just double drumstick it?

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.913
- [Sonny] Yeah.

00:10:19.913 --> 00:10:22.650
- [Mark] Let's just pull from either side.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.483
- [Sonny] Woo!

00:10:23.483 --> 00:10:24.316
- [Mark] Yeah, it's hot.

00:10:24.316 --> 00:10:27.373
Let's just pull the
drumstick on either side.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.613
Lift out the foot.

00:10:29.613 --> 00:10:31.440
- [Sonny] Oh, There it is, a whole foot!

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.273
- [Mark] Oh wow.

00:10:32.273 --> 00:10:34.133
That just completely, like,

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.090
that just falls off.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.653
- [Sonny] And here we go.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.610
Super easy.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.740
- [Mark] It just like pulls out.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.010
- [Sonny] Oh man.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.070
- [Mark] Even the foot, it's just--

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.023
- [Sonny] The foot just comes right off.

00:10:45.023 --> 00:10:46.020
- [Mark] Look at that.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.853
- [Sonny] The moment of truth?

00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:47.686
- [Mark] Let's do it.

00:10:47.686 --> 00:10:48.554
- [Sonny] Alright, here we go.

00:10:48.554 --> 00:10:51.772
(upbeat music)

00:10:51.772 --> 00:10:53.855
(laughs)

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.143
- Oh, wow!

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.150
- That's ridiculous.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.540
And it's unbelievably tender.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.595
It's salty on the outside,
did he put something on it?

00:11:04.595 --> 00:11:06.410
- Yeah, yeah, so it was
all marinated in probably

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.160
soy sauce and coriander root.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160
- [Sonny] Yeah it's just so soft.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.249
- [Mark] That texture is
unbelievably juicy and soft.

00:11:12.249 --> 00:11:14.832
(upbeat music)

00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:17.891
(moans)

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.140
It's so soft that's like
a two-biter drumstick.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.540
- All these fatty parts
are just kind of melted.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.493
- Yeah, you're right about that.

00:11:26.493 --> 00:11:28.050
- Yeah.
- It really is unbelievable.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.400
- That's over the top.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.290
(laughs)

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.740
- Yeah, I mean, there's a reason

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.150
he's sold out every day, right?

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.743
- Mhm.
- This is exactly it.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.680
- Like the bone is just completely clean.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.450
Okay next up let's try this sauce.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.120
- [Sonny] You can see
like a puddle of juices

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.430
as you put your finger in there.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.840
- [Mark] Oh, look at how
juicy even the, oh wow.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.090
Okay, that's hot, but that's
so juicy, even the breast.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.980
This is the real test, you know,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.470
because the thigh and
drumstick is always juicy.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.260
- [Sonny] Yeah, always a bit more fatty.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.930
- [Mark] But the breast
can be very dry and

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.539
grab a chunk, it feels--

00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:00.590
- [Sonny] Oh, yes.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.770
- [Mark] Incredibly juicy.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.890
You can probably squeeze it like a towel

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.203
and juices would come out.

00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:08.800
(moans)

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.845
- [Sonny] Yeah, that looks nice.

00:12:09.845 --> 00:12:10.727
- Oh, wow.

00:12:10.727 --> 00:12:12.402
And this is the classic
chicken-dipping sauce here.

00:12:12.402 --> 00:12:14.985
(upbeat music)

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.910
(moans)

00:12:20.052 --> 00:12:20.885
Oh, wow.

00:12:20.885 --> 00:12:21.718
- The breast is juicy.

00:12:21.718 --> 00:12:24.590
- [Sonny] A little bit more
firm, but still super juicy.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.320
- [Mark] Mmmhmm.
- [Sonny] For breast meat.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.590
- [Mark] The sauce is kind of tangy,

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.620
a little bit spicy, kind
of sweet at the same time.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.453
- [Sonny] I'm just going to have this.

00:12:30.453 --> 00:12:31.783
Look at this, all this skin.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.430
It's like a little bit crispy right here,

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.750
but the rest is just really soft.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.510
I think it just gets kind of
sweltering inside that box.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.443
- It gets juiced.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.635
Wait, camera back up.

00:12:43.635 --> 00:12:46.328
- [Ying] (laughs) Okay.

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:48.911
(upbeat music)

00:12:49.914 --> 00:12:50.747
(moans)

00:12:50.747 --> 00:12:52.270
- [Sonny] Oh, fatty, juicy skin.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.680
- In a few moments, this
chicken will just be bone.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.845
- [Sonny] (laughs) I could
eat like two of these.

00:12:56.845 --> 00:12:57.678
- [Mark] Mmmhmm (laughs)

00:12:57.678 --> 00:12:58.511
- [Sonny] Which is this sauce?

00:12:58.511 --> 00:12:59.770
- More looks like the Thai seafood sauce,

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.486
which is garlic, chilis, lime juice.

00:13:01.486 --> 00:13:04.069
(upbeat music)

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.600
Really good, too.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.226
Like less of a, more of
a refreshing chili sauce

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:10.420
as opposed to the other sauce,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.840
which is more of a smoky,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.840
I think more of a dry chili taste to it.

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:19.560
Dude, the skin bites are unbelievable.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.730
One of the signs of a successful
chicken-eating experience

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.160
is looking at your fingers,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.308
and mine are glistening to the max.

00:13:26.308 --> 00:13:28.891
(upbeat music)

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.240
The chicken is some of the
juiciest you will ever have.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.840
This is the type of chicken
that once you start eating it,

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.076
you will not stop eating until
all there is left is bone.

00:13:43.076 --> 00:13:45.893
- Until it's just that.
- A carcass.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.552
And we're not stopping

00:13:48.552 --> 00:13:51.135
(upbeat music)

00:13:52.546 --> 00:13:53.783
- The wings.

00:13:55.462 --> 00:13:56.787
- The wings are incredible.

00:13:56.787 --> 00:13:58.810
And of course khao neow, sticky rice,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.120
which I almost forgot about
because the chicken is so good.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.987
But you got to have khao neow,

00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:04.370
and you can kind of ball it up,

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.285
dip it in the sauce as well.

00:14:06.285 --> 00:14:09.331
(upbeat music)

00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:11.414
(laughs)

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.093
- So good.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.193
And that completes our
chicken and sticky rice.

00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:22.160
- Thanks man, this was a lot of fun.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.993
- For sure.

00:14:22.993 --> 00:14:25.410
And the chicken is so unbelievably good.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.070
We're going to move on now to eat som tum,

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.530
which is the green papaya salad.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.730
It would be very common to
accompany green papaya salad

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.940
with the grilled chicken,

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.000
but we're going to move
on to a different place

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.430
to eat green papaya salad.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.263
- Let's do it.

00:14:36.263 --> 00:14:37.349
- Let's go.

00:14:37.349 --> 00:14:38.920
(upbeat music)

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.262
- Should we bring the camera though?

00:14:41.262 --> 00:14:42.095
- Oh!

00:14:42.095 --> 00:14:45.030
In fact, we got to bring the camera

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.730
and the entire basket,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.250
because we've got Ying ordered

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.140
a couple more chickens here to bring home,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.973
to take away.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.123
So I think we're going
home with the basket.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.350
Okay, anyway we're moving on now

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.670
to the green papaya salad.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.067
- Location two.

00:15:03.067 --> 00:15:04.510
(upbeat music)

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.343
What do I do with this?

00:15:05.343 --> 00:15:06.880
- But I think we'll give
them back the basket.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.271
(laughs)

00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:11.884
(speaks foreign language)

00:15:11.884 --> 00:15:14.467
(upbeat music)

00:15:15.973 --> 00:15:18.723
(engine revving)

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.459
That was a little bit of
a drive, but we made it.

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:36.240
We are here next to eat
Thai green papaya salad.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.570
- [Sonny] So you said this
one is extreme-ish, in a way.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.810
- So it looks extreme,
but it's actually not

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.200
like a food challenge, you know?

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.980
It's just a normal dish,
a normal preparation.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.370
But it is, pretty hardcore.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.650
It's good, very, very good.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.380
The restaurant is called Som Tam Jay Gai.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.320
They also, not only do they
have green papaya salad,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.794
but they also have a type of good chicken.

00:15:58.794 --> 00:16:02.294
(speaks foreign language)

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.780
It's a type of chicken
from a certain region,

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.213
place in Thailand.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.920
These are some of my favorite
types of grilled chickens

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.210
in Thailand, because of their texture,

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:14.043
because of their flavor,

00:16:14.043 --> 00:16:16.240
because of the way their
unique grilling of them.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.620
We came here right at the peak of lunch.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.348
The restaurant is packed.

00:16:19.348 --> 00:16:22.848
(speaks foreign language)

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.310
- On my t-shirt, it says
(speaks foreign language),

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.080
which means not spicy, not eating.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.787
But she just mentioned to me

00:16:39.787 --> 00:16:41.450
(speaks foreign language)

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.763
which means not spicy, not selling.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.773
Is what she told me.

00:16:45.773 --> 00:16:49.116
So Ying said if it's not
spicy, she's not selling it.

00:16:49.116 --> 00:16:49.949
So we're in the right spot.

00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:51.880
- Yeah, okay.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.430
Look, this man can tolerate spice,

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.030
I can pretend like I can tolerate spice.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.200
I'm gonna do my best.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.770
I still like you nonetheless.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.270
(speaks foreign language)

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.353
- Okay, 30 chilis in the plate.

00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:07.930
(laughs)

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.231
- Cool.

00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:10.064
30?

00:17:12.581 --> 00:17:14.914
(crunching)

00:17:17.853 --> 00:17:19.820
(speaks foreign language)

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:24.385
- Here's the slogan:
(speaks foreign language)

00:17:24.385 --> 00:17:28.081
That means, sap is like, oh
here goes in the fish sauce.

00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:31.230
(speaks foreign language)

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.010
Sap means delicious but
it's more than delicious.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.863
It's like a well-rounded,
like mouth-pleasure feeling.

00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:42.246
(speaks foreign language)

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.543
(upbeat music)

00:17:51.968 --> 00:17:54.968
(utensils clanging)

00:18:04.743 --> 00:18:08.410
(speaks a foreign language)

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.260
Sonny is delivering our plate now.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.676
- Table one!

00:18:15.676 --> 00:18:18.090
(upbeat music)

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.150
- [Mark] Nice.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.370
- You know the most
beautiful things in nature

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.990
are always, no hold on,

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.680
the most dangerous things in nature

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.970
are always the most beautiful,

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.800
and vivid, and vibrant and bright.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.000
It's beautiful, and dangerous!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.070
- A small mountain of fermented
fish sauce and chilis.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.920
So many ingredients in here.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.400
There's at least 20
ingredients probably in here.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.530
Oh, we got another one too.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.888
- There's a whole 'nother tray!

00:18:39.888 --> 00:18:42.850
- You ordered that one too.
- Oh!

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:43.683
- [Mark] Dude!

00:18:43.683 --> 00:18:45.733
That one is with the shells and chilis.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:47.723
Oh man.

00:18:47.723 --> 00:18:50.260
I totally didn't even know
you was ordering this.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.093
Awesome!

00:18:51.093 --> 00:18:53.097
Oh, another ingredient in here
is (speaks foreign language),

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.740
which are those little seeds,

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.720
those little seeds,

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.910
which are white poponak seeds.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.190
- [Sonny] There's so
much going on in here.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.023
- [Mark] Alright, cheers.

00:19:04.023 --> 00:19:04.856
- Cheers.

00:19:11.014 --> 00:19:13.014
(moans)

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.153
- Oh, wow.

00:19:20.738 --> 00:19:22.405
That is an explosion

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.510
of like fermented

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.880
crunch and heat in your mouth

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.473
- Ooh, that is hot.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.223
- Oh yeah.

00:19:36.223 --> 00:19:39.610
- So, before I can't talk anymore,

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.433
the one thing I do like,

00:19:41.433 --> 00:19:44.479
is it fermented fish paste?

00:19:44.479 --> 00:19:46.340
- The dressing?

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.173
- [Sonny] Yeah.

00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:48.510
- [Mark] Fermented fish sauce.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.830
- [Sonny] Fermented fish sauce
can be a lot for some people,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.060
even for me,

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.200
but actually, spice is the one thing

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.150
that can neutralize that flavor.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.680
- [Mark] That's Vietnamese
sausage actually.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.570
- [Sonny] Oh!

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:00.620
- You know the--

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.453
(speaks foreign language)

00:20:01.453 --> 00:20:03.706
Yeah, it's the Thai version
of Vietnamese sausage.

00:20:03.706 --> 00:20:06.289
(upbeat music)

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.180
I just love it.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:17.180
And to me, to me it's
like this is the dish that

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.990
it touches on taste buds you
didn't even think you had.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.293
It just, it's more, almost
than your mouth can handle,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.500
and that's what's so awesome about it.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.550
- I agree with that, but
not more than I can handle.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.800
I'm doing just fine over here.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.983
I do love the flavor.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.023
I'm not gonna lie.

00:20:39.023 --> 00:20:41.910
It is a unique pleasure and pain happening

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.380
at the same time here.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.553
Here's even more sausage.

00:20:44.553 --> 00:20:46.263
I've got some chilis in this one.

00:20:48.534 --> 00:20:49.367
- Woo!

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.640
(moans)

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.353
- These pork rinds soak up all
these juices so beautifully.

00:21:00.094 --> 00:21:02.094
(moans)

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.280
- She kinda chuckled at Sonny.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.850
- She's laughing at me.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:06.683
Hello.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.610
She knows exactly what's going on here.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.890
Man, I'm sweating.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.620
I'm crying.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.493
I'm choking.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.050
But it tastes great.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.070
Don't get me wrong.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.920
It's really good.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.270
Look at all these chilis.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:24.953
How do you do this?

00:21:24.953 --> 00:21:26.573
It's almost unbearable pain, man.

00:21:28.856 --> 00:21:30.939
(laughs)

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.273
Why do you ask?

00:21:34.273 --> 00:21:35.313
Do I look not fine?

00:21:36.389 --> 00:21:38.800
(laughing)

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.240
I swear to God, it's delicious,

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.270
but this is one of the most painful meals

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.003
I've ever tried to eat.

00:21:44.003 --> 00:21:44.836
- Yes!

00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:46.770
- I've only had like five bites so far.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.400
This is hilarious man!

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.730
I used to be like, I can hang.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.600
If I ate with Mark Weins, I can hang.

00:21:53.804 --> 00:21:55.150
Mmm.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.390
It's not going to be that bad.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.140
But, you're the spice lord.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:21:59.973
Respect.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:01.703
You got this.

00:22:01.703 --> 00:22:03.570
Like, there's no competition.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.430
- I am

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.720
- You're sweating though.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.200
- I'm sweating and crying.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.370
- That is something.
- Oh yeah.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.713
Wow, I'm feeling it now.

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:14.400
- He's drinking the water.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.633
The man has a limit.

00:22:17.628 --> 00:22:18.750
What is this?

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.140
- That is fire.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.680
That is a nam.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.140
That is fermented sausage.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:23.973
- Oh!

00:22:23.973 --> 00:22:25.403
I am a broken man, Mark Weins.

00:22:27.562 --> 00:22:28.490
- Dude this is intense.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.990
- You wanna, are you gonna
have some sausage too?

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.940
- Yes I am.
- Or something else?

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.543
- Okay, let's do it.

00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:37.648
(upbeat music)

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.820
The wife has given me some tissues.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.233
That means it's time to wipe my tears.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.720
(laughs)

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.130
Well dude.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.140
Should we try some grilled chicken?

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:51.973
- Sure.

00:22:53.997 --> 00:22:57.060
(speaks foreign language)

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.028
Sonny just jumped out of his
chair to go buy ice cream

00:23:00.028 --> 00:23:02.223
- This guy, he's got ice
cream, this guy's a genius.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.470
(speaks foreign language)

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.303
Syrup on there.

00:23:06.303 --> 00:23:07.136
I don't care.

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.466
I just need something cold.

00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:11.466
(moans)

00:23:15.503 --> 00:23:16.943
Dog, that was brutal.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.460
Fun, fun, but wow.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.760
That is some intense heat.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.215
The ice cream is a lifesaver.

00:23:26.215 --> 00:23:28.210
(laughs)

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.063
He's a genius!

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.006
- Sonny's over there eating ice cream.

00:23:33.006 --> 00:23:35.840
(laughs)

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.150
- And you're having more chilis.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:37.983
That was like four chilis!

00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:38.816
Oh, dude.

00:23:38.816 --> 00:23:41.487
- Woo!

00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:43.173
And I got a whole piece of lime.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.473
Lime peel on that bite.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.464
- Are you going to get the lime peel?

00:23:47.464 --> 00:23:48.297
- Mmmhmm.

00:23:49.724 --> 00:23:52.470
This is just, just blows my taste buds

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:57.163
how many flavors you can
experience all in one mouthful.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.180
And it's just unbelievable.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.210
- You're right, you can mix so many

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.230
different kinds of ice cream

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.970
in one little cup.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.030
Is that what you're talking about?

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.300
- [Mark] Let's try the
grilled chicken for now.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.873
Alright, so completely different
type of grilled chicken.

00:24:09.873 --> 00:24:11.220
- [Sonny] What is that?

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.360
- [Mark] That's like the
whole wing, thigh combo.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.760
I guess I'll grab this drum.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.550
Juicy and oily all the way through.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.153
- [Sonny] Yeah it's not tough at all.

00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:25.283
I've been hiding my tissues under here.

00:24:25.283 --> 00:24:27.366
(laughs)

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.410
- [Mark] Exposed!
- That's my technique.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.630
Okay, thank you.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.750
- [Mark] Another one of their
specialties here is hoy na,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.570
which is this type of shell,

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.640
and grab yourself a skewer.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.633
I'll grab this guy.

00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:44.227
You poke in your skewer, and

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.900
like pry out the shell.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.443
Oh, so much juice.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.250
Oh this is a (speaks foreign language)

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.800
No, it's not a (speaks foreign language)

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.929
Oh look at that, it just keeps on coming.

00:24:58.929 --> 00:25:00.891
(speaks foreign language)

00:25:00.891 --> 00:25:01.760
- [Sonny] Alright guys,
what you got to do is

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.430
just kind of coax it out.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:04.650
You got to be nice to it.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.200
Otherwise, it'll break in half.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.203
- [Mark] Gentle.

00:25:08.203 --> 00:25:10.123
- [Sonny] I'll give it
a little shaky shake.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.760
Oh it's really in there.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.773
It's quite firm.

00:25:17.467 --> 00:25:20.181
- [Mark] Be careful of the splash.

00:25:20.181 --> 00:25:22.442
(upbeat music)

00:25:22.442 --> 00:25:24.442
(moans)

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.240
- Really delicious,

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.400
and softer than so many snails I've had.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.560
- [Mark] A little bit of an earthy taste,

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.990
but then that's kind of
balanced by the fishy marinade.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.590
- Oh, so that's, if you get the whole one,

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.423
it looks like that.

00:25:39.423 --> 00:25:41.200
And from my understanding,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.017
this is part of the
digestive track right here.

00:25:43.017 --> 00:25:46.239
- And look at those little,
little balls right there.

00:25:46.239 --> 00:25:47.818
Do you see that?

00:25:47.818 --> 00:25:51.087
(speaks foreign language)

00:25:51.087 --> 00:25:51.920
Those are the eggs?

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.753
- We'll just give it a little pinch.

00:25:52.753 --> 00:25:53.586
Hey!

00:25:53.586 --> 00:25:54.510
Now it's gone.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.503
The balls are gone.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.915
You always know it's fresh
when it's a little bit gritty.

00:25:58.915 --> 00:26:00.269
A little bit of sand in there.

00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:02.852
(upbeat music)

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.073
- An amazing meal.

00:26:08.073 --> 00:26:10.000
An amazing day.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.281
Any big chilis, any
whole chilis in my teeth?

00:26:12.281 --> 00:26:14.364
(laughs)

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.890
I don't even know, what would you call it?

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:20.844
This was a both day of
tradition, not food challenge,

00:26:20.844 --> 00:26:24.603
but extreme?

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.420
What would you say today,

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.708
what was the summing
word to hold it together?

00:26:30.708 --> 00:26:33.150
- Push to the edge of normal.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.990
- Push to the edge of normal.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.860
- Like, this is still
how people are eating,

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.320
but it can kind of feel extreme
if you're not used to it.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.320
For me it's been a blast

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.290
getting to hang out with you,

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.103
two different days in Bangkok.

00:26:43.103 --> 00:26:46.670
Seeing Thai food through your perspective,

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.640
and just seeing, you know,
we both do shows about food,

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.190
but we both have a really
different approach,

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:55.010
so seeing the way you approach
it and your love for food,

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.190
and your passion, a ton of fun.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:58.200
- Thank you.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.033
- Thank you!
- Thank you,

00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:00.699
and I want to say a
huge thank you to Sonny.

00:27:00.699 --> 00:27:02.215
And like he was saying,

00:27:02.215 --> 00:27:03.930
we got two days to hang out.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.410
So we also filmed a video for his channel,

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.090
so definitely, the link will
be in the description box.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.653
Go check out his video on his channel.

00:27:13.352 --> 00:27:14.260
- We eat blood noodles

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.793
and he shows me how to
eat a giant water bug.

00:27:16.793 --> 00:27:17.626
(laughs)

00:27:17.626 --> 00:27:19.260
- That was a lot of fun.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.063
Best Ever Food Review Show.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.200
And yeah, links will all
be in the description box,

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.370
so go check out, go subscribe to Sonny,

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.260
and go check out the video,
the other video on his channel

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.400
that we did together

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.940
'cause that was a lot of fun.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.920
But today was amazing as well.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.174
Thank you Sonny.
- Amazing.

00:27:36.174 --> 00:27:37.527
I'm gonna get another ice cream.

00:27:37.527 --> 00:27:38.500
(laughs)

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.550
Cheers, man.
- Oh, he's still there.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.090
- [Sonny] Yeah, thank goodness.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.430
- Alright.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.543
Cool, what a day.
