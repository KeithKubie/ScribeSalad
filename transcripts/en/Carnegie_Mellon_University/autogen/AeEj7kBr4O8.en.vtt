contact with a person you have to be

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
contact with a person you have to be
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100
contact with a person you have to be
really careful with the types of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
really careful with the types of
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.570

they aren't going to be uncomfortable
 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.430
they aren't going to be uncomfortable
and say if you kind of know where them

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440
and say if you kind of know where them
 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.680
and say if you kind of know where them
say in a globe or some kind of robotic

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690
say in a globe or some kind of robotic
 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.140
say in a globe or some kind of robotic
clothing or assistive device and they

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150
clothing or assistive device and they
 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.910
clothing or assistive device and they
also have to preserve our natural

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
also have to preserve our natural
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920
also have to preserve our natural
function so in my lab we are developing

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
function so in my lab we are developing
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.050
function so in my lab we are developing
different types of sensors and actuators

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
different types of sensors and actuators
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.210
different types of sensors and actuators
and robots using soft materials were

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220
and robots using soft materials were
 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.190
and robots using soft materials were
like highly stretch up and deform

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
like highly stretch up and deform
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.039

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049
a trip we make very small micro channels
 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.930
a trip we make very small micro channels
inside and then this micro channel is

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
inside and then this micro channel is
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.999

liquid conductor the application could

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
liquid conductor the application could
 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020
liquid conductor the application could
give you can wear this material in your

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
give you can wear this material in your
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.270
give you can wear this material in your
body so you move around the you detect

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280

on developing new types of robotic arm

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459
on developing new types of robotic arm
 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.699
on developing new types of robotic arm
or systems we using soft materials and

safety so what when I was I've been

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
safety so what when I was I've been
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.500
safety so what when I was I've been
developing here the lab is a hybrid for

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510
developing here the lab is a hybrid for
 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.920
developing here the lab is a hybrid for
a lot that then merges elements of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930
a lot that then merges elements of
 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.900
a lot that then merges elements of
conventional riches robots and soft

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
conventional riches robots and soft
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.350

robots
 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.259
robots
so for example we have like a very

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269
so for example we have like a very
 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.539
so for example we have like a very
lightweight internal skeleton so it's

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549
lightweight internal skeleton so it's
 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.400
lightweight internal skeleton so it's
rigid and make sure that the arm only

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
rigid and make sure that the arm only
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.830
rigid and make sure that the arm only
moves in ways we wanted to but it's very

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840
moves in ways we wanted to but it's very
 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.390
moves in ways we wanted to but it's very
very lightweight save it as bump

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
very lightweight save it as bump
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.770
very lightweight save it as bump
something it doesn't have the movements

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780
something it doesn't have the movements
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.430
something it doesn't have the movements
of to cause any damage or any harm most

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
of to cause any damage or any harm most
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.920
of to cause any damage or any harm most
people have no idea what a soft robot is

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930
people have no idea what a soft robot is
 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.470
people have no idea what a soft robot is
and I think everybody will in a few

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480
and I think everybody will in a few
 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.020
and I think everybody will in a few
weeks and that's going to be a huge

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030
weeks and that's going to be a huge
 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.380
weeks and that's going to be a huge
change for our field
