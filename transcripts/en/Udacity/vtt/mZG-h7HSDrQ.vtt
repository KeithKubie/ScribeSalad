I don't know about you. But I think that online shopping is pretty great. Once

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:07.602
Grant realized how much easier many people find it to be, he decided that he

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:11.166
should make his glasses wipers, nozzles and cleaning solutions available for

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:17.396
purchase on the internet. To encourage his customers to buy more merchandise

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:21.240
online, he's come up with a fancy piece for his function that allows them to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.146
save money on shipping cost orr postage, if they spend more money buying his

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:32.200
products. Please note that costs of order here does not include the postage.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.799
And also note that the quantities in each of these columns are measured in

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:40.825
dollars. So, we can read this as, if the cost of the order is less than $10,

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:47.787
the postage is only $2.75. If the order costs between $10 and $50, postage is

00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:52.944
$5.00. And for a person who spends at least $50 on the site, they need not have

00:00:52.944 --> 00:00:59.368
to pay any postage at all. How much would the total cost, which is equal to the

00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:07.175
cost of the order plus the postage, be for each of the following. A, one nozzle

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:13.560
set for $9.99. B, a box of six nozzle sets for $49.99. C, some cleaning

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.980
solution for $1.99 and one nozzle set for $9.99. And d, a box of six nozzle

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.669
sets for $49.99 and some cleaning solution for $1.99. I've included the dollar

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:29.419
signs for you on all these amounts, so please just write in the numbers.
