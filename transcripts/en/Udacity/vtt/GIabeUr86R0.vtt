00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now it's time to have some automatic control of the brake.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We want to set the wheel slip to 0.2, but actually the only thing that we can control is the brake.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We can't directly control the wheel slip.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So the job is to provide the right input to the brake so that the measured wheel slip is about 0.2.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That's lot of things going on in between.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Think about the dynamics of the car, the surface of the road, and so on.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Situations such as these are studied in control theory.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
How to provide the right input to get the output that you want

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and this is the approach one would typically be using.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We found the difference of the optimum value and the actual current value to get the current error.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is fed into a code controller, which as the name says controls the brake.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So what we are doing right now is more than just a simulation.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We're simulating the brake, the dynamics of the car, the sensors but in addition to that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we're also be going to design a controller.

00:01:04.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's a piece of software or maybe hardware that's going to actually be part of that real car.
