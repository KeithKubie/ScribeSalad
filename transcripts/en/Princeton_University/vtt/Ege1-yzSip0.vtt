LUCY REEDER: When I came to
Princeton, I was looking for a

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.350
way to volunteer in the community.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.840
I decided to do something that
I've never done before and I

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.330
never thought I could do.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.720
I'm leaving Princeton knowing
that I can do anything.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:40.460

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.180 position:61%
entrepreneurship in Bagamoyo, Tanzania.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.670
FAAEZ UL HAQ: I worked on a
crowd-sourcing system for

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.750 position:63%
tracking corruption in public offices in

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.900
the developing world.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.410
YU-SUNG HUANG: I spent a summer
helping New York City

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.190
figure out how it can help
failing small businesses.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.200
ALAN UTRIA: I worked with an NGO in
South Africa called Nkanyiso.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.040
ARIELLE SANDOR: I was an enactor
in a magnet theater troop in

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.160
Nakuru, Kenya.

JAVARIA NAJEEB: I made a documentary about a

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.040
transgender person.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.250
EDUARDO CONTIJOCH: I led a
breakout trip to Washington, DC,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.180 position:67%
to look at HIV/AIDS issues in the district.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.100
LUCY REEDER: I volunteered with
the Princeton Fire Department.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.910

LUCY REEDER: We got one call at 6 a.m., in
December, for a structure fire

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.980
out in Hopewell.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.920
We really didn't know what to
expect until we came over a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.230
hill and we could see the house,
on the top of the hill,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.270
completely engulfed in flames.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.820
And I expected to feel nervous
but I was actually calm

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.010
because I knew that I had been
trained to know everything

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.860 position:66%
that I needed to know to get the job done.

EDUARDO CONTIJOCH: Meeting
individuals who were HIV-

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.940
positive, seeing that their
lives weren't just the fact

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.010
that they had an infection,
it really brought

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.210
the issue to life.


00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.000
ARIELLE SANDOR: Magnet theater
is a means of engaging a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.070
community in an issue that
they're facing internally

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.690
through theater, and then halfway
through the skit we'll

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.210
say, "OK, freeze point."

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.280
"What would you guys do if you
were in this position?"

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.660
[music]

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.250
JAVARIA NAJEEB: I took a class
titled "Social Issue Filmmaking."

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.590
The great thing about being at
Princeton is that there's a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.080
lot of collaboration between the
different departments, so

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.840
my class was a combination of
many different kinds of

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.470
perspectives in one classroom,
which is something that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.640
Princeton offers to all
its students.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.590
ARIELLE SANDOR: Princeton was
the reason that I found out

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.180
about magnet theater and, you
know, it's those connections,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.730 position:59%
it's those random conversations, those

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.640
appointments you schedule on
e-mail and you don't know how

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.740 position:61%
they're going to impact you, and
then it's like [finger-snap] everything

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.990
is just so different.


00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.400
[music]

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.700
FAAEZ UL HAQ: To think that this
could potentially have a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.140 position:61%
positive impact somewhere in the world,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.180
that's a really--

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.130
that's a really great feeling.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.290 position:88%
AMANDA REES: In the Dalai Lama Fellowship,
when we talk about takeaways, it's really like a greater

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.180 position:59%
understanding of compassion
and resilience and interconnectedness.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.410
YU-SUNG HUANG: Now, when I walk
through the streets of New

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.160
York, I see a very human side
behind every small business.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.220
JAVARIA NAJEEB: This gave me
a broader perspective of how

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.640 position:67%
the human condition is the same everywhere.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.750 position:67%
ALEXANDRIA ("CAMMIE") BROWN: I saw children
come in who were very

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.130
shy, and the children really
starting to get into the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.080
stories and I saw confidence
levels soar.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.210
BENJAMIN COGAN: I've been
inspired to start a global

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.620
poverty charity called Giving
What We Can, that both

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.050
encourages students to give
more to global poverty

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.700
charities and to give to the most

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.960
effective charities possible.

[music]

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.570
ALAN UTRIA: You get to go out
into the world and really

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.950
learn things you can't learn
in classrooms, and while

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.580
you're doing that hopefully, you
can also have an impact on

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.780 position:66%
the communities that you are working with.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.190
LUCY REEDER: There are many
different ways to make a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.960
difference, and you should
think about all of them

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.440
because you'll never know what
you'll be able to do.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.540 position:97%
ALEXANDRIA ("CAMMIE") BROWN: Anything that you can imagine, you can do here.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.300
ARIELLE SANDOR: There are so
many opportunities to get

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.570
involved, and it's just about
taking that first step, and

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.290
somehow, you'll find maybe five,
and you'll be able to

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.240
link them all together and
create this incredible path

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.840
that you never would have
imagined before.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.980 position:63%
ALEXANDRIA ("CAMMIE") BROWN: If you have
something that you're

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.210
passionate about, something that
you're interested in, if

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.760
you see a problem, then you can
really make a change and you

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.010
can make a difference.
