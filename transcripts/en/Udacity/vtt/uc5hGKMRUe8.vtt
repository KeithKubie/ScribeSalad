that we've discussed? Easier troubleshooting. Facilitating

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.710
research and evolution by allowing coexistence

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.530
of production networks with experimental ones.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.370
Better forwarding performance. And adjusting the

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.130
resources of the network as demands change. Please check all that apply.
