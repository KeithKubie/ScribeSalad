The portal is a project of Shared
Studios which is a nonprofit and they

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.690
have portals all around the world, so
today we're connecting with Amman, Jordan

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.689
and there is a very large Syrian refugee
population near where this portal is

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.869
located there. My students have been
studying the Syrian conflict

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.070
particularly and it's wonderful they
have the portal here for our students

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.579
and our faculty and staff and people
from around the university to have an

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.760
opportunity to interact with people live
and in-person.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.480
full-body experience.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.780
We are from Jordan. And she is Muffa, and this is Yousseff.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.860
I see. How was your day today?

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.920
I just got out of the portal and we were ending the talk, I was
facilitating for most of the afternoon

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.739
and one of the gentlemen mentioned this
young girl, fifteen years old had a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.699
beautiful voice he and she was very
soft-spoken throughout the entire

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.100
interaction and then started singing and
it was gorgeous.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.780
I'm like tearing up just

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.150
thinking of what just happened. She sang
a song in the other line in Arabic and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.930
she said it was about love and longing
and it was beautiful, and the song I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.210
usually sing, I'm Catholic, and so I sing
Ave Maria, which is one of my favorite

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.400
songs so it was just such a beautiful,
spiritual experience and just really

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.110
vulnerable; on the other end of the world
you're sharing this really intimate part

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.070
of you; here you are singing this song
that means so much to me and I could

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.729
tell the song meant so much to her and
it was just a connection I quite frankly

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.520
really haven't had in a long time, it was
just so beautiful.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.760
In my conversations with many different
families in the internally displaced

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.970
persons camp in Erbil, Iraq, they said
please just tell our stories let people

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.030
know about who we are and help people to
understand both the challenges we're

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.580
facing but also our resilience and the
fact that we are able not only to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.930
survive the challenges we're facing but
that we look to the future with great

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.240
hope and great aspiration.
