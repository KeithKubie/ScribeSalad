00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is my version of the function

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
for each of the characters we need to replace:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
"&amp;", "&gt;". "&lt;", "quote".

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I replace it with is appropriate escaped version of the string.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm just overriding the same string, over and over again--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which is maybe not the finest way to do it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but it'll work, in our case.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And keep in mind that we need to replace

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the ampersand first.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If you did it last, for example--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I enumerated it last, to be a jerk--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
you would replace "&gt;" with "&gt;"

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and then you'd replace the ampersand in your new Escaped string

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
with an "&amp;".

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So let's test this a few times,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
make sure it's working.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Okay. Obviously, it prints this test string test.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's give this one a test.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Okay. And this is what we get:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We see our "&lt;" is Escaped to "&lt;"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and our "&gt;" is Escaped and so is our next "&lt;" and our next "&gt;".

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Let's test the other ones, to make sure everything's working.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm going to get rid of these quotes and use single quotes instead

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so we can test the escaping of those.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And what's the other one we didn't test? Aha!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Yes, we'll do our quiz from before:

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
&amp; = &amp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And we'll see how this prints.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Okay. So here we go--Run.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We see our double quote was replaced with: "

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then our ampersand--

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
this was the quiz question we asked before--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
so we have: &amp; (which turns into one ampersand here) =&amp; (that ampersand);

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
just: amp--for the letters a-m-p;

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and then our closing quote.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Okay. So let me show you one other simpler way of writing this function.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We can replace most of this code--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
like so.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We could say: import cgi.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
As it turns out, this function is already included in Python:

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
cgi.escape (s, quote = True)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Otherwise, it doesn't Escape the quote

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and--oops--let's return this.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Okay. So another way of writing this function is just to use the cgi module

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that is included with Python, and let's give this a shot.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And, as you can see, it works just the same:

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
"hello, &amp; --blah, blah, blah, blah-blah.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We see our Escape version of our string here, and this is obviously

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a lot simpler than writing in your own.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You may need more functionality yours, if you want to do that in the future.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But for now, the built-in one will work just fine.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Okay. Good job.
