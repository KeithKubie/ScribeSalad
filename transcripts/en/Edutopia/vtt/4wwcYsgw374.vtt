00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:07.086
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right,
put your books away.

00:00:07.446 --> 00:00:07.976
&gt;&gt;Children: Aw.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.776
&gt;&gt;Katie: We know that
practice makes perfect.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:13.196
Our kids need to read every
single night in order to get good

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:15.006
and we start them out in first grade.

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.766
But by fifth grade, they're hitting
their targets and they're up to two

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:22.126
and a half years above grade level
on the STAR reading assessment.

00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:31.026
&gt;&gt;We really found that a lot of our
kids going home weren't finishing books.

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:33.866
They were, you know, reading
one chapter or fake reading

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.286
and not doing reading logs.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:38.956
So we as a staff decided that we
would want all of our students

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:40.456
to at least read one series.

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:41.306
That's how we started.

00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:44.056
&gt;&gt;Kris: We realized that we needed
to make it more incentivized

00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:46.516
for the students, where they would
want to read, where it became

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:47.906
like a self motivation thing.

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:50.176
And our principal decided
that it needed to start young.

00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:51.806
So we created these charm necklaces,

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:54.876
and every time they finish a
book series, they get a charm.

00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:56.956
Those things are like gold to them.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.586
&gt;&gt;Emmanuel: I really like to read.

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:03.186
I would read fifty books
a day if I had the time.

00:01:03.356 --> 00:01:06.216
&gt;&gt;Katie: We know that when children
finish an entire series written

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:10.136
by the same author, that they
get to love and know a character.

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:14.076
And so we found that they increase
comprehension, increase practice

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:18.016
in reading and don't waste
time staring at a bookshelf.

00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:23.556
&gt;&gt;Kris: When you see my class
read, they're engaged in the book.

00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:25.926
You can see them like be in the story

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:27.736
and that's really what
we were going for.

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:30.146
Then we were like, okay, now are
they really understanding what

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:31.236
they're reading?

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:33.526
That's where Accelerated
Reader comes in, AR.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.986
They take quizzes on books.

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:37.386
They get points, depending
on the size of the book

00:01:37.386 --> 00:01:39.906
and the difficulty of the book.

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:45.386
&gt;&gt;Nevadisa: We don't use the small
box up here, but we use the big boxes.

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:49.046
There's twenty of them, and you need
twenty points to get a lucky ducky.

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.266
&gt;&gt;Katie: For reading, we
offer a lot of incentives.

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:55.356
We do lucky duckies if they
get twenty points in the month.

00:01:55.826 --> 00:01:59.126
Then we also have trophies for
the class with the most AR points

00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:00.796
of the month in each grade level.

00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:03.496
&gt;&gt;Jamari? Braulio?

00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:07.246
&gt;&gt;Braulio: As I said, I had
a good view of the stage,

00:02:07.716 --> 00:02:10.656
and what I saw was quite unexpected.

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:12.426
&gt;&gt;Katie: Parents are
children's first teacher.

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:15.706
We need them on our team, we need them
to support what we're doing in school.

00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:19.086
We need them to engage in discussions
about what books they're reading,

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:22.766
and share that same enthusiasm at
home for learning and excitement.

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:25.666
&gt;&gt;Lorena: To me, the way that I
see him is he wants to be the best.

00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:31.296
Reading, math, AR test, AR points.

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:37.986
&gt;&gt;Braulio: Reading is one of my favorite
subjects in school, and also it helps

00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:40.416
when some books are so interesting,

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:43.796
sometimes I actually feel
like that I'm in the book.

00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:46.886
&gt;&gt;Student: She's starting
to get the sense

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:51.126
that he's just wanting
the money and the land.

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.366
&gt;&gt;Klaus: Okay, and then
couple that with what?

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:54.926
What's going on in her personal life?

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:58.596
&gt;&gt;Student: In her personal
life, her husband just died,

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:00.316
so why would she want another husband?

00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:01.106
&gt;&gt;Klaus: So this is good.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:04.146
So when you guys write your own novels,
that's the thing that I'm looking for.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.736
Can you capture those
complexity of emotions?

00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:09.046
&gt;&gt;By the time they get into
my classroom in fifth grade,

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.226
I would probably have guaranteed
that they had more hours than anybody

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:13.636
in the school district reading books.

00:03:13.886 --> 00:03:17.436
That allows me to spend less time on
fluency and then I can spend more time

00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:20.786
on the plot in the curriculum,
or in the character development,

00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:24.196
because I'm not losing a
lot of time on the basics.

00:03:24.916 --> 00:03:28.386
&gt;&gt;Elaine: Gamen, three point
nine, Ruben, four point zero,

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:30.356
so you just got a four, good job.

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:32.236
Vishnu, ten point eight.

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:33.076
&gt;&gt;Katie: That's awesome.

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:34.176
&gt;&gt;Elaine: How are you doing that?

00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:38.066
&gt;&gt;Vishnu: I read these chapter
books that give five to six points.

00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:41.276
&gt;&gt;Katie: Our reading is
just exponentially more

00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:43.336
than what it ever was,
you know, six years ago.

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:47.096
And each year, they keep reading
more and it really does improve

00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:50.186
that overall achievement and fluency
before they leave our school.
