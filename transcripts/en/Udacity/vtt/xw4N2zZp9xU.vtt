00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.480
Welcome to the Udacity
iOS Developer Nanodegree.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.510
I'm James.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.450
&gt;&gt; And I'm Garrett.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.010
&gt;&gt; And
we are iOS course managers at Udacity.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.650
We're excited to join you on your
path to becoming an iOS developer.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.150
In this nanodegree program,
you'll acquire the knowledge and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.120
skills necessary to be hired as
an entry level iOS developer.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.040
You'll hone your developer skills
with our videos, quizzes and

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.380
reading materials.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.290
You will also be creating a portfolio
of apps and submitting them for

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.750
feedback from our awesome
iOS project reviewers.

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:32.100
&gt;&gt; This nanodegree program assumes you
have experience with an object oriented

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.500
programming language.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.870
Don't worry if you
haven't used Swift yet.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.535
If you're comfortable with terms like
classes, objects, inheritance and

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:41.860
polymorphism, you should be fine.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.540
If not, we recommend taking
our beginning iOS nanodegree.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.260
&gt;&gt; All of your apps will be built using
the newest stable release of Xcode.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.630
If you don't have it installed yet,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.368
you'll need to download
it to your Mac now.

00:00:53.368 --> 00:00:57.100
To download Xcode, select the Apple
icon on the top left of your screen and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.590
choose App Store.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.210
You can search for Xcode here.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.510
And whenever there is an update, you can
update it here in the App Store as well.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.460
Xcode will allow you to run
your apps on iPhone and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.780
iPad simulators right on your computer.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.320
If you sign up for
a free Apple developer account,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.090
you can also deploy your
apps to your own device.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.190
We've included a link
on how to register for

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.840
an Apple developer account
in the notes below.
