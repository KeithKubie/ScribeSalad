00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.330
 Sergo Cusinella: Hello and welcome. 

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.830
 My name is Sergio Cusinella and I work 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.550
 Software Engineer at Android Team at Truecaller. 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.340
 Today I'll talk about how to create apps 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.710
 For fast-growing markets. 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.650
 But before this, let me brief introduction 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.990
 About Truecaller. 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.760
 It is a company that started in Stockholm, Sweden. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.650
 We have three main products: 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.480
 Truecaller - an application 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.790
 Lets you know your caller in real time, 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.230
 Even if you do not have his number in your phone book. 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.710
 It also prohibits calls from the most important hackers in your area, 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.520
 It always gives you access to 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.689
 Correct information about people and businesses 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.140
 When you need it. 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.670
 Truedialer - It's a phone app 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.700
 Enrich your call history with photos and contacts 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.854
 When you do not have it. 

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:42.270
 It also lets you know 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.260
 The person you plan to contact before 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.792
 Make a call if its number is not in a book 

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:47.600
 your phone. 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.532
 Finally, Truemessenger - it's a messaging application 

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:52.365
 Lets you know the sender 

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:54.010
 Messages in real time. 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.350
 Spam is also automatically blocked and filtered 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.050
 So that the inbox remains safe and clean. 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.000
 Now, we return to the subject of talk, 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.989
 I will present you a short introduction on emerging markets 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.350
 Then I talk about how to create great experiences for them 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.234
 In the end, I will talk about the extent to which the definition of "free" 

00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:11.150
 In these places. 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.470
 When companies want 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.310
 Launch new products, they usually 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.260
 Think of Western markets like North America and West 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.060
 Europe 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 These areas include a large number of potential users. 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800
 In fact, reached the end of 2014 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.650
 The number of smartphone users in the United States is 163 million 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.310
 And 197 million in Western Europe. 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.970
 As well as the growing number 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.480
 But at a fairly moderate pace. 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.760
 While underestimating the latent power 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.890
 Which can all other markets 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.010
 Influence on the distribution of products. 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.270
 As we see here, by the end of 2014, 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.260
 Smartphone users in China reached 522 million 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.550
 In India 270 million and in the Middle East North Africa 122 million. 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.400
 We should also remember that second billion 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.729
 Of internet users, are located in these areas. 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.860
 So these areas will undoubtedly continue to grow exponentially 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.450
 In the number of users. 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.030
 Creating great products is very easy 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.520
 With our new cutting-edge devices 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.050
 Enjoy unlimited data plans on very fast LTE networks. 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.830
 We sometimes forget 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.980
 What is the norm in emerging markets? 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.390
 When it comes to hardware, it's usually equipped with dual SIM cards, 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.560
 The screens are not too big, 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.710
 The accuracy degrees are not very high, 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.650
 Even the new hardware, limited in terms of CPU and memory - well 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.590
 Relatively limited. 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.110
 The purchase of new smartphones is of course not available to everyone 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.860
 So there are a lot of users who actually buy 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.216
 Used equipment is a central processing unit and a GPU 

00:03:00.216 --> 00:03:00.716
 More limited. 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.710
 The devices do not work 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.350
 With the latest version of Android. 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.160
 And may not download any updates to it. 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.750
 When talking about data, they are mostly prepaid plans, 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.990
 Not too cheap, 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.320
 Users do not use the Internet 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.560
 Except when absolutely necessary. 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.330
 If we look at smart phones as a 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.580
 The only entrance to the Internet, 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.360
 It will show how careful data is used. 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.880
 In the end we talk about networks - it's very slow. 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.710
 3G networks are becoming mainstream, 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.620
 But it is crowded. 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.090
 Even Wi-Fi networks are slow because they are based on slow landline connections 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.850
 . 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.230
 They are not always available. 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.250
 How do we create a great experience for these markets? 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.200
 Well, as I mentioned we can not rely on applications that need continuous communication 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.050
 Internet access. 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.610
 That means we need to be empowered 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.050
 Users are able to open the application and use it partially 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.720
 At least while offline. 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.060
 Which means we must create some sort of cache layer. 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.460
 But as I mentioned, the hardware memory is limited. 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.170
 So when we do this, of course 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.190
 We have to bear in mind the proportionality between 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.470
 Cache and available memory 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.680
 the device. 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.260
 It is best to collect mdpi and ldpi resources. 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.750
 The accuracy of xxx-hdpi may not be essential for these markets. 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.780
 Certainly, we must bear in mind the size of the download of images, 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.050
 Given that this controls the application's use of the data. 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.290
 So we should try downloading thumbnails and preview images 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.570
 And delay the download of images 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.500
 As full as possible. 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.060
 When doing this, we actually need to 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.130
 Check the portability 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.690
 Full images on the device 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.000
 Where the size may be larger than the device. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.450
 Of course, we do not forget to change the image size - 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.820
 Its execution on the server does not cost a lot of money, 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.140
 So we do not have to implement it on devices 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.085
 Especially when the CPU and GPU are limited. 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.255
 Most importantly, because devices are not strong enough, 

00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:15.430
 We must absolutely 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.464
 Taking into account the animation and the speed of transport 

00:05:18.464 --> 00:05:19.880
 Which gives meaning to the application 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.170
 An important aspect of it. 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.200
 It is best to end up offering 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.770
 The interface is simple but rather smooth 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.380
 The interface is beautiful but slow. 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.010
 Finally, the translation comes - we must certainly 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.470
 Strive to offer a local language experience 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.500
 So invest in translation. 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.430
 We now turn to the definition of "free" - 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.090
 Looking at these three applications, 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.050
 We note that it is possible to download them all free of charge 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.570
 Play Store. 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.290
 But what users are looking for in emerging markets as well 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.880
 Is the application size, 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.300
 For example, when a user is seen in India 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.640
 To this application, 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.180
 Find it to download it via Caller 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.440
 It costs about 2 euros, while downloading 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.820
 LinkedIn costs him 4 times this. 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.150
 As you mentioned, users use pre-paid data plans, 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.430
 So the size of the application is a very important factor. 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.360
 Thus, sizes are essential. 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.830
 We must do everything possible 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.310
 Make sure the application is as small as possible. 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.260
 Translations have a great impact on experience, 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.570
 But at the same time occupy a certain amount of space, 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.130
 This means that we must add translation 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.490
 Which are of real importance for business activity only, 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.590
 And ensure that all translations are removed 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.170
 Compatible, 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.050
 They may add libraries we use. 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.220
 Of course, we must also remove all unused resources. 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.950
 There are some tools that can help us in this 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.430
 Such as string and lint resources. 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.960
 We must use light coloring 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.630
 And color filtering so that we can reuse the symbols. 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.070
 We definitely need to improve photos and maybe 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.810
 Try other image formats. 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.900
 Use ProGuard to compress the application 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.000
 As much as possible. 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.730
 Finally, third-party libraries - it's great 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.320
 It allows us not to repeat 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.970
 Circle each time. 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.160
 But at the same time we may occupy a certain amount of space, 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.790
 So we must watch them. 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.240
 It's also good to remember that you can import Google Play services 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.490
 In modular form, 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.080
 We should take advantage of this. 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.160
 I hope this presentation 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.930
 Has given you a general idea of ​​how to improve 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.570
 Your products for emerging markets, 

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.310
 If you have not done this before, 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.927
 They began to think about it. 

00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:55.760
 Thank you so much. 

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.560
