00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.930
&gt;&gt;commentatorDavid: We're fortunate to have
Jeff Ansell here today to talk, to talk about

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.360
his book, “When the Headline Iis You”.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.049
At Google we can, we can appreciate both sides
of-of news stories of the type that-that Jeff

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.610
writes about.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.730
One side you're worried that your-your words
are going to be twisted; you feel that-that

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.899
the-the journalists are predators trying to-to
force things out of you that you don't believe,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.259
don't want to say.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.079
On the other side, we read articles that are
just bsB-S. We see interviews where the questions

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.190
aren't being answered.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.660
Jeff from his background in journalism and
then advising people how to talk to-to journalists

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.800
helps us navigate the middle ground. How to
actually answer questions; how to not be a

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.850
stonewall and-and not be-be prey. And as a
result I think what he has to say is-is really

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.850
relevant to those of us at Google.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.129
No further ado. Jeff , he's here to-to talk
to us about his book one that [unintelligible]

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.230
you “When the Headline Is You” and I hope
you all have a chance to read it soon.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.220
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Thank you very much, David.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.220
Hey everybody.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.220
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Hi.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.220
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: How's everyone today?

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.220
&gt;&gt;some audience members: Good.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.220
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Good, good.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.340
First of all I wanna thank you folks for the
invitation to be here; I'm very grateful.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:27.820
Thank you for having the interest to be here
as well.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.220
[pause]

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.140
I am a media and crisis communications advisor.
What I do is I help companies and governments

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.290
and individuals when they're caught smack
dab in the glare of the media spotlight; sometimes

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.290
when the news isn't very good; and in fact
oftentimes controversial.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.750
I find myself working most often in cases
that can be considered tough, high profile,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.110
no win situations. I worked on the Erin Brockovich
case in California; I've trained White House

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.820
spokespeople; I just finished a stint with
the Vancouver Olympics.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.899
I play a very modest role as a, as a faculty
member of the Public Disputes Program at Harvard

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.899
Law School. I help instruct in the course,
‘Dealing With aAn Angry Public’ which

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:11.899
starts tomorrow right next door, by the way.

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:12.899
And I also have the opportunity to lecture
annually at Harvard Business School in the

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:13.899
course ‘Negotiation Dynamics’. And what
I do is I work the MBA students to help them

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:24.989
gain a degree of sensitivity to the impact
of values and emotion inand communication

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.480
on the negotiation process.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.670
So in the time that we have this morning,
I'm hoping that we can share some thoughts;

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.870
a couple of ideas about the state of journalism
today.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:43.900
Also I'd like to chat about why I wrote the
book and share with you some stories from

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.560
my days as a journalist.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.819
And I invite you every step along the way,
please feel free to stop me, ask questions;

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.080
I'll do my very best to answer as we go along.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.080
[pause]

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.130
If I may, I'd like to very briefly read just
a few paragraphs from the book that I think

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.499
sets the tone for what this all about. It's
from the-the book's introduction.

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.499
[pause]

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:09.739
"Answering questions from reporters is risky
business. Though a media interview may feel

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.739
like this great forward a straightforward
conversation, it actually represents a contrived

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:11.739
and manipulative dynamic.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.329
Knowing how to talk to reporters is actually
like learning a new language, and it bears

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:30.169
little if any resemblance to everyday conversation
and it's a mistake for anyone to believe otherwise.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.560
[pause]

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.730
It may seem as if speaking the truth should
be enough to build credibility and trust,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.779
but that's not the case. Exposing oneself
to media scrutiny requires more than simple

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:49.200
candor. I; it requires knowledge, training,
and a keen understanding of how reporters

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.310
write the news."

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.680
Any in my nearly 40 years of experience doin'
this, I've yet to meet anyone for whom media

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.650
skills come naturally.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.430
"Answering tough questions is difficult even
for reporters themselves.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.219
You'd think that being skilled in asking questions
would provide insight in how to answer them.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:08.450
I discovered otherwise, however, in a training
session that I conducted in Washington for

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.209
famed Watergate journalist, Carl Bernstein.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.440
In the training, my first question to Carl
was about his troubled relationship with his

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.449
Watergate partner, Bob Woodward and to my
surprise Carl put his foot in his mouth so

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.400
deeply it came out the other end, and I learned
something important that day.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.370
Anyone can ask questions, the real skill is
in answering them.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.889
So it should be of little surprise then that
many executives and government leaders and

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.680
spokespeople are reluctant to engage the news
media. Their concern is justified.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.160
People who talk to the media are only as good
as their worst quote. Though someone answering

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.229
a reporter's question may strike all the right
notes for the majority of the interview, it

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.020
takes only a single miscue to trigger disaster.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.759
One misstatement to a reporter can destroy
long held goodwill or cause a company's share

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:55.759
price to plummet.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.860
And I think legendary investor, Warren Buffett,
said it best: 'It takes 20 years to build

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.650
a reputation; five minutes [laughs] to ruin
it.'"

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.490
Actually probably in this day and age less
than five minutes.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.940
I was a pretty aggressive reporter. When I
used to show up for work every day, my editors

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:24.870
used to say to me, "Well Jeff, who's life
you gonna ruin today?"

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.870
[laughter]

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:34.259
I was oftentimes about as popular as a, as
a, as a pig at a Bar Mitzvah.

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:35.379
[pause]

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:53.300
Now that I'm out of journalism, I-I've had
opportunity to think about why I got into

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:13.449
it in the first place. And it's-it's funny
 -- I didn't see any of this when I was in

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:31.909
it for 20 years, but I became a reporter I
think in part because I-I grew up angry.

00:06:31.909 --> 00:07:00.810
My late father was
a factory worker and I recall the callous

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:20.760
way in which he was treated and it made me,
it made me upset that-that decent people were

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:31.930
treated in a very disrespectful fashion by
their employers. And it-it made me wanna fight

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:45.860
on behalf of

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:52.180
the little guy, and being a reporter let me
do that.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:08:03.289
I didn't become a reporter right away though.
I left school at age 16. I sold encyclopedias

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:10.159
door-to-door; I was a dishwasher; I was a
factory worker. I worked in a couple of different

00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:21.870
factories; I worked in a pantyhose factory
where I-I used to sew the legs in the pantyhose

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:35.250
together for three cents a dozen; I didn't
make very much money. And I worked in a clothing

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.010
factory as well.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:51.130
My parents were-were very upset because I
was supposed to be a professional and how

00:08:51.130 --> 00:09:02.589
the heck did I end up doin' this?

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:28.290
And-and one day when I was in the factory,
I-I called in sick because I was able to get

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:43.840
an audition for a local radio station. And
I was 16 years old but I told them I was 19;

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:52.959
I told 'em I was going to university even
though I hadn't even completed high school.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:10:10.399
And I did the audition and

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:22.839
I thought I'd done a lousy job and went back
to the factory the next day. And then I got

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:37.570
a phone call; not at the factory but to my
house telling me that I got the job.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:44.339
So though I-I terribly upset my parents, the
book is dedicated to my mother and father

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:45.339
so things came together.

00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:56.770
And by the way, that-that pantyhose factory
was mistreating its employees. I did an investigation

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:05.800
on them when I became a reporter so they got
what was comin' to 'em.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:20.650
And the other ironic thing is the clothing
factory where I used to be a shipper and used

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:33.670
to schlep all these bundles on my back, they
later provided my wardrobe when I was a TV

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:39.190
news anchor. So it's nice the way things turned
around.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.190
[pause]

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:46.310
When I was a reporter, I was very grateful
to do, to do a whole bunch of interesting

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.060
things. There was one story that-that changed
everything for me.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.060
[pause]

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:57.310
It was about a young boy named Kevin. He was
about eight years old and Kevin didn't have

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:06.360
a-a family; he was in foster care and he kept
getting shunted from one home to another and

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.639
he was a very, very sad little boy.

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:20.269
And I did a-a documentary on adoption and
I focused on Kevin. And to this day I often

00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:28.680
think that if-if Kevin found a home, it's
probably one of the most important things

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.610
I've ever done in my life; if he found a home
as a result of that story.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:44.220
And that's when I realized the power of the
pen and the camera. We can get an awful lot

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.220
done.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:56.290
As one of the stories I worked on, I posed
undercover as a drug addict for 12 months

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:06.500
to expose doctors who were pushing drugs.
And I wired myself with a hidden microphone

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:22.740
and I went to visit these docs every week
for a year; never once asking for drugs; never

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:28.250
once did they examine me.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:40.009
And I can tell you that I collected an awful
lot of drugs from those guys. I put them all

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:47.410
in a safe because the federal authorities
came to count the drugs after. And I'm grateful

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:55.720
to say that both docs lost their licenses
and got what was comin' to them.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:09.810
I spent 12 months tracking Nazi war criminals
here in the United States and in Canada; found

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:19.710
a couple of these guys. I got one shipped
back to Western Europe for trial; exposed

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.010
the others.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:34.600
It was most distasteful to work on that story;
I hated every single minute of it.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:51.730
And when I was lookin' at the evidence that
showed how terrible these people were and

00:14:51.730 --> 00:15:07.639
how they destroyed innocent lives, I wanted
to put my-my-my hands around their necks and-and

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:12.069
do the job myself. Thankfully we caught them.

00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:19.839
I spent a year investigating nursing homes
where I live. I planted spies inside homes

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:28.040
'cause people weren't being treated right.
And I'm grateful to say we closed up one home

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:37.259
and we got some amendments to the nursing
home laws in the community where I live.

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:38.259
[pause]

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:46.170
I had a great run in journalism. And then
one day something happened.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.580
We were gonna go on the air for the six o'clock
news on TV, and we didn't really have a lead

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.579
story that day; all we had was a stabbing.

00:15:51.579 --> 00:16:01.650
And I never liked to lead the newscast with
a stabbing because as terrible as a stabbing

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:07.320
is, in a major market station, you'd think
there'd be something a little more of significance

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.600
for everybody in the community.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:21.790
And it was about ten to six and as we were
getting ready to go on the air, the assignment

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:28.040
editor got on the loud speaker and he announced
to the room, "Good news. We have a lead story.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.839
The stabbing victim died." [chuckles]

00:16:32.839 --> 00:16:42.889
And the newsroom erupted in a cheer. And that
was the day I left journalism.

00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:46.120
And it just was getting to me that was just,
that put me over the edge.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.690
So I thought, "Let me take everything I've
learned in the past 20 years and apply it

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:56.000
to another-another purpose." And that's why
I became what's called a media and crisis

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.250
communications coach; media trainer.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:04.830
I help people deal with the news media because
it sure ain't a natural playing field now.

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.770
I know myself that when I was a reporter,
I’d say with great respect to the people

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:16.030
I interviewed, "I can get anybody to say anything
I want." And I kinda feel bad about that now

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:27.260
in some cases, but I was still in the process
of seeking redemption and this book is part

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.230
of that.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:50.510
Because the process of answering questions
for media, as I said earlier from the introduction,

00:17:50.510 --> 00:18:06.820
is very unnatural. It can be like learning
a new conversation, a new language; it's stilted,

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:13.480
it's scheming, it's manipulative, and can
be conniving.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:27.360
But I wanna be clear here, I didn't write
this book to bash the media. I'm very, very

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:46.570
grateful for many of the things I had an opportunity
to do as a reporter. I shared some with 'ya’.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:52.223
It's a noble calling and I'll always stay
in my head, it'll always stay in my head the

00:18:52.223 --> 00:19:02.140
quote by Thomas Jefferson who said, "I'd rather
have newspapers without government than government

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.170
without newspapers."

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:12.640
Now there has been a revolutionary shift in
how news is produced and how news is consumed,

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:19.610
and that's thanks in large part to you folks
at Google because the fact of the matter is

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:30.490
today anyone can be a reporter. In fact, Matt
Rudge Drudge said, "We're all newsmen now."

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:36.270
The problem is that we're in a state ofseeing
a continual dumbing down of the news these

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.270
days.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:42.980
I mean just in the last week alone, what have
some of the stories been? Paris Perez Hilton

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:49.340
will stop bullying people on his website,
that's in the news. Bristol Palin was [ ]kicked

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:55.830
off “Dancing with the Stars”; that was
in the news. Keith Richards writes a book

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:01.250
and describes Mick Jagger's private parts;
that's in the news, believe it or not.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.614
And so this is something that's quite concerning.

00:20:02.614 --> 00:20:08.340
And there are a number of reasons for this
dumbing down phenomena. First of all, fewer

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.870
consumers of news are lookin' for thoughtful
public policy discourse.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.880
We're told by so-called experts about diminished
attention spans the viewers, listeners, readers

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.130
have these days.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:19.010
Newsrooms themselves are experiencing a great
many cutbacks; people are losing their jobs;

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:28.980
you have reporters who are doing more with
less. Now it's, you have some reporters who'll,

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:38.159
who will work for the paper and they gotta
schlep around a TV camera with 'em 'cause

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:53.310
they gotta upload the-the information, the
and video to the Web; they gotta keep writing

00:20:53.310 --> 00:21:16.470
stories for the Web; and it's a, it's a, it's
lot of work on them now. And what it is, it's

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:28.891
research on the run and their they’re writing
history in a hurry.

00:21:28.891 --> 00:21:41.630
The problem is I think it's just it's just
too easy to become media road kill. It's too

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:52.520
easy for decent, innocent people to say somethin'
that they wish they hadn't said. And there's

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.150
a lot of casualties along the way because
it's very easy, very easy to become negative

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.740
and defensive and argumentative when you're
dealing with a reporter.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:05.320
And why? Because reporters approach stories
from a predetermined perspective; it's almost

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:12.350
a paint by numbers approach. And I didn't
realize any of this when I was journalist;

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.660
I had to get the distance to figure this out.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:22.350
But if you look at any controversial story,
it's a predictable cast of characters.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:28.500
If you have controversy, the first character
you need is the victim. And I'm not trivializing,

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.990
but somebody's gotta get hurt.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:37.470
If you have a victim, it means you need to
have a villain.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:50.140
If you have a villain and you have a victim,
it means you need to have a hero; somebody's

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.169
who's ridin' in to save the day.

00:22:53.169 --> 00:23:04.179
Then you have a character that I call, "the
witness" who saw the whole darn thing happen.

00:23:04.179 --> 00:23:15.260
And then there's the character I call, "the
expert." And when I was a reporter I used

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:26.730
to try to put the expert into a white lab
coat so they'd look official and be part of

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:32.470
a narrative; they didn't even have to speak;
they'd look as if they were expert.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.860
And then there's the character that I call,
"the village idiot." And the village idiot

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:42.570
is [chuckles] the one who really gums everything
up for everybody.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:50.530
And the risk oftentimes is that the villain
and the village idiot can be one in and the

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.530
same.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:58.760
And I say respectfully if you look at the
recent BP debacle, the villain of course was

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:04.470
BP itself and the village idiot may in fact
have been the President Tony Hayward, who

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:12.210
of course said a few things to the media that
I'm sure he regrets.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.210
But you know it's not even controversial stories
 ?

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.210
[pause[

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:19.240
that can pose risks. Even good news stories
are or stories [chuckles] that are supposed

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.180
to be good news can be problematic.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:31.100
John Walter was named leader of AT&amp;T. They
held a news conference to announce it and

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:39.070
then one of the reporters says to him, "Mr.
Walter, who was your service provider?"

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.070
[pause]

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:49.240
And Walter didn't know how to answer, "I don't
know." And that day AT&amp;T's market cap plummeted

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.240
four billion dollars.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.240
[pause]

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.880
Now if you were advising John Walter, what's
the best answer for that question? What do

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.960
ya think?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.040
&gt;&gt;audience: AT&amp;T.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.190
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Pardon me?

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:07.730
Okay, AT&amp;T fine; he could get away with it,
but it's a lie. Okay.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:15.010
Well But we really don't wanna lie to the
media because they're smart and they'll figure

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:21.120
it out and it doesn't look good 'cause once
tell you he wasthey tag you as a liar, it

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.120
sticks.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.890
What's another possible alternative?

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:35.390
"Mr. Walter who's your service provider?"
and you haven't got a clue, what do ya say?

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.010
&gt;&gt;male in audience: What do you think?

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:47.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Well I'll tell you in a sec,.
I wanna hear what you think.

00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:52.419
&gt;&gt;male in audience: No, what do you think?

00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:55.380
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: What do I think?

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.720
&gt;&gt;several audience members speaking at once:
[unintelligible]

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.059
&gt;&gt;male in audience: What do you think?

00:26:02.059 --> 00:26:10.179
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Oh, what do you think? Okay.
I think it’s AT&amp;T sir, am I right? [laughs]

00:26:10.179 --> 00:26:11.179
[laughter]

00:26:11.179 --> 00:26:13.789
And we’re back where we started from.

00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:17.230
&gt;&gt;several audience members speaking at once:
[unintelligible]

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.570
&gt;&gt;male in audience: You could lie.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:24.029
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: You could lie, but it's not,
we don't counsel that.

00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:28.500
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Starting in an hour, it’ll
it will be AT&amp;T?.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.730
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: That's the best answer.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:37.260
Or something along the lines of, "Regardless
of who it's been, it's AT&amp;T from now on."

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.520
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Right.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.520
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Okay.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:48.909
Anyway it was just a, that was the signal
of a very terrible time for John Walter and

00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:52.330
he didn't last terribly long at-at AT&amp;T.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:27:00.740
But most every company is one sentence away
from disaster. That's all it takes. Look at

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:08.190
Tony Hay-Hayward, our friend from BP. Remember
his quote? What was his famous quote?

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:12.059
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I want my life back.

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:15.460
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: I want my life back.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:26.250
Now here's the thing: it's quite conceivable
that Tony Hayward, when he made that comment,

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.460
he made a number of other comments.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:35.460
Let's presume he delivered ten sentences and
nine of them were genuine and heartfelt and

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:43.960
one sentence was, and he probably didn't even
mean it in a selfish way, but he says, "I

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.940
want my life back."

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:54.570
Well you don't have to be a-a journalism professor
from Columbia University to figure out that's

00:27:54.570 --> 00:28:05.210
the one quote they're gonna use because you
are only as good as your worst quote. But,

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:12.830
and the thing is people oftentimes, they'll
read the paper the next day, they'll watch

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:21.190
TV, they'll see a quote like that getting
used and you know what they're gonna say,

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:29.600
it's predictable. "Where's the rest of what
I said. They took me out of context."

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:38.179
No, no. T they weren't taken out of context;
they were edited.

00:28:38.179 --> 00:28:47.850
And that's one of the things I do is I share
with people strategies and techniques to make

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:55.549
sure that every single sentence that comes
out of your mouth is honest -- number one,

00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:59.780
and that it works in your favor.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.860
But again it's too easy for reasonably intelligent
people to put their foot in their mouths.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.269
Sunrise Hospital, example, in New York, part
of the Columbia Hospital System.

00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:22.970
They had a terrible situation happen not long
ago when a homeless man showed up at the Emergency

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:28.809
Room door and he went to the front desk and
he said, "Please I have terrible chest pains.

00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:31.070
C, can I see a doctor?"

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:41.200
And the woman behind the counter said, "Well,
sir I need your insurance card." He said,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:30:06.380
"Ma'am I'm homeless. I know I smell, I know
I'm dirty, but I have a real bad chest pain.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:12.490
Can you please help me see a doctor?"

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.730
"Sir, I need your insurance."

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:30.340
Anyway what happened was they walked him out
the front door and about 30 feet from the

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:37.240
front door, what do you think happens? He
keels over and he dies.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:45.340
He was a young man; he was in his 30's.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:55.899
So ABC News Primetime Live does an investigation.

00:30:55.899 --> 00:30:57.230
[pause]

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:04.110
And Brian Ross is a very good reporter; he's
probably one of the best reporters around

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.600
today; -- investigative reporters.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:13.210
He's interviewing the PR person at Sunrise
Hospital and he says to her, "Well, what's

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:24.409
your reaction to the fact that your Emergency
Room turned down this man because he didn't

00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:25.669
have insurance?"

00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:35.080
And she got all defensive and finally she
says, "Look it, we're all gonna die."

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.080
[laughter]

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:45.940
Now you know, if it you're Brian Ross and
you hear that quote, you know you just struck

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.940
oil.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:53.899
But there's the papers are riddled on a regular
basis with people saying dumb things. Remember

00:31:53.899 --> 00:31:59.059
that earthquake in Italy about a year or so
ago?

00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:05.590
Sylvio Berlusconi, the Prime Minister Italy,
remember what he said to all the people who

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:11.139
lost their homes? "Pretend you're on vacation.
Go to the beach. Go camping."

00:32:11.139 --> 00:32:12.139
[pause]

00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:18.130
You know and-and those are negative stories,
but a-a negative story doesn't even have to

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:22.060
be true in order for it to get legs.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:28.070
More than a hundred years ago Mark Twain said,
"A lie can travel halfway around the world

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:33.230
while the truth is still putting on its shoes."
And that was before television; before radio;

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.360
before the Internet.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.300
So how much more true is that today?

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:52.820
And I can tell ya that whether a person is
dealing with a negative situation that's real

00:32:52.820 --> 00:33:01.000
or not real, there's a particular response
pattern that people fall into. And you may

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:17.350
notice this on the news when you've seen you’re
seeing people who are being interviewed, oftentimes

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.490
reluctantly.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:30.520
When somebody is confronted by a reporter,
the first thing they do is they stop breathing.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:40.690
The second thing they do is they stop listening.
The third thing they do is they feverishly

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:48.110
say to themselves, "How am I gonna answer?
How am I gonna answer." ?" The fourth thing

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:56.000
they do is they start arguing. And the fifth
thing they do is they have an out of body

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
experience.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
[laughter]

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:09.570
And of course when the story comes out, they’re
their very upset about it and what's their

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:18.220
complaint gonna be, ? "Where's the rest of
what I said? They took me outta context."

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:27.590
You see what a lot of people have to realize
is that when they're mired in bad news, all

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:32.650
the facts in the world aren't gonna change
anybody's opinion,

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:33.650
[pause]

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:40.720
because bad news is driven by emotion. And
just about every bad news story that's out

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.720
there has emotion attached to it.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:51.210
We deliver the ‘Dealing With an Angry Public’
course at MIT Harvard. And we get a bunch

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:55.690
of people who take the course usually from
the ugliest sectors around. We get nuclear

00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:05.290
people and sometimes we get people from tobacco;
the gun lobby sometimes comes.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:15.650
And oftentimes somebody will stand up at the
beginning of a program, usually it's a, it's

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:31.680
an engineer, with great respect. And the engineer
will say to everybody, "The reason we're taking

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:38.790
the program ‘Dealing With an Angry Public’
is because we wanna help our angry publics

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:46.020
learn how to strip away emotion so they focus
only on facts."

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:51.450
And we get a good laugh out of that.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:36:04.860
Because if it's about a battle between fact
and emotion in the court of public opinion,

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:10.960
emotion is always gonna win.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:17.580
Now with a court of law or in the regulatory
world, facts will prevail.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.840
But most people fight their battles in the
court of public opinion.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:31.460
And they-they often fight their cause by using
traditional public relations strategies and

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.780
those strategies don't work anymore.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.750
Because one public relations strategy that
has been used and used and used is the one

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:48.220
where the message is the mantra, . Oover and
over and over again the individual will repeat

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:53.540
the same message regardless of the question
that's asked.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:59.200
And it just makes them look foolish because
each time they repeat the same question over

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:13.390
and over again, it strips away a layer of
sincerity from them. And they think, "Well

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:22.010
I'll show the reporter there's no way she's
gonna get me 'cause I'll just keep saying

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:26.480
my message over and over again."

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:42.540
But what I used to do when I was a reporter
is I would feature my question and the answer

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:54.320
and if I asked them five times and five times
they gave the same dumb response, I would

00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:07.130
feature that in my story. And so who's the,
who looks foolish now?

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.130
[pause]

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:15.330
The other mistake the traditional public relations
strategies make is to overwhelm people with

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:23.020
data. "Well you know let me just share what
the numbers indicate here. You know if you

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.701
look at the parts for per million they come
in;" it doesn't work. In part because the

00:38:25.701 --> 00:38:30.220
information that people deliver comes from
them and it's not credible when it comes from

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.520
them. It has to come from a credible third
party source.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.600
The other thing is that very often people
in bad news are-are-are reluctant to refute

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.930
the concerns of angry people. To, they, they
don't wanna engage angry people.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.790
So if people are suffering, very often a company
or organization will not want to acknowledge

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.660
it. Why? Because it gives credence to their
perspective; it gives credence to their arguments.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:45.100
And so it makes people angrier when a company
refuses to acknowledge the harm it may have

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:52.150
done or at least acknowledge the fact that
some people perceive there's been harm.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:59.440
Because when you're dealing with-with upset
people, there's two things they want. The

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:08.580
second thing they want is-is, "Fix my problem."
The first thing they want is for you to acknowledge

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.580
it.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.630
And what often stands in the way of course
are lawyers.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.630
[pause]

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:22.440
Lawyers have the ear of the CEO. And the lawyers'
expertise is in protecting the company in

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:32.610
a court of law and that's why the lawyer exercises
too much influence around the table.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:42.640
The problem, of course, is that a lawyer will
save you a hundred million dollars in a court

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:59.240
of law and cost you a billion dollars in the
court of public opinion in terms of lost sales

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:05.930
and so on. So who's the winner there?

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:06.930
[pause]

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:10.040
Also traditional public relation strategies
tell you that if you're a spokesperson, never

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.240
use a negative word; never use, even-even
if it's a terrible situation.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:18.740
I was training somebody who was a plant manager,
a whole bunch of plant managers, and we were

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.840
simulating that day a-a-an accident at the
factory. And in the accident simulation, there

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.840
were fatalities.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.360
And so my question to the plant manager in
our simulation was, "What's your response

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.260
to the deaths that took place in your factory
today."

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:32.260
And he says to me, "Well you know we're very
proud of our safety record."

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.260
[laughter]

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:39.290
"Excuse me? How can you say that given the
fact that there are people dead?"

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:47.770
And what did he tell me? He had media training.
And the media trainer told him never say anything

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:48.770
negative which is absolutely bologna baloney
and nonsense.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.110
Because sometimes you do have to do use negative
words,; otherwise people just aren't gonna

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:57.610
believe you. If you're in a situation where
there's a high degree of concern and a low

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:01.530
degree of trust, and it's difficult to carry
on your day-to-day business affairs, and you're

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:12.810
on the front page of the newspaper above the
fold, and they're talking about you either

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.190
in Congress or the state legislature, then
it's time to use negative words.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.650
And a great example of that would be the JetBlue
debacle of a few years ago when the airline

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:19.230
pretty well came to a standstill, stranded
many hundreds of thousands of customers. After

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:20.250
David Neeleman who was the president at the
time came out and said, "I'm ashamed. I'm

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.720
embarrassed. This never should have happened.
A lot of people were very, very inconvenienced

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.720
and we apologize for that."

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.720
But a lot of people are even afraid to apologize.
Again, why? Because it's the lawyer. If you

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.720
apologize, it's gonna put us on the hook.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.280
There was a story in Canada involving the
bad blood scare. Remember when the tainted

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.170
blood was out there? Red Cross around the
world was sourcing blood from San Francisco

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.220
prisons if you can believe it. And a lot of
people got hepatitis and the AIDS virus.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.250
And in Canada, they held a Royal Commission
to investigate why this was happening. And

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.600
the President of Red Cross was appearing before
the judge and the judge said to him, his name

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.260
was Douglas Lindores, the President. The judge
said to him, "Mr. Lindores, do you now apologize

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.940
to all those people who've been victimized
as a result of-of the inept actions of Red

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.940
Cross?"

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.940
And the President of Red Cross said, "Well,
Your Honor it's that easy, it's a."

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.940
And the judge said, "Well Mr. Lkindores I
think it is very easy. Yes or no do you apologize?"

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:50.550
"Ah, well Your Honor I'm gonna have to consult."
"Sir, yes or no do you apologize?"

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:51.910
And the headline the next day, "Red Cross
Refuses Apology."

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:52.910
Now oOf course he's the former CEO of Red
Cross.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:53.910
But we should know that very often an apology
goes an awful long way towards mitigating

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.430
damages in a bad news situation.

00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:05.580
I read about one company, The Covenant Transportation
Group here in the United States. Everyday

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.580
its trucks travel one million miles here in
the United States alone. They've got 25,000

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.840
trucks on the road and terrible things happen
now and again.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.170
And they have a policy, a new policy whenever
one of their trucks is involved in an accident

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:12.790
or even a fatality, the president of the company
and the lawyer will call up the family and

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.190
they'll say, "We’re sorry for what we caused.
We apologize. Is there anything we can do

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.190
to help you in the meantime?"

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:16.190
And of course the lawyer for the family is
saying, "Get off the phone. They're trying

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.190
to fool you. Get off the phone."

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.190
And the company says, "Look -- do what you
have to do. Please sue us; do whatever you

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:22.030
have to do. We understand that, but in the
meantime is there a mortgage payment, is there

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:23.070
a tuition payment, is there something we can
do to help."

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:26.390
And their insurance premiums have-have plummeted.
They're savin' an awful lot of dough.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:29.050
Same thing with the Michigan Health System.
They have a more forthcoming policy 'cause

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.450
it used to be docs and then would circle the
wagon and we would refuse to acknowledge your

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:32.450
problem. But now they-they've seen the merits
though of this way.

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.450
And by the way, in-in 35 states across the
United States there is the Apology Act; four

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.450
Canadian provinces have the Apology Act, as
well.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:39.630
What that allows a company to do is apologize
without it being used as an admission of liability

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:40.990
in court. And it's-it's a very, very popular
piece of legislation that hopefully will spread.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.990
Because when bad news happens on-on your watch,
you have to be amongst those who's most aggravated,

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.990
most upset, most discouraged, and most aggrieved.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.990
So my hope is that “Wwhen the Hheadline
Iis Yyou”, it will find several audiences.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.990
I hope it'll be of interest to folks who are
consumers of news, who are interested in how

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.990
news is-is gathered, reported, interpreted.

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.990
I'm hoping as well the book will be of interest
to public relations people, of and spokespeople.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.120
Journalists I hope will find interest in it
although it's many of the journalists, of

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.500
course, will-will look to these techniques
and will try to find them when their they’re

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.500
interviewing people.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.750
But you know the-the whole book talks about
taking an honest, ethical, and forthcoming

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.800
approach to-to dealing with the media so it-it-it
should be something that, well will in some

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.230
cases will stymie journalists, but they're
getting the truth nonetheless.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:03.230
And I'm hoping as well it will be of value
of to students of both public relations and

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:04.230
journalism as well.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.230
And overall, I hope that what the book will
do is take those of us who are right now passive

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.230
consumers of news; we watch TV, we're not
even thinkin'. We read the paper, we're not

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:07.230
even thinkin'. I'm hopin' that this book will
turn people from passive consumers of news

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:08.230
into sophisticated consumers of news.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:09.230
Folks, thank you so much for inviting me to
be here today. I'm very grateful.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.230
[applause]

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:11.230
[pause]

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:12.230
David?

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:13.230
&gt;&gt;commentatorDavid: Questions?

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Please.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:15.230
[pause]

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.230
&gt;&gt;male #1: First, thanks for much for joining
us, Jeff. My name is [Durand] and I was hoping

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.230
that maybe we could reconstruct, I believe
her name was Shirley Sherrod, the woman who

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:18.230
had given a speech about not wanting to have
lent dollars to a white family; Shirley herself

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:19.230
was an African American.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.230
Then she went on to say that she realized,
had a moment of mindfulness, and-and realized

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.230
that she was imparting some bias and-and did
grant the family the-the dollars they needed.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Right.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.230
&gt;&gt;male #1: And then the video was subsequently
heavily edited to in fact make her look like

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:24.230
a racist.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Yeah.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.230
&gt;&gt;male #1: You could say the same, the same
thing happened with ACORN recently, right

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.230
with the-the pimp coming in with his prostitute
and-and making it look like ACORN was helping

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.230
them when in fact ACORN was supplying or gathering
information to supply to the police.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.230
I'm wondering in this world of-of YouTube
and really heavy editing where in fact you

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:30.230
can make an apple look like an orange, what
advice do you have to CEO's or to those who

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:31.230
are in the, in the public media to make sure
that their true message is coming through?

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.230
Because once the damage is done, it's done,
right?

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Thank you, Durand.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.230
Well first of all, learn how to do it. Because
you get intelligent, articulate people who

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:35.230
think that because their they’re glib and
they present well that they know how to communicate

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:36.230
with media, and so they're the ones who often
put their foot in their mouths the deepest.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:37.230
In the, in the case of that woman it was a
matter of context. Now the reporters chose

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:38.230
to focus on that particular quote that said
she was gonna deny the loan and of course

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:39.230
they didn't feature the-the-the-the other
quotes as well.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:40.230
The-the secret is to make every sentence out
of your mouth exist as what I call, "a standalone

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.230
statement."

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.230
You see you can answer a question with four
sentences.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.230
The problem oftentimes is sentence number
one makes no sense until you hear sentence

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:44.230
number two, which by itself is incomplete
until you hear sentence number three, and

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.230
then the whole thing is tied together in sentence
number four.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.230
And then you open the paper tomorrow and you
only see yourself delivering sentence number

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:47.230
two and you say, of course, "Where's the rest
of what I said. They took me out of context."

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.230
You see when ya, as a spokesperson, when you
weave your sentences together you're building

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:49.230
a house of cards. 'Cause you never know which
one, two, three, or four quotes the journalist

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:50.230
is gonna use.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:51.230
So the idea, I believe, is to create standalone
statements that exist as silos. So that the

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.230
message I'm delivering now makes sense regardless
of whether you hear what I said before or

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.230
whether you hear what I say after. Each sentence
has to be able to make sense on its own.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.230
So Durand, that's probably the best way to
have some degree of influence over the way

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.230
stories are edited.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.230
[pause]

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:57.230
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hey, Jeff. Thanks for coming, once
again.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:58.230
Name's Patrick.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:59.230
I hope I'm not too presumptuous but I'm gonna
consider you an-an old school journalist.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:00.230
And --

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: I've been called worse.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.230
&gt;&gt;male #2: and going off that I'd really love
to get your opinion on kind of bouncing off

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:03.230
during thisDurand’s question with the rise
of your Glenn Beck's, your Rachel Maddow's,

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.230
these kind of journalists, but I would say
new school or kind of what you touched on

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:05.230
with YouTube and anyone can kinda be a journalist.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:06.230
Do you think that we're losing the credible
discourse that kind of was present in your

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.230
heyday and subsequently we're losing the-the
fourth estate kinda we're seeing the death

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.230
of the fourth estate in the 21st century?

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: I think, Patrick, to a certain
extent we are.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.230
Part of this dumbing down of news is turning
news into entertainment and the Glenn Beck's

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.230
of this world and others have seized the spotlight.
There is very little thoughtful public policy

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:12.230
discussion on the TV anyway. Maybe you'll
catch an hour or two on Sunday morning, but

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.230
even CNN isn't terribly deep these days.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:14.230
And the journalists themselves have turned
everything into a sporting contest. Like we

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:15.230
have an election happening here in the United
States tomorrow. Where's the thoughtful discussion

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:16.230
about the issues; : poverty, hunger, education?
It-it's like a sporting contest; . Tthere's

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.230
gonna be winners and losers; smart and stupid;
competent and incompetent. That's the way

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.230
the world interprets these days.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.230
And reporters also there's, I-I'm not saying
it was right, but there was a time when certain

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:20.230
matters were off limits. And again, I'm not
saying that they should have done this: President

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:21.230
Kennedy's sex life, for instance.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:22.230
And now look we know too much detail about
President Clinton and his own particular sex

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:23.230
life.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.230
So there's no boundaries anymore. And that's,
that I find very, very disturbing.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:25.230
And we don't see enough venues for thoughtful-thoughtful
journalism these days. Especially with all

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.230
the job cuts that are takin' place. People
are losin' their jobs left, right, and center

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.230
in newsrooms. And they're having to rely on
wire services and so on. and sSo everybody's

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:28.230
gettin' the same news. T; there's not a proliferation
of different opinion out there. And we the

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.230
people are suffering as a result.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.230
&gt;&gt;male #2Patrick: Well people say they're
getting the best news from the Ccomedy Cchannels,

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:31.230
which is sad but true actually.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Did you see President Obama
on Jon Stewart show last week? Unbelievable.

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:33.230
The President of the United States is on the
Ccomedy Cchannel doing an interview with Jon

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.230
Stewart.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.230
It's a, it's a hoot to watch. The President
was totally defensive, was totally without

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:36.230
humor, and the messages he delivered just
failed to resonate on that particular program.

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:37.230
Stewart to his credit knows he's a comedian.
So he was tryin' to make jokes, but the President

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:38.230
just wasn't connecting. And that's-that's
a problem he's having these days.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:39.230
But that's how desperate people are to get
their message out that they'll go to where

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:40.230
they think the people are listening. In that
case it's the cComedy Cchannel.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:41.230
&gt;&gt;male #3: So speaking of that, what did you
think of Eric, what did you think of Eric

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:42.230
Schmidt on Colbert?

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:43.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: I didn't see that. Forgive
me. Can you share?

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.230
[pause]

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:45.230
&gt;&gt;male #3: Well the greatest one was Colbert
gave him this-zing, this zinger line where

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.230
he said, "Well didn't you say that-that teenagers
around age 15 should be able to give up their

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.230
whole past and start fresh?" And Schmidt listened
looks at him and said, "That was a joke."

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:48.230
[pause]

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:49.230
But I, but I had another question.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:50.230
How do you deal with the kind of reporter
who basically has written the story first,

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.230
knows what your opinion is, has cast you in
a role, and then sort of whatever you say

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:52.230
is gonna be quote edited to reinforce that?

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:53.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: We can't control how the reporter
writes your story. What we can control are

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.230
the quotes that come out of our mouths. And
if, yes they do paint by numbers. T, they

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:55.230
paint by numbers because there's a lot of
demand on them and they gotta cover quite

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.230
a few stories, and so very often they leave
a slot open for the villain or the village

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.230
idiot. And they ask questions that are designed
to bring out the villain or the fact that

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:58.230
person is incompetent.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:59.230
If a, if a spokesperson recognizes that that's
the game that's being played and is taking

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.230
an honest, forthcoming approach, even though
they are being targeted as the villain or

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.230
the village idiot, they can represent themselves
appropriately without puttin' their foot deep

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:02.230
in their mouths; without putting their foot
in their mouths at all.

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:03.230
You see what's really important, I think,
is for every spokesperson who's mired in a

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.230
bad news situation always to start off by
askin' themselves, "What am I made of? What

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.230
are the words that I would use to describe
how I want my stakeholders to see me and perceive

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:06.230
me as I deal with this terrible situation?"

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.230
So let's say we're dealing with BP or Toyota.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:08.230
BP: "What are the words that describe how
we want our stakeholders to see us?" What

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:09.230
are the words folks?

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:10.230
[pause]

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.230
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Resilient.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Resilient?

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:13.230
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Strong.

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Strong.

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:15.230
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Responsible.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:16.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Well here's the thing: who's
the audience?

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.230
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [unintelligible]Compassion.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: I'm gonna say I'm gonna lean
towards compassion because here's the deal.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.230
At the height of the crisis, BP's audience
 – it’s gotis a different audiences 'cause

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:20.230
it's got its shareholders and investors, yes,
but it's got the general public as well. And

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:21.230
what's said in the general public wasis gonna
influence what happens to the share price

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.230
and whether people are gonna feel comfortable
investing in the company.

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:23.230
So I think at a time like this, words like
“compassion”, “trustworthy”, “accountable”

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:24.230
are words that are important. I think that
for the shareholders and those messages “strong”,

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:25.230
“resilient” are very important.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:26.230
But even then there has to be a degree of
acknowledgement of the terrible thing that's

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:27.230
taken place.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.230
And then the idea is to take every message
you deliver, every question you answer, every

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.230
policy you have responsibility for, and to
filter it through this prism. Because what

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.230
this does is it gives you a path, it gives
you a plan, it gives you a direction. And

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:31.230
at the end of the day, they're not gonna love
'ya. Spillin' Spilled all this oil, we ain't

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:32.230
gonna love 'ya, but if maybe the general public
hates the company just a little bit less,

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.230
then that's the victory.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:34.230
[pause]

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:35.230
Please.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:36.230
&gt;&gt;male #4: I have a question. I'd-I'd like
your reaction to this opinion that someone

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:37.230
I know who grew up under Communism has of
the, of the American journalism system who

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:38.230
said, "You know people in America in our opinion
are much more easily influenced by the media

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:39.230
because they grew up with trainingtrained
to believe that we have a free press. Under

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:40.230
Communism we all knew that it was all lies
[laughs]."

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.230
[pause]

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:42.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: I really do believe we have
a free press here.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:43.230
The problem is that it's what we're being
fed these days in the press.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:44.230
[pause]

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.230
That's why it's-it's good to have a variety
of sources for your news not to depend on

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:46.230
any one particular news outlet.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.230
[pause]

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:48.230
&gt;&gt;male #5: So is the best media strategy to
kind of bond to this existing paradigm of

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:49.230
winners and losers and to portray yourself
as this winner or as the subject of media

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:50.230
attention is-is the onus on you to call out
the confidence, to try to broaden the conversation

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:51.230
and to call it out? I guess I'm not articulating
this very --

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: No you are.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:53.230
&gt;&gt;male #5: Who's Whose responsibility is it
to question this paradigm? Obviously the person

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.230
answering a media inquiry is the person foremost,
self interest in, but is there a responsibility

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:55.230
to address the larger pocket?

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: It depends on the situation.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:57.230
If it's a situation that's societal and is
systemic perhaps there may be an opportunity

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:58.230
to broaden the context. But if it's a company
that's smack dab mired in the middle of a

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:59.230
problem that it owns, it just has to do its
very best to come out of it.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:00.230
But these are questions that we as-as consumers
of the news oughta be asking as well. 'Cause

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:01.230
reporters sure as heck don't have time to
ask themselves these questions; they're too

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:02.230
busy gettin' the story out for the, churning
out sausages for the next meal. But these

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:03.230
are important questions that spokespeople
have to ask and that we, those of us who consume

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.230
the news, have to ask as well.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:05.230
[pause]

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:06.230
&gt;&gt;male #6: Jeff, do you have any particular
insights on Google's image in the press these

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.230
days? We’ve have had a lot of conflict in
the press you could say; predatory seeming

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:08.230
stories.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:09.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: Well I heard of one story that
received some coverage involving a breach

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:10.230
of trust [ ]—David? -- that had taken place
and I didn't hear about from the media, I

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:11.230
heard it about through word of mouth. And
it didn't become big news to-to Google's benefit.

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:12.230
But when bad news happens, you have to be
the one who's most aggrieved, as I said earlier,

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.230
most outraged.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.230
Very often when a company tries to defend
itself in the court of public opinion, when

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.230
an ugly issue, something blatantly wrong takes
place, the story starts off on the front section

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.230
on page 12. And then as they continue not
to own it, it moves to page 8eight; still

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:17.230
not gonna own it, it moves to page 4four;
still refusing to own it, it moves to page

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:18.230
1one, top of the fold. And you know what happens
then? They own it.

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:19.230
[pause]

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:20.230
So perhaps this particular organization was
got off on a very, got off in a very easy

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:21.230
way in dealing with that particular situation
'cause I never heard about it in the media.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:22.230
T, but that's ultimately what a company wants.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.230
[pause]

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:24.230
Durand.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:25.230
&gt;&gt;Durand: Maybe a philosophical question,
but why does the bad always win? On that day

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:26.230
that you left broadcasting, I could imagine
that there were hundreds of other good things

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.230
that happened, but why do you think the bad
always-always takes the top story?

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:28.230
&gt;&gt;Jeff Ansell: I think it's for the same reason
that people slow their cars to look at accidents

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:29.230
on the highway on the other side; because
there's that curiosity.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:30.230
[pause]

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:31.230
In the case of the, of the newsroom though,
it's just an insensitivity.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:32.230
[pause]

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:33.230
Reporters are faced up every day with terrible
things in life and so some of them fight back

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.230
by becoming insensitive to it.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:35.230
I know that when I was a reporter, one of
the things they used to ask me to do was if

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:36.230
somebody experienced a death in the family
due to a murder or some terrible accident,

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:37.230
they used to ask me to go to the house to
get a picture of the deceased so we'd have

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.230
it for tomorrow's paper or tonight's news.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.230
And I used to do it and I used to feel terrible.
I was like 19, 20 years old. And then as I

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:40.230
got older I realized this is wrong. The last
person in the world that this family wants

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.230
to see right now is the media.me.

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:42.230
And it got to a point where I refused to go.
I said, "I'm not gonna goin'. I'm not doin'

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:43.230
it. No, I'm not coverin' the funeral. I'm
not gonna do it."

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:44.230
Because there is that insensitivity and what
is, what is news? News is drama; it's irony;

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:45.230
it's controversy; it's emotion; it's conflict
above all. News very rarely is good news.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.230
I mean unless that there's a breakthrough
with cancer medications and so on, but most

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.230
news isn't that good. And that's why people
buy the papers and that's why people tune

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.230
into the news.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.230
[pause]

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:50.230
&gt;&gt;commentatorDavid: If there are no other
questions now, let's wrap up.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:51.230
Thank you very much, Jeff.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:52.230
[applause]

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:53.230
[unintelligible]

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.231
Thanks.
