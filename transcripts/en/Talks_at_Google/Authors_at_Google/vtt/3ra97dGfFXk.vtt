ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Hey.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.920
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.180
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.900
My name is Artur
Oliveira, and I'm

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.865
very excited today
to host this talk

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.150
and to be able to introduce
Edan Lepucki to you.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.040
Edan is the author
of "California."

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.410
It's her debut
novel, and she has

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.020
been billed as a brilliant
new novelist who just came out

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.230
with this book.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.324
It takes place in California.

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:27.490
It's set in the near future.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.489
And it's essentially the
story of a couple who's

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.610
trying to start a family in
this kind of dystopian future.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:39.200
EDAN LEPUCKI: Thank you so much.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.866
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: So
Edan's going to start

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.120
with a quick, brief
reading from the book,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.830
and then we're going
to do some Q&amp;A. Thanks.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.170
EDAN LEPUCKI: Thank you.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.170
Thank you for having me.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.170
Thanks for coming, guys.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.340
I, like any person, have
dreamed of coming to Google

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490
to eat free lunch
for my whole life.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.350
And I got to do it, and it
was really fun and delicious.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.380
I suggest you try a sushi roll.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.020
So as Arthur said, "California"
takes place in the future.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.340
It's about a husband and
wife named Cal and Frida,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.800
and when the book opens, they've
been living for a couple years

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.450
out in the woods by themselves.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.820
And their nearest neighbors,
Sandy and Bo Miller,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.990
have died under
mysterious circumstances

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.880
before the book begins.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.130
In the first chapter, Frida
finds out that she's pregnant.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.000
In the passage
I'm going to read,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.450
she and Cal have recently had
an argument about whether or not

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.700
they should go find other people
beyond their small settlement,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.000
because at this point, the
only people that they ever see

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.460
were the Millers, Bo and
Sandy and their two children,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.220
but they're now dead.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.900
And they see a man named August
who comes once a month to trade

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.910
goods, and he
basically tells them

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.470
that they shouldn't go
beyond where they live.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.010
It's not safe.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.680
But Frida thinks there's more
than August is telling them,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.660
and she becomes
convinced that Cal

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.770
knows more than he's
telling her because he's

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.550
so concerned with staying put.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.380
She basically feels like,
I'm going to have a baby,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.740
we can't do this by ourselves.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.780
We need to find out
who else is out there.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.490
So in this section, Frida and
Cal have just had an argument.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.630
August is the trader that
they see once a month.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.130
He's on a horse-drawn buggy
with lots of goods to trade.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.200
I think the only other piece
of information you need to know

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.900
is that Frida's brother Micah.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.910
He was a suicide bomber in
LA and he blew himself up

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.450
at the Hollywood
and Highland Mall

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.380
in LA about five years
before the book starts,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.210
and his name is Micah.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.700
Has anyone ever been to the
Hollywood and Highland Mall

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.030
in LA?

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.670
Not a one.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.520
This is the first
audience I've ever

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.140
had that no one has ever been
to the Hollywood and Highland

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.639
Mall.

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:09.330
It's a horrible mall and
you should never go there.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.630
I mean, I consider myself
a connoisseur of malls.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.190
It's really bad.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.520
I'm so happy to be able to
warn you guys ahead of time.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.060
I've saved your life.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.980
So at this point,
this is in the morning

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.380
and Frida has left their house
to go do laundry at the creek

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.410
because at the end
of the world, you

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.745
don't have a washing machine.

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:33.220
So you have to do your
laundry at the creek.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.020
"Frida pulled the
pants out of the bag

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.760
again and shook them
so they hung straight.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.650
She walked over to
the big rock and lay

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.280
them flat across its surface.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.770
It wasn't time to go yet.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.710
She wasn't finished.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.770
Cal wanted Frida to be pregnant,
and Frida wanted that too

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.670
if she was honest with herself.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.790
It felt like a dare, the
biggest, most important risk

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.380
of all.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.500
Micah might think so.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.460
Before the group ruined him,
when his mind was still open,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.280
fluorescent as
plankton, he might

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.440
have written her a letter that
said, 'Go ahead, believe in it.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.060
Don't get all afraid on me.'
'I'm not afraid,' she said

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.620
aloud.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.540
The way her voice sounded
in the morning air

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.140
made her turn around.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.149
Was it some desire for a reply?

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.736
No one was there,
just the trees.

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:20.110
This didn't surprise
her, but she

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.370
did feel disappointed as
if she'd been stood up.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.070
But by whom?

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.140
The creek rushed
along, oblivious,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.400
and across the water,
the forest waited.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.550
She and Sandy used
to go foraging there,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.170
but they always stopped
before getting in too deep,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.270
before the land became alien.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.950
In a moment, she had the
mesh bag full of Cal's socks,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.070
and she was crossing the creek.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.240
The trees seemed to step aside
to let her into the darkness.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.880
'After you,' they whispered.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.040
She walked farther, in a
direction she'd never gone,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.500
but there was a path
here slightly overgrown

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.930
and she saw the track
marks of August's carriage.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.210
She knew he carried a scythe to
cut away brush as he traveled.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.660
It was as if he had
cleared the way for her.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.760
She draped a single sock
on the branch of a tree.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.570
The fabric was gray and thin,
and it had once belonged to Bo.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.230
Now it was a crumb that
would lead her back.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.130
Hilda"-- that's her mother--
"Hilda and Dada and Micah would

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.070
be a fairy tale to her baby,
but for Frida, this world here,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.390
the afterlife, was
the fairy tale.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.070
If she wasn't
careful, Frida would

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.560
be eaten by a witch at
the end of her journey.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.250
In a few moments,
August's tracks

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.800
led to a narrow trail, thick
redwoods on either side.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.390
Frida paused, hands
clenching the bag of socks.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.046
She sighed.

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:45.550
'I'm not afraid,' she said
again, as it to remind herself.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.562
She placed a red sock on
a branch and kept walking.

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:51.770
Every few minutes or so,
she left a piece of clothing

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.980
for herself to find
on her way back,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.440
and she would find her way back.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.800
The longer she walked, the
more her chest tightened.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.510
She'd felt like
this before, driving

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.940
lost in LA, her Navigator
and her Device dead.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.660
She'd pass through a
rough neighborhood,

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.180
hoping to find something
familiar so she could breathe

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.370
again, blink again,
though by the end,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.060
every neighborhood that
wasn't a Community was rough.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.930
She was alert in
that same way now.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.890
She had to pay attention, or
she might get turned around,

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.281
never find the
thread of the route.

00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:24.850
The clothing
wouldn't be any help

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.440
if she headed in
the wrong direction.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.150
She'd created a system.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.040
Colored clothes meant turn
right, black and white ones

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.630
meant turn left, and
gray, head straight.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.260
She kept her eyes on
landmarks-- the tiny stream,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.945
the vines choking a thick
trunk, a lone crocus.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.570
After she had walked
for about an hour,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.740
she saw something
white up ahead.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.660
She quickened her pace even
as she wanted to turn around.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.330
It was a bathtub with
claw feet like a beast's.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.080
The inside was
rusted out and filled

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.610
with brown rainwater, green
algae floating in its surface.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.930
Something jagged
snagged Frida's throat

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.010
and she swallowed it down.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.540
Here was evidence
of other people.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.150
A person had
abandoned this here.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.400
What was she doing?

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.830
She had to pee, and she only
had two pairs of socks left.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.270
If Cal came to find her at
the creek, maybe to talk,

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.270
he would worry, and then
later, he'd be so angry.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.960
She had to turn around before
she came upon other objects,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.990
before someone stepped in
her path with a weapon.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.790
But first, she
hiked up her dress

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.680
and squatted next to the tub.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.130
She pulled down her
leggings and peed.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.810
There was an atavistic
relief to this,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.180
and her eyes watered
from the pleasure.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.820
The end of the world couldn't
take this tiny joy away

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.900
from her.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.650
She was a dog marking
her territory.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.170
Frida was here.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.130
As she stood, pulling
up her leggings,

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.060
her dress falling
back to her ankles,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.230
a sound caught her attention,
something like a crunch,

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.020
like someone stepping
on fallen leaves.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.640
She froze, that jagged thing
rising in her throat once more.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.860
'Hello?' she whispered.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.340
No answer.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.500
Relax, she told herself.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.440
It's nothing.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.730
Couldn't be.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.290
But still, she thought she
felt a presence not far

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.800
from where she stood.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.580
Something, someone
was watching her,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.740
its breath shaping the
molecules between them.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.970
She was breathing
in that same air.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.200
She stepped away
from the bathtub.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.860
She would hurry back to the
creek and then return to Cal.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.220
Nothing had happened.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.570
She was safe.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.730
From behind a tree,
another crunch.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.659
The sound came from her
left and she turned.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:37.830
A coyote.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.841
It was standing
there watching her.

00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:41.590
It didn't look like
the starving ones that

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.880
used to skulk around LA,
desperate for a cat to eat,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.800
some garbage scraps.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.360
This one was well fed, big,
with coarse, brownish gray fur

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.670
that looked prickly
to the touch.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.320
If Frida didn't
know any better, she

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.770
might think she'd run into a
strange dog, tall and eerie

00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.730
eyed.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.770
It was so still.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.442
A bird cawed above them.

00:09:04.442 --> 00:09:06.440
Frida couldn't remember
what she was supposed

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.220
to do, yell at it to go away,
or step back quietly, or run

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.520
like mad.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.430
This animal wasn't huge
but it could hurt her.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.570
The coyote let out
a rasping sound,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.770
its eyes arrowed into her,
and Frida noticed an animal

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.430
at its haunches, something dead
and small, a rabbit, maybe.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.960
'I don't want it,'
Frida whispered.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.210
She already had a
hand on her stomach.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.640
Already, she needed to keep
her child away from this.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.320
She could feel the fear growing
on her like a skin, a mold.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.210
She could smell it.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.890
The coyote pawed at
its meat, rasped again.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.740
The dead thing had been
torn down the middle

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.540
and flattened like
roadkill, limp and bloodied.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.600
The coyote turned back to
her and Frida read its body,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.570
saw that it would pounce
if she didn't get away.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.770
Above them, the bird
cawed once more.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.970
Frida turned and ran.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.690
On her way out of the
forest, away, away, away, she

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.380
grabbed every piece of clothing
she saw, held them in her arms

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.240
as if they could protect her.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.780
'You look like a burglar,'
Cal said as she approached

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.850
the house with the wet bag
of laundry on her back.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.620
'Help me with these,' she said.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.560
She was still shaking.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.310
'Sure thing.' Cal grabbed
the coiled rope hanging from

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.460
the side of the house, stretched
it to the tree across the yard,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.910
and hooked it.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.410
He kept looking back
at her as he did so

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.170
as if trying to figure out what
was different about her, as

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.046
if she'd just returned
in the beauty parlor.

00:10:38.046 --> 00:10:40.420
'Are you all right,' he asked
when they were side by side

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.000
at the line.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.310
'No.'

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.280
'Please don't tell me you're
still pissed at me.' Frida

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.210
shook her head.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.020
'It's not that.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.690
Just now, after I
finished the clothes,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.680
I went into the forest.'

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.950
'You did what?'

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.390
'We need to find other people.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.270
They're nearby.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.750
I know it.' He didn't answer.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.920
She squeezed his hand hard.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.495
'Don't lie to me.'

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.830
'Why are you being so
careless,' he asked.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.190
'Why are you being so
duplicitous?' He smirked.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.540
'Good word.'

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.640
'I'm pregnant, Cal.'

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.020
'So now you're sure about that?'

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.610
'Would you rather I
be sick?' she asked.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.210
She let go of his
hand and pulled

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.500
one of Sandy's old dresses
from the laundry bag.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.350
It was wrinkled and cold.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.950
He pulled it away from her.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.900
'Let me,' he said.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.290
'Just tell me what
you know,' she said.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.320
Cal closed his eyes,
the dress in his hands.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.650
She could tell by the
way his face scrunched up

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.500
that she almost had him, that
he'd do exactly what she asked.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.710
He wanted to tell her.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.420
He almost dropped the
dress but she grabbed it.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.240
'I just washed
this,' she whispered.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.280
"Please don't get it dirty.'

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.160
'I should have told you as
soon as Bo told me,' Cal said.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.480
'What do you mean?' Frida
thought of the coyote

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.030
and the animal it had killed.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.980
'Let's go inside,' Cal said, and
put a hand on her lower back."

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.430
Thank you.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:09.797 --> 00:12:10.880
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: All right.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.671
Thank you for that.

00:12:11.671 --> 00:12:14.680
That was lovely.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.060
You stopped just
before the good part,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.690
right before the zombies attack.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.523
EDAN LEPUCKI: Right.

00:12:20.523 --> 00:12:23.790
The zombies just come
right around the corner.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.140
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: But
it's actually, I think,

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.320
when a lot of people
hear about this book,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.400
the term "post-apocalyptic" is
usually used in the newspapers

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.500
and in reviews and
things like that.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.400
And I think for us
nowadays, post-apocalyptic

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.130
is "The Walking Dead,"
it's "21 Days Later,"

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.720
it's things like that.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.742
And hopefully this
isn't a spoiler,

00:12:43.742 --> 00:12:45.200
but there's no
zombies in the book.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.575
EDAN LEPUCKI:
There's no zombies.

00:12:49.456 --> 00:12:51.084
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: What
was your impetus

00:12:51.084 --> 00:12:52.250
for the setting of the book?

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.750
How did you get there?

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.046
EDAN LEPUCKI: Well, to be fair,
when I thought of the book

00:12:58.046 --> 00:12:59.920
actually as a book that
I would want to read,

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.669
not necessarily a book
that I would write,

00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:04.600
I had thought of this phrase,
"post-apocalyptic domestic

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.570
drama."

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:10.200
So post-apocalyptic was always
in the equation of the project.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.450
But I knew I didn't want to
write something really extreme,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.750
one, because I didn't
really feel qualified

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.110
to write that kind of work.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.740
The speculative fiction I read
is more on the Margaret Atwood

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.000
side of the spectrum
than something

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.700
more straightforward
science fiction.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.320
So I felt like I couldn't
speculate into something

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.640
that was that different
from my current reality.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.260
And I was really interested
in the domestic drama portion

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.170
of that phrase, and I thought
it would be really neat.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.350
First of all, I was like,
I want to read this book.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.610
I was not going to write it.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.870
I was like, it would be so
neat to read a novel that's

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.490
about marriage but
have this other element

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.840
as this high stakes
backdrop, but really

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.610
focusing on this relationship.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.660
And to be honest, people
ask me all the time,

00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:00.420
so how did you decide to have
just a slow accrual of things

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.300
being bad versus one thing?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.190
And I'm always like,
I just did that.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.930
I didn't really think ahead of
why I was doing certain things.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.039
There's no intention behind
anything in the book.

00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:14.080
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: But for
me, that was just so new,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.690
and it was so different
from, I think,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.890
most of the really popular
media that's out there.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.990
And different in a
good way, I should say.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.230
EDAN LEPUCKI: Well, I wanted
to make it feel realistic.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.970
For me, I thought
the realism of it

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.710
would be what was
most scary about it,

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.910
because I think if
there's a singular event,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.850
whether-- if it's
way in the future,

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.430
you think, well, anyone I know
will be just dead by then,

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.540
so I don't have to worry.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.720
Or if it's a singular
event, there's

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.260
less agency in the creation
of that particular brand

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.520
of apocalypse.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:50.310
Whereas this is only 40 years
in the future, maybe 45, 43

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.414
or something, so we
could all be alive

00:14:53.414 --> 00:14:55.080
and our children will
be alive, and so I

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.280
think that's a lot scarier.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.785
I'm hoping that readers feel
more complicit because what

00:15:00.785 --> 00:15:04.225
Frida and Cal are going
through, a lot of it

00:15:04.225 --> 00:15:06.870
is because of things
that we have to deal

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.000
or are refusing to deal
with in the present.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.660
So there's been
climate change issues.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:16.120
The very, very rich have
moved away from public space

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.450
and they just pay for
their own services

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.360
and they live in their own--
they're called communities

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.400
and it's impossible to get into.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.150
There's a lot of those things
that we see in the present.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.790
I basically took everything
that I felt really nervous about

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.532
and put it into the book.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.650
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: That makes
the story very relevant.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.010
EDAN LEPUCKI: I hope.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.910
That's my goal.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.670
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Absolutely.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.020
So you mentioned the domestic
drama and you mentioned

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.070
their relationship,
and something

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.420
that stuck with me a lot
that Stephen Colbert said--

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.670
and we're going to get to him.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.610
I know that this
book is inexplicably

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.100
connected to Colbert.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.420
But when Colbert hosted
Hank Green, the author

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.079
of "Fault in Our Stars."

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:03.120
EDAN LEPUCKI: John Green.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.680
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: John Green.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.440
EDAN LEPUCKI: I was
like, who's Hank Green?

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:05.880
That's an unknown author.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.630
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: He
said that a young adult

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.400
novel is a novel that
people actually read.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.680
But I have to say that's not
how I felt about "California."

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.240
I didn't feel like
it was something

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.180
that you would use the term
young adult for because Cal

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.720
and Frida's relationship
was so real.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.260
Their marriage was
so real, and it

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.620
was at a level that's a
lot more mature than what

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.550
would be in a quote,
unquote, "young adult novel."

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:38.800
So my question for
you is, how were you

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.160
able to create that
relationship in the book,

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.844
and how were you able to
make it realistic and mature?

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:47.510
EDAN LEPUCKI: Well,
first I have to say,

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.590
young adult-- I've got
to talk about that first.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.820
Actually, a young adult
author, Cecil Castellucci,

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.290
she's my friend, and she says
that a young adult novel is

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.130
a novel that's
about young people

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.600
without the retrospective gaze.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.450
So they're not far enough
away from their teenage years

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.460
to process it as an
adult, and they're

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.460
sort of living through it.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.400
I kind of like that definition
because it doesn't catalog

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.160
the book based on
who's reading it.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.254
It's based on subject.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:22.390
I don't tend to read a lot
of young adult fiction,

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.170
but I know a lot of people who
do, adults and young adults.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.364
I do hope that my book
has a level of readability

00:17:29.364 --> 00:17:31.780
that it has in common with
some of the young adult novels.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.200
And I think one of the reasons
why people are gravitating

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.840
towards those books is that they
do have a strong sense of story

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.175
and narrative propulsion
that I think is pleasurable

00:17:41.175 --> 00:17:44.410
and people are returning to
that idea of storytelling

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.720
can be a pleasant experience.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.159
I read adult fiction.

00:17:50.159 --> 00:17:51.700
That's mostly what
I'm interested in.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.170
I was just joking with
my same friend, Cecil,

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.180
about how I had just recently
read "The Love Affairs

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.915
of Nathaniel P.," which is about
this single guy in Brooklyn,

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.430
and I was joking with her
that one of my favorite parts

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.500
was the descriptions of
him cleaning his apartment.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.350
And I was like, I really love
fiction where nothing happens.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.850
I don't know why,
but if it's really

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.715
invested in the characters,
then I can go with it.

00:18:14.715 --> 00:18:17.090
It's also better than actually
cleaning my own apartment,

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.590
probably.

00:18:21.284 --> 00:18:22.700
I don't know where
that came from,

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.480
but it made me think about how
I can read about someone dusting

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.950
their mantel-- that
sounds like I'm

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.372
talking about something else.

00:18:31.372 --> 00:18:32.725
That sounds like a euphemism.

00:18:32.725 --> 00:18:34.650
I can read about someone
mopping their floors

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.730
if it's written about
from a strong perspective

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.050
of that person living.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.330
So if we can get a real
understanding of what

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.770
it feels like to be
them in that moment,

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.520
you can get me interested
in basically anything.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.430
Anything can happen,
plot-wise, if I'm

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.790
interested in the characters
and their consciousness

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.110
and their perspective.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.360
So that's kind of where
I come from as a reader,

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.780
and also kind of how
I came to this book.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.680
So I had this post-apocalyptic,
mid-apocalyptic landscape,

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.221
I guess, but that
was new for me.

00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:07.720
And so what I was
really focusing on

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.510
were this married couple, Frida
and Cal, and just thinking

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:13.450
about who they were, and
where they came from,

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.350
and what made them
do what they did.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.682
And really, I was just
moving with intuition.

00:19:19.682 --> 00:19:21.890
I didn't really know where
the story was going to go.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.370
I had this character in
the very first scene.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.570
She didn't have a name yet.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.180
She had a turkey baster
which nobody knew about.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:35.010
And I just started
thinking, what

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.820
would have had to
happen to you in order

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:41.040
for you to take a turkey
baster from your hometown

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.507
and like hoard it in the
forest and not tell anyone,

00:19:43.507 --> 00:19:45.090
including your
husband, that you owned

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.464
it and it was very
special and it

00:19:46.464 --> 00:19:48.630
was a powerful object to you?

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:55.360
That was a really useful entry
into Frida and her humanity.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.720
And similarly with
Cal, I had him

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.646
longing for memories
of college and thinking

00:20:00.646 --> 00:20:02.020
about his single
mom who had died

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.740
in a snowstorm in
Cleveland, and using

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.000
that to push him to
think about who he was.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.790
Because I didn't have an outline
of where I was going to go,

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.940
I would just put the
characters in a scene.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.160
The novel switches
perspectives between them.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.590
And so if I was
in a Cal chapter,

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.230
I would just really
think about, what

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.540
does the room look like to Cal,
based on the fact that this

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.100
happened to his mother, and
he went to college here,

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.826
and his best friend
was a suicide bomber,

00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:29.200
and he's madly in love with
his wife who's kind of bratty

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.506
but he loves her anyway, all
of those things informing

00:20:33.506 --> 00:20:35.255
every single choice,
sentence to sentence.

00:20:35.255 --> 00:20:37.480
And just being with
them and treating them

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.710
like real people that existed
before the book starts and will

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.785
continue to exist
after the book ends.

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.910
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: You mentioned
that the book changes

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.771
perspective from
chapter to chapter,

00:20:48.771 --> 00:20:50.895
so one of the questions I
had when I was reading it

00:20:50.895 --> 00:20:54.304
is, who is the main
character to you?

00:20:54.304 --> 00:20:55.970
EDAN LEPUCKI: This
is really interesting

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.075
because people will be
like, obviously, Frida

00:20:58.075 --> 00:21:00.000
is the main character, or
somebody else will be like,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.541
Cal's the main
character of the book,

00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:04.760
and to me, they share the story.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.770
In some ways, I
think sometimes it's

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.710
Frida's story because
it starts with her

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.390
and she gets one more
chapter than he does.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.610
So maybe she gets a
little bit more page time,

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.210
but it really is
their-- it's the story

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.037
of their relationship.

00:21:19.037 --> 00:21:21.620
It's the story of where they are
at the beginning of the novel

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.904
and where they end up, sort of
the arc of their relationship.

00:21:25.904 --> 00:21:27.570
They're together at
the end of the book,

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.520
but they're different.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.592
And I'm interested in
what has happened to them

00:21:30.592 --> 00:21:32.550
and how they have been
changed by the six weeks

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.970
that the book covers.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.240
Do you think one of them
is more than the other?

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.054
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: No, I
didn't, which I only

00:21:39.054 --> 00:21:40.720
realized about halfway
through the book.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.690
Because you start
with Frida, I thought

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.314
well, she's the main character,
and then at some point in time,

00:21:45.314 --> 00:21:47.660
something just clicked with me.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.334
And maybe it speaks
to the marriage,

00:21:50.334 --> 00:21:52.750
that it is a lot of give and
take between the two of them.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.280
Even you as a reader
reading it, you can kind of

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.755
see that going back and forth.

00:21:56.755 --> 00:21:58.130
EDAN LEPUCKI:
Also, it was really

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.610
fun to write a book where I
got one person's perspective

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.110
and they knew information that
the other one didn't and they

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.490
had two different
interpretations

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.000
of particular moments.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.742
That was really fun
as a writer to do.

00:22:08.742 --> 00:22:10.200
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
They're never quite

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.783
sure what the other
one knows and what

00:22:11.783 --> 00:22:13.060
they're not telling them.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.226
EDAN LEPUCKI: It's so funny.

00:22:14.226 --> 00:22:15.550
I am the worst secret keeper.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.070
I just cannot keep secrets.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.000
And this book, it's all secrets.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.870
Just one secret
feeds off the other,

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.830
and I get asked
about it quite a bit.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.970
What's up with the secrets?

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.850
But I've been thinking,
when you have a secret,

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.300
it's your own
private possession.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.301
It's your own territory.

00:22:32.301 --> 00:22:34.508
And this is a world where,
at the beginning at least,

00:22:34.508 --> 00:22:35.330
it's just them two.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.510
It's like the Frida and
Cal show all the time.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.030
They really have
no private space,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:43.050
except everything about their
lives is intensely isolating.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:48.300
So I've thought about
the way that secrets, it

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.914
provides a space between them
in a hyper intimate environment.

00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:55.580
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: It
is a work of fiction,

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.090
so I don't want to
go into any spoilers.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.995
If any of you have
read the book and you

00:22:59.995 --> 00:23:03.570
would like to ask Edan
some questions afterwards,

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.860
you can certainly do that.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.510
EDAN LEPUCKI: There's
some plot twists.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.430
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: A couple.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.130
What I mentioned earlier, too,
is in addition to the book,

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.350
and in addition to
what I really believe

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.690
is a very unique
and very different

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.740
story with a unique
setting, the way

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.312
that the book burst onto
the scene was also pretty--

00:23:24.312 --> 00:23:25.145
EDAN LEPUCKI: Crazy.

00:23:25.145 --> 00:23:27.186
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Pretty
creative and pretty crazy.

00:23:27.186 --> 00:23:30.000
So do you want to
tell the story,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.260
just because I'd love to
hear how you would tell it.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:32.570
EDAN LEPUCKI: Sure.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.114
I mean, I feel like
you all could just

00:23:33.114 --> 00:23:34.370
go home and Google it.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.590
I just wanted to use
"Google" in a sentence.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.110
So my book is published
by Little Brown, which

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.100
is an imprint of Hachette,
and Hachette is still

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.660
in disputes with Amazon,
which is an online retailer,

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.085
if you're not aware of them.

00:23:50.085 --> 00:23:51.460
I really want to
meet someone who

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.970
doesn't know what Amazon is.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.480
I'm just waiting
for someone to be

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.890
like-- I mean, I have had
people at readings be like,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.150
oh, I didn't know about Colbert,
and I love that part when

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.420
that happens, but anyway.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.460
Has anyone not heard of Amazon?

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.070
Show of hands.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.430
So Amazon and Hachette are
in this dispute over contract

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.574
negotiations, and
as part of-- I don't

00:24:16.574 --> 00:24:18.740
want to use the word
"retaliation" because it sounds

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.730
a little bit overboard,
but Amazon removed

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.176
the Pre-order buttons from
any books being published

00:24:24.176 --> 00:24:25.550
by Hachette that
weren't out yet.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.890
And I didn't really know
this, but pre-orders

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.310
are a pretty big part
of a book's life.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.710
You can kind of get a sense
of how well a book will

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:37.020
do by how high the pre-orders
are beforehand and that kind

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.680
of stuff.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.990
So Colbert, he has a show called
"The Colbert Report" on Comedy

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.690
Central, and he's a
Hachette author as well.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.440
He has books published
with Grand Central,

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.806
so he wanted to talk
about-- and also, even books

00:24:49.806 --> 00:24:51.180
that weren't on
pre-order, Amazon

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.780
was delaying shipment for them.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.429
So it would say, it will be
available in three weeks, which

00:24:56.429 --> 00:24:58.220
is so different from
most things on Amazon,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.810
which we can get in
like two seconds.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.344
So he wanted to talk about
the dispute on his show, which

00:25:03.344 --> 00:25:05.510
I was really thankful for
because I felt like it was

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.350
a book industry topic forever
that nobody outside the book

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.560
industry talked about.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.820
And so I was glad that he wanted
to just bring the conversation

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.450
to the general public, because
I had friends who were asking me

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.470
about, how come I can't
pre-order your book,

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.130
and they had no idea that this
whole dispute was happening.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:23.480
The book industry was in
a whole tizzy about it

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.710
and it didn't like
anybody else cared.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.780
So Colbert was going
to talk about it,

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.660
and he brought in
Sherman Alexie,

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.980
who is really well known.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.230
He's a Native American author.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:36.230
He wrote "Absolutely True
Story of a Part-Time Indian."

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.020
That's one of his most
recent popular novels,

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.670
but he's a lovely guy.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.336
I didn't know him beforehand.

00:25:42.336 --> 00:25:43.484
He's very telegenic.

00:25:43.484 --> 00:25:45.150
I think that's one
reason why he keeps--

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.710
he's really funny
and on the fly.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.510
So he went on
Colbert to sort of be

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:53.060
the-- they could converse
about the dispute.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.450
And Alexie decided he wanted
to talk about a debut novelist

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:59.440
because he felt like
it's really hard to be

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.740
a debut novelist in this world.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.800
They sent him a bunch of
books and he picked mine.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.330
I don't know.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.390
I was not involved.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:13.099
And then Alexie went on
and talked about my book.

00:26:13.099 --> 00:26:14.890
I knew the day before
that it might happen.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.730
I knew day of that
was going to happen.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.990
But even after it
happened, I didn't

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.620
realize that it was going
to be this big thing.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.145
Because once my
book was announced,

00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:26.450
then Colbert had
everyone who was

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.910
going to show it
to Amazon order it

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.490
from Powell's, the independent
bookstore in Portland,

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.910
and he made it
like this campaign.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.820
He started tweeting
about it all the time,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.540
and then he mentioned
it a second time,

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.500
and then pre-orders were
just going up and up.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.960
Then we were up to
9,500 or something,

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.730
and I went to Powell's.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.520
I signed all of them.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.264
And then my book
debuted at number three

00:26:48.264 --> 00:26:49.680
on the "New York
Times" bestseller

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.510
list, which is
impossible to happen.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.990
It never happens to
a first-time novelist

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.070
or any kind of novelist.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.010
I don't expect this to ever
happen to me ever again.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:05.717
And then I went on
Colbert to say hurrah

00:27:05.717 --> 00:27:07.550
because it was really
was kind of miraculous

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.830
to have a literary novel,
post-apocalyptic but still

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.765
literary, from someone with a
totally weird name that nobody

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:16.190
had ever heard of.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.710
I feel very grateful,
obviously, but also pleased as

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.300
punch that I am part of
this strange footnote

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.490
in literary history.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.000
I think Amazon is obviously part
of a larger, long conversation

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.695
about publishing
and how books work

00:27:30.695 --> 00:27:33.070
and all that kind of stuff,
and that when somebody writes

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.720
a history, there
will be a paragraph--

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.080
maybe I'll get a sentence--
about this thing that happened.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.460
And I hope down below,
after "ibid, ibid, ibid,"

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.150
there'll be a little
line about me.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.240
I feel like that's pretty cool.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.690
So that's what happened.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.410
It just has a crazy story.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.910
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: You can just
add that yourself on Wikipedia.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:51.660
Just write yourself into the--

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.130
EDAN LEPUCKI:
Actually, Wikipedia

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.900
says that I was
born in Poland based

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.480
on a joke I made on something.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.060
If anyone here knows
how to fix Wikipedia--

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.770
I know you have to join.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.449
I know people can do it.

00:28:01.449 --> 00:28:02.990
I know anyone can
do it, but then you

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.520
have to sign on and join.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.580
It's like in "The Office"
where Steve Carell

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:14.480
is like, we can bring
YouTube down to film it.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.930
That's sort of where I'm at.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.080
But they think I'm from Poland.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.965
I'm from LA.

00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:22.090
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: So you got
the Colbert bump, right?

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.341
EDAN LEPUCKI: I got the
Colbert mountain, basically.

00:28:25.341 --> 00:28:27.340
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Signed
10,000 books in two days?

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.131
EDAN LEPUCKI: Yeah.

00:28:28.131 --> 00:28:29.594
I'm really good
at signing books.

00:28:29.594 --> 00:28:31.260
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: We've
got another couple

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.600
thousand here for you to sign.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.290
EDAN LEPUCKI: Maybe
6,000, I think.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:43.130
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: So the dispute
between Amazon and Halette,

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.170
it's over actual
printed books mainly.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.600
It's probably ebooks too, right?

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:54.030
EDAN LEPUCKI: Amazon is
famous for its secrecy levels,

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.097
really crazy levels of secrecy.

00:28:57.097 --> 00:28:58.930
So there's not much
about the dispute that's

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:03.360
been known to the
public, but there's

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.700
one part that we do know that
is about the price of ebooks.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:12.910
Amazon wants ebooks to be lower
because the pie of profits,

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:17.875
Hachette is making more
than Amazon would like.

00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:19.250
I don't think
Hachette is totally

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.460
blameless in the situation.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.270
I think if royalty
prices for ebooks

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.459
had been higher all
along for authors,

00:29:25.459 --> 00:29:27.000
probably this wouldn't
have happened,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.097
but when ebooks came
into the scene, somehow

00:29:30.097 --> 00:29:31.680
the royalty share
for authors is lower

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.410
for ebooks than print books.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:34.910
I know.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.160
And I was like, I'm so
happy to have a book.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.420
and I'll sign wherever.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.320
Whatever you want,
I'll just do it.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.890
But that's common practice is to
have lower royalties for that.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.470
Amazon's argument is that
if an ebook is cheaper--

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:52.880
their argument is a little
bit questionable to me.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.550
They're like, if
a consumer has $20

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:02.140
and if they buy an
ebook for $5, then

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.790
they'll spend their second
$5 on another ebook.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.000
And I'm kind of like,
after you buy your ebook,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.625
then you're going to
go buy your latte.

00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:11.570
You're not necessarily
going to buy a book.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:15.147
And I do also feel
like a book is not

00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:16.980
just the actual physical
thing that you buy.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.760
So when you buy a
hardcover, obviously, it

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.650
costs more because you're
paying for the hard cover,

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.807
but you're also paying
for me to write the book.

00:30:24.807 --> 00:30:26.640
It took four years for
me to write the book.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.410
You're paying my editor,
who did edits for a year.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:34.229
You're paying the cover
designer and my publicist.

00:30:34.229 --> 00:30:35.770
So many people go
into making a book,

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.020
so I think sometimes the
argument that an ebook should

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.640
be cheaper because it's
electronic is not always true.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.150
I'm not saying that it
shouldn't necessarily be cheaper

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.490
in some cases, but
of course, I can

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.140
see Hachette's side
of the situation.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.652
I also worked in
bookstores for a long time.

00:30:52.652 --> 00:30:54.985
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: And what do
you see as your perspective,

00:30:54.985 --> 00:30:56.600
then, especially
with the ebooks?

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.170
Because Google has
the Google Play Store.

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:03.110
You can buy ebooks through
the Google Play Store.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.850
So what do you see
your perspective?

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.270
What should be the role of
technology companies like Apple

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:12.580
and Google and Amazon and
Microsoft in this space?

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.140
Because they do
provide a great value

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.990
to consumers and to authors,
but at the same time,

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:23.010
it's also a whole other layer.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.310
EDAN LEPUCKI: I think it's
a really difficult question

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:29.240
because I recognize--
I personally, I

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.920
have read on my iPad, but I
don't prefer to read that way.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.180
I like to read in the bath.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.540
I like to eat and just get
grease all over whatever

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.430
I'm reading.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.729
But I'm a minority book buyer.

00:31:43.729 --> 00:31:45.770
I buy from an independent
bookstore at full price

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:46.620
and I don't care.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.880
It doesn't bother me.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.520
And I never really
shopped at Amazon,

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.090
but I recognize that I'm
different from another kind

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.880
of book buyer.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.800
And I don't really
care how people read.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.075
It's not like I'm like, oh,
I love the smell of books.

00:31:58.075 --> 00:31:59.430
I don't like that.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.250
If you want to read on
your Kindle, that's fine.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.710
And I do think that these
companies are offering

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:08.100
great services to
readers, and I think

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.820
there's some things happening
in technology that are changing

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.310
how we consume media in
really interesting ways.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.919
Everyone's always
years ahead of me.

00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:18.460
I'm like, oh my god, and people
have been doing it for years.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.800
But I do have a question
about, at what point

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:30.620
do we say that the cost of
content has gotten too low?

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.105
I feel bad for anyone who's
trying to make music nowadays.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.930
I have a friend who's in a
band and she doesn't really

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.720
make any money at it.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.020
She can tour, but her whole
band will make $600 for that one

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.520
evening, and there's
eight of them,

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.290
and then the DJ will come in
and he gets $3,000 for the night

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.670
and he's one guy.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.520
I hear that kind of story from
a lot of different people.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.740
And thinking about it from
a perspective of an artist,

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.180
if I'm going to spend
years and years on a book,

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.095
obviously I shouldn't get paid
for something that doesn't sell

00:33:04.095 --> 00:33:06.180
or people don't
necessarily want to read.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.890
But if people are paying
only $0.99 for it,

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.107
it just doesn't seem
like a tenable model.

00:33:12.107 --> 00:33:14.440
So I don't know what the
answer is, but it is definitely

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.280
something that I feel
is troubling to me

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.683
and I don't know how to fix it.

00:33:20.683 --> 00:33:21.370
I don't know.

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:22.472
Just blabbing now.

00:33:22.472 --> 00:33:24.055
I'm sure everyone
here in the audience

00:33:24.055 --> 00:33:26.354
has better ideas than I.

00:33:26.354 --> 00:33:27.770
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
But it's certainly

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.936
an interesting question
because it's not just books.

00:33:29.936 --> 00:33:34.010
Like you said, it's music, it's
movies, it's apps, it's games.

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.210
It's everything
that's happening, too.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.310
But also with that
digital space,

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.700
there's also a whole
other side of it,

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.380
which I haven't
heard talked about

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.270
too much in the
context of your book,

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:52.834
but there's also piracy, right?

00:33:52.834 --> 00:33:55.000
You as an author, is that
something you worry about?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.291
Is that something you think of?

00:33:56.291 --> 00:33:58.164
Do you have a perspective on it?

00:33:58.164 --> 00:33:59.080
EDAN LEPUCKI: I don't.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:03.670
I haven't personally-- maybe I'm
good enough to be pirated now,

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.010
but before that, I wasn't.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.449
I'm friends with Emily
Gould who does Emily Books,

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:17.130
and she's in subscription-based
book business.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:21.300
You pay a certain amount a
month and you get a free ebook,

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.780
and it's non-DRM technology.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.510
And she's tried to get deals
with publishing houses,

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.480
and I might be getting
this story wrong.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.460
This is how I understand it.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.177
But trying to get
publishers, let's

00:34:35.177 --> 00:34:37.510
make "California" our next
Emily-- this hasn't happened,

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.560
but let's make this Emily
Books the next pick.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.340
The publisher will say, no,
because of the DRM technology

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:48.100
of being able to pass the
book onto next people.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.139
I tend to know quite
a few people who

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:54.820
work in the creative arts who
are against technology which

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.720
limits it to a single device.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.610
Now I feel like I'm so
stupid because-- I'm

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:06.410
like a cave woman coming
into this shiny spaceship.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.840
Because they feel like it's
actually more limiting than it

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.996
is protecting the artist.

00:35:10.996 --> 00:35:12.620
So I feel like I know
enough people who

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:17.770
are in support of the freedom of
spreading technology in the way

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.320
that you would spread a mix
tape or something that I don't

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.917
really know where I
fall on the continuum.

00:35:23.917 --> 00:35:26.500
Although I will say that it does
feel like everyone just wants

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.940
everything super
cheap or just free,

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.050
like I got my wedding
dress for $0.10.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.240
I got these shoes for $1.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.890
And you're like, do you know
the effects on the environment

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.770
that happened to make
you wear those shoes,

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:43.300
or what small child
had to make those?

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.010
I just feel like the
desire for things

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.260
to be cheaper and cheaper
makes me really uncomfortable.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.039
But at the same time, is
it an inexorable movement

00:35:52.039 --> 00:35:52.580
towards that?

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.310
I don't know.

00:35:56.624 --> 00:35:58.790
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: It's certainly
a difficult question.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:59.060
EDAN LEPUCKI: I can't
believe this video is

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.774
going to be on the
internet forever.

00:36:00.774 --> 00:36:02.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:04.532 --> 00:36:06.490
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: I'll ask
you one last question.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.305
EDAN LEPUCKI: Can
you ask me something

00:36:07.305 --> 00:36:08.971
about, like, point
of view or something?

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:15.469
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: So wrapping
up with my questions,

00:36:15.469 --> 00:36:18.010
because I would love to get some
questions from the audience,

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:19.468
too, if we can go
back to the book,

00:36:19.468 --> 00:36:22.100
then, for one last question.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.770
EDAN LEPUCKI: Stay in
your box, little girl.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.300
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: I kind of
asked you this before the talk,

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.670
but how much of
yourself is in Frida

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:36.370
and Cal and their relationship,
because-- correct me

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.360
if I'm wrong, but I hope I'm
not wrong-- I got the impression

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.810
that the characters
and their relationship

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:46.720
were just so real that it had
to come from somebody who kind

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.480
of knew what they
were talking about.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.690
EDAN LEPUCKI: Well, in a
sense, every character is me

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.900
because they all
sprung from my mind,

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.389
but it's not me and my husband.

00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:01.430
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: That's
not what I was getting at.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:02.471
EDAN LEPUCKI: No, I know.

00:37:02.471 --> 00:37:05.430
People have asked me that.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.200
I've gone camping
twice in my life,

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.644
and not since the early
'90s, and I'll never go back.

00:37:10.644 --> 00:37:12.560
In this book, they live
out in the wilderness,

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.380
so I had to actually use
the powers of pretend quite

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.340
strongly and do a
little bit of research

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.640
to get them to live
out in the sticks.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.420
I wanted to write a book about
marriage because I'm married

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.870
and I felt like a
lot of the books

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.411
I read about marriage are about
the dissolution of a marriage

00:37:29.411 --> 00:37:32.790
through adultery, not that
that's not interesting to read,

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.190
but I'm kind of sick of that.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:39.410
And I found Coach
and Tammy Taylor

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:42.850
from "Friday Night Lights," they
have a marriage on that TV show

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.617
that's really a very strong
and loving and dynamic and

00:37:46.617 --> 00:37:47.450
believable marriage.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.160
So that was another inspiration.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.270
And I am happily
married, and I wanted

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.860
to write a book about two
people who actually were really

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.060
in love and connected.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.970
The actual couple in
the book, I actually

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.310
don't know if they
are happily married.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:04.040
By the time I got
to the end, I'm not

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.627
so sure about their
connection or what they had,

00:38:06.627 --> 00:38:08.710
but that was kind of an
interesting process for me

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.840
to go through.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.770
I mean, sure, there's
stuff from me in the book

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.860
and from people I
know, but they're not

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.930
based one to one in reality.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.960
I just make up people.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.000
You might see yourself
in my fiction someday.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.440
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Oh, wow.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.545
EDAN LEPUCKI: If
you're not careful.

00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:30.420
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: A villain
in a book, perhaps?

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.211
EDAN LEPUCKI: Yeah.

00:38:31.211 --> 00:38:32.778
I could do that for you.

00:38:32.778 --> 00:38:33.835
Yeah, sure.

00:38:33.835 --> 00:38:34.710
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Cool.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.460
Well, great.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.240
So thank you so much.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.205
Now I would love to
hear from you guys.

00:38:40.205 --> 00:38:42.080
If you could please
speak into the microphone

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.200
so the folks on the live
stream and on the recording

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.740
can hear you.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.495
AUDIENCE: You said the book
took you four years to write.

00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:52.529
So how much of that
was first draft

00:38:52.529 --> 00:38:54.070
versus revisions
and stuff like that?

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.565
I like to write.

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:56.356
I'm curious about every
author's full story

00:38:56.356 --> 00:38:59.090
because it's just
interesting to me.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.350
I just wanted to know more
about that process for you.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:02.600
EDAN LEPUCKI: Well, let's see.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:07.440
I started it in
September of 2009

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:12.420
and I sold it in
September of 2012.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.270
So when I say four
years, I'm counting

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:18.320
the one year of the revisions.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.870
The first year that
I was writing it,

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.950
though, I also stopped to revise
another book that never sold

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:26.450
and I wrote a novella, which
was more like a long story.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:32.120
So there were couple month spans
that I would take time off.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.970
It probably took me the
majority of the time

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:35.560
to finish the first
draft because I'm

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.500
a pretty careful writer in
that my first drafts aren't

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.600
these mad, messy spiels.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.060
I write a chapter.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.740
I look at it.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.640
I figure out what
I want to do next,

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.890
then I write the next chapter.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.840
I'll often go back
and rewrite as I go.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.150
So I think probably
two and a half years

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.760
to write the first draft and
then another half of the year

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.720
doing revisions.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.380
The book as it was
sold was probably

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.320
the third or the fourth
draft, and then I

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.290
did two more drafts
with the editor.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.839
AUDIENCE: How much did it
change from start to end?

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:08.880
EDAN LEPUCKI: It's funny.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.400
The version that is
published feels to me

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.681
like the version
it was fated to be.

00:40:13.681 --> 00:40:15.930
And in some ways, it's very
different from the version

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:18.305
that I sold, and in some ways,
it's not different at all.

00:40:18.305 --> 00:40:20.150
Actually, my brother
read the draft right

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:22.800
before it sold to help me
with botany information

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.777
because he's sort of
an amateur botanist,

00:40:24.777 --> 00:40:26.610
and then he read the
book after it came out.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.770
And he said to me, it
actually feels the same

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.085
except for things felt
different and I wasn't sure how.

00:40:31.085 --> 00:40:33.120
And he said the ending
felt a lot different.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.390
I probably cut 70
pages of flashbacks

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.979
from the first part,
which at first I was like,

00:40:41.979 --> 00:40:44.020
I can't cut these, and
then as soon as I started,

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.110
it felt so liberating
to just cut the fat.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:50.150
And then the last
100 pages, it always

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.750
ended up where it ended up.

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.290
It was almost like
Tetris, where there

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.992
would be some scenes
removed or different

00:40:58.992 --> 00:41:00.950
things would happen in
a particular scene which

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:03.220
would affect the next scene.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.130
But because the
characters were the same,

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.579
it actually didn't
feel like huge changes.

00:41:07.579 --> 00:41:09.120
I don't know how
else to describe it.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.820
Because Cal and
Frida and the people

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.610
surrounding them were
the same, so the plot

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:17.529
was almost superfluous
in some strange way.

00:41:17.529 --> 00:41:19.070
AUDIENCE: I haven't
read the book yet

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:23.390
so I don't know all of the
apocalypses that are in here,

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:25.960
but you mentioned that they're
based on your anxieties,

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.529
and I'm just curious.

00:41:28.529 --> 00:41:30.320
I probably have some
of the same anxieties,

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.920
so after writing
this book, how has

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.410
that changed your appraisal
of our current world

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.660
and its prospects?

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:39.610
EDAN LEPUCKI: You know,
it was in some ways

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.890
cathartic to write it.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:44.762
Some readers have told me
it's a really scary book,

00:41:44.762 --> 00:41:46.720
but when I was writing
it I didn't feel scared.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.740
I almost felt
thrilled and powerful.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.140
I always joke, I ruin
IKEA in half a sentence.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:58.680
I'm like, see you later, IKEA,
and it feels really good.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.580
But I'm still nervous
about a lot of the things.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.510
And actually, sometimes I listen
to the news and I'm just like,

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.190
my book is like
unicorns and rainbows

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:09.915
compared to what's
happening at present.

00:42:09.915 --> 00:42:11.540
I remember I was
listening to something

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.690
about-- there were
two occasions.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.570
One time, I was listening
about the kids who

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.690
are coming from Honduras
across the border,

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.260
and some of the things
that their parents do

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.760
for them, like putting IUDs
in very, very young girls

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.910
before they send them
off to cross to get away

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:31.120
from horrible, horrible,
unspeakable acts of violence,

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.127
and thinking about how that
was so much harsher than any

00:42:34.127 --> 00:42:35.710
of the things that
I'd put in my book.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.210
And then I was listening
to something about Syria,

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.030
and I was just like, Jesus,
these things happen now

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.010
across the world, and
my book isn't really

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:48.940
that scary at all compared to
what's presently occurring.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.650
I'd heard after
the climate summit

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.230
some of the decisions
that they had made,

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.910
it gave me a little bit more
hope than I had had previously.

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.493
I don't know if that
was just me being

00:42:58.493 --> 00:43:00.700
a Pollyanna in the
moment, but I felt like,

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.190
OK, maybe we can get
things together, maybe.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:07.780
But I'm still pretty nervous.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.650
I think everybody probably
swings wildly between,

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.130
humankind is totally screwed
and we make all these choices

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:20.232
and we're just raping the earth
until there's nothing left.

00:43:20.232 --> 00:43:22.440
And then you swing to the
other side and you're like,

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.130
as a species, we're
so innovative,

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:27.410
and we're so kind on
an interpersonal level.

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:30.350
I come into contact with
people who are really generous

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:33.300
every day, so how could
that exist along with that?

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.240
So I think we all go between
those two-- I mean, somewhere

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.587
in the middle, of
course, as well.

00:43:39.587 --> 00:43:41.920
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: As someone
interested in an MFA program,

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.503
I was interested
about your experience

00:43:43.503 --> 00:43:45.260
at the University
of Iowa, and what

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.280
were your major takeaways
from your time there?

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.630
EDAN LEPUCKI: I went to
Iowa in 2004 to 2006.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.820
I had a great time.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.020
Iowa is a really
big program, so I

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.550
feel like I had a different
experience than other MFA

00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.820
graduates.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:04.030
Iowa has about 50 students
total, 25 fiction, 25 poetry,

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.640
and other programs
have six total,

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.090
so it's a very
different environment.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.440
I will say that I'm
not a person who

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.650
thinks you have to get an
MFA or that MFAs are stupid.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.660
It seems like there's
only two options now.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.350
I kind of think an MFA can
work for a lot of writers.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:28.836
It worked for me in terms of it
was a good time for me to go.

00:44:28.836 --> 00:44:30.460
I was working full
time at a bookstore.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.260
I was writing when I could,
but I couldn't really

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.280
carve out the space.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.850
And then I was given two years
to read and write and meet

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:39.470
other writers, which is just
a really wonderful gift.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.840
I run a private
writing school in LA,

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.140
and so a lot of the
students either have MFAs

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:48.610
or are applying to MFAs
or they're not getting in.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.382
They run the gamut in terms
of MFA desire or experience.

00:44:51.382 --> 00:44:53.840
And a lot of them end up writing
books and publishing books

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.330
without MFAs, and
so I don't think

00:44:55.330 --> 00:45:00.000
that's a requirement to
leading the life of a writer.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.280
I don't think anyone should
go unless they get aid.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.970
It's not a lucrative
field, or isn't necessarily

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.050
a lucrative field, and
it seems like a bad idea

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:11.140
to go into debt to do it.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.270
So if you go and you
end up hating it,

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:15.180
if you didn't pay for
it, then that's OK.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:20.380
And I feel like if you know
you're spending $30,000 a year,

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.056
will that infect
your writing process

00:45:22.056 --> 00:45:23.680
or make you feel like
you have to write

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.107
a certain kind of thing?

00:45:25.107 --> 00:45:26.940
It just seems like it
puts a lot of pressure

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.330
on your short stories
that there should not be.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:32.999
But I've met a lot of
great readers there.

00:45:32.999 --> 00:45:35.040
That's probably the best
thing that I got from it

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.160
is getting lifelong
readers that I still

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.320
exchange work with and talk
about writing with and call

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.850
crying, that kind of stuff.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:46.910
AUDIENCE: So when you talk about
the number of drafts you did,

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.910
when you say a draft, are you
putting it aside and starting

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:52.940
from beginning again, or are
you rewriting specific sections?

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.840
EDAN LEPUCKI: Well, it's funny.
"Draft" is such a loose term,

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.980
I feel like, because it can
refer to different-- actually,

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.500
Lauren Groff, the writer,
she's a wonderful writer.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.230
She writes by hand, and
then she takes everything

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:13.349
she's handwritten and throws it
away, and then she starts over.

00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:15.140
She's like, if it's
good, I'll remember it,

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.154
which is so horrifying to
me but completely admirable.

00:46:19.154 --> 00:46:21.070
So I write everything
right onto the computer.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.444
I usually have a
notebook with me

00:46:22.444 --> 00:46:25.260
where I write, OK, what
did I do in this passage?

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.530
What do I want to do next?

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.172
I have a lot of notes.

00:46:28.172 --> 00:46:32.680
But because I revise as I go,
then what draft number I'm at

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.309
is unclear.

00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:36.350
Right now, I have a book.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.230
I have 170 pages of it.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.140
There are some sections that
I've written many times over

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.112
and other ones that
are just totally raw.

00:46:43.112 --> 00:46:45.195
It might end up that some
of the totally raw stuff

00:46:45.195 --> 00:46:47.880
will end up in a
published book someday.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.600
I don't know.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.330
Usually what happens is,
if I can remember clearly,

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.100
when I got to the end
of the first draft,

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.810
I wrote, "the end."

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:03.810
Then I'll print it
out, read through it,

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:07.530
make changes based on what
I think the book needs.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.140
Usually, what I'll do is I'll
do like a pass that's just

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.562
for prose, and then I'll
do a pass that's like,

00:47:13.562 --> 00:47:15.270
OK, I'm going to focus
on the flashbacks,

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:17.750
figuring out which ones do I
need, which ones don't I need.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:21.370
Or I'm going to focus
only on the last 50 pages

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.950
because I feel like the conflict
resolution is really not

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.300
working here, or I'm
going to work on pacing.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.660
I'll have an intention
for every single draft,

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.040
but all of those intentions
will encompass a single draft.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.652
It will be part A of the
draft, part B of the draft.

00:47:36.652 --> 00:47:38.110
And then when I
was with my editor,

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:39.820
for instance, the
first draft was all

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.656
about cutting the flashbacks
and adding world building,

00:47:42.656 --> 00:47:44.030
and then the second
draft was all

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:47.400
about working on the plot
in the last 100 pages,

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.580
so they were focused per draft.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:55.000
But they start to sort of blur
together of what draft is what.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.035
I have a feeling
that in my future,

00:47:57.035 --> 00:47:59.660
I will have some kind of project
where I'll write a whole draft

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.780
and then have to totally
dispose of it and start over,

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.791
but I haven't had
that experience yet.

00:48:06.791 --> 00:48:09.040
AUDIENCE: What is that
decision making process for you

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.260
of switching to another book?

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.440
When do you give
up on a project?

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.265
EDAN LEPUCKI: That
other book, I have

00:48:15.265 --> 00:48:17.230
a soft spot in my
heart for this book.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.310
People ask me now, am
I going to publish it?

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:20.060
I'm like, no.

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.500
That book belongs in the drawer.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.700
That book, I finished it.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:29.549
My agent sent it out for almost
a year to different editors,

00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:31.590
and there were too close
calls that were actually

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:34.256
very heartbreaking, where it was
like, they're going to say yes,

00:48:34.256 --> 00:48:38.120
and then they couldn't
get the final approval.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.670
But while it was
out on submission,

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:40.503
it was a whole year.

00:48:40.503 --> 00:48:42.530
I started "California."

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:44.370
After it had been
rejected so many times,

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:48.730
and it got to the point my agent
would send it to 12 publishers

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:53.390
and we'd get back three nos, and
the other nine just didn't ever

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:54.580
read it.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.780
It felt like a manuscript
that had no heat,

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.110
that nobody wanted to look at.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:00.870
And so I gave her the first
100 pages of "California,"

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.790
and she was like,
this book is better,

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.660
and it's a little
bit more commercial,

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.102
which is sort of a gross word.

00:49:09.102 --> 00:49:11.060
I don't think she was
being mercenary about it,

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.630
but she was like, you're writing
a book that you naturally

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:16.180
want to write, and I feel
like I will definitely

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.050
sell this next book.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.430
So instead of sending out
this book again and again,

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:21.830
which was getting really
psychically difficult,

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.895
why don't you just put it aside
and focus on this new book?

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:27.020
And so I always said if I
didn't sell "California,"

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.480
I was going to become a
nurse, because I was like,

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.200
I just can't go through that
rejection process again.

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.782
It was a year of people being
like, you're not good enough.

00:49:34.782 --> 00:49:36.240
You spent three
years on that book.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.480
Sorry.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.330
But then they
accepted it, so now I

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:45.241
don't have to be a nurse, which
I think is better for everyone.

00:49:45.241 --> 00:49:47.615
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Well, Edan,
thank you so much for coming.

00:49:47.615 --> 00:49:48.670
EDAN LEPUCKI: Thank
you for having me.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.220
Thank you so much for
hearing me blabber on.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.470
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thank you all.

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:52.670
[APPLAUSE]
