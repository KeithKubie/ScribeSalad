( intro music )

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.877
( applause )

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.879
- Pam: Welcome.
- Marcus: Thank you.

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.851 line:0%
Do you mind if we talk a
little bit about your

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.120 line:0%
early years,
your early biography of...

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.723 line:0%
You were adopted when
you were three years old

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.158 line:0%
you and your sister.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:29.562
After your mother
had fallen ill.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.964
In fact, many, many people
in Ethiopia

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:33.432
had fallen ill, tuberculosis?

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:34.467
Yeah.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:39.705
Both my mom, my sister,
myself we had it, and,

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.374
you know, we lived out
in the countryside

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.743
and it was really
my mom and my sister

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.478
that walked into
a big hospital.

00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:48.281
Marcus:<i> My mom passed away,</i>

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:50.416
<i> my sister and I,
 we survived.</i>

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:54.854
So, talking about Sweden
and talking about your,

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.589
your adopted parents.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.593
Ann-Marie is your
mother's name, and...

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.728
she wasn't much of a cook,
was she?

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.830
My mom was a horrible cook.
Nice woman.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.899
- ( audience laughter )
- Marcus:<i> Horrible cook!</i>

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.669
<i> Her mother was a
 fantastic cook.</i>

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:13.373
So, what about your
grandmother's roast chicken?

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.874
- Can we talk about that?
- Yeah!

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:18.177
I mean, Helga... You know,
the funny thing with...

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:21.647
The cooks that I know,
the cooks that I sort of admire

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:24.350
they all came out of poverty.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.219
When I think about, but you
know, they lived a rich life.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:28.454
When I think about
the cooks that mattered

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:29.855
the most in my life,

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.393
I think about a lady like
Leah Chase, down in New Orleans

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.596
that sort of had the first
integrated restaurant

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.031
in this country.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.966
Owned her own business
since the 40s in America.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:44.203
And, my grandmother, you know,
they were born into poverty

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:45.805
but they knew how to cook.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.607
And...

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.943
So they ate well but maybe,
you know,

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:54.080
didn't have, what we think,
as a lot of money.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.851
And, my grandmother's cooking,
although when she passed away

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:02.188
she was a middle class
Swedish woman that did,

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.156
you know,
that did very well.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.892
But her cooking came
out of poverty.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.393
That never changed.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:11.130
Her DNA on roasting chicken

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.931
putting the vegetable
underneath

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.535
letting the chicken fat drip in.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.603
The next day have
a chicken soup

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:19.972
and maybe the third day
having chicken dumpling.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:22.608
- You know, so, the way she--
- She really stretched
that bird.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:24.176
Yeah, stretched that bird

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.579
and always had the broth on
in the back.

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.549
You know,
she was smart, smart lady.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.585
You know,
she had also child labor.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:35.054
- She had us three...
- ( audience laughter )

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.657
<i> ...running up and down,
 taking care of the pantry</i>

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.159
<i> and making like,
 there was always--</i>

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.227
<i> When you entered her house,
 you had to work.</i>

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:42.495
<i> There was always
 something going on.</i>

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.763
Now, thinking about
that chicken, too

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:47.132
what I thought was really
interesting was that

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:50.302
your grandmother
instinctively knew something

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:54.073
about the temperature that
that chicken needed to be

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:56.375
in the same way that
chefs who are cooking

00:02:56.375 --> 00:03:01.547
a 27 dollar chicken today,
do the same thing

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:02.815
but they do it in
a different way.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.417
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:07.352
You know,
that cooking is...

00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:09.956
It's like anything you do a lot

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.156
it's just instinct, right?

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:13.525
It's almost like Jazz musicians,
you know it.

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.828
Some people come from it
from a school,

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:18.264
some people were
just born with it.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.032
But when you have that concert
or when you're cooking

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:22.235
it doesn't really matter,
we're here now.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.936
And either you

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:26.673
learn those muscles
or you don't.

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:30.843
My mom had this
fancy electric oven,

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.479
my grandmother never
trusted that oven, so...

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.982
My grandmother,
she had

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:39.351
an oven that we'd have to
feed with wood all the time.

00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:41.320
So, just understanding

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.789
how an oven worked,
things like that

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.691
a cooking school's not
going to teach you that.

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.159
- Pam: Yeah.
- Cooking school is also not

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.296
going to teach how you taste
something and, you know.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:52.131
She used to taste the sauce

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:54.734
by pouring it straight
into her hand

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.635
and tasting it like this.

00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:57.870
- Right.
- You know.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.706
There was, you know...
So stuff like that,

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:05.445
you know, you have to be a
real craftsmen to understand.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:06.779
So,

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:11.284
at Aquavit, how excited
were you when they said,

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.886
"Yeah, come and...
come and work here."

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:14.954
No, it's very exciting.

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:17.490
Aquavit has always been,
sort of the,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.327
the only Scandinavian restaurant
outside Scandinavia.

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:24.831
Marcus:<i> The person that owned
 Aquavit at the time,</i>

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.899
he came back after
a couple of months,

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.634
"I'm looking for a chef."

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:31.904
And he said, "I know who is
going to be the new chef."

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:33.439
I'm like, "Who is it?"

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.208
"You're going to
be the new chef."

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.610
And I was like,
"Well, let me think about this."

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.946
Because it made me nervous.
I didn't wanna be...

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.214
Aquavit is a very famous
restaurant in Scandinavia.

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:44.016
I didn't wanna be the
guy to close it.

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:45.151
( audience laughter )

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:49.355
I'm like... Isn't that because
I was just being paranoid

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.524
I'm like,
"No, I don't want all that."

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:53.359
But I also knew that

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.596
timing of stuff
doesn't always work.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.231
You know, I wrote to

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:00.867
get to three-star
Michelin restaurants 30 times

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.267
before I got in.

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:04.303
That didn't fit with my timing.

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:05.805
- ( audience laughter )
- So, you know,

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.373
there were 30,
there was 29 no's,
you know what I mean?

00:05:08.373 --> 00:05:10.276
- Yeah.
- So, I also knew the opposite

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:13.679
of that timing is just not
going to be presented to you

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.215
and I think it even helped me
being black, in that case.

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:19.952
Because I knew how
rare we get the shots.

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:21.453
So, you better take it.

00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:23.623
Right, you better do
the most out of it.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:26.425
Well, and you definitely made
that opportunity work for you

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:29.161
because I think
by the time you were

00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:33.333
literally, just less than a
year later when you were 24,

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.635
a little food writer named

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:37.703
Ruth Reichl in the
<i> New York Times</i>

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:40.640
reviewed your meal.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.575
- Yeah.
- And something happened.

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:46.279
We got three stars from
<i> New York Times</i> and, you know--

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.482
You're the youngest...
He is the youngest chef

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:53.586
to ever receive a three-star
review from the<i> New York Times.</i>

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:54.720
I mean, come on!

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.725
( applause )

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:01.694
But, what I like about
that more than anything is

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:05.331
that we really had no clue
that she was in the building.

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.665
Any of those times.

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:09.201
And when I say like,
"We had no clue,
we had no clue."

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.937
Did she wear a
disguise or something?

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.671
It wouldn't matter to us,
because we didn't know.

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:14.440
We were so disorganized.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.208
- ( audience laughter )
- We were just working.

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:18.410
It could have said
"<i> New York Times</i> "
on her forehead

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.879
we wouldn't have known.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.882
So, what happened
after Aquavit?

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.450
What was your next
big adventure?

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.654
You know, I remember the
weekend before 9/11,

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:32.791
I did,
I was cooking at The Towers.

00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:36.195
I was cooking there, down there,
and the following weekend

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:39.732
the weekend of 9/11,
I was in Australia.

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:43.268
And I just remember,
a guy waking me up, like,

00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:46.071
knocked on my door,
"You gotta put on the TV".

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.507
And I saw this stuff
that happened

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:51.444
and I knew a lot of those cooks,
I knew a lot of those servers,

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:53.112
I knew a lot of...
I knew chefs.

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:55.448
At The Tower? The restaurant
at the top. Right.

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.617
And it was one of those times
when you start thinking about,

00:06:58.617 --> 00:06:59.852
"Okay. What am I doing?"

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.887
Like, whether, is
this going to be...

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:03.121
Is this going to be my life

00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:05.090
to cook for the richest
people in the world

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.728
for the rest, fill at least
80 seats every night?

00:07:09.728 --> 00:07:11.564
And I started to think about,

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:15.134
you know, what can a chef do,
what is my other purposes.

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:17.636
And, my call was
that experience,

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.304
right, the post-that.

00:07:19.304 --> 00:07:20.439
Yeah.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:24.410
And, I decided to,
"You know what,

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.046
let me,
let me move to Harlem.

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.881
Let me move somewhere else."

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.516
So, I'm like, "What if...

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:35.587
You know, what if I can open
a small restaurant here that

00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:37.890
puts the community...

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.292
Becomes a waterhole
for the community.

00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:43.095
That is of and
similar to Sylvia's

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:45.364
in the place of
creating jobs.

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:47.399
But just done a
little bit different."

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:48.667
And that was really when

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.504
the whole idea of Red Rooster,
for me,

00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:54.940
started to become real.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.244
Marcus:<i> And then by 2010,
 we opened Red Rooster.</i>

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:01.180
And, how is it
doing these days?

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.915
We have been very fortunate,
you know.

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.049
( knocks on wood )

00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:05.451
- Very fortunate.
- Yeah.

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.519
Marcus:<i> We're really blessed
 by the community</i>

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:08.988
<i> and we're really blessed by...</i>

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.188
<i> But, you know,
 it's not about--</i>

00:08:10.188 --> 00:08:12.057
I never measured a restaurant,

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:14.160
and it's easy to say when
you're busy all the time,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.095
but I don't measure it by

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:17.863
how busy it is.

00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:19.265
I measure it by
the goals and

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.666
the reason why I put
it in there.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.802
What is--
What was the purpose?

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.403
What is the core purpose?

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.972
The purpose was to

00:08:26.972 --> 00:08:30.409
really create something to
inspire and aspire, right?

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:34.079
The purpose was to
create jobs of the trade

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:37.416
that I've been lucky enough
to be a part of.

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:40.285
The purpose was
to also create

00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:43.288
another, so young,

00:08:43.288 --> 00:08:45.057
particularly,
people of color can say

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:48.026
"Hey, I can own a business.
Hey, I can become a chef.

00:08:48.026 --> 00:08:52.297
Hey, I can become a bartender."
Whatever your goal is.

00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:54.599
But it's a field here
and here is an--

00:08:54.599 --> 00:08:56.269
It represents an opportunity.

00:08:57.569 --> 00:09:02.040
This trade that lot of people
of color really started in

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:07.112
and served in, but the minute
it became a profession

00:09:07.112 --> 00:09:09.148
didn't fit into anymore,

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:12.518
can really take back
its authorship.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:15.220
That's the intent.
And that takes time.

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.424
And, thank you so much for
coming and being with us.

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.359
- Marcus, thank you.
- Well done.
You did a great job.

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:23.029
- You did.
- ( applause )
