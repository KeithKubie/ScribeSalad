00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.280
We're on problem 207.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:12.630
If n is equal to 4p, where p is
a prime number greater than

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.350
2, how many different positive,
even divisors does n

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.590
have including n?

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.960
So how many integers go
into n, or go into 4p?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.220
Well, definitely 4 goes into it,
because this is going to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.690
be a multiple of 4.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.750
Then anything that goes into
4 will also go into it.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.070
So 2 goes into it.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.430
2 is also a divisor.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.800
p would go into it.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.520
Are there any other numbers
that go into p?

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.410
No, p is prime.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.260
Well, you know 1 goes into p.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.950
But they wanted to know
the different

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.860
positive, even divisors.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.740
So, the positive-- we're just
dealing in the positive world.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.570
That just lets us know this
isn't some trick question

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.270
where we have to count
negative numbers.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.260
But they want even divisors.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.870
So, first of all,
1 is not even.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.185
So that can't be it.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.830
The second question,
is p even?

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.300
Well, by definition, if p was
even, and if it's greater than

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.070
2, it would be divisible by 2.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.880
So it wouldn't be able
to be prime.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.890
But they tell us that
p is prime.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.670
P is prime and it's
greater than 2.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.560
So it can't be divisible by 2.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.960
So it has to be odd.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.160
So this is also not
an even divisor.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.700
So there's only two even
divisors, 4 and 2.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.500
So the answer is 2.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.050
A.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.750
Problem 208.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.145
S is a set containing
9 different numbers.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.060
T is a set containing 8 numbers,
all of which are

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.430
members of S.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.810
Which of the following
statements cannot be true?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.220
The mean of S is equal
to the mean of T.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.900
So, let's think about
this a little bit.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.830
So, choice A, that their
averages are

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.530
equal to each other.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.330
Let's just say that set S is
equal to 1 through 9, 1, 2, 3,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.570
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.850
So what would its mean be?

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.460
Well its mean, if you average
all these numbers, if you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.100
average 1 and 9, you get 5.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.410
If you average 2 and
8, you get 5.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.880
If you average 3 and
7, you get 5.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.080
You average 4 and
6, you get 5.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.490
If you average 5, you get 5.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.845
So the average is 5.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.210
So if this is S, what
if T were this?

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.400
What if T were just
this right here?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.170
Let me label that.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.420
That's T.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.610
That's not 7.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.360
That's T.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.150
Then S is everything.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.920
So, it's T plus the 5.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.380
So the average of all the
numbers in T, if you average

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.140
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, your
average is going to be 5.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.595
If you think about it, the
average of 4 and 6 is 5.

00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:58.740
The average of 3 and 7 is 5.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.450
I think you get the idea.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.830
You could work it
out if you like.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.490
If you were to take set S, which
is all of these numbers

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.450
plus the number 5, if you add
5 to a set of numbers whose

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.610
average is 5, the average
is still going to be 5.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.100
So A definitely works.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.870
B, The median of S is equal
to the median of T.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.450
Well, once again, that's
true with this set.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.040
This is a good set
to work with.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.050
It proves everything
we need to prove.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.280
What's the median of T.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.790
It's the middle number in T.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.000
There's 8 numbers, so
you have to average

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.700
the middle two numbers.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.180
So, if you average the middle
two numbers in T, 4

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.050
and 6, you get 5.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.100
So 5 is median of T.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.180
Then what's the median of S?

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.390
Well, now S includes the 5.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.000
So you can put all these
numbers in order.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.210
So 5 is the middle number.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.170
So 5 is also the median of S.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.310
So, both of these can
happen, A or B.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.160
Choice C, the range of S is
equal to the range of T.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.000
The range of a set is just the
difference between the highest

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.540
and lowest number.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.840
Then the range of S
is equal to what?

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.250
The highest number in S is 9.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.510
The lowest number in S is 1.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.270
So that equals 9 minus 1,
which is equal to 8.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.640
What's the range of T?

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.370
Well the highest number
in T is 9.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.769
The lowest number is 1.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.150
9 minus 1 is equal to 8.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.680
So this one can definitely
be true.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:34.390
Statement D, the mean of S is
greater than the mean of T.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.770
Well, sure.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.620
Instead of this being a 5,
what if this was a 50?

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.660
Now all of a sudden the average
of T would still be 5.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.975
But if you threw this 50 in
there for S, your average is

00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:50.030
going to go a good
bit above 5.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.570
So statement D could definitely
work if you just

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.550
make that extra number that's
in S a lot larger number.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.980
Then statement E, which I'm
guessing is the choice it

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.180
cannot be true because we could
figure out a case for

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.030
all of A through D.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.460
The range of S is less
than the range of T.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.280
So the range of the difference
between the highest and the

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.030
lowest. No matter what, the
range of S has to be at least

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.960
as large as the range of T.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.930
Think about it.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.280
In this case, the range of T
is 9 minus 1, which is 8.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.005
You could make the range of
S larger if you use 50.

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:35.500
If 50 was the extra number, then
the range is 50 minus 1.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.110
But considering that all of
these numbers in T are also in

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.900
S, the difference between the
highest number in T and the

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.910
lowest number in T has to be
less than or equal to the

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.240
range of S.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.590
So they're saying the opposite,
the range of S is

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.520
less than the range of T.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.680
We know this cannot be true
because T is a subset of S.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.920
So the choice is E.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.340
Next problem-- it took me more
time that I wanted to-- 209,

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:17.520
How many different positive
integers are factors of 441?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.380
Well, essentially it's
just factoring it.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.800
Well let's see, this should be
divisible by-- let's see, 4

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.640
plus 4 is 8 plus 1 is 9-- so
this should be divisible by 3.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.140
So 3 goes into 441.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.020
1 times 3 is 1.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.540
Bring down a 4, it goes
in it 4 times, 12, and

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.560
then you get 21, 27.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.140
So, you get 3 times 147.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.550
3 should also go into this,
because 1 plus 4 plus 7 is 12,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.310
which is divisible by 3.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.630
So 3 goes into 147.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:08.430
147, you go 4 times
12, 27, 49 times.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.510
So let's just do a prime
factorization of 441.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.210
You get 3 and 147.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:24.950
147 factors into 3 and 27, which
then factors into 3 and

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:30.450
9, which then factors
into 3 and 3.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.870
OK.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.890
So I didn't realize, but
this is a [? link ?].

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.520
This is the same thing
as 3 to the fifth.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.770
Is that right?

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.060
Oh no, sorry.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.500
I made a mistake.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.810
Let me redo this.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.200
3 goes into 147 not 27
times, but 49 times.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.550
So then this is, if
you you prime

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.410
factorization, a 7 and a 7.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.370
I was about to say, 441 isn't
3 to the fifth power.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.520
So let's write that down here.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.380
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.220
I don't want to be confusing.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:13.330
So 441 is equal to 3 times
3 times 7 times 7.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.110
So if they want to know how
many different positive

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.310
integers are factors, so all you
have to think about is how

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.680
many positive integers
can I construct with

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.540
two 3's and two 7's?

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.790
So let's just list them.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.450
3 definitely works.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.140
3 times 3 will definitely
work.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:28.670
Well, let's go in order.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.460
7 will definitely work.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.690
3 times 3 will work.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.610
That's 9.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.000
3 times 7 would work.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.990
21.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.700
3 times 49 will work.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.630
3 times 7 times 7, so 3 times
49 will work, which was

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.610
actually 147.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.620
147 works.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.680
Then 9 times 7 would
work, which is 63.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.320
9 times 7.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.200
Then you have 9 times
7 times 7.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.850
That's essentially 441.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.260
Let me make sure I haven't
missed any combinations.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.270
You have one 3 and one 7.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.160
So you have a 3 and a 7.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.140
You have a 3 and two 7's.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.545
You have two 3's and a 7.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:28.600
Then you could have two
3's and two 7's.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.430
Then, of course, you have
the 3 and the 7.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.400
So I have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 numbers.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:39.460
Here I have 1, 2, 3-- what
am I missing here?

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:45.170
So, I have a 3, 7--
oh, of course.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.620
I'm actually missing the 3 times
the 3, and I'm missing

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.840
the 7 times the 7.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:59.190
So, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8 factors of which 441-- and

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.485
that's not one of the choices.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.600
How many different positives
integers?

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.870
Oh, and of course,
the number 1.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.000
So, how many does
that come to?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9 numbers.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.010
So, that is D.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.580
There must be a faster
way of doing that.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.610
I'll let you think
about that one.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:20.950
Anyway.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.780
See you in the next video.
