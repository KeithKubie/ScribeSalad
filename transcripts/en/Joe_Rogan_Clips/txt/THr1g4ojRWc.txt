Speaker 1:          00:00          Right, that means something. Right. That's, that's impressive to me. I think that's really impressive. There are a lot of performers who are not good performance. They start out not as good performance and they need the people to believe in them in order to get away with a trickery. Right. And they never lose that. They always want people to believe it's a trigger. And when, so when I started coming out and I started saying, Hey, it's magic, it's verbal, it's nonverbal communications, all this stuff mixed together to create a show on not a psychic. There is absolutely nothing psychic about what I do. There were quite a few mentalist in the mentalism field back then. There wasn't as many as they are now who were upset with me. Dunkin said if you are assigned take man, the best way to hide it is say you're not assigned like right.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Yeah. No, that would be true except it's not the case. So what's up with the nails? I don't know cause we're two hours in here. Maria, tell me what's up with these nails. Yeah, take a nail. Okay. All right. All right. So this is what I want you to do. I just, you're going to have to describe what's happening. Okay. So this is one of the very first things I started doing. Joe, is this like the nail, I want you to look at the nail and nail and I want you to watch what happens. Okay. I'm watching what happens. Oh my God, you're bending it. This is incredible. You're Ben. As you can see, the nail is actually slowly, slowly bending out ranges. I look at, he's shaking your hand too. Yeah. Showing your powers. And the thing about that, take a look at it.

Speaker 1:          01:17          It's not a trick nail. It's nothing like that. I mean, everything I use from silverware to forks to anything that I do is a actual like this and slowly do that. Nah, that's it's uh, yeah, no, but I'll straighten it out again. I was at the VA, I was at the very end right there like that. Oh, I can't, I can't do that. So here, hold on. You got another one maybe? Yeah, I'm gonna say, yeah, let's keep it got some forks. Yeah, I got some forks. Okay. So I want you, I want you to point to a fork. Anyone? Um, how about this one? Do you want it or you want me to have that one? Uh, I'll take that one. You'll take it. All right. So, so you've heard of people, we've talked about people actually bending silverware, right? Can I have that pen that said? Wow. That one. You know, you can't. Yeah, I don't know. That's the one I want. I'm getting you to do something. I this one, just give me them fucking for the time. This, I know what you doing. Give me that fork. Yeah, you got a fork. They'll take a whole shit for it. No, you can have that fork. Joe. Let's take your fork.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Joe. Trying to get this floor to Ben. You know, watching, um, yeah, this was year four. Incredible. Trying to get this one. The could have burned.

Speaker 2:          02:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:21          what kind of techniques are you using, sir? There's a check. Tell me and I'll trick forks. Well, we're going to eat with these prompts. Those are those actually 100% genuine forks. Um, but you can't tell me how you're doing it. It's slight of hand. That's as much as I can tell you. Okay. Let me do it. Do it again. So I would watch some more time. You want to watch one more time? Okay. I was hoping I had like a bullshit fake fork. No, not really. Are legit. If I was sitting with you, I'll show you it. It's actually, no, it's easier if I'm sitting with you. So let's do here. People can tell, huh? Yup. So what's this one? Ready? Here we go. Watch it. Right. Watch. Okay, so I'm going to shake it like right. You know what? Let's do it this way. Can you, is it a way, can I move this? Yeah. Yeah. So hold both hands out like this. Okay. And I'm just going to, I'm going to hold it right there. I want you to hold that in and hold that in for me. I'm gonna have to make a, what do you want me to do? Hold this end as well. Okay. With that. And I'm going to hold it right in the center. Right there. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:20          You're rubbing it. Watch, Oh, you're heating it up. Wait, wait. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't force it. Don't force it. Just hold it. Okay. Can you feel that? Yeah. Because it's a different kind of metal. No, it's not. Yeah. You're using some sort of fake ass metal and now it's hard again. Right? Because you're heating it up, right? Is that what it is? No. What? I'm going to actually get this one a break. Hmm. But I'm gonna look now chill. Wow. Right? Because it's some bullshit ass metal. I promise you it's not. I have DVDs out that teach magicians how to do this. Of course, you gotta be a magician. Know where to get it. And it uses any fork anywhere. Anytime.

Speaker 1:          04:03          Promise you. But I got mine to bend now. Yeah. Good luck bending it this way. If they were made out of special metal, I would never let you keep them because they would be too expensive. But this one's going to twist all the way around and that one's not made as special metal. It's a regular metal. Hold on. I've got to concentrate. Yo, dude, are you psychic for real? Yeah. What kind of wizardry is that, sir? He spun this around and turned into a not, the thing is he's not going to tell you how he does it. That's the real problem. No, you're telling me that it's bullshit, but you won't tell me how you're doing this bullshit. It's very unfortunate. What? There's different techniques. That's the thing, right? I mean, and I really hope you can come see a show. Sometimes I do things like one person, another person feels it. I tell people to donate like name and number, you know any number at all. Okay, go ahead. 13. Okay. And that would be a common number for a lot of people to choose. Sure. You know, there were specific words, if I said to you, think of a number of name, any word with seven letters or less. Go ahead. Okay, go ahead. Cut.

Speaker 1:          05:07          Of course. Most people wouldn't. Most people were not a common word. No, that's not a common word. I'd know most people are choosing love or how something like that. And kinda along those lines, uh, you know, a dog or cat, a really common ones. Um, but, but here's, here's the interesting thing. Okay. Okay. So inside this wallet, did you give up on the word? Because I'd chosen her. There was no, no. Yeah, inside this wallet. I put it in, see, I was driving while I was driving all around it. Right, right. And someone cut you off and you know what doodling is? Doodling is when you kind of scribble without even looking. And as you notice inside the hair, you open it up. Tell me what's on there. So you know, I didn't want to touch it. What does it say? It's hard to read.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Yeah, it's my handwriting and doodling. Does it say 13 and can't? Yeah, it does. Let me see. Oh shit. Hmm. Well, it's such bad handwriting that I got to think that you wrote that underneath the table. It is definitely a 13 right? [inaudible] yeah, yeah, yeah. I wrote it under the table while we're doing this. How would it end up inside the wallet? Cause you just shoved it in there. Oh, this is, try this. What's that one? All right, we'll try this. I can't promise I'm going to be able to do okay. You know what? I got both of you in here. Let's do this. What am we do? All right. I just got a bunch of cards on second deck of cards. All right. That is crazy though, to have 13 and cunt written on the piece of paper. I'm gonna wash your hands closer.

Speaker 1:          06:36          I'm going to fan of cards out, Joe. Okay. I'm not going to actually have you pick one up. I am in sort of, I'm going to find it. I'm not good at fanning cause I'm not a magician. Right. I'm gonna show you the cards. You're not a magician. I'm a mentalist. Oh, watch. I'm going to found the cards out. I want you to think of any card you see any card. I say you get one. Okay. You see it? Yes. Did you get a red card? Excuse me? Did you get a red card? Yes. Good. Did she got a red card? And we do. Same with you across the table. I want you to think of any card to get a black card. Okay. Do you get one? Yeah. All right. I'm gonna ask one question cause I have to ask questions sometimes to try to figure out exactly what it is you're thinking. Okay. Did either one of you choose a high card? Yes. No. Okay. High cards are hard for me to get, but I will try. All right. Look at me. Don't dump down so you got a red card. I'm going to say your card is probably hearts.

Speaker 1:          07:31          Your card over there. Jamie is black. Yes. Probably spades.

Speaker 3:          07:39          Nailed it.

Speaker 1:          07:41          The two, two of spades.

Speaker 3:          07:42          Yes.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Hearts, King hearts. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me see that deck of cards. We only had three choices. Yeah. I had a queen of spades and eight of spades and a two of spades and I switched from the queen of sprays. Before you asked that question, high or low? I went low. You went low. You went low. Yeah. Why did you do that? Because I thought it was [inaudible] mind. Fuck he mind fucked. You thought I was going to go high. There's a lot of these kinds of things. It's verbal, nonverbal. It's magical. Psychology is a mixture of all kinds of different things. Twisted up a spoon. It son that shouldn't, yeah. I don't know how you did that. I definitely want you to come. We go to the magic castle tonight, by the way, are you? Yeah. You're welcome to call me if I can go to the comedy store.

Speaker 1:          08:22          Oh yeah, you're working. Yeah. Yeah, I'm working. What time you work in there rather come and see you so I'm not working. You're not? Nah. Going to go ahead and see some friends. Like my friend of my scrubs is actually a good friend of mine, Steve Valentine. I don't know if you know Steve as an actor. No, I don't really graves' and crossing Jordan, stuff like that. And he's got an interesting story about his life and it's not the psychological thing as well, which I'm always fascinated with of where he was performing magic for years, constantly performing magic and um, he wanted to be an actor and the magic was kind of a side thing for him, but it started getting away. He'd go on interviews and stuff and they say, you know, I want you, that guy that does kit shows, I want you to do a party for me and so forth.

Speaker 1:          08:59          And he could never get the part. So he started denying that he was a magician. I just totally left magic completely. And people say, yeah, I got your business card. No, that's not me. That wasn't me. Oh wow. That's when he started to be on how to act and he started getting the acting jobs and everything. It wasn't until years later that he could go back and be a performer. Wow. And it's a really interesting story, but he does it with magic and teaching and things and yeah. Do you ever work on comedy and magic in her Masa? Nah. No. I never have. No. Yeah, it's interesting cause he mixes comedy and magic together. Like you'll have like a magician on the show with comedians. There was a few of those back in the days that I worked where it was comedy magic club type thing.

Speaker 1:          09:36          So yeah, it's a good nights. Do you ever teach this stuff? I teach to other magicians. I have, so have to be like, I have videos and stuff. I have books. Uh, so I definitely do teach, but I don't teach one on one. I never teach. I just don't have time to teach you one on one. I'm always so busy working and trying to teach like this stuff. Like how do you do these things? The metal bending, I have DVDs out on that. The teach magicians how to do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I promise you they are not trick forks. Those, they're not trick nails, not trick forks. They are. Yeah. Well just the fact that you could spin a regular fork, right? This, Oh fuck. Are you doing that man? There was a way it sorta became the Holy grail for me when a, I can tell you how that came about for me.

Speaker 1:          10:16          There was muscle walkie I told you that he could actually put it under a chair and he would put it in something and twist it. I was doing an article for the national Inquirer. I don't even think I could do that with just my hands. And that's what's confused. And the guy shows up. You? Yeah, there is a way. And the guy shows up, a photographer shows up from me and he says, I want you to bend some silverware. So you know, I go, Oh, you know, and I, you know, I go to him, you know, and I go, okay, all right, I'm going to bend something. So I take one and I go like this and next thing you know it's bending up like that. And then I do another bend for him. He says, this is going to take a while, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          10:49          I go, well, yeah, you know, he says, just bend them up with your hands. I go, well that's cheating, which exactly what I was doing, you know? So I say these, that's cheating. So he says, no, go ahead. So just start bending them up like crazy, crazy. And next thing you know, I had a twist and I remembered exactly how I got that twist. So I called Randy up on the phone because it was sort of the Holy grail thing, looking for a way to actually do it. And I went in there and I had one of those telephones that had the long cord, you know, all the way into the bathroom. And I called Randy up and I'm whispering now and say, Hey, I just bet a four with them, you know, with my hands, you know, just put a twist in it. And he goes, yeah, so what?

Speaker 1:          11:19          I go, no, no, no. And I explained exactly how to do it. And now all the mentalists use that technique. Yeah. So this was a regular fork. Yes. And you twisted that right in front of my face with one. Yes. Yup. Hmm. Oh, how the fuck you did it. You're not supposed to know. He's supposed to enjoy the mystery, Joe. All right, well I'm trying know that you can be fulled. It's very confusing. I can be fooled so easily because this is a real fork. I know that there's a certain forks that they make out of shitty metal. It's like a knee, heat it up and it becomes like super bendy. Yeah. That's something that's, I don't want to get too much into methods and so forth, but that's definitely not something I use or would use and yeah, and that looks just a little weird.

Speaker 1:          12:00          Yeah. But yeah, it looks like jerking off before, but I'm trying to get a dyno monic ejaculation that may or may not do it. The thing about was weird is that how easy that fork bent when I bend it, when you had it, it was very strange. The one that bent really easy. When I bend it and you said, are you doing it on your own? It was so easy to bend, right? Like why would it, why was it so easy to bend? And I'm can't tell you why at that moment, but if you look now, that's that fork right there. And take a look at it and see if it's easy to bend. Now you'll see that it's not going to heat in as fuck her up. I'm going to make it easy, but it's because at that moment, that's the one that I was going to break.

Speaker 1:          12:36          I wanted to break that one. It's very confusing. Yeah, it's a job. Well, it's amazing really, because you'll let people actually touch the things. And someone like me who knows that you're doing a trick, cause you just told me that you're doing a trick and yet I still can't figure out how to fucking do it. You see me work, you'll see I throw everything across the stage and a lot of stuff I just leave for people afterwards because I want them to interact with those things I want them to take them home with. Yeah, yeah. No, I can imagine. Especially the forks. Yeah. After awhile, you know, that's just, he just sat. I mean you just sit and look at this fork afterwards. You look okay. I don't think I could do that. Yeah. I mean if I just gave you a regular fork, Jamie, do you think you'd do that?

Speaker 1:          13:16          Spin that? No, I don't think I could twist that thing like that. We remember when we're talking about the TV show, we're talking about the TV show earlier, the areas. I have a pitch that's out right now for a series, which it looks like you may be going somewhere. So I don't want to say too much about it, but it's bringing back the million dollar challenge and it's going out to James, Randy, James, Randy million-dollar challenge and used to go out looking for psychics, testing them on a proper controls. If they're trying to trick us, maybe I'll expose it in methods. I will demonstrate my abilities supposedly to do the exact same thing under certain conditions as well and it's sort of what makes me the expert to go out and try to find these things and see what's really going on and it's sort of brain games Meech meets the bunking meets psychic phenomena, but not every single one is going to be debunking either.

Speaker 1:          14:01          It's only going to be really debunking when somebody is purposefully going out and trying to bullshit somebody and trying to fall. People will take advantage of people. It's very baffling stuff. The the, I mean the, the, the stuff about talking to people and ask them questions and reading their cues. That kind of makes sense. But this doesn't make sense at all. The fork stuff just does not make sense. It's really weird because the PK stuff is something as a mentalist, as a performer, you tend to pick your powers, right? You tend to, well you wouldn't because you don't, you know, but as performance ourselves, when we perform this type of stuff, we go, okay, does that fit sort of in the repertoire of my abilities? Do I have x-ray vision? You know, I drive cars blindfolded, you know, it put DOE in there, they put tape over, they at least see me do something along those times on your show.

Speaker 1:          14:45          And it says thing of like, you pick your abilities and this doesn't seem to fit with anything except that your Yella did do this. And also said that it could duplicate pictures and read minds once in a while as well. I didn't do too much of the minor eating, but did a little bit of it. Somebody would draw a picture, then he would draw a picture and they would match. So, which is a standard mentalism magic trick anyway, but his methods were a little bit more bold, a little bit more direct. [inaudible] yeah. I'm still baffled, stopped being baffled. How can I not be bent some forks, man. Maybe. Maybe someday I'll teach you how to do all this and I'll tell everybody no, they did not want that. I won't tell you. Don't tell them. I can't tell you. You can't tell me cause I'll fucking tell everybody.

Speaker 1:          15:26          Yeah. But then nobody's going to be impressed when you do it. Well, I don't care. Yeah. I just want everybody to know. Is there anything else that you can do that's fucked up? Ah, I didn't really bring a whole lot cause I've kind of just wanted to talk more than anything else. Um, I mean we've done enough. It's very, very impressive. Maybe I can do one thing for you. Okay. I don't know. Um, all right. So see these, you know what they are, right? No, they're the Zener cards. Basically. The [inaudible] shapes basically five shapes that were, um, they were used at Stanford research Institute. Uh, I took university, actually not Stanford, Duke university. They accredited by [inaudible]. Uh, simple shapes. Uh, there's a square, there's a star wavy lines, a plus in a circle. All right. These are the standard shapes right there. I'm going to try to get you to choose a specific one.

Speaker 1:          16:16          Now, psychologically, if I asked you to choose one, which, which would you say like, I mean we shouldn't even say psychological [inaudible] that would be psychological because it's right in the middle and that would be the one. All right, so I'm going to go with, um, yeah, I'm going to go with a star. I think star, there's a circle. There's a square, a the plus in the wavy lines, right? I'm going to mix them up so you don't know which is which. Alrighty. I'm going to have to look at them in just a second myself to make sure I know exactly where that is. All right. We can do this as the gambling thing or not, but I don't like to do that. I should probably rip people off strong. Right? Put that in the right place. Okay, good. So this is what we're going to do.

Speaker 1:          16:54          I'm going to take cars and I'm going to ask you, do you think the star is that card you, all you have to do is not choose a star. You're going to choose a star. You won't know why you choose a star, but you will choose the star. All right? Okay. You won't have Aegis will and it's going to be something I do. Something I say or something that it's going to be something that I'm going to try it. I just made this make me pick the star. This may or may not work. All right, but we're going to try. I see sneaky pastor, do you think this is, do you think I'm going to say yes? That's the star. You say yes, that's a star. You'll see. Okay, so you're supposed to say no, that's not the star at some point because you, your idea is not to pick the star.

Speaker 1:          17:30          I want you to not pick the store to anyone, so if you think that's the star. All right, I will. Okay, so you're just going to say, do you understand? Yes. All right, so here we go. I know you're watching me close. All right, so let's do it again. Hold on. We already flipped them around. It makes them up. One more time. There's this sneaky hand movements are still confusing. Watch. Okay. No take time. Moments to makes me sad. He spent so much time learning how to move your hands like that. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep it simple. Really simple for you. Okay. By my opinion. Yeah. Well I've cut it already so cause I want to do it again because I'm going to make, make it very vague. Right. Your job is to not choose the star K not choose the star. Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:08          Ready? All right. So, um, um, I guess I'll just ask you, do you want this card? No. All right. So you don't want that one. Don't want that one. Do you want that card right? Like don't choose a star. Yes, I want that one. You sure that's the one you want? Yeah, that's the one I want. Don't look okay. I won't look that. Look. I don't trust you. Watch my hand. Don't look, don't look okay. I see what you didn't choose. You didn't choose a circle, right as she was a plus that didn't, she was [inaudible] the wavy lines or the square. He chose a star. They look sound of a bitch. Yeah. Yeah, but that's like slight of hand, right? Huh? Huh? Well, what the hell is that? Watch. What are you talking about? Slight of hand. I can try. I can try it one more time. Hold on. Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:59          To put it there. All right. I hate doing this stuff like this because especially with the amount of people that are listening to this podcast, right? What happens? [inaudible] I'll manage if I'm wrong. I looked like an idiot. If you're wrong as a performer. Yeah. Somehow or another. I think you're not going to be wrong. I could be. So once again, I'm going to try and make you choose a star, okay? Okay. Your job is to not use it. Okay. I'm not going to do it again after this. This is the last time we doing this. All right. Do you want that card? Yes.

Speaker 1:          19:28          That's the one you want. That's the one I want. I keep in mind. You did that the first time. Yeah, right. Don't look, I don't want look square. Circle plus wavy lines. Take look. Dammit. The story now, do you, um, realize that I'm impulsive and that I have no patience? I did all that for the star immediately did it the first time. See, you thought that by doing it again, that I would not think that you would do it a second time. Is that what you did is that's how you sort of kind of, not what I did. I was not going to tell him. So now he's getting frustrated, right? No, no, no. I'm very impressed. I'm very impressed. Well, listen, man, this was a lot of fun. It was.
