00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:10.550
Why do Zombies Eat Brains?

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.690
Zombies have been a pop culture staple for
decades, and in that time the concept of the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.890
dead coming back to life somehow to feast
on the living has proliferated virtually every

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.210
form of media that exists.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.300
One trait that is seemingly synonymous with
zombies is their apparent need to feed on

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.999
the brains of the living.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:34.500
But why is this idea so intrinsically linked
with zombies and where did it come from?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.870
(To be clear when we say that we’re going
to talk about zombies, we’re referring to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.440
zombies as they’re understood by modern
pop culture, not the zombies of Haitian and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.800
West African folklore, which are an entirely
different entity altogether.)

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.620
With that out of the way, we initially thought
that answering this question was going to

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.350
be easy since modern media featuring zombies
all have roots back to the exact same source,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.379
George A. Romero’s cinematic masterpiece,
Night of the Living Dead.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.930
While it’s true that zombies have been around
in various forms before the release of Night

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.950
of the Living Dead in 1968, Romero’s film
is largely considered to have introduced the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.380
concept of the modern zombie to the world
and almost all media involving them draws

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.080
from his film in some way.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.800
Although Romero is noted as the source for
many of the common zombie tropes, shambolic

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.260
movement and a hunger for human flesh being
the most prominent, zombies don’t actually

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.549
eat brains in any of the six “Of the Dead”
series of films he directed.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.260
In fact, Romero himself has no idea where
the brain-eating idea came from and in a 2010

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.070
interview with Vanity Fair, when asked about
the link between zombies and brains, Romero

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.229
very bluntly explained that: “Whenever I
sign autographs, they always ask me, “Write

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.229
‘Eat Brains’!”

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.090
I don’t understand what that means.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.469
I’ve never had a zombie eat a brain.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.600
But it’s become this landmark thing.”

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.500
Romero went on to explain that although his
zombies do indeed eat human flesh, he’s

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.830
never given much thought as to why they do
this and even expressed amusement at the idea

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.030
of a film exploring the idea of, as he put
it, “Do they [zombies] shit?”

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.670
The origins of the “zombies eating brains”
trope didn’t actually appear in media until

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.420
well after Romero’s film debuted in the
60’s, first being featured in the 1985 movie,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.970
Return of the Living Dead.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.290
While you could be forgiven for thinking Romero
had a hand in making this film due to its

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.210
title, it was actually released entirely independent
of his input.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.460
You see, after the release of Night of the
Living Dead in ’68, Romero and his co-writer,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.960
John Russo parted ways and reached the agreement
that Russo would retain the rights to the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.400
“living dead” suffix whilst Romero agreed
to use “of the dead” in any subsequent

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.550
media he produced.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.490
Though Russo had a hand in the creation of
the original Night of the Living Dead, Return

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.790
of the Living Dead isn’t considered to be
linked to the official “of the dead” series.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.860
This is mainly due to the numerous discrepancies
between the zombies in both men’s films.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.900
While the zombies in Romero’s films can
be “killed” in a sense by destroying their

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.730
brain, Russo’s zombies are effectively immortal,
being shown to survive being decapitated and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.780
even burned to a crisp.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.050
In regards to why the zombies feed on brains,
the closest we’ve ever come to an official

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.400
explanation is a quote from Return of the
Living Dead’s writer and director, Dan O’Bannon,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.760
who suggested that the undead felt the need
to feed on the brains of the recently living

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.550
because it somehow made them feel better by
easing their pain.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.820
Avid fans of the zombie genre have tried to
expand on this reasoning by asserting that

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.120
zombies eat brains and guts because of the
high levels of serotonin they contain, something

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.370
that is kind of alluded to but by no means
confirmed in the film’s official commentary

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.150
where the production designer for the film,
William Stout, notes that the idea of eating

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.620
brains somehow alleviating the zombie’s
pain “makes sense“.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.720
As for investing such time and effort in such
zombie minutia, Romero, who we’re treating

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.290
as the de facto authority on all things zombie,
because he kind of is, has criticised people

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.669
in the past for taking his work too seriously
including Max Brooks, who you may recognise

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.239
as the author of the best selling Zombie Survival
Guide.

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.129
Romero has always maintained that the focus
of his movies isn’t the zombies- it’s

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:31.210
us, or rather our reaction to them and that
the zombies and how they function isn’t

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.210
important.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.419
An idea that is shared by the many creators
of media inspired by his work.

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.550
For example, Robert Kirkman, the creator of
the immensely popular Walking Dead series

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.800
has stated that he will never reveal how the
original zombie outbreak started or how the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.719
zombies infect through biting because it’s
“unimportant” to the story.

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.889
Likewise, in the film Shaun of the Dead, the
cause of the zombie apocalypse the film revolves

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.960
around and how exactly the zombies “work”
is never revealed, only hinted at as a direct

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.319
homage to Romero’s films where we’re similarly
never told why or how zombies are able to

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.439
exist.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:14.199
As for why the idea of zombies eating brains
has managed to become so widespread despite

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:19.379
the fact it’s not a trait Romero’s zombie’s
(and by extension almost all zombies in modern

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:24.580
fiction) share, The Simpsons are believed
to be the main culprit in the idea becoming

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.990
popularised.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.030
The 1992 classic Treehouse of Horror segment
Dial Z for Zombies, which itself was a spoof

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.020
of Return of the Living Dead is one of the
earliest pieces of media with the exception

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.810
of Return of the Living Dead itself to feature
brain eating zombies.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.590
To quote Matthew Belinkie of OverthinkingIt.com:
“millions of kids saw this episode before

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.259
they were old enough to see a real zombie
film.

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.979
I suspect that for a whole generation, this
was the first zombie story we ever saw.

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.999
And that, my friends, is why we think that
zombies eat brains, even though most of us

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:15.759
have never seen a movie where this 
is 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.370
the case.”
