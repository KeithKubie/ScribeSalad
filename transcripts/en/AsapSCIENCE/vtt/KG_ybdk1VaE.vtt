Whether you use it to fry your eggs,
melt and bake potatoes, use on popcorn

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.320
or simply spread on toast.  Chances are
butter has been part of your life and diet.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.670
Or is it margarine?  What is the difference
between butter and margarine and is one

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.030
healthier than the other? Butter, made
from cream or milk has been used for

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.159
thousands of years. But scientists
eventually took notice of its high

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.189
levels of saturated fat.  With more than
35 calories per teaspoon, butter

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.390
is fattening.  When we look at the
molecules of butter we see some of the

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.659
building blocks of life, carbon, hydrogen
and oxygen.  But these carbon atoms are

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.420
completely surrounded by the hydrogen
atoms.  And this saturation level

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.430
quickly became associated with, and
commonly believed to contribute to

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.490
cardiovascular disease.  Margarine on the
other hand is created primarily from

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.960
plant oils which have a similar but
different chemical composition.  The

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.110
carbons double bond with each other so
that fewer hydrogen can fit and we call

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.660
this unsaturated fat.  So far so good, a
similar tasting substitute with less

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.309
saturated fat. Right?

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.440
Not so fast, unsaturated fat has a lower
melting point and so its natural state

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.900
is less solid, like vegetable oil.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.180
In order to get the consistency of
butter scientists decided to make it a

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.790
little more saturated.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.270
The problem is through this process
called hydrogenation where more

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.130
hydrogen is added and the oil becomes
more solid, high temperatures are used

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.080
which cause some troublesome changes.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.160
You see, most of these double bonds are in a
configuration known as "cis bonds",

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.330
but hydrogenation often flips them into
something called a "trans configuration".

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.490
Ah, the dawn of trans fats.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.770
And while it may seem trivial, this
simple yet unwitting flip from "cis" to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.390
"trans"

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.270
leads to significant changes in the way
our body processes and metabolizes the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.750
molecules.  Essentially trans fats lower
good cholesterol and higher the bad

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.960
cholesterol which increases the risk of
coronary heart disease.  So while margarine was

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.450
initially seen as a healthier option,
it's own hazards slowly came to light.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.610
But the truth is that many margarine
companies claim to be trans fat-free

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.740
nowadays, and some are.  At the end of the
day if we compare them side by side

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.500
there are pros and cons for each.  Butter is 
completely natural and typically made

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.480
from one ingredient, whereas margarine is
processed and has many ingrediants.  Butter

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.690
also has some essential vitamins and
minerals such as vitamin a and e. But margarines

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.790
now vary so much it is difficult to
make an accurate comparison.  Many hard

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.760
stick margarines are still high in trans
fats and much worse than butter.  But some

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.590
newer margarines are much lower in
saturated fat, lower their calorie count and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.000
contain zero trans fats.  The bottom
line is to be aware of what you are eating.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.330
Margarine can vary so drastically that
looking at the label to understand what

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.120
is or isn't and it will help you make
informed decisions.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.319
And there are healthier alternatives to
both,

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.159
such as vegetable oil spreads or using olive oil to dip your bread instead

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.309
of buttering up.

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.409
No matter what you choose, the
recommended goal is to limit the intake

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.049
of saturated fat and avoid trans fats
altogether.
