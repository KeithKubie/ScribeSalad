00:00:00.802 --> 00:00:02.066
- [Voiceover] Let's look at the clock

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.138
and see what time is shown.

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:07.414
The clock has two hands;
this first shorter one,

00:00:07.414 --> 00:00:09.664
which represents the hours,

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:14.346
and then there's a longer hand here

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.679
that represents the minutes.

00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:19.873
So, we can start with the hours,

00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:22.570
this shorter hand right here.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.605
Before we can figure out the hours,

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:27.853
you may have noticed our
clock is not labeled.

00:00:27.853 --> 00:00:29.882
So let's add some labels.

00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:33.539
At the top of the clock,
here, is always 12 o'clock.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.289
That's where the hour hand starts

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.817
and, then, the hour hand really only deals

00:00:38.817 --> 00:00:41.400
with these larger square marks.

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:45.351
So when it works its
way to this first one,

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:47.434
then it is now 1 o'clock.

00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:51.438
And when it gets to the
next one, 2 o'clock,

00:00:51.438 --> 00:00:54.355
and three and four, five and so on,

00:00:56.411 --> 00:01:00.578
until we work our way all
the way back to 12 o'clock.

00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:03.860
So now our hour hand,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.307
let's look at our hour hand right here.

00:01:06.307 --> 00:01:09.337
We can see it's just barely past the 10,

00:01:09.337 --> 00:01:11.692
but it hasn't reached 11.

00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:14.945
So that means our hour,
it's after 10 o'clock,

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:18.951
maybe 10:05, maybe 10:30,
but it hasn't reached 11 yet,

00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:22.534
so we can safely put
a 10 in for our hours.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.767
Now let's switch to minutes.

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:28.404
Here's our minute hand, and it looks like

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.849
it's lined up to this little mark.

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:32.595
Minutes are shorter and they also use

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:35.522
these shorter marks on the clock.

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:37.865
The minute hand starts facing up,

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.943
so when the minute hand
was here it was 10 o'clock

00:01:40.943 --> 00:01:42.473
and then it moved one minute,

00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:45.368
so it was one minute after 10 or 10:01.

00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:47.618
10:02, 10:03, 10:04, 10:05.

00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:53.878
So, this is five minutes
after 10, and it keeps going.

00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:57.601
10:06, 10:07, 10:08, 10:09,

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.035
10:10 right here,

00:02:01.227 --> 00:02:03.968
and maybe you can see this
pattern, it keeps going.

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:06.894
Here it was zero minutes after the hour.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.211
So it was zero, then five, then 10.

00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.603
So this one is gonna be 15.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.667
We're gonna keep counting by fives.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:17.167
And then one more minute after that is 16.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.886
So it is 10:16 or 16 minutes after 10.

00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:27.255
One more here.

00:02:27.255 --> 00:02:30.297
Let's again start with our hour hand.

00:02:30.297 --> 00:02:34.780
And we know our labels; we
know this is 12, one, two.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.007
We could keep labeling, but our hour hand

00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:39.939
is facing right there so
we really don't need to.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.245
The hour hand is between one and two.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.006
So it's after one, but not yet two.

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:46.839
So it's one something,

00:02:48.187 --> 00:02:49.603
and by looking at our minutes we can see

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:50.940
it's quite a bit after one.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.383
This minute hand has
worked its way around.

00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:56.715
And remember this is gonna
be five minutes after,

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:58.965
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40.

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:04.960
We can't go to 45, that's too far.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.640
So let's go back to 40 and
now just count by ones.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.890
41, 42, 43, 44.

00:03:10.904 --> 00:03:13.441
Our minute hand lines up here to

00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:16.358
44 minutes after 1 o'clock or 1:44.
