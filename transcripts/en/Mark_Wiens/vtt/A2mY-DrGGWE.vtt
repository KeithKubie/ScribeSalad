00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:01.087
- Hey everyone.

00:00:01.087 --> 00:00:01.920
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.566
Hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.753
This is a completely
spur of the moment trip.

00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:08.115
But Ying and I were invited to Phuket

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:12.720

full-on amazing food event

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.857
and it will be hosted at
this really exclusive,

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:17.387

00:00:17.387 --> 00:00:20.597
hotel in Phuket and this
is gonna be really a,

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:23.636
an opportunity of a lifetime,
the combination of the food

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:25.641
and hotel and I can't
wait to share it with you.

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:29.308
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:33.285
We're staying at a hotel called Sri Panwa.

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:36.037
It actually has it's
own little mountain hill

00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:37.865
and it's located at the very Southern tip

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:38.991
of Phuket.

00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:41.180
So it's about a 45 minute to an hour drive

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.597
from the airport.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:49.422
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:58.293 --> 00:01:00.626
(splashing)

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:08.336
We've got our own private swimming pool.

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:10.169
We just arrived to Sri Panwa.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.002
We got all checked in.

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:11.895
Ying and I got the,

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:14.427
this is the garden, family garden villa

00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:17.231
so it has a garden view
but we're somewhere

00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:18.319
on the top of the hill.

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:19.882
The sea is surrounding us.

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:21.355
This place is gorgeous

00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:23.557
and yeah, I'm gonna give you a full tour

00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:25.906
of the room and also walk around

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:28.396
but I had to jump in the pool first.

00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:31.035
Alright, so this is
the whole outdoor area.

00:01:31.035 --> 00:01:32.659
It's kind of the courtyard of this villa.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.017
The swimming pool is down there

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:35.203
and that pool is amazing.

00:01:35.203 --> 00:01:36.973
It's a salt water pool.

00:01:36.973 --> 00:01:38.319
And I can taste a little bit of salt water

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.301
on my lips right now.

00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:41.613
But if you come over here,

00:01:41.613 --> 00:01:43.552
this is a little outdoor kitchen,

00:01:43.552 --> 00:01:47.583
have the fridge and all
the drinks are available

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:49.528
at your disposal.

00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:51.604
We'll have a water right now.

00:01:51.604 --> 00:01:54.886
(slow instrumental music)

00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:57.252
Oh, I didn't see that step.

00:01:57.252 --> 00:01:58.199
Hello, Ying and Mica.

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:59.032
- Hello.

00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:00.191
- Oh, Mica's ready to swim.

00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:01.024
- Hello.

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:03.443
- Mica.

00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:04.276
(laughs)

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:05.394
But oh, okay check this out.

00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:07.919
This is the sliding glass door.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.136
Probably one of the coolest things

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:10.306
about this room,

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:12.248
the sliding glass door that opens

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:13.602
right into the pool.

00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:15.663
And then over here is the,

00:02:15.663 --> 00:02:17.610
it's a gigantic bed which occupies

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.995
the center of the room and
then moving to the back

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:22.970
here is the bathroom area.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.080
A huge bathroom area.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.590
Whoa.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.423
It's giant.

00:02:27.423 --> 00:02:29.144
I haven't even come back here yet.

00:02:29.144 --> 00:02:31.144
But we have double sinks

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:35.134
and we have a gigantic tub back here.

00:02:36.842 --> 00:02:40.507
I don't even know where this door goes.

00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:42.234
Oh, back to the room.

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:43.067
(laughs)

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:45.562
Okay, you can go around in a circle here.

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:47.312
And what's back here?

00:02:49.462 --> 00:02:51.097
Oh, okay so the tub,

00:02:51.097 --> 00:02:53.551
the tub is over here and then over here

00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:56.840
is a shower but then there's also

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.798
oh yeah, there's an outdoor shower, too.

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:03.642
And oh, hello toilet with the garden view.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:05.312
I think that completes this little tour

00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:06.740
of our villa.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.067
It's really self-sufficient.

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:10.065
There's everything you need in here.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.690
Really nice.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.100
It's really an honor to be invited here.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.434
I'm very thankful.

00:03:15.434 --> 00:03:16.481
We're on our way to a place

00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.006
called Baba Nest which is a roof top

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:20.423
or a pool top bar

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:25.387
and area and we're gonna
see the sun set there.

00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:28.055
The designs at this hotel are incredible.

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:29.983
This is Baba Nest.

00:03:29.983 --> 00:03:31.608
Oh, here it is right here.

00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:33.246
Wow, the view is unbelievable.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.853
You get full, at least a,

00:03:35.853 --> 00:03:37.327
well it's kind of a 360 but at least

00:03:37.327 --> 00:03:39.660
a full 180, 220 degree view

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.693
of the sea around.

00:03:43.693 --> 00:03:44.705
I'm hanging out now.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:46.945
This is my good friend, David Kalifa

00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:48.921
and he is one of the ultimate

00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:50.981
food lovers in the world.

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.345
He's an amazing guy.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:55.512
He especially specializes on Instagram

00:03:56.408 --> 00:03:58.251
and he's the Hungry Tourist.

00:03:58.251 --> 00:04:00.610
And David is the one who master-minded

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.232
this entire connection of food and

00:04:03.232 --> 00:04:05.514

00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:07.462
So I want him to quickly just

00:04:10.515 --> 00:04:11.810

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.673

my life is just travel,

00:04:16.062 --> 00:04:18.124

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.811
Actually the fish was flown
from (mumbles) this morning.

00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:37.119
Tonight's sushi, tomorrow Wagyu.

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:39.239

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:43.415

As you can see, they have no chairs here.

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:55.082
Only bean bags.

00:04:55.082 --> 00:04:55.915
- Yeah.

00:04:55.915 --> 00:05:00.580
- And look who else is

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.224
Hey, Mica.

(upbeat instrumental music)

00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:11.945
It is by far, the best time
of the whole day right now.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:15.278
It's time for dinner and here with David

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.930

he's starting on the first course.

00:05:29.034 --> 00:05:30.129
This is Omakasiya.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.720
So the chef is just deciding
what we're gonna eat tonight

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.168
and oh.

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.957
- Tuna hand roll.

00:05:35.957 --> 00:05:36.790
- Thank you.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.623
Tuna hand roll.

00:05:37.623 --> 00:05:38.456
- Quickly, quickly.

00:05:38.456 --> 00:05:39.289
- Eat it quickly?

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.122

00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:40.955
- Okay, this is the first one.

00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:41.788
The tuna hand roll.

00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:43.537
Right out of the chef's hand.

00:05:43.537 --> 00:05:45.454
I gotta eat it quickly.

00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:49.916
(laughs)

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:50.749
Oh.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.740
- [Man] Wow, (mumbles).

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.639
- Oh, wow.

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:55.665
Oh, I can't even believe it.

00:05:55.665 --> 00:05:59.087
I don't even, that's
just, that's just like

00:05:59.087 --> 00:06:03.254
melting tuna in your mouth
with a little bit of rice.

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:07.686
An extraordinarily fresh
seaweed that is just

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:11.076
this crisp, but really fragrant.

00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:11.909
Oh, wow.

00:06:16.381 --> 00:06:19.249
- This is the most
amazing and we're starting

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:20.871
with it, just imagine.

00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.503
- [Man] Yeah, starting with a.

00:06:22.503 --> 00:06:24.253
- Mm, it's ice cream.

00:06:26.546 --> 00:06:30.718
- Next course, is Bonito smoked mackerel.

00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:33.046
It's just beautifully,
artfully designed as well.

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:34.423
Sliced into thin strips

00:06:34.423 --> 00:06:36.923
and then decorated gorgeously.

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:41.963
Oh, it's so pure.

00:06:41.963 --> 00:06:42.828
Oh.

00:06:42.828 --> 00:06:44.858
It's so delicate.

00:06:44.858 --> 00:06:47.059
Oh, and look and next course.

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:50.726
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:06:55.306 --> 00:06:56.915
- Ah, I want to put it on my face.

00:06:56.915 --> 00:06:58.998
(laughs)

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.512
- The next course we have
is Japanese Spring salmon

00:07:04.512 --> 00:07:06.169
with dashi.

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.487
And this is like a, in a cocktail cup.

00:07:09.487 --> 00:07:13.654
Oh, there's a chunk, a nugget,
a nugget of salmon down here.

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:16.789
(chattering)

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.197
Oh.

00:07:18.197 --> 00:07:19.746
I can really smell the dashi.

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:20.722
You can really smell the stock.

00:07:20.722 --> 00:07:22.207
Yeah.

00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:25.686
Mm, just a, like a
roasted smoky but again,

00:07:25.686 --> 00:07:27.353
very delicate aroma.

00:07:34.227 --> 00:07:35.060
Wow.

00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:42.452
Okay, I don't wanna over
use melt in your mouth

00:07:42.452 --> 00:07:44.876
but I can't help it.

00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:47.300
Everything is melting
in my mouth right now.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.603
(laughs)

00:07:48.603 --> 00:07:52.601
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:54.374
Chef has started on the sushi courses,

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:55.740
and the first one.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.490
And it was just, it's just
unbelievable to sit here

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.207
in front of him and watch
him prepare the sushi.

00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:05.710
Everything he does is just
with incredible precision

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.901
and with amazing expertise
and with passion as well

00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:12.401
and the first one is flounder.

00:08:14.831 --> 00:08:15.914
0h, the rice.

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:18.352
The rice is awesome

00:08:18.352 --> 00:08:20.020
with a little bit of a sour taste to it.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.603
Next step is squid.

00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:26.048
(man speaks in a foreign language)

00:08:26.048 --> 00:08:26.881
(laughs)

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:27.789
- I think so.

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:28.904
I hope so.

00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:32.654
- Oh, that has this
amazing crispiness to it.

00:08:33.708 --> 00:08:34.791
Oh, so fresh.

00:08:36.113 --> 00:08:36.946
Mm.

00:08:37.796 --> 00:08:39.511
The texture, the texture is awesome.

00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:43.116
So soft yet with a
little crispiness to it.

00:08:43.116 --> 00:08:45.192
- This baby snapper.

00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:46.025
- Baby snapper.

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:46.858
Thank you.

00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:48.887
- (mumbles)

00:08:48.887 --> 00:08:50.870
- This one is baby snapper.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.142
And just look at that, look at that ratio,

00:08:53.142 --> 00:08:56.983
that fish, the little
cluster, clump of rice

00:08:56.983 --> 00:08:59.137
and then just the light seasoning,

00:08:59.137 --> 00:09:01.470
but it's absolutely perfect.

00:09:07.002 --> 00:09:07.993
It's so soft.

00:09:07.993 --> 00:09:09.098
It's so tender.

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:10.562
(laughs)

00:09:10.562 --> 00:09:11.540
- [Man] It's amazing.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.757
- Yeah, that's a baby snapper.

00:09:14.757 --> 00:09:17.185
- This is (mumbles) pen shell.

00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:19.139
- For this one, it's a pen shell.

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:21.842
And he added on some zest of the yuzu

00:09:21.842 --> 00:09:23.342
which is a citrus.

00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:30.199
Oh, that is insane.

00:09:31.747 --> 00:09:36.205
It sort of has the texture
of a little bit of a scallop

00:09:36.205 --> 00:09:38.839
but like more meaty almost.

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:42.206
And then you can really taste
that sharp, citrusy flavor

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:43.206
of the yuzu.

00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:45.781
- Golden eye snapper.

00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:48.948
- This next one is Golden eye snapper.

00:09:50.898 --> 00:09:53.304
This is a meal I never want to end

00:09:53.304 --> 00:09:54.271
in my whole life.

00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:55.876
I wanna just stay here
for the rest of my life

00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:57.209
and keep eating.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:01.466
Oh.

00:10:01.466 --> 00:10:03.549
(laughs)

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.233
Oh, I think that's
bringing a tear to my eye.

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:09.211
Oh, that's butter.

00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:10.961
Oh, that's so tender.

00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:15.048
And I get a little bit
of citrusy-ness in that

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:17.631
the, the ratios of ingredients.

00:10:18.496 --> 00:10:22.163
And the balance of
freshness is just insane.

00:10:24.573 --> 00:10:26.375
Something I'd never
experienced before in my life.

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.637
This is, this is unreal.

00:10:28.637 --> 00:10:31.969
The next course is Akami,
which is the lean tuna

00:10:31.969 --> 00:10:35.993
that pure, red and it's
just shining with a sauce

00:10:35.993 --> 00:10:37.898
that he's brush over it.

00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:39.515
(laughs)

00:10:39.515 --> 00:10:43.848
I'm like actually whimpering
right now in satisfaction

00:10:43.848 --> 00:10:45.265
and anticipation.

00:10:51.574 --> 00:10:54.643
Oh, I don't even want to chew.

00:10:54.643 --> 00:10:56.303
Oh, I don't need to chew.

00:10:56.303 --> 00:10:57.838
Ridiculous.

00:10:57.838 --> 00:11:02.114
And as soon as you finish one
best bite of your entire life,

00:11:02.114 --> 00:11:05.615
another best bite of
your entire life comes.

00:11:05.615 --> 00:11:06.668
- [Woman] Michael.

00:11:06.668 --> 00:11:09.252
- This one is the medium fatty tuna.

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.502
(mumbles).

00:11:13.929 --> 00:11:16.924
Oh, it just like plays with your tongue.

00:11:16.924 --> 00:11:17.757
Oh, oh.

00:11:20.378 --> 00:11:22.307
It's turning to liquid right now.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.699
What really fascinates me is how he works

00:11:24.699 --> 00:11:26.769
both of his hands together

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.465
but doing separate tasks

00:11:28.465 --> 00:11:32.610
he does it with just,
like emaculate precision

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.832
and just pure love.

00:11:34.832 --> 00:11:37.528
- When you eat this one, close your eyes.

00:11:37.528 --> 00:11:38.361
(laughs)

00:11:38.361 --> 00:11:39.194
- Okay, yeah.

00:11:39.194 --> 00:11:40.027
- So talk to tuna.

00:11:40.027 --> 00:11:40.860
- Here it is.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.693
The Oturo.

00:11:41.693 --> 00:11:46.240
The fatty tuna belly and
this is one of the most

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.265
beautiful things that
I, maybe I've ever seen

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:50.490
in my entire life.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.907
(chattering)

00:11:54.931 --> 00:11:57.014
(laughs)

00:11:59.569 --> 00:12:02.691
I'm talking, that is
undoubtedly, one of the single

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:03.792
best bites.

00:12:03.792 --> 00:12:05.479
You can not explain that
sensation in words at all.

00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:08.684
And also, what's amazing about a

00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:10.694
eating sushi this ways is the interaction

00:12:10.694 --> 00:12:12.050
with the chef.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.157
It's, that's really
part of the experience.

00:12:14.157 --> 00:12:16.802
We are halfway through the menu right now.

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:20.327
But, yeah, this is a
meal I never want to end.

00:12:20.327 --> 00:12:22.712
This one is the gizzard shad.

00:12:22.712 --> 00:12:26.379
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:12:27.855 --> 00:12:29.043
Marinated in vinegar.

00:12:29.043 --> 00:12:31.210
Okay, really, really good.

00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:36.197
You taste this sourness but it's subtle

00:12:36.197 --> 00:12:37.216
but then it keeps on coming.

00:12:37.216 --> 00:12:39.677
Next piece is Botan shrimp

00:12:39.677 --> 00:12:43.594
and that is, that is just
beautiful to look at.

00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:49.640
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.723
Oh, the natural sweetness

00:12:52.698 --> 00:12:55.899
and then that wasabi flavor in there.

00:12:55.899 --> 00:12:59.315
Oh, it's a little bit like kind of

00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:01.189
a gummy as well.

00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:02.930
But so soft.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.648
Oh, that sweetness just keeps on coming

00:13:04.648 --> 00:13:06.413
as you keep on chewing.

00:13:06.413 --> 00:13:09.866
Oh, it's like a lingering
natural sweetness

00:13:09.866 --> 00:13:10.820
to that shrimp.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.653
Next up is the shrimp.

00:13:18.226 --> 00:13:19.726
Oh, it's so sweet.

00:13:21.216 --> 00:13:23.109
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:13:23.109 --> 00:13:26.442
This one is the Tilefish marinated kelp.

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:31.976
Mm.

00:13:33.297 --> 00:13:35.762
That one has a little bit
more of a chewy texture to it.

00:13:35.762 --> 00:13:37.391
- Yellowtail Amberjack

00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:39.370
marinated to soy sauce.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.918
The one is yellowtail
amberjack marinated soy.

00:13:43.918 --> 00:13:46.761
And this has a nice, little
like golden yellow color

00:13:46.761 --> 00:13:47.594
to it.

00:13:48.891 --> 00:13:51.308
(chattering)

00:13:52.806 --> 00:13:54.348
Spectacular.

00:13:54.348 --> 00:13:55.181
Again.

00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:58.327
Next up, this is a clam
and chef has said that

00:13:58.327 --> 00:14:02.494
this is a very traditional
piece of sushi as well.

00:14:06.442 --> 00:14:08.084
Mm.

00:14:08.084 --> 00:14:08.917
Mm.

00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:12.908
Oh, it's very muscular
and has a little bit of a

00:14:12.908 --> 00:14:14.528
crunch to it.

00:14:14.528 --> 00:14:17.019
And again, that natural sweetness

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:20.769
of that seafood is just
awesome and so fresh.

00:14:24.076 --> 00:14:24.909
- Thank you.

00:14:24.909 --> 00:14:25.742
Next one, this is the Monkfish liver and

00:14:25.742 --> 00:14:27.078
what he did is he took
a little ball of rice

00:14:27.078 --> 00:14:28.256
and then he wrapped it around seaweed,

00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:29.474
then he added the monkfish liver

00:14:29.474 --> 00:14:32.185
and then he, I think he grated on

00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:33.102
maybe yuzu.

00:14:39.116 --> 00:14:40.539
(laughs)

00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:42.622
That tastes like pudding.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.547
(laughs)

00:14:46.547 --> 00:14:49.492
Like the best pudding ever.

00:14:49.492 --> 00:14:53.159
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:14:57.256 --> 00:14:59.393
It's time for uni.

00:14:59.393 --> 00:15:01.912
And uni is sea urchin.

00:15:01.912 --> 00:15:03.965
This is, it's just absolutely gorgeous.

00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:05.406
This is one that you have to take a moment

00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:06.796
of silence out of your time

00:15:06.796 --> 00:15:09.315
to just admire the golden color,

00:15:09.315 --> 00:15:11.648
the like, the shimmer of it,

00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:15.375
the juiciness of it, okay.

00:15:21.217 --> 00:15:23.300
(laughs)

00:15:28.114 --> 00:15:29.697
It's unexplainable.

00:15:31.744 --> 00:15:34.744
That is ice cream of the sea.

00:15:34.744 --> 00:15:36.760
It's so delicate.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.606
It has a little bit of a seafood-y flavor.

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:42.331
But the custardy texture

00:15:42.331 --> 00:15:44.322
and the like, the Earthiness of that

00:15:44.322 --> 00:15:46.307
is unbelievable.

00:15:46.307 --> 00:15:48.140
I'm at loss for words.

00:15:50.105 --> 00:15:52.571
Next piece is the Rosy sea bass.

00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:53.910
And it does look kind of rosy.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.988
Wow, even in my fingers, feeling it,

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:58.172
it feels kind of like,

00:15:58.172 --> 00:16:00.161
feels kind of squishy, the fish.

00:16:00.161 --> 00:16:00.994
Wow.

00:16:07.236 --> 00:16:08.069
Oh.

00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:10.673
Oh, that one is amazing.

00:16:10.673 --> 00:16:12.019
Oh.

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.102
It's like, it's so fatty.

00:16:15.424 --> 00:16:16.723
It tastes like pure fat.

00:16:16.723 --> 00:16:18.433
It was as I expected because every bite

00:16:18.433 --> 00:16:20.266
has been unbelievable.

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:23.306
But that was amazing.

00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:24.742
Rosy sea bass.

00:16:24.742 --> 00:16:26.575
Next bite, is sea eel.

00:16:28.295 --> 00:16:29.725
Oh, and actually in your fingers.

00:16:29.725 --> 00:16:31.678
You can actually feel how it's like

00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:33.249
almost dissolving in my fingers

00:16:33.249 --> 00:16:35.082
before I even bite it.

00:16:38.107 --> 00:16:39.294
Oh.

00:16:39.294 --> 00:16:41.377
(laughs)

00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:45.782
That might be one of the softest things

00:16:45.782 --> 00:16:47.050
that's ever gone in my mouth.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.317
Eel that I've tasted is more buttery.

00:16:49.317 --> 00:16:52.142
But this was actually more creamy.

00:16:52.142 --> 00:16:54.559
(chattering)

00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:59.095
We have come to the end

00:16:59.095 --> 00:17:03.046
of this omakasi meal that
is life-changing meal.

00:17:03.046 --> 00:17:04.576
And the last one is a traditional omelet

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:06.970
and chef put some sugar on top

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.303
and then he blow torched it.

00:17:10.216 --> 00:17:12.081
Oh, and here's chef now.

00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:13.706
(laughs)

00:17:13.706 --> 00:17:14.539
Thank you man.

00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:17.051
This has been, this has
been a life-changing meal.

00:17:17.051 --> 00:17:17.962
- Really?

00:17:17.962 --> 00:17:19.823
- One of my, the best meals
I've ever had in my life.

00:17:19.823 --> 00:17:20.656
- (mumbles)

00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:21.489
- It's amazing.

00:17:21.489 --> 00:17:22.322
Thank you.

00:17:22.322 --> 00:17:23.155
Thank you so much.

00:17:23.155 --> 00:17:23.988
- You have to eat.

00:17:23.988 --> 00:17:25.484
- Okay.

00:17:25.484 --> 00:17:26.317
(laughs)

00:17:26.317 --> 00:17:27.150
Alright.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.983
One bite?

00:17:27.983 --> 00:17:28.816
(laughs)

00:17:28.816 --> 00:17:29.649
One bite, okay.

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:30.584
- What, two bites.

00:17:30.584 --> 00:17:31.586
Two bites, two bites.

00:17:31.586 --> 00:17:32.419
Yeah.

00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:33.919
- Okay, two bites.

00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:36.309
Mm.

00:17:37.481 --> 00:17:38.314
Oh.

00:17:38.314 --> 00:17:39.164

00:17:43.586 --> 00:17:44.484
(laughs)

00:17:44.484 --> 00:17:48.054
It is a type of like egg custard.

00:17:48.054 --> 00:17:50.432
Thank you very, very much.

00:17:50.432 --> 00:17:51.731

00:17:51.731 --> 00:17:53.709
I never wanted this meal to end.

00:17:53.709 --> 00:17:56.079
(laughs)

00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:57.579

00:17:58.455 --> 00:18:00.470

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.720
(mumbles).

00:18:03.606 --> 00:18:04.439
We just made it back to the villa.

00:18:04.439 --> 00:18:05.272
And it's only right that I share

00:18:05.272 --> 00:18:07.547
my ending thoughts about that meal

00:18:07.547 --> 00:18:08.899
and this day with you

00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:10.602
from the pool.

00:18:10.602 --> 00:18:11.898
(slow instrumental music)

00:18:11.898 --> 00:18:13.308
Oh, it's kind of cold now.

00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:15.426
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:18:15.426 --> 00:18:16.844
Oh, yeah.

00:18:16.844 --> 00:18:18.255
Being able to swim at night

00:18:18.255 --> 00:18:19.610
is one of the best reasons

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.493
to have a private villa.

00:18:21.493 --> 00:18:23.533
Oh, I love swimming at night.

00:18:23.533 --> 00:18:24.875
This is fantastic and it feels

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:27.198
oh, okay it is a little bit cold at night

00:18:27.198 --> 00:18:29.848
but it's so refreshing and feels so good

00:18:29.848 --> 00:18:31.089
after a meal like that.

00:18:31.089 --> 00:18:33.512
So I wanna say a huge thank you

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:34.601

00:18:34.601 --> 00:18:38.329
