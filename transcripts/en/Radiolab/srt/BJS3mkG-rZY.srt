00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,830
You are listening to radiolab
radio from W N Y s e.

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,840
Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab and today, well, today,

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,290
yes,

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,180
the story of an ax wielding nun
coming through a window to smack some

5
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:26,080
staphylococcus and take you back to
the future. Exactly the story it goes,

6
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:28,380
I'm not getting a sense. I
don't know if you will. Okay,

7
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:31,910
well the story comes in two parts,
both from our producer Latif Nasser,

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,110
and here's part one.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,700
So the way the story
goes, it starts in 1928

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,140
1928 Alexander Fleming, the story goes,

11
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,640
who knows if it's apocryphal or not,

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,620
is growing staph staphylococcus
in his lab. That's Maryn Mckenna.

13
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:53,100
She's a science writer
and staff is a bacterium.

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,130
It lives on our skin and especially
like parts of the body that are warm and

15
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:04,530
damp. So it likes to be just up our noses
or on our genitals or in our armpits,

16
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,200
places like that. And
generally it's no big deal.

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,550
It doesn't really do us any harm,

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,640
but if it gets into a scratch or a cut
and makes its way inside our bodies,

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,420
staff goes from being this
benign companion to being

20
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,590
potentially deadly. Anyway,

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,420
London 1928 Fleming has growing staff
in his lab in these little petri dishes

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,550
and he was a slob

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,220
basically, and he goes on a vacation.

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,360
He leaves his petri dishes
covering bacteria just
around leaves his window open

25
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,450
and something blows across his lab plates.

26
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,950
Some tiny little spec of a thing just
floats in through the window and comes to

27
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,190
arrest on one of those petri
dishes. And so a few weeks later,

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,260
Fleming finally back from vacation.

29
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,490
He needs to use those lab plates again
and he and his assistant go to clean them

30
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,260
off. Yeah,

31
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,160
I mean you'd imagine that he
would seed some real lush,

32
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:10,161
nice furry lawn of staff just over flowing

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,390
right out of the plate because it's
been sitting there for so long.

34
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:16,240
It's been a staff party, but on one
of the plates that they pick up,

35
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:17,074
they realize that,

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,403
cool,

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,070
it's almost polka dot. It's got
little dead zones all over it.

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,610
Little patches where the staff is dead,

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,380
dead, dead. Something
blew through the window,

40
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:34,850
landed in the dish and
starts killing the bacteria.

41
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,010
Yeah, and so when Fleming
looks down at his plate,

42
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,110
he sees that at the center of these,
you know, staff dead zones, uh,

43
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,280
there's a tiny speck of
natural mold. Oh, mo.

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,270
And they realize that that mold is
expressing a compound that is killing the

45
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:55,680
staff around it. It's like emanating
rays of death. What was the compound?

46
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,270
That compound was called

47
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,143
[inaudible],

48
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,300
the first true antibiotic infectious
diseases that had been killing people for

49
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:06,290
as long as we had been.

50
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:10,640
People suddenly could be stopped and
it just blew in through the window.

51
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:14,660
That is the, that is the story that's
always been told. However it got there,

52
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,210
it was, it was amazing. It was a miracle.
It was called a miracle drug. Right?

53
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,420
I mean, it was just, it was,

54
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,320
it really was a moment when the world
changed when Fleming was put on the cover

55
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:27,920
of Time magazine. This is
1944 height of World War II.

56
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,870
It was a picture of his face and the,

57
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,010
the banner on the cover said
his penicillin will save
more lives than we're can

58
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:38,534
spend.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,833
[inaudible] but,

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,030
and this is, um, I had no idea about this.

61
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,810
Virtually at the exact same time when
Fleming's faces on the cover of Time

62
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,930
magazine, like two months later, um,

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,120
this Stanford researcher publishes that
he has found five different streams of

64
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,564
staff.

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,710
The do not respond to
penicillin. Really? Yeah.

66
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,430
This is happening while he's on the
cover, virtually the exact same moment.

67
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,490
And it's the first sign that staff has
responded to the penicillin in the world

68
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,380
by developing resistance to almost
like a separate history. So in wheeler,

69
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,490
the era of penicillin was over before
it began, almost before it began,

70
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,490
before it's even released
to the general public. Wow.

71
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,610
And that penicillin resistant staff

72
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,700
moves across the globe.
And in 1957 in Cleveland,

73
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,450
some scientists gather together
and they are in a panic.

74
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,290
They have no idea why they've lost
the antibiotic miracle so quickly.

75
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,830
So scientists across the globe put their
brains together and try to come up with

76
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:51,600
a new drug next amazing thing.
And in 1960 they get methicillin.

77
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,500
Oh

78
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,060
and it works for about
11 months, 11 months.

79
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,190
And so we started this arms race.

80
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,280
There was a bug and then there
was a drunk that took care of it,

81
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:08,130
and then there was a better bug
drug bug drug bugs. Right, exactly.

82
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,820
I actually found this list. Do
you want to hear it? Yeah. Okay.

83
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,730
So streptomycin 1943 resistance,

84
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:19,731
1948 methicillin 1960
resistance in 1961 clindamycin.

85
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:23,490
1969 resistance. 1970 wow.

86
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,000
You can think of it as leap frog
or you can think of it as a game of

87
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,490
whac-a-mole, ampicillin,

88
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,630
1961 then 1973 so that's a
little carbenicillin released.

89
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:36,970
1964 resistance. 1974 they're getting
better. They're getting better.

90
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,310
There were always more trunks.

91
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,170
Drug development was doing really
well for a really long time.

92
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,150
Hyper Cillin introduced 1980 resistance,

93
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:50,151
1981 but after the year
2000 drug companies begin to
realize it's not really in

94
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:53,580
their best interest to
make antibiotics anymore.

95
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,760
And the end I have on
this list is linezolid,

96
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,420
which is introduced 2000 resistance,
2002 wow. There are a few more,

97
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:04,520
but you get the idea antibiotic approvals,

98
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,110
the entry of new drugs to the market
just kind of fell off a cliff. Why?

99
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,830
Well to it takes 10 years and $1 billion
to get to the point where the drug is

100
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,110
marketable. But as soon as you
get the drug on the market,

101
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,270
the resistance clock is running.

102
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,920
So you probably won't make your money
back. And as you've probably heard,

103
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:24,080
we now have these situations,

104
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,351
well,

105
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,500
frightening new warning from the Centers
for disease control about the spread of

106
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:32,210
a string of germ where literally nothing
works so called super bugs are now

107
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:35,480
turning up in hospitals and patient dies.

108
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,140
There are nail bugs that
can resist all of our drugs.

109
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,290
I have seen physicians
breakdown weeping over this.

110
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,640
It's not the way that medicine
is supposed to fail anymore,

111
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,773
but it does.

112
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,940
I mean I know that that possibly the,

113
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,640
the origin story of
penicillin, this is apocryphal.

114
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,190
So this is all a little
suspect, but you know,

115
00:06:57,191 --> 00:07:00,970
just do enjoy imagining for a moment.
Like it just seems like if that happened,

116
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,860
let's just open up a bunch more windows,

117
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,090
just something out of blow in and we
can wait a long time. Right. I mean,

118
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:11,890
we had staff had been around
for Millennia before 1928

119
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,941
but you know,

120
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:18,941
the whole reason I wanted to do this
story is because kind of there is a new

121
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,820
window. It's a different
kind of window though.

122
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,810
Not to not a window nexus and
petri dishes, not a window
nexus and petri dishes.

123
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,640
Kind of a window next
to somebody, few dishes,

124
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,420
but a totally different kind of window.
What kind of window is it? Well,

125
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:35,420
I'm about to tell you that it's
something blow into the window. Yeah,

126
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,450
but it's not mold. It's
way more fun than mold it.

127
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,500
It carries an ax. How about
that? So it's a person maybe

128
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,060
I don't even know what
I'm referring to anymore.

Uh, part two. Yep. Okay. Hey, I'm Jad
I boom. Rod. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich.

155
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,370
This is Radiolab. We're
ready now for part two.

156
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:29,990
Now remember when part one ended,

157
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,990
there was a window open and
something was going to come through.

158
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:36,380
We don't know what to do. We know it's
not mold. Yeah, we know it's not mold.

159
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:39,560
So whatever it is, whatever
it was, whatever it will
be, we will hear about it.

160
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:42,720
Now from our reporter Latif Nasser, well,

161
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:47,340
actually there is this story about
these two women who did open a window,

162
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,830
uh, to, to an alien and distant land. Um,

163
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,920
and actually in a way it's a
story about re-imagining the past,

164
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:59,520
but to me it's a, it's a, it's a,
it's a story about a friendship.

165
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,750
Hey everybody. Hello again. Hello again.

166
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,060
It's a story about an unlikely
friendship. Um, it's a bloody field.

167
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,970
It's a buddy. Yeah, it's a buddy
movie. Okay. So, yeah, tell us,

168
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,500
maybe just walk us through it. Right.
So, okay, so you have, um, hello,

169
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,910
I'm Dr. Christina Lee,

170
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,620
Christina and I'm an associate professor
in Viking studies at the school of

171
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:22,860
English at the University of
Nottingham. She's a historian.

172
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,880
And then you also have, hi,
I'm Freya Harrison. Freya.

173
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,770
I'm a research fellow in the center for
biomolecular sciences at the University

174
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,610
of Nottingham and free up free as a
microbiologist. She studies bacteria.

175
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,540
We'll start with her. Okay.
So most of my work is about,

176
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,450
so we're looking at how
bacteria, if all of during very,

177
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:44,330
very long lived infections, but

178
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,200
like my big hobby is
Anglosaxon Viking reenactment

179
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,970
[inaudible] interest
in the history and uh,

180
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,470
mainly in dressing up as a warrior and
going to fight club every Wednesday night

181
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:03,640
and learning to use the weapons. Yeah.

182
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,940
So this is actually not free as
group. This is a group in New Jersey,

183
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:11,050
but basically they do the same thing.
Hundreds of people go out into, you know,

184
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,770
some field with some dulled
weapons, everything from swords,

185
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,330
spears, axes,

186
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,440
and we give each other a jolly good
fashioning and have a good time.

187
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,090
I only mentioned this cause
it, it actually plays into
the story. Well it was,

188
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,820
it was really a nice sort
of coincidence really.

189
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:34,090
So 2012 a few years after
finishing her doctorate,

190
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:36,600
Freya goes off to work at
the University of Nottingham.

191
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,110
Nottingham is one of the places in the
UK, not only for, for microbiology,

192
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:44,050
but for sort of Anglo
Saxon in Viking history.

193
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,410
And she goes there to study
microbes, but she figures, hey,

194
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,910
why not while I'm here,

195
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,830
brush up on my old English with her
h m will here, it's [inaudible].

196
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,110
I'd studied some old English to a level
where I could sort of read and fat and

197
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:02,920
speak a little bit. Let's stand on Nif
Nikita. She figured, Hey, she could,

198
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,410
she could be better. And if she did,

199
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,170
she would get deeper into
the whole reenactment thing.

200
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,050
So I rather cheekily emailed
the school of English,

201
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,070
his old English reading group. That's
where she met Christina, the historian.

202
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,630
And I thought one point Christina, the
historian asks freer like what do you do?

203
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,500
And Fred said, you know, my day
job is that I'm a microbiologist,

204
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:27,700
but on evenings and
weekends I'm a history nerd.

205
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,750
And Christina said the moment she heard
that and just kind of thought I found my

206
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,030
kindred spirit here
because she was like, wow,

207
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,170
I'm like your mirror image
because I'm a historian by day,

208
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,720
but by night I'm a microbiology nerd.

209
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,100
I've been interested in infectious
disease for quite a long time. Which um,

210
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,550
I don't, I don't find any kind
of friends in my department.

211
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,220
She told me she's the kind of
person who would, you know,

212
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:54,850
watch Ebola coverage on the news
and not be able to stop watching.

213
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,210
So eventually they start talking
about historical diseases.

214
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,680
So like how would people back then
have treated something like, you know,

215
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:09,820
Ebola, Freya is especially interested
in this because she, for her struggle,

216
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:14,740
reenactment is developing this nun
character who goes off and heels people.

217
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,330
But anyway, so they're
talking back and forth.

218
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:17,500
And then to cut a long story short,

219
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,710
they find themselves both interested
in this one particular book.

220
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,730
It's known as boat's leach book. This is
about 1100 years old. What's it called?

221
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:32,560
Bolt balls. What? Bolds leach
book as nothing to do with no hat.

222
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,370
Oh,

223
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,370
even though it just spelled as B Zeno
d it is indeed leach like leach like a,

224
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,340
like a leach, like a little worm. It
grabs onto your, your blood? No, no.

225
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,160
It comes from the old English word legend,

226
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,110
which is actually a healer or a doctor.

227
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,230
So is it that little squeaky animals
are called leaches because they're

228
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:54,730
medicinal, not the other way around. So
the doctor wasn't named for the leads.

229
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:58,790
The lead was named for the
doctors. And Bald is the,

230
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,750
as a man the guy wrote, we think it's
a guy, we think it's like a nice name.

231
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,500
And what is this book? So it's kind
of like this old healers handbook.

232
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,810
It's filled with these potions and cures.

233
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:10,720
The original manuscript is in
the British library locked away,

234
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,420
but 21st century very kind.

235
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:17,260
People have digitize the original
old English text and put it online.

236
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,350
So Christina and Freya bring it up
and they start going through all the

237
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,070
remedies. And you know,

238
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,080
as it describes to you remedies for
stuff that is a little bit different.

239
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,200
You know, things like phone Odell vote
for no money on possession by the devil,

240
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,460
which according to this leach book,

241
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,630
the remedy for someone who is possessed
by the devil is you view the rank and

242
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,850
Lutheran make this kind of like foul brew.

243
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,870
You make them drink it and it'll
make them vomit out the devil.

244
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,140
And then there's another remedy for warts.

245
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,370
This shale we at our new auto zone and
all I'm going to say about that one is

246
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:55,670
that it involves Helen's
urine and mouse blood.

247
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,470
And then things like Muncie, I
taught around a, how should we say,

248
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,920
make your husband more physically
attentive or less physically attentive,

249
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,820
whichever you,

250
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,290
whichever direction you need to moderate
it or towed blood drink on [inaudible]

251
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,970
Nestea actually it's just you boil boiler,

252
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,750
plant and some water and give
it to the guy. Oh yeah. Anyway,

253
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,940
so free and Christina are going through
this Veatch book looking for some kind

254
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:27,150
of wounds thing. It was clearly
an infection, some posse, uh,

255
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,480
something we could clearly say that
that's bacteria. And eventually they,

256
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,020
they find an entry at the end of
the recipe. It says an old English,

257
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,920
say Beth's de la [inaudible]
still nudged them.

258
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,710
The best medicine. The best
medicine. Yeah. Move over. Laughter.

259
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,590
Yeah. And we thought, how
can we not try this one?

260
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,870
What was the best medicine for?

261
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,380
So it said it was for a lump in the eye.

262
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,280
It's anticoag when in holding these days
if you get a course like that could be

263
00:15:58,281 --> 00:15:59,600
something like a watch. Right?

264
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,340
But there is a suggestion by
archeologists that eye infection was,

265
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,370
was rife amongst the Anglo Saxons
because you lived in buildings where you,

266
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,710
you had smoke going on,
you look crammed together.

267
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,950
So that could also be
a sty. What is a STI?

268
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,710
It's an infection of an
eyelash follicle. You Rub,

269
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,190
it itches and then it gets scrolling.

270
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,800
Causes quite a nasty red lumps of
STI in your eyes. Stay in your eye.

271
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,630
Now it just so happens that the
bacteria that causes the signer I is

272
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:34,220
staphylococcus Aureus staph. Oh, the
same stuff as the mister window man.

273
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:36,620
Penicillin man. Exactly.
And we just thought,

274
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,490
wouldn't it be nice to have a bit of spare
time and add a couple of hundred quid

275
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:45,050
to buy the ingredients and just give
this a go? Yes, let's give it a try.

276
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:47,930
You know, why, why the hell
not? And matter of fact

277
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,600
we thought that two video recently
producer Matt Kielty and I went to my tiny

278
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:01,460
apartment in the city and we tried to
cook it up to, are you ready to cook? Oh,

279
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:06,230
I'm ready to cut. I've got this recipe
here. Please read it. Go for it.

280
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,060
Okay. It goes like this

281
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,270
with one name crop. That's
the first line of the recipe.

282
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:16,640
And right off the bat for Christina
and Freya, there's a problem.

283
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,980
That first ingredient would
crop the ouch crop latch.

284
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,290
Christina said it was quite difficult
to translate and nobody quite knows what

285
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,680
it is, but luckily just a
couple of words over was a clue.

286
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,680
Then Garlia they May
2nd ingredient garlic,

287
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,750
which is an allium spaces and crop
latch. We know this was another allium.

288
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,930
That's what the dictionary
of old English, um,

289
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,600
tells us significant probably what they
were dealing with as an onion or leak.

290
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,790
We didn't know which
one. So we thought, okay,

291
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,340
we'll try one that has
onion and one that has leak.

292
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,260
Now you knew the recipe doesn't
cover this, but we did it anyway. Um,

293
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,980
peel the onion, chop it
up. The same for the Gar.

294
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,210
Like the recipe doesn't tell you how
much it just tells you mine's off.

295
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,560
So you take out the measuring cup. So
you measure it in equal amounts? Yeah.

296
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:08,520
You call them mounts and there's a
pestle and then after that, okay.

297
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,410
It says it canoe

298
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,030
hounded well together. Okay.

299
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,390
We really pounded and pounded. Freya did

300
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,400
lots and lots of time
with a mortar and pestle.

301
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,520
Muscles built up from wielding a
sword for pounding the ingredients,

302
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,820
starting to be more of
a mush third ingredient.

303
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:32,280
The next one was definitely something
you wouldn't have knocking around in your

304
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,520
kitchen and fe, rs. Yeah. Lung Bay.

305
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:40,200
I am Fairleigh school ox girl, bovine
bio from a, from a cow's gallbladder.

306
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,390
What do you have to kill the
cow and then go reach it.

307
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,870
It's actually a very standard
ingredient in microbiology labs.

308
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,890
Ox Bile today in 2015 you can but
should not just buy it on the Internet.

309
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,873
Here we go, here we go.

310
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,150
And so you take the ox bile added to
the onion and garlic and then the fourth

311
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:58,320
ingredient they name a win
wine and wine, red wine,

312
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:01,440
white wine like Whoa, why are we
talking about, this is the thing.

313
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,740
So we had quite a discussion about what
type of wine should we use and we don't

314
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:07,470
know really, did they have red
wine that they have white wine?

315
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:09,270
What was the alcohol content?

316
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,750
But I did a bit of a bit of detective
work and you figured out that the

317
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,720
monastery where this Leech
book was written, well they,

318
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,480
she figured out where their
vineyard was just down the road.

319
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,180
This is modern organic vineyard.
So they used that wine.

320
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,010
Can we kill Dave Yolie and [inaudible] I
just want to point out how difficult it

321
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:29,540
is to find English line. We had to
use Italian, but it mainly with sue

322
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,750
[inaudible] on artifact. Once
you get all that stuff together,

323
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,310
you're under the final
ingredient, the fifth ingredient.

324
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,810
It was actually that you're specifically
told that you have to mix these

325
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:44,550
ingredients together in a brass or
a bronze pot. Um, I don't have one.

326
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,150
Um, so we had to sort of
add pieces of, you know,

327
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:50,430
of copper that would've been
available to people at the time.

328
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,570
So they had to do some research,

329
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:56,250
but they figured out that the copper of
today that is most like the copper of a

330
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,290
millennium ago was actually
taught trench brass,

331
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:02,460
which is what's used to standard in
plumbing fittings. Pennies in there.

332
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,780
We actually use penny's worth,

333
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,160
couldn't show it looks and
smells like quite a nice,

334
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,720
quite a nice summer
suit. It looks awful. Oh,

335
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:16,620
that's so gross.

336
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,330
Clearly we botched this whole thing
not to stand the neonics on them,

337
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,260
RF fatter. And uh, finally we're going
to cover it. Okay. We're covering it.

338
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,840
The directions say we have to let
the whole thing sit for awhile.

339
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,520
That has to be stored
for nine days and nights.

340
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:37,080
Okay. That's it. One day
goes by, two days, three,

341
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,270
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, nine days later.

342
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,180
All right, here we go. You
Ready? All. Alright, here we go.

343
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,200
And nipped on them. Our
Arvato outer ring through Cla.

344
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,610
Then you have to strain it through
a cloth. The liquid that comes off,

345
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:00,520
you apply to the person's
eye or the liquid and

346
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,500
[inaudible] say bets. Lunch. Now,

347
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,820
clearly we didn't have any staff to
try this out on, but Freya in her lab,

348
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:15,840
she made these mock wounds with these
little plugs of, of, of Collagen,

349
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,880
so it's a bit like Jelly.
Basically it's like a,

350
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,290
like a goopy substance made to be kind
of like a flesh wound and we infect these

351
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,180
wounds with bacteria, with the staff.

352
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,730
Then they put this thousand year old
recipe that had been standing there for

353
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:31,320
nine days. They put it on the
bacteria that was in the fake wound.

354
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,520
We'd obviously where we didn't think
this was going to work. Nope. We thought,

355
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:36,990
you know, we'll given the ingredients,

356
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:40,200
we might see some small
killing effect on the bacteria,

357
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:42,150
but it won't be anything
to write home about.

358
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,300
They thought maybe you'd
killed 10% 20% of the bacteria.

359
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,500
But then when they came back the
next day, it was a staff massacre.

360
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,120
It went on a rampage and
went on a staff rampage.

361
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,660
It was killing, you know,

362
00:21:55,661 --> 00:22:00,400
99.99999% of these bacterial cells.

363
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,730
Yeah.

364
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,950
First we thought we made some sort of
mistake and this was some kind of fluke,

365
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:09,520
you know, we'd, we'd accidentally mixed
up our plates or mislabeled something.

366
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,413
So

367
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:11,590
[inaudible]

368
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,590
we run the entire experiment again.
They grab ingredients, Mash them up,

369
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,840
put them on some bacteria
and it happens again.

370
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,050
Just absolutely wiped out the
bacteria and held them dead.

371
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,430
And he tried a third time and a fourth
and fifth and it works every time.

372
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,350
And this is this, this
is just something you,

373
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:30,600
you really don't see in
your career. Some test.

374
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,250
And eventually they escalated
from just regular staff to,

375
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:40,230
to Murcia to the
methicillin-resistant stuff.

376
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,540
And this is one of the
bad ones. Super Bug,

377
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,580
new government data estimate that about
2000 people are dying of community-based

378
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,900
Marissa every year. This one is very
dangerous. It's so Christina and Freya,

379
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,930
they sent some of bald brew to one
of their collaborators in the states.

380
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,560
Oh, collaborator, Kendra Rimbaud in
Lubbock in Texas. Kendra took this stuff,

381
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,060
put it on some Murcia bacteria,

382
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,840
and then a week later sent
free and Christina and email.

383
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,250
And I think it was actually a
three word response. I thought.

384
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:12,630
I think she just simply
said, what the fuck, what the

385
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,860
ball's best medicine had just
wreaked havoc on the Mercer.

386
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,900
It killed 90% of them. This is
beyond their wildest dreams now free.

387
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:28,860
And Christina made very clear that
this is not yet a miracle drug. I mean,

388
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:30,780
it's not even been tested in humans.

389
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,530
So absolutely do not do this at home.

390
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,980
They don't even know if this
is safe. It might be the,

391
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,970
if you don't do it in exactly the way
we did, nasty fungus could grow in it,

392
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,380
give you a worse infection. So, uh,
we should not have done this, this,

393
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,543
Masonite, we

394
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,270
dumped ours down the drain.

395
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,570
But the thing about this whole story that
is so intriguing and so cool to me is

396
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:03,290
this time travel thing,
which is so strange.

397
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:08,291
Like it's like the idea that
something a thousand years ago,

398
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,370
uh, like a bullet forge a
thousand years ago, we could,

399
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,490
we could use it now and
then it could work that,

400
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:20,210
that the time travel dimension
of that is so weird to me.

401
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,460
It kind of makes you think differently
about, I don't know, progress.

402
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,560
So without further ado,

403
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,100
Dr. Christina Lee and Dr Fred Harrison,

404
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,430
and they're going to talk to
us about some ancient biotechs.

405
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,950
For example, just a few weeks ago, uh,

406
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:48,510
Freya and Christina got up in front
of the Royal Society of chemists.

407
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,330
Thank you very much. And it is
an absolute pleasure to be here.

408
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,650
Large Hotel conference room a hundred
or so people up free actually, uh,

409
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,350
got up on stage dressed as a nun. Okay.

410
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:04,120
So this is one interpretation of water
and Anglo Saxon scientist may have look

411
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:06,070
likes and they presented the results.

412
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,910
Next ingredient is
particularly the cooking demo.

413
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:13,000
And then at some point Christina
said something really interesting.

414
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,751
She was like, okay,

415
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:18,340
sure we want to write this off because
it has demons and dragons and elves in

416
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:23,320
it, but are we sure that we know
what they meant by those words?

417
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,290
Like for example, I'll
run the days which asks,

418
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,460
you sing for Avid Marias
and we would say, oh,

419
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:33,580
that's so superstitious. This is
all in their heads. But there again,

420
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,540
we should also remember this is a
period when people do not have watchers.

421
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,820
You do not have your nurse, you
know, so that's got the watch.

422
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,830
Everybody knows the album.
Maria, everybody knows the
length of an album, Maria,

423
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,873
so maybe it's,

424
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,710
maybe it's take this medicine and wait
20 minutes and I know how to standardize

425
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:54,720
20 minutes, which is three of them.
Maria's four other Maria's may even,

426
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,330
that's fast.

427
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:00,330
It may appear one way and it's in
fact could be a totally different way.

428
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,790
It suggests that the,
in order to time travel,

429
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,510
you have to somehow, God,

430
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:09,040
it's like we don't even have the language
people to understand what they were

431
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,640
doing. There's the effective,

432
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,630
there's a phrase that the
past is a foreign country

433
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,660
like boys. We need to learn the
language of the doctors of that time.

434
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,650
We need to kind of be
a little bit less, um,

435
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,090
dismissive and learn a little bit
more, you know, stuff from them.

436
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,880
I learned a bit of humility this
way. Here's the reason why this is

437
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,310
whole confusing to me.

438
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,630
So 1100 years is a crazy long
time for humans and for bacteria.

439
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:45,690
That's like an exponentially
crazy long time.

440
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,080
So how is it that something that this
man bald was doing to these bacteria then

441
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,830
like, like it's not even the same
bacteria? How could that even work?

442
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,020
That's a, that's an awesome question. So,

443
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,260
so one thing we've got
to think about is, well,

444
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,280
why did these medicines drop out of use?

445
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,080
And maybe it's because when the week
used the bacteria of old resistance,

446
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:16,140
but now a thousand years later when
these medicines have not been used,

447
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,000
you'd expect that resistance to be lost.

448
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,390
This is something that Marin
Mckenna mentioned to Zorn and I

449
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:25,220
that sometimes when you take
a drug out of circulation,

450
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,990
sometimes resistance will
decline. That doesn't always work,

451
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,270
but sometimes the resistance does decline.

452
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,300
So if we had been using this compound
through the ensuing thousand years,

453
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,090
then maybe it wouldn't work. So this
is an interesting discovery there.

454
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:45,110
Like what worked once
and then was resisted.

455
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,700
You give it a rest,

456
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,810
it can work again and it will be resisted
and you put it to rest and if you had

457
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:55,310
enough different, if you could go to
different places and the different paths,

458
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,300
did you go to China where they now got
all these people studying Chinese cures

459
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,900
and Arab cures? You could come up with a,

460
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,440
with a rich historical cocktail of
armamentarium that will work if you bring

461
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,590
them in, take them out, bring them
in, take them out and the whole world,

462
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,760
the whole world of the past then
becomes the food of your future sort of.

463
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,000
So it's also a positive.

464
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,640
Like now I have a suddenly an
image that it's possible that that,

465
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,930
this is Soren wheeler by the way,

466
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:28,250
in conversation with Mary Mckenna Latif
that a thousand years ago these folks

467
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:31,820
went through what we went through
with penicillin and that they,

468
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,360
this guy wrote something in the book and
it's actually called the best medicine.

469
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,900
He probably got on the cover of
whatever their version of time was,

470
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,050
their Nobel prize and everybody
celebrated and then years later sties were

471
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,020
coming back and the garlic wine didn't
work anymore and they stopped using it

472
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:53,021
and it got put away and then here we
are and we discover it and it's been put

473
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:57,290
away long enough that like then, then now
I'm thinking about future some future.

474
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,790
It's civilization digs up and old
medical textbook that was in some dusty

475
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,080
whatever and discovers penicillin

476
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,150
and it works. Did we,

477
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,970
did I lose you on that ma'am? No,
no. I'm still with you. I'm just,

478
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:12,740
I don't know. It just seemed like,

479
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,110
it seems like such a great
hypothetical construction.

480
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:18,440
I just didn't really know what
I could add to with this. Sorry.

481
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,610
[inaudible]

482
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:26,611
producer,

483
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:30,690
lots of Nasser with hope and Soren
Wheeler and a produced by Matthew Kielty.

484
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,560
Special thanks to Sarah too. Steve
Diggle, Andrew, Alexandra rider,

485
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:37,800
and Justin Parker, who came down from
Yale to be our old English readers,

486
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,290
to Jean Moreau from the Gotham early
music scene at the Marcia young on the

487
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,660
medieval harp column, Monroe of Tadcaster,

488
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,110
and on the rest of the barren eve iron
buck. Not totally sure what that is,

489
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:50,800
but I know they helped us out and I
guess we should help ourselves out of the

490
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,430
door quickly through the window.
I'm Chad, I'm Robert Krulwich.

491
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,480
Thanks for listening.
