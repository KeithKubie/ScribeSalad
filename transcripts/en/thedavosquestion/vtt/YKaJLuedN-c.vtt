00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:08.849
Hello, my name is Busty Okundaye. I'm with
UGC Technologies Shanghai, China. Yes I do

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.330
think the football is going to take place
here in 2010. It's actually very good for

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.949
the World Cup. It's very good for not only
South Africa, but the entire continent of

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.420
Africa. First of all there is going to be
precedent, meaning this is the first time

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.109
this has come into Africa. So hopefully it
will be coming again and won't be so much

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.620
of a headache coming a second, or third, or
fourth time to Africa. And in terms of other

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.430
areas beside football, does the infrastructure
that has been developed for this activity,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.809
this football coming to South Africa, is a
lot of benefits for the masses in terms of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.690
infrastructure or development. As another
benefit is creating jobs. Is skills also that

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.309
are very well needed not only in South Africa
but in other parts of Africa. But right now,

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:11.049
creating it here in South Africa. I think
this is a very, very good thing. And of course

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:20.140
when the football activities themself head
up here in South Africa there will be people

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.710
coming from all over the world not just from
Africa or from South Africa alone. And these

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.109
people will be bringing in a whole lot of,
what will I say, financial stuff that they

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.679
will come here and spend in South Africa.
So that's also beneficially for South Africa.

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.399
And besides that, there are other things like
follow up effects that will actually happen

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:52.020
in South Africa. So a lot of not just football
relationship will be happening among those

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.520
peoples of the world, but also there are business
issues and friendship issues. Also cultural

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.170
issues that will follow as a result of this.
So I think it's very beneficial not only to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.539
South Africa, but to the entire continent.
Thank you.
