00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.680
Let's say I've got some
subspace of Rn.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:11.790
Let's say V is a
subspace of Rn.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.350
And let's say the set B-- I'll
do it in blue-- let's say the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.880
set B is a basis for V,
so it's got a bunch

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.930
of vectors in it.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.480
And let's say it's got v1,
v2, all the way to vk.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.660
So you can see we have
k vectors, so v is a

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.790
k-dimensional subspace.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.960
So that means that if I have
some vector a-- let's say I

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.910
have some vector a that is a
member of my subspace-- that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.640
means that I can represent a
as a linear combination of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.840
these characters right there.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.130
So I could write a as being
equal to some constant times

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.420
my first basis vector, plus some
other constant, times my

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.140
second basis vector.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.310
And then I can keep going all
the way to a kth constant

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.940
times my k basis vector.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.640
Now, I've used the term
coordinates fairly loosely in

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.060
the past. And now we're going
to have a more precise

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.010
definition.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:25.470
I am going to call these
constants here c1, c2, all the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.620
way through ck.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm going to call them the--
I'll do it in a new color--

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:47.750
the coordinates of a, with
respect to our basis B, with

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.170
respect to B.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.930
And we could also write
it like this.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.930
We could also write I have
my vector a, so I

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.740
have my vector a.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.610
But if I wanted to write my
vector a in coordinates with

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.800
respect to this basis set B,
I would write it like this.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.690
Put brackets around it, and put
the basis set right there.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.200
And this says I'm going to write
this in coordinates with

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.340
respect to this basis set.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.570
So, I will then write
it like this.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.150
I'm just going to put these
weights there, these constant

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.790
terms, on the on the linear
combination that I have to get

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.910
of my basis vectors to get a.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.880
So there's c1, c2, all
the way to ck.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.600
Now there's one slightly
interesting thing, or maybe

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.680
very interesting thing,
to point out here.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.520
V is as basis of Rn, so
anything in V is also

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.620
going to be in Rn.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.360
But V has k vectors.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.390
It has dimension k.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.090
And that k could be as high
as n, but it might

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.550
be something smaller.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.410
Maybe we have two vectors in R3,
in which case v would be a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.920
plane in R3, but we can abstract
that to further

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.740
dimensions.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.050
But when you specify something
that is in our subspace, with

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.610
respect to its basis, notice
you only have to have that

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.840
many-- the dimension of your
subspaces-- you only have to

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.830
have that many coordinates.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.090
So even though a is a member of
Rn, I only have to give it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.920
k coordinates.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.720
Because, essentially, you're
giving it positions within,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.850
let's say, if this was a plane,
within the plane that

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.850
is your subspace.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.780
Let me make this a little
bit more concrete.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.440
Let me do some examples.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.960
So let's say we have
some subspace.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.330
Let me clear this out.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.280
Let's say I have a couple
of vectors.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.170
Let's say v1 is the
vector 2, 1.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.710
And let's say v2 is
the vector 1, 2.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.740
Now you might immediately see
that the basis, or the set, of

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:10.230
v1 and v2, this is a basis for
R2, which means that any

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.360
vector in R2 can be represented
as a linear

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.540
combination of these guys.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.240
I could do a visual argument.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.360
Or we also know that, look, R2
is two-dimensional, and we

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.290
have two basic vectors right
here, and they are linearly

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.860
independent.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.880
You can verify that.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.120
In fact, the easiest way to
verify that, is if you just

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.450
take 2, 1 and 1, 2, and you put
it in reduced row echelon

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.620
form, you're going to get the
2 by 2 identity matrix.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.260
You're going to get 1, 0, 0, 1,
and that lets you know that

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.770
this guy and this guy are
both basis vectors.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.200
So, that's all review.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.460
We've seen that before.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.320
But let's visualize these.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.530
Let's visualize these guys.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.450
So if I were to just graph it
in the way we normally graph

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.660
these vectors, what does
2, 1 look like? let me

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.960
draw some axes here.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.970
Let me draw it.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.220
We'll do it in a different
color.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.640
Let's say that is my vertical
axis, and this is my

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.820
horizontal axis.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.520
And 2, 1 might look like this.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.710
We're going to go out
1, 2, and then we're

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.270
going to go up 1.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.460
So that is our vector
1, right there.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.160
That is 2, 1, that's
our vector 1.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.670
And then 1, 2 might look like,
or it does look like this, if

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.680
I draw it in a standard
position.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.680
1, then you go up 2.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.980
1, 2 looks like this.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.200
So when we talk about
coordinates with respect to

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.290
this basis, let me pick
some member of R2.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.510
I'll engineer it so that I
can easily find a linear

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.150
combination.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:06:00.210
Let me take 3 times v1,
plus 2 times v2.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.960
What is that going
to be equal to?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.710
That's going to be equal
to the vector.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.950
So 3 times 2, which is
6, plus 2 times 1.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.630
So it's the vector 8, and then
I have the vector 3 times v1,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.900
plus 2 times that.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.300
So 8, 7, right?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.230
3 plus 2 times 2 is for 8, 7.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.215
So if we were to just graph 8,
7 in the traditional way, we

00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:33.530
would go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and then we would go up 1,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.870
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.190
And we would have a vector, I'm
not going to draw it out

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.740
here, but it would specify
that point right there.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.080
That would be this point.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.590
If you view these as
coordinates, we would view

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.940
that as point 8,
7 right there.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.100
Maybe I'll write it like that.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.240
That's the point 8, 7.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.050
If I wanted to draw the spectrum
in standard position,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.820
I would draw a vector that
ends right there.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.170
Now, we have this is basis
here, this basis B,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.190
represented by these
two vectors.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.635
This is B1 and B2.

00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:08.980
And what we want to do is
represent this guy.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.640
Let's say that this is vector--
let me call that

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.210
vector a-- so vector
a is equal to 8, 7.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.350
Now, we know that if we wanted
to represent vector a as a

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.070
linear combination of my basis
vectors, it's going to be 3

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.910
times you v1, plus 2 times v2.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.610
So just given what we just saw
in the earlier part of this

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:38.190
video, we can write that the
vector a, with respect to the

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.660
basis B-- maybe I'll do it in
the same color as the basis--

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.960
with respect to the basis B, is
equal to these weights on

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.655
the basis vectors, is
equal to 3 and 2.

00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:54.700
And let's see if we can visually
understand why this

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.770
makes sense.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.930
We're saying that in some new
coordinate system, where this

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.390
vector can be represented as 3,
2-- and the way you think

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.000
about the new coordinate
system is, in this old

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.960
coordinate system we hashed
out 1's in the horizontal

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.350
axis, and that was our
first coordinate.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.130
And we hashed out 1's in
the vertical direction.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.590
That was our second
coordinate.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.480
Now in our new system, what's
our first coordinate?

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.810
Our first coordinate is going
to be multiples of v1.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.540
This is v1 or this is v1,
so it's multiples of v1.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.540
So that's 1 times v1.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.680
Then if we do 2 times v1, we're
going to get, over here,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.049
2 times v1 would get
us to, what?

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:38.400
2 would get us to 4, 2.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.289
3 times v1 would
get us to 6, 3.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:48.150
So let's see, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.780
So it's 6 and then 3,
just like that.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.945
And then 4 times v1 would
get us to 8 and 4.

00:08:57.945 --> 00:09:01.330
So you can imagine that what I'm
drawing here, this is kind

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.670
of the axes, the first-term
axis generated by v1.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.450
So I could draw it-- let me do
it in this blue color-- so you

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.946
can imagine it like this.

00:09:12.946 --> 00:09:16.990
This would be a straight
line, just like that.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.090
And then the coordinate tells me
how many v1's do I have. So

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.830
I would hash off the coordinate
system like this.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.490
Instead of doing increments
of 1, I'm going to do

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.700
increments of v1.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.780
I'll write it just like that.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.360
As you go 9, 10, we're going
to go up one more to 5,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.800
something like that.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.870
Now, the second coordinate tells
you increments of v2.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.080
So this is our first increment
of v2, then our second

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.080
increment if we go to 4,
is going to be 4, 2.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.850
Just like that.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.892
That's going to be 6 and 3.

00:09:47.892 --> 00:09:50.060
It's going to be
just like that.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.560
It's going to be 6 and 3.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.970
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.830
So if you want to think of it
is a bit of a, well, you

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.620
should be thinking of it
as a coordinate system.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.570
You can have this new skewed
graph paper, where any point

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.320
you can now specify it as going
in the v1 direction by

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.350
some amount, and then
by going in the v2

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.280
direction by some amount.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.130
Let me draw that as
this graph paper.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.980
So I could draw another version
of v2, just like that,

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.500
just all the multiples of v2.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.100
I could shift them like that.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.760
I could do another
one like this.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.140
I could do another.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.035
That one is a little bit
not neat enough.

00:10:31.035 --> 00:10:33.630
I could do it like that.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.280
I could do-- I think you're
getting the idea.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.630
Let me make that a little
bit neater.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.430
This might have been useful
to do with another tool.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.500
And then I could do all the
multiples of v1 like this.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.320
I'm doing a graph paper
right here.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.350
So it looks something
like this.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.980
It would look something
like this.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.560
It would look something
like this.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.090
And so you can imagine the
skewed graph paper, if I did

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.740
it all over the place
with this kind of

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.160
green and this blue.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.390
So in our new coordinate system,
we're seeing 3, 2.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.690
So that means 3 times our first
direction, which happens

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.950
to be the v1 direction.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.490
It's no longer the horizontal
direction.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.680
It's the v1 direction.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:18.500
We're going 1, 2, and then
we go 3, like that.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.470
And then we're going to go
2 in the v2 direction.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:26.260
So we're going to go 1,
2 in the v2 direction.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.110
And so our point is going
to be right there.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.250
You could imagine
going like this.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.390
You go 3 in the v1 direction,
and then you go 1, 2 in the v2

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.900
direction and you get
to our point.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.980
Or you could go, kind of in
your v2 direction and then

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.250
your v1 direction, but either
way you're going to get to

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.680
your original point.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.570
So that vector, or the position
specified by the

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.930
vector, 8, 7, could just as
easily be specified in our new

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.180
coordinate system by the
coordinates 3, 2.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.980
Because we're saying 3 times v1,
and then, plus 3 times v1.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.180
It takes us in this direction.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.850
We're going 3 notches in the v1
direction, and then we're

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.570
going 2 notches in
the v2 direction.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:13.430
And so that's why these are
called coordinates.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.690
You're literally saying how
many spaces in the v1

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.430
direction to go, and then how
many spaces in the v2

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.250
direction to go.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.460
But this might, I guess, lead
you to the obvious question.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.280
Why haven't we been using
the coordinates before?

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.640
Like I might have been
saying all along.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.470
I've been saying all along.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.660
Let's say I have some vector
lowercase b, that is equal to,

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.380
I don't know, let's say it's
equal to-- I'll do it in an

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.640
R2, just because it's easy to
visualize-- let's say it's

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.630
equal to 3 minus 1.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.240
If we were to graph
it it would look

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.480
something like this.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.490
We would go, 1, 2, 3, and
then we would go down 1.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.220
So it would look something
like this.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.970
It would specify this point.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.310
But why have we been calling 3
and negative 1 coordinates?

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.110
Why have we been calling 3
and minus 1 coordinates?

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.630
We've been doing it
well before we

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.490
learned linear algebra.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.440
We called these coordinates all
the way from when we first

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.370
learned how to graph.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.680
Why are we calling those
coordinates?

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.820
Or how does this meeting of
coordinates relate to these

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.030
coordinates with respect
to a basis?

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.560
Well, these are coordinates
with respect to a basis.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.100
These are actually coordinates
with respect to

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.670
the standard basis.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.630
If you imagine, let's see,
the standard basis in

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.680
R2 looks like this.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.530
We could have e1, which
is 1, 0, and we have

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.680
e2, which is 0, 1.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.755
This is just the convention for
the standard basis in R2.

00:13:43.755 --> 00:13:53.100
And so we could say s is equal
to the set of e1 and e2.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:14:06.055
Then we say that s is the
standard basis for R2.

00:14:06.055 --> 00:14:09.080
And it's a standard basis
because these two guys are

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.180
orthogonal.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.470
This is 1 in the horizontal
direction.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.130
This is 1 in the vertical
direction.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:22.130
And any vector in R2-- let's say
I have some vector x, y in

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:32.440
R2-- it's going to be equal to
x times e1, plus y times e2.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:39.900
So we can say that if you want
to write some vector x, y, if

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.600
you wanted to write with respect
to this standard basis

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:53.770
right here, it's going to be
equal to the coordinates by

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.270
the definition that we did
earlier in this video of the

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.600
basis vectors right there.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.250
Or these weights on our e1's and
e2's, so it's going to be

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.010
equal to, well the weight
there is x and the

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.780
weight here is y.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.410
So these coordinates that we've
been talking about from

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.820
the get-go, these are definitely
coordinates.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.400
They're consistent with our
definition of coordinates in

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.300
this video.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.180
But we can maybe be a little
bit more precise.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:25.930
We can now call them the
coordinates with respect to

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.480
the standard basis.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.700
Or we could call them, we could
call these right here

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.950
the standard coordinates.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.910
I just wanted to
point this out.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.600
This might be almost trivially
simple, or a bit obvious.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.370
But I just wanted to show that
our old usage of the word

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.210
coordinates was not inconsistent
with this new

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:58.560
definition of coordinates as
being the weights on some

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.610
basis vectors.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.290
Because even in our old
coordinates, or the old way we

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.970
used them, these really
were weights on our

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.270
standard basis vectors.
