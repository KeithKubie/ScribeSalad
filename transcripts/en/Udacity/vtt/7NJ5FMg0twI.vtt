00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.800
Welcome back, in the first two lessons
you learned how to build great inputs.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.960
In the last lesson you
practiced building great force.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.480
Along the way you probably noticed
that building great experiences for

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.280
your mobile users has been
a major theme of this course.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.150
&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's because it can be
a lot more difficult to build the really

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.970
fantastic experience for them.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.400
When users choose to
interact with you app,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.450
it should respond to that touch
in intuitive and beautiful ways.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.840
And that's what you'll
learn in this lesson.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.520
&gt;&gt; You'll fix a few sites that badly
need your help with some better

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.630
touch events.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.730
And at the end of it you'll be
given this courses project.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.320
If you feel like you need more practice
designing websites for mobile, I highly

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.850
recommend checking out the course called
Responsive Web Design Fundamentals.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.130
Which I teach alongside Etos
colleague from Google Pete Lepage.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.500
You can find a link to it
in the instructor notes.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.760
&gt;&gt; Great, first thing first, I want
you to see why touch events matter.
