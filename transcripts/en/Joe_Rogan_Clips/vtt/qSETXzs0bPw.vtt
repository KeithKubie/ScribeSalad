1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
Dogs my whole life.
And one of the things that you do kind of notice,

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.410
I right now have a golden retriever.
We have,
uh,
we,
yeah,
we have a white lab.
Yeah.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.930
Yeah.
Yellow lab.
And uh,

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:14.230
I've had a bunch of different dogs mastiffs and pit bulls and German shepherds.

5
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:16.540
No small.
We have a docs in,
you don't have small Dah.

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.090
My oldest daughter has a tiny Chihuahua.
It's the [inaudible].
No,

7
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.100
he's the best bark all the time.
Now.
He doesn't bark that much.

8
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.800
He bought us a little bit,
but he's,
he's really smart.
He's actually a Mutt.

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.150
He's Chihuahua and Australian shepherd,
but he's like that big tiny,

10
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.610
tiny little thing.
He's the best.
But,
um,
um,

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.340
my point being is that you can see if you get a dog from a breeder,

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180
you really can see how they can cultivate certain types of behavior.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.930
Like a good example of my mass diff who passed away this year.

14
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.230
He came from this guy who bred dogs for films and for police training.

15
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.110
And uh,
he was the most calm,
most chilled out dog I've ever had in my life.

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.800
He was just a giant dog is 140 pounds,
but he,

17
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:04.920
you could have them taken anywhere and trust him with a baby and he was like,

18
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:07.510
hello?
Like everything was totally,

19
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.020
but this guy purposely,

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.830
anytime a dog showed any aggression towards people or any aggression towards

21
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:14.664
dogs,
he wouldn't let them.

22
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.910
<v 1>So how can anyone not hear the stories like that or no stories like that and not</v>

23
00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:21.370
then also think that genes play a role in human behavior.

24
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.850
<v 0>Oh,
they,
you have children.
Yes.
You realize it when you have children,</v>

25
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:29.740
you see it like,
okay,
this is not,
I didn't do this.
This is,
this comes from me.

26
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.000
Yes.
There's certain traits that my children have that I watch and I go,
okay,

27
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:38.310
this is not this.
I didn't teach them.
They just started.
They were born this way.

28
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.540
I've got my fucked up brain.
You know,

29
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.050
there's something in there like they're not seeing the light.

30
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.830
They don't see how crazy I am.
It turns by her whole heart.
I work working things,

31
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.090
how obsessive I get with things they're just doing.
And it's very weird.

32
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.450
It's very weird because you see it,
you're like,
oh well,
okay,

33
00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:58.120
well how much of this shit that's in me is,
well,

34
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.210
how much of me is me deciding to be this person and how much of me has no

35
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:07.570
choice?
About half and half.
I would say overall on average across traits,

36
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.020
how much do you think gets passed down through genetics?

37
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:15.730
In terms of inclinations?
Like like the niche positions?

38
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.593
Yeah,

39
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.450
<v 1>half on average.
So for example,
about half the Wii,</v>

40
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.030
you know how religious you are or how risk averse you are.
Like I can,

41
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.440
I can about half the variation and how if you look at a group of people and some

42
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:30.610
are more risk averse than others,

43
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:33.670
about about half of that has to do with their genes and half has to do with how

44
00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:37.240
they were raised or what environments they grew up in.
So you know,

45
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:41.380
there's a kind of innateness to many of our qualities and you can shape them.

46
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.050
You know,
for example,
you can't,
you couldn't make me a musician.

47
00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:47.650
Unfortunately I have almost no musical talent.
I can dance,
I think.
I mean,

48
00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:50.740
I think others would even say that I can do that.
Uh,
but,
um,

49
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.640
so it's not just like I think I can dance,
but I can't.
Uh,
but I,

50
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.320
I have no musical ability whatsoever.
I would say I'm tone deaf and,
and you know,

51
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.540
I can appreciate,
I like I,
but I can't produce it.

52
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.790
There's no way you could train me,
I don't think to be a musician.
Um,
but,

53
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.240
um,
so some of it is inborn and some of it is,
is a,

54
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.620
is taught for all of these qualities.
Yes.
It's a fascinating thing to watch.

55
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.850
It emerge from a child,
isn't it?
Yes.
As a parent,
you see where it comes from.

56
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:21.730
Although we have adopted,
like,
I,
um,

57
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.810
my mother had three biological children and I have two adopted siblings that

58
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.460
come from actually a multiracial family.

59
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:29.380
I have a black sister and a Chinese brother.

60
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.540
And My mother was an incredible human being.
She died when I was a 25.

61
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:39.250
She was 47.
Uh,
and,
uh,
we have been foster parents,
my wife and I.

62
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.300
And so,
and we have lots of adopted kids in the extended family in addition to

63
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:47.800
biological kids.
And so you can see,
you can see the play of genes.

64
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:52.801
You can see the extent to which the kind of the inherited traits that these

65
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:58.120
people we all have.
And you see the shaping by how you're raised and you know,

66
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.510
so both are important.
And this is incidentally why if you ever have anyone,

67
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.820
it's not,
it's not nature or nurture.

68
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:08.110
It's both always almost in every single trait actually.
Well,

69
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:12.100
that's the case of so many things in this life.
We want everything to be binary.

70
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.480
Yes,
it's,
it's nuts.
It's a total,

71
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.141
we were talking earlier,

72
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:22.141
it's a total loss of nuance and an inability to see any gray and,

73
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.750
and,
and some people think,
and I think that's what you were talking about,

74
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.850
some people think that we are hardwired to like dichotomies to see,

75
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:31.420
you know,

76
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.420
male and female and an up and down and good and evil and left and right.

77
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.820
And to simplify the world by finding out.
And that we like it,

78
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:43.750
that it soothing to us to think that the world can be divided into two

79
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:45.910
categories.
Yes.
But in fact,

80
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:49.300
many times not always like up and down is sort of clear,

81
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.190
but many times it can't.
They're shades of gray and it's harder.

82
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.030
That's harder to live in the gray.
Yes.
I completely agree.

83
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.520
And that's why I've always been a po.
I mean,
I,

84
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.700
I think it's incredibly foolish to deny that,

85
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:08.030
but people find comfort in denying yes.
They find comfort in main tribal.
Yeah.

86
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.530
They find confidence in them.
US versus them.
This is the classic.
Yes,

87
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.740
yes,
yes.
It's,
it's a,
it's a simplified view of the world and it's,

88
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:19.900
it's foolish and dangerous actually.
Yeah.
Um,

89
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.490
now sometimes you're at war with an enemy,
you know,

90
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.400
it's me or him and uh,
or us or them,

91
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.520
there are circumstances in which it's a different survival.
Yes.

92
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.260
Survival of in that mode.
Yeah.
I get it.
But,
um,
but you know,

93
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:39.730
but I think the a kind of worldview which says we are good,
they are evil.

94
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.000
Um,
as we've been saying in different kinds of ways,

95
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:45.070
in different parts of our conversation is I think,

96
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.250
foolish and wrong and ultimately self-injurious.
Actually.
Um,

97
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.290
so.
