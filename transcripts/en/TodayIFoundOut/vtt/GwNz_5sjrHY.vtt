00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.309
Prized since ancient times for its alluring
fragrance, today musk can mean any of a number

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.120
of substances used to scent perfumes.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.090
However, while in our modern era most musk
is synthetically produced, when it first came

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.640
on the scene, musk was only found in a scrotum-like
sac on the bellies of male musk deer.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.340
Musk deer are found throughout Asia, including
in Afghanistan, China, India, Mongolia, Nepal,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.829
Pakistan and Siberia.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.550
Small, the largest barely reach 2 feet in
height and weigh no more than 40 pounds.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.950
The male of the species has a scent gland
sometimes called the musk pod that sits between

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.640
its belly button and genitalia.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.750
Resembling jiggly bits, early on the Sanskrit
speakers who started harvesting the gland

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.940
used their word for testicle, muska-s, to
refer to both the gland and its product.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.380
The first use for musk was in Auyervedic medicines,
the preparation of which required the gland

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.540
first be dried and then ground.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.610
At this point, it is said to have a sharp,
repulsive, animal smell with “ammonia accents

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.110
that resemble urine and castoreum.”

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.100
Eventually, however, it was learned that by
heavily diluting the stinky powder in alcohol,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.439
the bestial smell disappeared, which likely
made the medicine much more palatable.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.579
In addition to removing the animal stink,
the dilution also revealed an underlying pleasant,

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:26.729
complex aroma.

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.810
Making its way through ancient civilizations,
deer musk became highly prized and very expensive.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.650
By the dawn of the 19th century, pound for
pound, it cost more than twice that of gold.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.439
Later, as cheaper, synthetic substitutes became
available, they were likewise called musk.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.579
Today, musk is still harvested from musk deer,
and while the Convention on the International

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.979
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora
and Fauna (CITES) regulates their harvest,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130
poaching remains a problem.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.409
Other animal sources of that musky smell include
civet cats, sperm whales and beavers.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.359
For instance, secretions from beavers’ castor
sacks located next to their anal glands have

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.079
a musky/vanilla scent.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.590
This substance, called castoreum, is commonly
used in various perfumes, in some cases used

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.660
to create the “new car smell,” and used
in many foods as “natural flavoring,”

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.230
in substitute for vanilla.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.630
Certain non-dairy creamers are just one of
many foods that sometimes contain castoreum.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.630
Yum!

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.200
Another common musky additive to high end
perfumes is Ambergris.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.050
This begins as a large, compacted mass of
the indigestible parts of a squid and other

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.900
gross stuff in the intestines of a sperm whale.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.900
No one knows for sure how it emerges from
that dark, stinky interior, although the most

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.580
obvious explanation, poop, is the most popular.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.270
Floating on the ocean until it washes up on
shore, the best ambergris spends years oxidizing

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.380
from a combination of salt, air and sun.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.580
Prized for its unique scent, ambergris is
in high demand by perfume manufacturers and

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.580
the amorous alike.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.770
In fact, high quality ambergris can sell for
$20 per gram (about $9,000 per pound).

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.460
As you can imagine, there is a thriving industry
in ambergris hunting, and the competition

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.600
can be fierce.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:12.690
Luckily, there are other sources of musk available,
including plants like the Abelmoschus moschatus

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.490
and Amgelica archangelica, as well as several
chemical compounds including aromatic nitro

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.350
musks, polycyclic musks and macrocyclic musk.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.350
Some people lack sufficient amounts of an
enzyme, flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), such

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.860
that they cannot digest choline or convert
trimethylamine (an organic compound) found

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.260
in lots of common foods including red meat,
egg yolks, beans and fish.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.700
As a result, the compound, which smells strongly
of fish or B.O., accumulates in their bodies

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.700
and is released in their sweat.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.200
As you can imagine, this can be a socially
debilitating condition.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.830
Other conditions can also be diagnosed by
smell.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.970
Schizophrenics are said to sometimes sweat
out more trans-3-methyl hexenoic acid, which

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.250
gives them a super sweet smell, like over-ripened
fruit.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.740
Diphtheria is also said to have a sweet smell,
while typhoid is known to smell like bread

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.140
baking, and TB sometimes smells like beer.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.390
On the other hand, those with asthma and cystic
fibrosis can be diagnosed by the smell of

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.960
their breath, which is said to be a bit acidic.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.490
Liver and kidney diseases can make the breath
smell of fish, and untreated diabetes can

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.109
make it smell like rotten apples.

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.660
There’s even a condition named after maple
syrup where people can’t break down leucine,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.039
isoleucine and valine (all amino acids).

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.469
While on the up side, their pee smells like
breakfast, on the down side, in the most severest

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:41.499
forms the condition can cause intellectual
disability and even 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:52.809
brain damage.
