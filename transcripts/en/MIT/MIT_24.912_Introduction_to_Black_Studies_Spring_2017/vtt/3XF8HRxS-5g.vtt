00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.293
AUDIENCE: So first of all,
thank you for being here.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.095
We've talked about
immigration in the past.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.797
And with regard to
the Haitian refugees,

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:31.731
I think it also applies.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:32.899
And one of the
themes we studied,

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.969
I believe with
Professor Tormund was,

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.405
what's the actual reason that
people do not want immigrants

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.507
in the country versus the
reasons that they state?

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:44.044
So for example, one of the
reasons that people would state

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.379
would be that immigrants
are ruining the economy.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.514
But if you look at--

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.249
NOAM CHOMSKY: One of the
reasons why people stay?

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:50.483
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.584
One of the reasons that
people state that they don't

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:52.819
want immigrants in the country.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:53.553
NOAM CHOMSKY: Oh,
state that they--

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:54.521
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:55.522
Is because they
say that immigrants

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.689
will ruin the economy.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.958
But then, Professor Tormund
pointed out the fact

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.593
that Mayor Bloomberg
of New York,

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.729
or the former Mayor
Bloomberg of New York,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.897
said that New York could
not run without immigrants.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.068
So what do you think are the
actual reasons that people

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.270
do not want immigrants
in the country?

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.539
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, first of
all, it's not a new phenomenon.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.109
And it's not the United States.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:19.412
So for example, in
Europe, a majority

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.282
of the population
of Europe, majority,

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:28.288
thinks that Europe should not
permit any Muslim immigrants.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:31.658
Europe has a certain history.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.860
It's called crematoria,
for example.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.663
That's part of the background.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.898
And that's part of the
immigration background

00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:40.366
here, too.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.803
I can talk about it from a
very personal point of view.

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:50.210
My father happened to be able
to come to the United States

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.347
before fleeing from
Czarist Russia.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:58.618
Horrible conditions,
especially for Jews.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:03.256
He made it before the
Immigration Act of 1924.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:09.662
In 1924, Immigration Act for
the first time barred Europeans.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:13.233
Prior to that, there were
racist immigration acts,

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.002
like it kept out Orientals.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:18.771
But Europeans were admitted.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:21.141
And there was a very
simple reason for that.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:24.444
We were exterminating the
indigenous population.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.546
So there was a
lot of open space.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:30.450
That's what you see
glorified in stories

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.720
about covered wagons going
to the West-- the pioneers.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.990
Of course, they were
displacing some people

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.759
who happened to live there,
but it's another story.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.561
Anyway, there was an open--

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.228
the continent was
open after you've

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.465
exterminated the population.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:48.234
And you want the right
kind of people to come in.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.171
And if you go back, the question
of the right kind of people

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.039
was quite delicate.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.175
So for example,
Benjamin Franklin,

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:59.579
who was the leading figure of
the Enlightenment in the United

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:04.717
States, he thought we should
have discriminatory immigration

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.520
rules to keep out the
wrong kind of people.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.689
People who were too dark.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:14.394
And the people who were too
dark were Swedes and Germans.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.396
That's Benjamin Franklin.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.463
So we got to watch out.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.465
Keep out Germans and Swedes.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:20.966
They're too siwrly.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.869
But that was finally relaxed.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.005
Anyway, they needed
Europeans to come in.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:29.576
By the beginning of
the 20th century,

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:33.980
they didn't need immigrants
any longer to fill the country.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.152
And the constant racism emerged.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:44.490
So the 1924 Act was--

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:48.328
in reality, it was based
against Jews and Italians.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:51.097
What they said is East
and Southern Europeans.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:53.700
But that meant
Jews and Italians.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.235
Well, OK.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:58.905
What happened to
the Jews who were

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:02.075
unable to come until the 1960s?

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:06.112
They ended up in concentration
camps and crematoria.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:07.847
So it's a serious issue.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:11.451
That's most of my
family, incidentally.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:14.754
The ones who didn't make it.

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:16.422
So the story goes way back.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:18.124
It's not something new.

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.125
And it's not just
the United States.

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.767
Western society generally is
infected by very deep racism.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:31.137
And it's even more extreme
in many ways in Europe

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:33.072
than in the United States.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.241
In fact, in Europe, it's
even more frightening

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.010
than the United States.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.411
So take this
morning's newspaper,

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.281
if you happened to look at it.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:44.817
The government of Austria--

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.386
there was a
coalition government,

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.554
but it wasn't able to
have an agreement, so they

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.523
have to have an election.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:54.627
And the concern is that the
most popular figure in Austria

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:57.030
might win the election.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.198
He happens to be a neo-Nazi.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.000
That's Austria.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.671
There's a little bit
of history in Austria.

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.340
Well, that's scary.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.677
And it's happening all over.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:18.084
Here, it has a special character
because of white supremacy.

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:22.522
White supremacy is very deeply
rooted in the United States.

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:25.658
There are comparative
studies of white supremacy.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:29.562
The major ones by
George Fredrickson,

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:33.599
a good sociologist who
did a comparative study

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.469
of white supremacy
in many countries.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.238
It's more extreme in the
United States than any country

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.109
that he studied, including
South Africa under apartheid.

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.745
And you see it all
over the place.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:50.049
I mean, when the Nazis
in the early '30s

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:54.320
were trying to find models
for the Nuremberg laws,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.290
the racist laws, they
looked around the world.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.592
And the only country where
they could find good models

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.928
was the United States.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.730
They took US models.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.066
The US had miscegenation rules--

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:10.236
rules against
interracial marriage--

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:12.472
which lasted, in fact,
until they were finally

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:15.875
struck down in the 1960s.

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:19.946
The Nazis didn't
entirely take the US laws

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:23.216
because they regarded
the US laws as too harsh.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:29.989
So the US laws were based on the
concept of one drop of blood.

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.826
None of this means anything
from a biological point of view.

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.328
It's all totally meaningless.

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:40.332
But these are socially
constructed categories.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:43.770
And one drop of
blood meant if you--

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.607
by whatever category
was concocted,

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:52.145
you had one drop of Negro
blood, you're black.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.347
And then, you can't
marry a white.

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:57.750
Those were laws that were
not struck down, I think,

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.487
until 1967.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:05.858
And you see it all over
the place right now.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.228
I mean, it's right in
front of us all over.

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:14.600
In fact, if you look at
Afro American history

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.170
in the United States,
it's pretty remarkable.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.073
In fact, that's something
that really should be studied.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.943
The two topics that
should be studied

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:26.779
are, what happened to
the native population

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.449
and what happened to
the black population?

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:33.453
Anything else is secondary
for the United States.

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:34.921
Without going
through the details--

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.389
I presume you know them.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:39.192
But the first slaves
were brought here

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.595
in Massachusetts 400 years ago.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.430
That's 400 years.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.365
You look over those
400 years, there

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.969
have been literally
a few decades.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:56.409
Maybe 30 years scattered in
which African Americans had

00:07:56.509 --> 00:08:00.346
kind of a small opportunity
to enter the general society.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.981
That's quite a record.

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:04.116
And, of course,
it has a residue.

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:09.789
The residue shows in things
like mortality, wealth.

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:14.093
The wealth of African American
families is virtually zero.

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:17.864
What there was, was pretty
much destroyed by the crash.

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:23.035
It shows up in, why are
there murders in ghettos

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:25.905
in Chicago and Baltimore?

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:26.973
It's not the genes.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:32.278
Everywhere you look, you see it.

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:33.913
And it shows up.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.948
Going back to your
question, it shows up

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:41.187
in the racist immigration
laws, which are bad enough now.

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.956
But the ones that
were enacted in 1924

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:47.226
and maintained right
through the Holocaust,

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:48.394
those were pretty serious.

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:53.299
In fact, you probably
know the stories.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:58.604
But ships were turned
away bringing refugees

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:01.107
who thought they could make it.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.576
There's some strange
stories if you look at it.

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:04.810
They're kind of suppressed.

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:10.182
But one quite
interesting story--

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.485
it's worth looking at if
you're interested-- has

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.453
to do with Japan.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:19.091
The Japanese fascists
were kind of--

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.932
only had limited understanding
of the Western world.

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:28.100
Japan had been pretty isolated.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.372
So the fascist leaders, the
generals in Japan in the 1930s,

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:36.142
were pretty much
influenced by Germany.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:41.647
And they read German
propaganda, Nazi propaganda,

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.450
about how Jews are
running the world.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.387
And they were very eager to get
the Americans off their back.

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:51.390
They didn't want a conflict
with the United States.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.225
So they concluded
that the way to get

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:55.361
the Americans off
their back is by doing

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.496
something nice for the Jews.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:01.834
And this, in fact, fit
with Japanese history.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.904
Because in the early
part of the 20th century,

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:07.640
there was a Russo-Japanese war.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.677
And wealthy Jews who
were very anti-Russian--

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.913
because Russia was
very anti-Semitic--

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:17.049
were funding and
supporting the Japanese.

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:20.519
Jacob Schiff and others.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.389
Japan considered that that
was part of the reason why

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:25.191
they were able to win the war.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.959
So they had their
own connections

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:29.295
with the international
Jewish conspiracy

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.664
that runs the world that
they were picking up

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:33.599
from Nazi propaganda.

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:37.870
So they concluded that the way
to mollify the United States

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:44.176
was to bring Jews from
Eastern Europe to Japan.

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:48.914
And there was a period
of the Nazi Russian pact

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.783
where people could move.

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:53.219
And in fact, there was
a considerable number

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:58.024
of Polish Jews, very
orthodox Polish Jews.

00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:04.263
The kind you see with
black hats and white shirts

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:06.198
and you know, all of this.

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:10.770
They were brought
from Poland to Japan,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.072
which was a feudal society.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.708
The cultural contact
was incredible.

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:18.377
There's all sorts of
interesting stories about it.

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.047
But the point here
is that the Japanese

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:25.317
assumed that if they brought
Polish Jews to Japan,

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:28.888
the American Jewish community
would welcome them here.

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:31.357
They didn't want them to
stay in Japan, of course.

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:33.793
They thought they'd go
on to the United States.

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:35.761
They stayed in Japan.

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:39.432
Nobody wanted them here,
including the Jewish community.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.667
And there's plenty
of stories like that.

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:46.939
As soon as you start to
lift the veil very slightly,

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:48.407
you find it everywhere.
