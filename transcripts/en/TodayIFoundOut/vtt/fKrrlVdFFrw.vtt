00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.810
Who was the wealthiest person in every century?

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.970
That was a question we tried to answer in
a previous TIFO article.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.510
While it was an incredibly difficult question
to get definitive answers to, it did reveal

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.720
that the wealthiest private entity in the
19th century was actually not a person – but

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.720
a family.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.720
The Rothschild family, descendants of Mayer
A. Rothschild, is still around today and is

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.609
believed to be worth over a trillion dollars
combined, thought to be the largest private

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.160
fortunate in the history of the world.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.470
Who are the Rothschilds exactly and how did
they amass this tremendous fortune?

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.321
Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the patriarch of
the Rothschild fortune, was born in 1744 in

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:45.950
a Jewish ghetto in Frankfurt, Germany.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.730
When his father passed away, Mayer was still
young, but he took over the family’s currency-exchange

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.730
business.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.870
The work required Mayer to know a lot about
different kinds of money, currency, and coins

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.420
and, soon, he became an expert in rare and
old coins.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.460
To supplement the business, he became a rare
coins dealer.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.270
Now, it just so happened that the Crown Prince
of Hesse (a territory in Germany) was an avid

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.630
rare coin collector.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.390
Upon hearing of Mayer’s immense collection,
he approached him and they made several deals.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.780
The deals went so favorably that in a matter
of years, when the Crown Prince became William

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.029
IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (essentially
governor of the region, under the rule of

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:26.479
the Holy Roman Emperor who was Joseph II at
the time), he hired Mayer Rothschild to be

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.939
the “Hoffaktor” of his considerable fortune.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.079
A thorough description of the position of
“Hoffaktor” is probably worth a TodayIFoundOut

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.170
article by itself, but it essentially translates
to “court Jew.”

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.140
While politically incorrect today, it was
quite a favorable, honorable, powerful, and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.340
well-paid position.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.189
Essentially, a Hoffaktor was a Jewish banker
who dealt with the finances, tax-collecting,

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.419
and money lending in regards to European royalty;
something close to what a high-priced accountant

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:54.599
would do today.

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.749
This began the Rothschilds’ rise to unparalleled
fortune.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.189
Mayer’s international financial influence
continued to rise through the French Revolution

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.429
(1789-1799) when he handled virtually all
of the financial aspects of the war.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.129
As put by Count Corti in the book The Rise
of the House of Rothschild, “Every government

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.420
wanted money: there were loans to be raised,
exchanges to be negotiated, armies to be clothed

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.420
and fed.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.030
Wherever there were business to be done, there
were the Rothschild with their offers and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.110
quotations.”

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.239
By 1800, Rothschild was one of the ten wealthiest
men in Frankfurt.

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.860
He also had had five sons, each taking up
the family business.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.890
When they got old enough, they were strategically
situated across Europe, bringing their wealth,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.110
expertise, and family connections with them.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.390
This is how many historians have speculated
that the Rothschilds were able to keep their

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.069
wealth when so many other prominent families
lost it during these turbulent times in Europe..

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.680
With a “judicious selection of points of
vantage,” the Rothschild brothers were stationed

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.439
in Frankfurt, London, Naples, Paris, and Vienna,
each “becoming indispensable to his adopted

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.930
country,” yet working together with the
family to ensure maximum profit.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.329
Their only true allegiance was to the Rothschild
name.

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.150
In 1812, Mayer Rothschild passed away, but
not before assuring the continued fortune

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.470
of the family for centuries to come by carefully
arranging marriages for his sons, often to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.849
cousins, keeping everything within the family
to ensure the wealth never left (similar to

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:20.849
royal intermarriages).

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:21.849
(Interestingly, contrary to popular belief,
genetically speaking, cousin marriages aren’t

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:22.849
nearly as bad as is often made out.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:23.849
See: The Truth About Cousins and Marriage)

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.170
The European wars of the early 19th century
furthered the Rothschild’s wealth and influence.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.040
Nathan Mayer Rothschild was the most cunning,
savvy, richest and possibly dishonest of the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.769
famed five Rothschild brothers.

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.549
Historians argue the morality behind his methods
– and what are true stories and what were

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.690
made up due to jealousy and sometimes antisemitism
– but the result remained the same – he

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.970
became exorbitantly rich.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.319
Stationed in London (as part of his father
Mayer’s business plan) when the Napoleonic

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.810
Wars officially broke out in 1803, he single-handedly
helped finance the Duke of Wellington and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.230
his opposition to France.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.967
He arranged shipments of bullion (refined,
melted, and rare metals shaped into coins

00:03:55.967 --> 00:03:58.829
or bars) to armies across Europe that were
fighting France.

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.430
He also used the Rothschild network across
Europe, a system of couriers, agents, information

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.480
gatherers (and, as legend had it, carrier
pigeons) who fed him news of the war, at times,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.109
a full day ahead of the government knowing.

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.159
This allowed him to spread rumors of losses,
when he knew full well that Britain and her

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.450
armies had won.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.269
He could depress stock prices and, when people
panicked, he bought.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.840
The most well-known example of this was pertaining
to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.669
Rumors ran rampant that Britain had lost the
crucial battle, causing markets to crash.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.120
When word came back that it was Napoleon who
had suffered a terrible defeat, it was Nathan

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.560
Mayer Rothschild who reaped the enormous benefits
from previously buying stock and bonds at

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.870
depressed prices.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.870
This was speculation and insider trading at
its finest, practices that would no doubt

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.449
find him in prison today in many nations.

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.520
As with many extremely rich industrialists
of the 19th and 20th century (i.e. Rockefeller,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.490
Carnegie, etc.), while their practices may
have not held to the highest of moral standards,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.560
they did use their power and money for good
causes as well.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.139
Nathan Rothschild was known as an abolitionist,
working toward eradicating the slave trade

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.139
in Britain.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.660
For instance, it is said he helped finance
the twenty million pounds (about £1.7 billion

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.930
today or $2.6 billion) needed to buy out British
plantations, as well as the passing of the

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.479
Slavery Abolition Act of 1833.

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.190
Through the 19th century, the Rothschild’s
wealth continued to grow.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.569
Nathan had seven children, including four
sons (sons were the ones that carried on the

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:28.720
family business).

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.729
His son Lionel became the first Jewish person
to be elected into the House of Commons in

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.550
Britain, though, previous to this Jews were
supposed to be barred from it.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.879
In order to get around this, the Prime Minister
John Russell introduced and got passed the

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.750
Jewish Relief Act of 1858, taking away this
restriction.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.500
He had a social conscience as well, helping
to finance relief for Irish famine victims.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.480
As the years rolled by and the 19th century
turned into the 20th, the Rothschilds continued

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.380
to be among the wealthiest and most influential
bankers in the world.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.080
Nathan Rothschild, better known as Lord Rothschild,
began issuing loans to countries beyond Europe,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.520
most notably the US.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.760
Beyond banking, the Rothschilds are also well
known in the world of wine and art collecting.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.230
In the late 19th century, the Lord Rothschild
arranged for the purchase of several estates

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.230
in France.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.509
They became world-renown vineyards and, to
this day, Rothschild wine is among the most

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:22.620
expensive in the world.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.629
As for art collecting, the Lord Rothschild
and his brother, Albert, were avid collectors

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:31.930
and buyers of works of art, filling their
enormous homes with priceless paintings, provocative

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.760
sculptures, French furniture, china, and scientific
equipment.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.220
Said the Baroness Bettina der Rothschild to
the New York Times in 1999 about her great

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.720
uncle the Lord Rothschild, “It was Nathaniel
who especially loved buying scientific instruments.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.590
Who could ever think that microscopes were
beautiful, but these were.”

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.159
These collections were hailed across Europe
and the envy of many.

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:58.750
However, in March of 1938, within 24 hours
of Hitler’s SS Army “annexing” Austria,

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.439
Nazis stripped the Rothschild’s homes in
the region of all their priceless possessions.

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:06.330
With the intention of putting the collection
on display in his own proposed Hitler Museum

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.949
in Linz, Austria (Hitler’s hometown), Hitler
had all the art hidden away in a ski resort

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:11.979
high in the Alps.

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:16.139
The massive collection was finally discovered
by American GIs after the war.

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:22.319
It took 54 years (1999) before the Austrian
government decided to give the art back to

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:25.979
their rightful owners, the descendants of
the Rothschild family.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:30.060
Many of these works were hanging in Austrian
museums prior to this, despite the knowledge

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.110
that they had been stolen during the war.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.319
However, months after receiving most of the
art back, the Rothschild family decided to

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.069
donate or sell nearly all of the collection.

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:43.040
Said Baroness Bettina der Rothschild at the
time, “But it just doesn’t make sense

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.040
to keep them.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.580
We all live very differently today than my
parents did.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.270
Not only are the security questions terrifying
and the insurance costs prohibitive, but this

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:56.479
type of 18th-century French furniture needs
a butler and two housemaids constantly polishing

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:57.479
it.

00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:58.479
That’s just not the way we live.”

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:02.270
They’ve also in the last century or so donated
several amazing estates, such as the Waddesdon

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.270
Manor and the Schloss Hinterleiten.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.270
Who was the wealthiest person in every century?

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.270
That was a question we tried to answer in
a previous TIFO article.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.270

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.270

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:47.919
wealth when so many other prominent families
lost it during these turbulent times in Europe..

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:48.919
With a “judicious selection of points of
vantage,” the Rothschild brothers were stationed

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:49.919
in Frankfurt, London, Naples, Paris, and Vienna,
each “becoming indispensable to his adopted

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:50.919
country,” yet working together with the
family to ensure maximum profit.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:51.919
Their only true allegiance was to the Rothschild
name.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:52.919
In 1812, Mayer Rothschild passed away, but
not before assuring the continued fortune

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:53.919
of the family for centuries to come by carefully
arranging marriages for his sons, often to

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:54.919
cousins, keeping everything within the family
to ensure the wealth never left (similar to

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:55.919
royal intermarriages).

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:56.919
(Interestingly, contrary to popular belief,
genetically speaking, cousin marriages aren’t

00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:57.919
nearly as bad as is often made out.

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:58.919
See: The Truth About Cousins and Marriage)

00:08:58.919 --> 00:08:59.919
The European wars of the early 19th century
furthered the Rothschild’s wealth and influence.

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:00.919
Nathan Mayer Rothschild was the most cunning,
savvy, richest and possibly dishonest of the

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:01.919
famed five Rothschild brothers.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:02.919
Historians argue the morality behind his methods
– and what are true stories and what were

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:03.919
made up due to jealousy and sometimes antisemitism
– but the result remained the same – he

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:04.919
became exorbitantly rich.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:05.919
Stationed in London (as part of his father
Mayer’s business plan) when the Napoleonic

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:06.919
Wars officially broke out in 1803, he single-handedly
helped finance the Duke of Wellington and

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:07.919
his opposition to France.

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:08.919
He arranged shipments of bullion (refined,
melted, and rare metals shaped into coins

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:09.919
or bars) to armies across Europe that were
fighting France.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:10.919
He also used the Rothschild network across
Europe, a system of couriers, agents, information

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:11.919
gatherers (and, as legend had it, carrier
pigeons) who fed him news of the war, at times,

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:12.919
a full day ahead of the government knowing.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:13.919
This allowed him to spread rumors of losses,
when he knew full well that Britain and her

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:14.919
armies had won.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:15.919
He could depress stock prices and, when people
panicked, he bought.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:16.919
The most well-known example of this was pertaining
to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:17.919
Rumors ran rampant that Britain had lost the
crucial battle, causing markets to crash.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:18.919
When word came back that it was Napoleon who
had suffered a terrible defeat, it was Nathan

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:19.919
Mayer Rothschild who reaped the enormous benefits
from previously buying stock and bonds at

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:20.919
depressed prices.

00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:21.919
This was speculation and insider trading at
its finest, practices that would no doubt

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:22.919
find him in prison today in many nations.

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:23.919
As with many extremely rich industrialists
of the 19th and 20th century (i.e. Rockefeller,

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:24.919
Carnegie, etc.), while their practices may
have not held to the highest of moral standards,

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:25.919
they did use their power and money for good
causes as well.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:26.919
Nathan Rothschild was known as an abolitionist,
working toward eradicating the slave trade

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:27.919
in Britain.

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:28.919
For instance, it is said he helped finance
the twenty million pounds (about £1.7 billion

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:29.919
today or $2.6 billion) needed to buy out British
plantations, as well as the passing of the

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:30.919
Slavery Abolition Act of 1833.

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:31.919
Through the 19th century, the Rothschild’s
wealth continued to grow.

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:32.919
Nathan had seven children, including four
sons (sons were the ones that carried on the

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:33.919
family business).

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:34.919
His son Lionel became the first Jewish person
to be elected into the House of Commons in

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:35.919
Britain, though, previous to this Jews were
supposed to be barred from it.

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:36.919
In order to get around this, the Prime Minister
John Russell introduced and got passed the

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:37.919
Jewish Relief Act of 1858, taking away this
restriction.

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:38.919
He had a social conscience as well, helping
to finance relief for Irish famine victims.

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:39.919
As the years rolled by and the 19th century
turned into the 20th, the Rothschilds continued

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:40.919
to be among the wealthiest and most influential
bankers in the world.

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:41.919
Nathan Rothschild, better known as Lord Rothschild,
began issuing loans to countries beyond Europe,

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:42.919
most notably the US.

00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:43.919
Beyond banking, the Rothschilds are also well
known in the world of wine and art collecting.

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:44.919
In the late 19th century, the Lord Rothschild
arranged for the purchase of several estates

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:45.919
in France.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:46.919
They became world-renown vineyards and, to
this day, Rothschild wine is among the most

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:47.919
expensive in the world.

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:48.919
As for art collecting, the Lord Rothschild
and his brother, Albert, were avid collectors

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:49.919
and buyers of works of art, filling their
enormous homes with priceless paintings, provocative

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:50.919
sculptures, French furniture, china, and scientific
equipment.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:51.919
Said the Baroness Bettina der Rothschild to
the New York Times in 1999 about her great

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:52.919
uncle the Lord Rothschild, “It was Nathaniel
who especially loved buying scientific instruments.

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:53.919
Who could ever think that microscopes were
beautiful, but these were.”

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:54.919
These collections were hailed across Europe
and the envy of many.

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:55.919
However, in March of 1938, within 24 hours
of Hitler’s SS Army “annexing” Austria,

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:56.919
Nazis stripped the Rothschild’s homes in
the region of all their priceless possessions.

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:57.919
With the intention of putting the collection
on display in his own proposed Hitler Museum

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:58.919
in Linz, Austria (Hitler’s hometown), Hitler
had all the art hidden away in a ski resort

00:09:58.919 --> 00:09:59.919
high in the Alps.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:00.919
The massive collection was finally discovered
by American GIs after the war.

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:01.919
It took 54 years (1999) before the Austrian
government decided to give the art back to

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:02.919
their rightful owners, the descendants of
the Rothschild family.

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:03.919
Many of these works were hanging in Austrian
museums prior to this, despite the knowledge

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:04.919
that they had been stolen during the war.

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:05.919
However, months after receiving most of the
art back, the Rothschild family decided to

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:06.919
donate or sell nearly all of the collection.

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:07.919
Said Baroness Bettina der Rothschild at the
time, “But it just doesn’t make sense

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:08.919
to keep them.

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:09.919
We all live very differently today than my
parents did.

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:10.919
Not only are the security questions terrifying
and the insurance costs prohibitive, but this

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:11.919
type of 18th-century French furniture needs
a butler and two housemaids constantly polishing

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:12.919
it.

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:13.919
That’s just not the way we live.”

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:14.919
They’ve also in the last century or so donated
several amazing estates, such as the Waddesdon

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:15.919
Manor and the Schloss Hinterleiten.

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:16.919
Today, the Rothschild family still exists
and is still ridiculously rich (as mentioned

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:17.919
with a combined wealth estimated at over a
trillion dollars), though in recent times

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:18.919
tend on the whole to try to keep themselves
very low-profile, even with donations to charities.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:19.919
They also no longer focus as much on banking,
instead often focusing their energies on wine,

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:20.919
asset management, charity work, real estate,
and social activism, attempting to keep with

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:20.928
the family motto- Concordia Integritas Industria
(“Unity, Integrity, Entrepreneurship”).
