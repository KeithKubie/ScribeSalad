CHRIS: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.000
Thanks for coming.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.140
My name's Chris [? Wallen. ?]
I'm an engineer here at Google

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.780
on the Maps team.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.040
And I'm hosting today
Walter Voit and Srishti Goel

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.720
from Adaptive 3D
Technologies, and they're

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.720
going to give a
talk about what they

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.760
call their extreme 3D printing.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.180
So without further ado,
I present Walter Voit.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:27.500
WALTER VOIT: Thanks, Chris.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.580
It's a pleasure to be
back here at Google.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.500
As Chris mentioned,
I'm Walter Voit.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.360
We founded Adaptive
3D about two years ago

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.610
as a spin-out from a
company that I founded back

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.950
in grad school called
Syzygy Memory Plastics.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.700
In my spare time, I'm a
professor at UT Dallas

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.180
and run a research lab that
focuses in polymer chemistry,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.220
in flexible electronics,
in radiation processing

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.170
and materials, and looking
at fundamental interfaces

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080
of materials.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.350
And in this quest to
make better, stretchier,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.630
lighter, stronger
materials, we've

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.220
come up with some
really neat ways

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.250
to be able to build
them layer by layer

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.820
and make stronger,
tougher, 3D printed parts.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.670
Let's get right into it.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.500
So Adaptive started in 2014.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.650
Up here is our management team.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.740
I'm the president
for now until we

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530
find sort of a
seasoned management

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.090
team, for which we're looking.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.170
Srishti, who's here, just joined
the team a little while ago.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.130
She got her Material
Science degree at Columbia,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.980
and is leading a lot of
interactions with the companies

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.830
that we work with.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.240
Dr. Lund is an organic
chemist by training

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.730
who specializes in a lot of
our new synthetic monomers.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.130
Dan Patterson is
our first investor.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.680
He's a seasoned private
equity guy back in Dallas.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.840
He's bought and sold more
than 30 companies since 1993

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.765
and does a lot in the
middle market manufacturing

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:58.000
and business
logistics, and I think

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.850
has really come in and given
us a lot of experience.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.040
He was a Harvard MBA
guy from the late '70s.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.670
And finally, Brent Duncan.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.154
He was the co-founder with
me of Syzygy Memory Plastics.

00:02:09.154 --> 00:02:11.320
He and I were grad school
buddies from Georgia Tech.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.920
He was in the MBA program
and I was in the PhD Program.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.050
Brent also has a PhD in
Material Science and Engineering

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.285
from Duke University, and
spent some time with a nicotine

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:24.470
s startup company in
the Research Triangle.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.190
And then has been working
with a lot of technology

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.700
transfer back in Dallas for the
better part of the last half

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.430
decade.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.535
So what our mission and
what our job at Adaptive is,

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:38.840
is to really provide
services to large companies.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.410
We work primarily with
large Fortune 500 companies.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.730
Halliburton is our
first big, big customer.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.780
We've also engage
a number of others.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.890
And we're trying to build
parts that can't be made today

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.580
by conventional means.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.350
So let me get into what
that market opportunity is.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.410
In the past almost 25 years,
3D printing-- you guys

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.717
have probably heard it as a
buzz word, as a tech word--

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.300
and it means a lot
of different things

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.270
to a lot of different people.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.750
You can 3D print metals,
ceramics, plastics,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.780
so we're a niche.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.080
We're just focused on
plastics, and within the area

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.800
of plastics, we've focused on
soft, rubber-like materials,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.020
and viscoelastic
materials, materials

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.030
that have extreme toughness.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.860
3D printing has had a 25%
compounding annual growth rate

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.040
over the last 25
years or so, and it's

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.590
projected to serve as a critical
part of the $16 trillion

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.080
manufacturing economy by 2030.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.844
And you have to ask why that is.

00:03:43.844 --> 00:03:45.760
Well, a lot of the big
companies in our space,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.140
in the polymer space,
3D Systems and Stratasys

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.300
are two of the large players.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.140
And I think a lot of
market hype sort of caught

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.960
up and even
surpassed the expec--

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.420
or surpassed the reality
of where 3D printing was.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.650
If you look at a lot
of these stock prices,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.230
in 2014 there were
some pretty big peaks,

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.560
and things haven't been
so rosy on the market

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.290
side for 3D printers.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.010
And the reason is
because companies

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.780
have been unable to 3D print
high value industrial parts.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.209
A lot of 3D printers and
3D printing companies,

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.730
we like to call the
Kickstarter babies,

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.440
have come out with
the shock and awe.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.600
The hey, let's print something
really quickly, or let's print

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.320
some really complex widgets.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.610
But a lot of the back
end market reporting

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.460
from Wohlers and
from other sources

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.700
has identified this giant
additive manufacturing market

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.630
as the real value add.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.632
It's the idea that you
can print materials.

00:04:39.632 --> 00:04:41.840
That if you print this first
layer, the second layer,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.480
the third layer,
the fourth layer,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.030
they need to be as strong
in this x-direction

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.150
or this y-direction as they
are in this z-direction.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.570
And a lot of parts suffer from
this problem called anisotropy,

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.520
not the same in all directions.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.600
And so with our background
in understanding polymers

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.470
and polymer physics,
we've focused

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.350
on printing isotropically
tough parts,

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.440
and have found really
neat ways to chemically

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.980
cross-link plastics
in this direction,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.710
as well as in this direction
to make them strong and tough.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.340
And in a little
bit I'll show some

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.590
of the materials properties,
some of the stress strain

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.310
curves.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.040
I don't get too
nerdy and techie,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.840
but that's sort of the
limiting problem that's

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.210
kept these kinds of
materials from being

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.520
a solution to
industrial problems.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.180
Today, a lot of 3D printed
parts are used to print molds,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.410
to print jigs, and then you'll
do conventional manufacturing

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.260
in those 3D printed molds.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.570
But it's difficult to print
a rubber, to print a plastic,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.550
and have that go
into an automobile,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.360
have that go into
an oil well, have

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.960
that go into a tennis shoe,
have that go into a spaceship.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.760
And so, what we're
looking at doing

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.840
is solving that problem
for a subset of materials.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.050
So today less than 29%
of 3D printed parts

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.660
are used for functional
parts, and the market

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.120
is just a fraction of
what it could become.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.340
So what have we done
over at Adaptive

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.280
to print these tough, high
quality rubbers and plastics?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.010
Well, we've focused on
very scalable solutions.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.350
So while we are synthetic,
organic chemists at root,

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.280
we've tried to limit the
design and manufacture of brand

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.230
new monomers.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.670
But we use things that we can
source from large chemical

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.560
manufacturers that can be
scaled to meet a large market.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.810
We've developed a very
nice patent portfolio.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.460
A lot of the research has
been translated from research

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.010
at the University
of Texas at Dallas.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.740
But we've been able
to build materials

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.160
with incredible strain
capacity, things

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.830
that can stretch five
times their original size

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.640
and then snap back into shape.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.090
Or things today that have a
toughness of 16 megajoules

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.150
per meter cubed, and some
experimental materials that

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.840
are far greater than that.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.270
And I'll get more into those
details in a little bit.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.890
We also tune a lot of
the important properties

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.870
for 3D printed parts.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.310
We've developed a new kind of
3D printer to make our polymers,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.780
following a process called
SLA or stereo lithography.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.580
But we've used Texas
Instruments DLP projectors.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.990
You might have
seen the ads, it's

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.042
the little mirrors, little girls
with elephants running around.

00:07:11.042 --> 00:07:12.750
Maybe you've got home
theater projectors.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.630
I don't know if this is a DLP
projector, but it probably is.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.570
But what we can do is
we can focus light.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.920
These mirrors will
actuate at about 6,000 Hz,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.850
and so we can turn light on
and off very controllably, very

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.160
selectively, and
we designed resins

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.340
that can be selectively
photopolymerized.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.460
And we can very rapidly
print layer after layer,

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.480
and print a whole layer
at once at the resolution

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.880
of SLA technology.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.370
So most of these
mirrors are spaced out

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.310
about 16 microns apart
in one of the machines

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.010
by the time you have your
throw angle down onto a part.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.580
It's a little larger
than that, so in x and y

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.800
we've got feature sizes in
the 20 to 75 micron range.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.740
And then in the
z-axis we can make

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:03.870
that as finely resolute as we'd
like, or as large as we'd like.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.500
And that dictates a lot of
the print speed of our parts.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.250
We've come up with
some really interesting

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.080
post-processing techniques.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.500
A part of our process
involved only partially

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.880
curing this layer, so that
when the next layer comes on,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.570
we get this full
chemical covalent cure.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.180
And so we've got
some very interesting

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.620
post-processing steps that
help solidify these properties.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.180
But at the end of the day,
instead of providing materials,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.910
or providing
printers, we're really

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.620
working with large companies
to provide solutions

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.429
to underlying problems.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.419
So for instance, with
Halliburton, they've

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.110
got some needs for very
specific geometries

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.280
in their downhole
completions team.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.330
So they need plastic
parts that can essentially

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.830
help keep wells open
or help close up wells.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.210
We need parts that have
a high strain capacity,

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.130
but have a high
toughness, and have

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.240
to be in pretty complex shapes.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.540
And so those are the kinds of
things that we like to tackle.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.690
So what we can do is
we can replace polymers

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.490
where you'd normally
use rubbers,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.615
nylons, for a host
of different markets

00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:06.990
that you see pictured here.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.050
And by controlling the
monomer concentration, some

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.520
of the processing
characteristics,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.780
and a host of the additives,
we've got a huge range.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.934
As you can see up here
in the little profile,

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:19.350
we've got a lot
of different parts

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.170
that I'll play around with.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.230
One of the things that
we spend a lot of time on

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.020
is we play with internal
structure in 3D printed parts.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.780
So here you'll see
six little wafers

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.990
of the exact same material,
but the effective stiffness

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.260
of these materials
ranges dramatically.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.590
So here's something
that's fairly stiff,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.570
but it's also not very dense.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.030
It's got near the
stiffness of a solid part,

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.510
but because of how this
lattice structure is created,

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.850
a lot of the stresses
are translated linearly

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.880
through the part, and so we've
got a very stiff material.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.950
We've got other ones that
have the exact same density,

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.380
but by having different
internal geometries,

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.800
we have a huge range in
the effective stiffness

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.460
of these parts.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.670
So by being able to selectively
control internal geometries

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.070
during this 3D printing,
we can do a lot of things

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.640
with the same material.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.500
And then by changing
materials, we've

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.870
got a huge parameter
space to play with.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.620
Here's some little Androids
we printed for you guys just

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.120
for today.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.661
They also have little
microchips that

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:21.270
are embedded in
their heads, so you

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.160
can download a little TagWriter
app and scan over them

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.950
and they'll say something
fun to you guys,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.370
if you want to come try
it out a little bit later.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.030
Here's some dragons
that we've also printed.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.550
And so you can get a sense
of some of the feature sizes

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.450
that we get.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.116
These belong to a
class of materials

00:10:37.116 --> 00:10:38.490
that we've done
a lot of research

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.480
in the lab, which are close to
materials called shape memory

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.550
polymers.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.680
So these happen to be materials
called viscoelastomers,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.090
or they're materials that
are in this transition state.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.900
So you can see that when I
deform this dragon's wings,

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.330
they're sort of slowly
starting to recover.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.260
Well what we can do and what
our lab back at UT Dallas

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.670
focuses on, is these materials
called shape memory polymers.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.280
Here's a little
business card made out

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.130
of one of the shape
memory polymers.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.760
But it's a material
this is stiff and glassy

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.900
at room temperature.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.890
It has a modulus
of 2 gigapascals,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.730
so it's just like Plexiglas.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.280
Now if I heat this
up in my hand,

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.090
and get it to room
temperature-- or get it

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.370
from room temperature,
sorry-- to body

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.910
temperature, what
it's going to do,

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.800
is it's going to get orders
of magnitude less stiff.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.360
So what I can do
is I can bend this

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.766
into some sort of
metastable shape,

00:11:24.766 --> 00:11:26.140
and then as soon
as it cools off,

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.460
it's going to get very hard
again in this new shape.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.810
So a lot of plastics do this.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.810
If you've ever as a kid
played with liquid nitrogen,

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.310
you can stick a
banana in it and you

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.320
can hammer a nail into a wall.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.370
Or you can dunk a racquetball
and hurl it against the wall

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.560
and it's going to shatter.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.700
Or you could dip roses
in liquid nitrogen

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.440
and then they just
crumble apart.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.920
Well we can design
materials that

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.580
undergo that same sort of
brittle to ductile transition,

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.820
but instead of over
hundreds of degrees

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.000
they can do it
over five degrees.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.030
And so what we do is
we park these materials

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.500
right at the onset of
one of these transitions,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.790
and then when that temperature
increases a little bit,

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.280
they get really, really soft.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.484
So here are two very
similar materials,

00:12:04.484 --> 00:12:07.150
but this is one where that glass
transition temperature, as it's

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.370
called, is just a little bit
closer to room temperature.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.240
So as soon as I put
this in my hand,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.280
it's just going to sort
of soften immediately.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.080
And so it's going to go from
Plexiglas to silicone rubber.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.120
And I can bend it,
I can manipulate it,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.184
but then it holds this
new shape very, very well.

00:12:22.184 --> 00:12:23.600
So a lot of this
engineering we've

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.040
done in designing these
shape memory polymers

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.880
is similar to the
problems that we

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.300
face in the 3D printing world.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.690
What we're trying to do is
engineer cross-links, engineer

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.910
these multimonomer
solutions, engineer

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.820
the sterics of side chains.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.390
So basically, how these
little groups hanging off

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.110
of our main chain polymers
interact with each other

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.760
to make things stronger,
to make them stiffer,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.920
to make them tougher, to
make them less brittle.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.830
And so a lot of that engineering
has gone into the materials

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.130
that we've developed
at Adaptive.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.070
So what's the real market need?

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.890
This is a snapshot straight
from Stratasys's website.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.740
Stratasys is one of the large
3D printing plastics companies

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.820
in the country.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.730
And you can see
in the upper right

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.630
corner of that chart
they're missing

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.470
a whole swathe of materials.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.560
So they've got an FDM
set of technologies,

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.930
that's on the left, that stands
for fused deposition modeling.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.570
That's sort of if you'd
imagine taking a hot glue gun

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.714
and squirting it out
and building a pattern,

00:13:21.714 --> 00:13:23.630
and then putting another
layer on, and putting

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.270
another layer on, you can
build materials quickly.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.190
Their PolyJet process lays
down an unpolymerized resin

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.090
and follows behind with a
laser, or with a UV light,

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.800
and sort of spot cures it.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.650
So our technology is
a lot more similar

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.390
to their PolyJet technology,
where we're curing something

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.940
directly out of a resin.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.870
And the materials
properties we get

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.730
are up there close to
nylons, close to some

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.750
of these very high
performance materials

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.860
that 3D printing has
had a tough time making

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.240
in complex, arbitrary shapes.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.570
So let's get into a few
more technical specifics.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.520
Here's a host of non
3D printed materials

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.960
and what their mechanical
properties look like.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.110
So if you look on the left,
that axis is the tensile stress.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.990
That's basically how much force
it takes to deform a material.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.160
And it's proportional to
the cross-sectional area

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.260
of that material.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.510
PMMA is Plexiglas, that's
like this material.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.860
So it's a fairly strong
but very brittle material.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.180
If you look at something like
low density polyethylene,

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.910
high density polyethylene,
polypropylene,

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.280
they're materials with a lot
of give, with a high strain

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.630
capacity, but their strength
isn't quite as high.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.950
And then you've got
materials like PA6.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.880
That's a polyamide, or
a nylon base material.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.390
And those combined have
a really high strength

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.030
with high strain capacity.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.770
And for us, the
figure of merit--

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.580
and I think for a lot of 3D
printers-- the figure of merit

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.970
should be the toughness.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.960
And the toughness is
the integrated area

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.060
underneath that
stress strain curve.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.270
And that explains how much
energy a material can withstand

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.060
per cubic meter, or square
meter if it's an impact

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.730
test, or per linear meter.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.950
And so what we'd like to do is
engineer materials that take up

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.370
as much space on this
graph is possible,

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.690
that are a combination of
being stiff and being strong,

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.890
but also having a
high strain capacity.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.034
Now the modulus-- oh, yup?

00:15:13.034 --> 00:15:14.992
AUDIENCE: Is that to
rupture, all those curves?

00:15:14.992 --> 00:15:16.408
WALTER VOIT: These
are to rupture.

00:15:16.408 --> 00:15:18.990
So these are the strain
to failure points.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.972
And so what you see on
this far end of the curve--

00:15:21.972 --> 00:15:23.430
let me get a laser
pointer out here

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.990
so people online can see me.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.682
One moment.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.720
Yeah, perfect.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.160
So if you were to take the slope
of this line in the very, very

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.150
leftmost region of
this graph, that's

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.010
called the linear
elastic regime.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.960
And that slope is
the Young's modulus.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.000
And that sort of tells
you-- that's effectively

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.620
the stiffness of the material.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.860
So if we want a material
that's soft and rubbery,

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.220
we need something with
a very soft or very low

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.390
slope right here.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.850
But something that as you
strain it, it sort of strain

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.880
hardens and get
stiffer and stiffer.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.690
And by doing that, we can
get a very tough material

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.920
that's very soft and
behaves like a rubber.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.535
If we want an extremely
tough material

00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:03.800
and we don't care
what its feel is,

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.390
we don't care that
it's soft or stiff,

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.580
but we just want it to
absorb a lot of impact.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.470
You'd like a material that's
fairly stiff but not brittle,

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.170
and then as you get past
this yield stress point,

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.820
you have a huge strain
capacity until failure.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.340
And I'll show you some of
our curves in just a minute.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.770
But so what we have
is a couple ways now

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:24.700
to engineer the effective
stiffness of a material.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.430
One way is by tailoring
the stress strain curve,

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.410
and another way is by tailoring
this internal geometry.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.550
And this internal
geometry is not something

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.250
that you can do with
conventional manufacturing.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.300
So for instance, let's
say we wanted to build

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.190
an insole for a running shoe.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.310
A lot of that insole is
actually wasted material.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.900
There are certain
points in that shoe

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.300
where stresses are
transferred from your foot

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.460
down to the ground.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.070
If we could engineer
material for those parts

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.600
to effectively
translate the stresses

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.700
and have everything
else essentially

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.960
be a very low density foam,
we could reduce the materials

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.490
costs, we could reduce the
weight without any sacrifice

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.349
to the end strength
of the material.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.960
There are no conventional ways
to manufacture parts like that.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.660
That's why these market
projections think

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.670
that 3D printing has such a
place in manufacturing markets,

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.550
even though today it's more
expensive than injection

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.310
molding, than extrusion,
there are just

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.290
things that you simply can't do
with conventional thermoplastic

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.050
processing means.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.830
So let's look at some
other parts today

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.030
and how 3D printed parts
stack up against them.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.830
So what you see in
the top left here

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.020
are some of the
world's best materials.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.940
They're some of the
world's best plastics.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.260
These are different
combinations of polyestheramides

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.480
that have sort of a
stress of 10 to 18 MPa,

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.970
but have a strain capacity all
the way up to 1600 or 1800,

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.750
so this is something
you could stretch

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.510
to 16 times its original
size and then it's

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.570
going to sort of snap
back and not deform.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.540
So these are very,
very tough materials.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.990
Here are some materials,
some nylon based materials,

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.100
that when you combine them
with small amounts of carbon

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.200
nanotubes, or single-walled
nanotubes, or buckyballs,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.270
or carbon fibers,
you see you get

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.590
this big increase
in their stress

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.040
without a large sacrifice
to their strain capacity.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.276
And again, these are
non 3D printed parts,

00:18:20.276 --> 00:18:22.150
but these are some of
the engineering methods

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.220
that are used to increase
the properties of parts.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.850
So now looking
down here, what you

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.240
can see the difference
between injection

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.800
molded parts and then
a 3D printed part.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.370
So here's an injection molded
part out of this material.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:41.270
And this is a PA-12, so
a nylon based material.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.230
And you can see how
little strain capacity you

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.240
have once this is 3D printed.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.440
So when this is 3D printed,
those layers simply

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.900
don't stick together well,
so the neat material has

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.940
incredible strain capacity,
the printed material is tiny.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.080
Same thing over here.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.880
You've got this 250% strain
capacity for an injection

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.130
molded material.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.254
You've got a 30% strain capacity
for the 3D printed material.

00:19:05.254 --> 00:19:06.170
The story is the same.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.770
Wohlers released a
market report in 2015

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.790
that looked at a lot of the
commercial 3D printed parts,

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.110
and most of the strain
capacities of those parts

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.860
were in the 10% to
30% range or lower.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.510
But it was difficult to 3D print
parts that were a lot stronger.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.980
Google recently was part
of a fund-raising round

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.895
for carbon 3D, which
apparently they

00:19:28.895 --> 00:19:30.520
haven't released too
many stress strain

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.950
results of their materials
yet, but can print fairly

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.170
high strain capacity materials.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:40.010
But perhaps at very limited
toughnesses and very limited

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.584
stresses.

00:19:41.584 --> 00:19:43.500
So what are some of the
innovations that allow

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.690
us to print these materials?

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.180
Well the first one is
sort of a new printer

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.190
that we've developed
that right now we're

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.420
calling the Z cup model.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.120
But what we can do is
we can package our resin

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.130
inside of something-- you guys
maybe have used Kurig K-cups.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.210
You can stick a little piece,
a thing of coffee grounds

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.240
into a machine, you
can push a button,

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.850
and it makes some
coffee for you.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:11.150
One of the big problems with
handling resins for consumers

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.400
is that you have to
handle those resins.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.920
Often they can be noxious,
they can have odors.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.710
We can package our resins
into these little sealed cups,

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.700
these guys plug in
to our printers.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.876
We can manipulate the height of
something we've call a Z fluid,

00:20:24.876 --> 00:20:26.500
which is a material
that's a little bit

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.280
more dense than
our monomer resin,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.480
and then we can very rapidly
print things layer by layer

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.160
within these Z cups.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.460
So what that printing system
looks like, would be you

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.630
can injection mold or mass
manufacture a Z cup that

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.161
looks like this, fill it with
a little bit of resin, seal it.

00:20:43.161 --> 00:20:44.660
Depending on what
kind of resin, you

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.802
may have to remove all
the oxygen from the Z cup.

00:20:47.802 --> 00:20:49.760
Some kinds of resins you
don't have to do that.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.370
And then in the machine,
we can inject the Z fluid

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.020
and control how parts
are being printed.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.720
So let's get here now to
some of the good stuff.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.100
So here are some of the
stress strain responses

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.130
of competitor materials.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.640
And we've been
able to get things

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.220
that have a higher stress and
have a much higher elongation.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.230
These are some of the parts
that we're printing today,

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.280
we're doing some work.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.300
I was at GE a couple months
ago and gave a big talk on some

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.010
of our 3D printing there.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.300
We've done some work now with
the NNSA, the National Nuclear

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.840
Security Administration
on some 3D printing,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.960
and with Halliburton,
and with a car parts

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.940
company called [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.660
They build some interesting
automotive components.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.340
But we've got these
materials where

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.630
we can tune this
initial modulus,

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.030
so we can say how we want
these materials to behave

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.290
at room temperature.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.330
But then we've got pretty
nice strain capacity,

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.690
so these stretch to 100%
up here at 15 or 20 MPa.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.790
So this is a little
Chinese fingertrap

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.624
that we built out of
one of those materials.

00:21:55.624 --> 00:21:58.081
As you can see, a lot of the
parts that we're showing here,

00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:00.120
little toys and games,
a lot of our clients

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.710
don't like us to show
exactly the parts that we're

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.350
printing for them.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.824
But what's also
really exciting is

00:22:06.824 --> 00:22:08.240
some of the
experimental materials

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.160
that we have in development.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.190
And so these are materials
that unfortunately

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.880
in a public forum like this,
I can't talk at length about.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.380
But I can give you
a glimpse at some

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.290
their thermal
mechanical properties.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.630
So this is a material with
close to a 400% strain

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.590
capacity, that has a
stress up to about 50 MPa.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:30.070
So this has a toughness of about
100 megajoules per meter cubed.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.650
So these parts that we're
printing right now daily

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.060
for a lot of our customers.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.330
That's about a 10x improvement.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.620
If you look at the 30%
percent strain capacity

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.190
that a lot of current
3D printed parts have.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.800
This is between a 4
and a 10 x improvement

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.900
over rubber-like and
viscoelastic materials.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:54.070
This would be another 10
x improvement over that.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.920
And these are parts
again that have

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.870
very interesting properties,
but by tuning the polymer

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.160
chemistry, tuning
how they behave

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.460
as a function of temperature,
as a function of frequency,

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.330
we can do some neat things.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.970
And so if you want
to follow up with us,

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.310
we'd love to talk to you guys
in more detail on the material

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.260
side, on the business side.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.740
I'm sure she can handle
a lot of that follow up.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.680
I've got a couple other little
side things I wanted to show,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.920
some other fun projects
we're working on

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.270
back at the University with
some polymer chemists there.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.340
But one of them is
being able to 3D print

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.160
self-healing materials.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.340
So we've come up with
a really neat reaction.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.140
This is a
furan-maleimide reaction.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.290
It's been known for
a while, but we've

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.410
found ways to take
advantage of this reaction

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.980
and functionalize even
conventional materials like PLA

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.130
and like ABS with some of
these pendant side groups.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.560
And so what you can
see here is a PLA blend

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.370
that we functionalized
with these furan

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.660
and these maleimide reactions.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.540
And they undergo
a high temperature

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.800
reversible Diels-Alder reaction.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.900
And so what we got
here is a material

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.040
that we broke apart
the first time.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.440
And so that was
this point up here.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.272
We basically heated these up
and shoved them back together.

00:24:09.272 --> 00:24:10.730
We did another
stress strain curve,

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.960
then it actually broke at
a different point, which

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.330
we're really excited about.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.200
So we were able
to heal something

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.192
basically stronger than this
point where it was before.

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:22.150
And so we think there's
some really interesting

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.950
opportunities for
taking very low cost,

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.360
conventional materials
and finding ways

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.990
to post-functionalize those
materials with pendent side

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.550
groups to give them some
interesting properties

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.400
in materials that
can be 3D printed.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.720
But we think some
of the real success

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.910
lies in the ground up
engineering of systems

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:46.440
and of materials to solve these
really interesting anisotropy

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.720
issues that we see
in the market that

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.660
are limiting the broad adoption
of 3D printed plastics.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.390
So with that, I didn't
prepare a whole lot of slides,

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.720
but wanted to leave plenty
of time for discussion,

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.970
and sort of
speculation about maybe

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.410
where this field is headed.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:06.620
And wanted to get some of you
guys's take and interest on why

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.550
you're here.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.550
So thanks for your time.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.080
WALTER VOIT: So the question
was whether the shape memory

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.580
polymers would fatigue as you're
bending them over many cycles.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.270
And so it's a great question.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.270
There's a curve in
material science called

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.020
an S-N curve, which
is a stress plotted

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.640
versus the number of cycles.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.536
And so if you stretch materials
to their yield strength,

00:25:33.536 --> 00:25:34.910
or the ultimate
tensile strength,

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.720
and you do that
repeatedly, then they

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.160
will fail after fewer
numbers of cycles.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.150
So a lot of these curves
that you see here,

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.550
this is the failure
at one cycle.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.610
So what most materials do
is you build in something

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.510
called an endurance limit,
which is a safety factor that's

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.670
some fraction of
this, and we can

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.690
guarantee that under
this stress profile,

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.550
a material will never fail.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.410
And so typically
what you do is you

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.740
take some fraction of
your yield strength,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.640
you make it less than that, this
is the linear elastic regime,

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.160
and then you can cycle material
hundreds of millions of times

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.830
without any adverse effects
to the network structure.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:14.460
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
even you warm it up,

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.900
it can become fatigued?

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.180
WALTER VOIT: So
when you warm it up,

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.280
it won't fatigue
unless you stretch

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.970
it pass this endurance limit.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.160
And so we can define
an endurance limit

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.170
based on how stiff and how
stretchy each material is.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.900
And you can heat it up and
cool it down indefinitely.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.570
That will not have
an effect on things.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.580
But when it's heated, as
long as you don't stretch it

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.225
beyond a certain distance, you
can keep doing that cyclically.

00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:42.570
AUDIENCE: And about that
self-healing material,

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.520
is that a one shot
healing procedure,

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.570
or can it be repeated?

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.040
WALTER VOIT: This is one
that can be repeated.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:54.240
So at high temperature, this
reversible Diels-Alder reaction

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.320
is sort of favorable.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.760
So the monomers are just as
favorable as a joint polymer

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.980
as a function of temperature.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.480
So you get to the
right temperature,

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.670
these reactions are
sort of an equilibrium.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.760
So you can basically make
and break these bonds

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.710
really nicely.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.270
So depending on
how many of these

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.350
we functionalize
onto our materials,

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.510
we can control how well
they stick back together.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.700
Now, if you have
just a few of them,

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.420
then they're not
going to be as strong.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.210
But the material is not
going to be as brittle.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.459
And so there's a balance
then between ultimate tensile

00:27:23.459 --> 00:27:26.580
strength, strain capacity, and
a lot of these pending groups.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.510
And unfortunately in
a big talk this, I

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.560
haven't gotten into a lot
of the very hairy details

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.380
in polymer design.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.780
But there are a
tremendous number

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:38.250
of features of the
monomers that we choose,

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.660
and how they interact,
how they polymerize,

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.404
what they're starting viscosity
is, what their side groups look

00:27:43.404 --> 00:27:45.070
like, what the kinetics
of that reaction

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:48.070
looks like, that go
into the ultimate design

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.670
of these materials.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.670
But today, I wanted to
just show the properties.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.450
And say maybe some of
the market skeptics

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.324
out there, that we
material scientists may

00:27:58.324 --> 00:27:59.990
in the near future
have a great solution

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.406
to help a lot of
these businesses,

00:28:01.406 --> 00:28:05.150
who've really thought a lot
about 3D printing, but so far

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.430
haven't been able to
print the kinds of parts

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.365
that their customers need.

00:28:10.365 --> 00:28:11.930
AUDIENCE: You talked
about the Z cup

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.890
for printing some of
these smaller parts.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.320
How do you handle printing
some of the larger pieces

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.945
for like, oil companies?

00:28:20.945 --> 00:28:23.060
WALTER VOIT: Well, the
reality is that this Z cup

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.200
model is highly scalable.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.840
So we've joked
around a little bit,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.080
but we could have a
helicopter lowering a giant Z

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.720
cup into a swimming
pool, and we could

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.160
print a canoe if we wanted to.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.370
Now, I mean, that's a
little bit unrealistic,

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.350
but as a thought
experiment, there's

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.650
no technical limitation from
keeping that from happening.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.700
It's just a balance of the
intensity of, in this case,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.300
our light.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.350
And we've played around
with both ultraviolet light

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.910
projectors and visible
light projectors.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:54.360
And so depending on
the initiators we use,

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.880
we've got a lot of
control within our systems

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.200
over how they're initiated.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.750
But we could do this
on very large scales.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:06.170
We've built larger Z cups, that
are printing the kinds of parts

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.372
that our friends at
Halliburton like, for instance.

00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:10.990
AUDIENCE: So one
of the things I've

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:15.570
noticed as a issue with
3D printing for production

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.050
is just the speed of printing
the materials, versus injection

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.710
molding or forging or
something like that.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.140
And are you able
to address that?

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.170
WALTER VOIT: Not as well as
we would like, certainly.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.830
So the question was
that in 3D printing,

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:34.750
speed is often an issue, and
that 3D printing can't compete

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.860
with injection molding, with
extrusion, with maybe blister

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.780
packaging, and other things like
that for making complex shapes.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.080
And that is a true limitation
for a lot of 3D printing.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.290
Carbon 3D, a company that
you guys have recently

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:52.100
invested into, has come up
with some really elegant ways

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.560
to very quickly print parts.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.720
But a lot of the
customers that we've

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.690
talked to have lower volumes
that don't necessarily

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.110
need that kind of speed.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.810
For them, the
driving issue really

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.650
is the underlying
materials properties,

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.250
and not the print speed.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.850
So, I mean, these aren't taking
weeks and months to print,

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:18.030
we can print these in sort of
20 minutes to 4 or 5 hours.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.100
So it's not that
they take forever,

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.790
but it's also not that we're
right now able to pull parts

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.110
out of a liquid resin.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.750
But I think as we continue
working on making these faster,

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.970
I think that the driving
issue, for what we've

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.170
seen from a lot of the
market reports though,

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.200
is not that the volumes of
3D printed parts are too low,

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.840
but it's that the materials
properties aren't good enough.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.631
And so I think we're
coming at this problem

00:30:42.631 --> 00:30:45.310
maybe from a different
angle that Carbon 3D is,

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.400
is that we're really trying to
focus on printing tough rubber

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.654
materials, printing tough
viscoelastic materials.

00:30:53.654 --> 00:30:55.070
And I think the
speed is something

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.910
that can be engineered
into the system,

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.062
whereas the underlying materials
properties maybe can't be.

00:31:01.062 --> 00:31:02.770
SRISHTI GOEL: Walter,
can I add something

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:03.720
to this point really quick?

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.940
WALTER VOIT: Maybe
come to the microphone.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.790
SRISHTI GOEL: So,
the other point

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.470
that in general, the
benefit of 3D printing

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:11.765
that a lot of people, I
think, miss when you first

00:31:11.765 --> 00:31:13.140
start thinking
about the subject,

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.977
is yes, 3D printing
takes a lot of time.

00:31:15.977 --> 00:31:17.560
But if you consider
the amount of time

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.230
it takes away from things like
having to redo your tooling

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.302
costs, to actually having
all of the other changes

00:31:23.302 --> 00:31:24.010
you have to make.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.443
If you have one 3D printer,
it can print anything from A

00:31:26.443 --> 00:31:27.100
to Z, right?

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.600
You don't have to
change your tools.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.060
You don't have to change
the assembly line,

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.476
you don't have to
do-- if you have

00:31:31.476 --> 00:31:34.770
to change every single part
for some small specification,

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.920
you don't have to rechange your
entire assembly line to fix

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.880
this one small error.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.645
You can just change
your SDL file,

00:31:40.645 --> 00:31:42.020
and suddenly you're
there, right?

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.220
So when it comes to time,
that time efficiency

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.744
is spent more on actually
making the part than on making

00:31:47.744 --> 00:31:49.660
all of the infrastructure
for making the part.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.580
And that's where we see that
even though 3D printing might

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.750
be smaller and materials
might be more expensive,

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.500
at the end of day,
you're actually getting

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.532
a more cost-effective solution.

00:31:58.532 --> 00:32:00.730
AUDIENCE: So a quick
question about,

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.601
I guess that you guys are making
the material as well as the 3D

00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:05.100
printer.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.200
How about like the
slicing in the software

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.232
that comes behind it?

00:32:08.232 --> 00:32:09.690
Is that something
you guys created?

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.440
Are you using off
the shelf product?

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.540
Or, how do you do that?

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.030
WALTER VOIT: So we've done
a little bit of dabbling.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.390
I'm on a computer
scientist by training.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.450
I did my undergrad
in CS and a master's

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.690
in Artificial Intelligence.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.680
That's how I knew
Chris back in the day.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.710
He stayed on the dark
side, I went over

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.290
to the light side of materials.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:31.760
No, so we've built a
few of our own systems

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.850
to print these materials.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.310
So we've written some of
our own scripts and software

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:38.030
to run the printer
to do the slicing.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:41.120
But to be honest, we would
love an infrastructure

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.833
like you guys's
behind that, instead

00:32:42.833 --> 00:32:44.916
of relying on what we've
sort of done with chicken

00:32:44.916 --> 00:32:46.570
wire and chewing gum.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.095
I think there's a lot of
need for-- especially as we

00:32:49.095 --> 00:32:51.095
get to some of these
complex internal geometries

00:32:51.095 --> 00:32:54.230
that we've passed out, there
are a lot of very sophisticated

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.030
algorithms that can generate
fractal-like patterns, that

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:01.280
can generate complex internal
geometries, that can map,

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.660
let's say, a finite
element model

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.630
that you've generated in
Abacus, into a structure

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.430
that once you've 3D printed it,
you can localize the stresses

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.190
and strains appropriately.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:15.870
I think that's a huge area
where software companies have

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:16.910
room to play.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.940
I know that HP has recently made
some acquisitions in that area.

00:33:24.556 --> 00:33:27.952
AUDIENCE: What's the
cost of the resin itself?

00:33:27.952 --> 00:33:30.160
What's the difference between
just traditional nylon,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.615
between [INAUDIBLE] similar
properties as injected?

00:33:35.615 --> 00:33:40.210
WALTER VOIT: These are resins
that are not quite as commodity

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:44.350
as something like
polyethylene or polypropylene.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:49.680
But they are not far if you look
at petrochemical distillation,

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.480
they're not far from crude oil
down the distillation pathway.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.674
So if there were a
need to mass-produce

00:33:55.674 --> 00:33:57.090
these kinds of
materials, it would

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.090
be very inexpensive to do so.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.090
Because the volumes aren't
as high now as they could be,

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.872
they are a little bit
more specialty resins.

00:34:05.872 --> 00:34:07.330
They're a little
bit more expensive

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.610
than traditional
injection molded parts.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.570
But we look at what other
3D printing companies are

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:16.190
charging, following the razor
blade model of essentially

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.380
giving away printers and then
charging a lot for resins,

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:23.389
and at the lab prices that
we're making resins now,

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:27.329
we are more than competitive
at those price points.

00:34:27.329 --> 00:34:28.870
AUDIENCE: Just a
couple quick things.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:34.810
First you mentioned being
able to vary the Z height.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.840
How far can you vary that?

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.020
WALTER VOIT: What's
really neat is

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.710
we can do that during a print.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:45.374
So if we had some components
that structurally we

00:34:45.374 --> 00:34:47.040
wanted to print some
layers very quickly

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.206
and we want a lot more
resolution in another layers,

00:34:49.206 --> 00:34:50.090
we could do that.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.889
It's a balance of
what kind of initiator

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:55.380
we have in the material,
what kind of inhibitor

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.930
we have in the material,
what the height is,

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.890
what the intensity
of the light is,

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.540
and how these little micromeres
are turning on and off.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.810
So a lot of
projection technology

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.710
has advanced algorithms that
make the edges, for instance,

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.480
look sharper and pixels.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.440
So the mirrors are
turning on and off much

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.610
faster than the human
eye can see to give you

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.170
some interesting edge effects.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.870
So there's some
interesting ways we

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:22.030
can play with that combination
of inhibitor, of initiator,

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:27.170
of layer thickness, and of
software to control that.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:31.110
So one thing that limits
how thin we can do that,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.011
is the viscosity of
our underlying resin.

00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:36.260
And so different resins that
have different properties

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.970
have different viscosities.

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.140
In the lab, though,
we've been able to spin

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.740
individual layers that are
less than a micron thick.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.250
In fact, we've been
able to spin down

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.140
some of these kinds
of materials--

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.150
now this is a solvent-based
approach where we have to let

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.720
some solvent then evaporate.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.370
But we've been able to build
20 nanometer thick, very

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.610
uniform films, and do some
neat things with those.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:03.510
Now, that's not really realistic
to print large area 3D printed

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.550
parts, but for some of the
photolithographic processing

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:09.120
we do, for instance, for
building microelectronics,

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.760
often we need a 20
nanometer thick dielectric

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.960
to do something.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.930
And so we've got some abilities
to spin these materials down

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.490
to those thicknesses.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:22.320
In terms of the thickest, it
depends again on the inhibitor.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.940
If you start to
vary the thickness

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.500
within a print a
whole lot, it becomes

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.310
difficult to balance
the inhibitor.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.370
Because as light is going
through this material,

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.450
as a reaction is
propagating, you

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.870
don't want that reaction
to propagate and turn

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.740
your whole resin into
a big ball of goo.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.580
So we need ways to
start that reaction

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.570
and stop that reaction.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.094
And Carbon 3D has their
own way to do that.

00:36:45.094 --> 00:36:46.510
We have a very
different way to do

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.190
that, which gives us a lot
more control over how to start

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.415
and stop these reaction.

00:36:51.415 --> 00:36:54.380
AUDIENCE: So what you do with
the leftover resin in the K-cup

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.131
model?

00:36:55.131 --> 00:36:57.380
Because it seems that you
have a fixed amount of resin

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:02.140
for any K-cup and so is it
just because every single one

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.942
is going to be custom designed
for the part that's being made?

00:37:04.942 --> 00:37:05.650
WALTER VOIT: Yes.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.350
So for high-volume
manufacturing,

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:11.560
companies would be able to
specify exactly how much resin

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.440
they would need.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.430
And we would have very little
waste at the end of the day.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.390
In these cases, we pushed
the Z fluid up higher,

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.485
and then we polymerize
a little A3DT disk

00:37:21.485 --> 00:37:23.360
at the top that's a
little knickknack that we

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.650
can play around with
and hand out as swag.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.660
In the future for
highly customized parts,

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.120
that would be nearly
eliminated for more

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.036
of the maker community.

00:37:34.036 --> 00:37:35.410
There would be
different SKUs you

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.430
could buy for
different size resins,

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:39.050
and then it would
be up to individuals

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.740
to determine what to
do with the extra.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.830
But in most cases, you
would push it to the top

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.390
and then just finish
polymerizing it.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:45.977
SRISHTI GOEL: So
the other thing is

00:37:45.977 --> 00:37:48.560
we're actually, because of this
problem of having waste resin,

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.260
we're doing a lot of studies
now that are internally focused

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.710
on what kind of--
what quality of print

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:55.586
do we get if we
reuse our old resin.

00:37:55.586 --> 00:37:56.960
And so we're seeing
that actually

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.802
if you use-- if you need
something that's low quality,

00:37:59.802 --> 00:38:02.260
if you're not super concerned
about what kind of properties

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.490
you're going to get
on the end user,

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:07.960
then you can actually reuse the
resin and it works pretty well.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.840
So we're actually working on
making that less of a waste

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.854
situation, more of a recyclable,
more sustainable solution

00:38:13.854 --> 00:38:15.645
for having to deal with
that kind of thing.

00:38:15.645 --> 00:38:17.660
WALTER VOIT: So the
question was whether we

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.660
were focused in medical
markets, because it seems

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.050
like this control of stiffness
and internal geometry

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:26.940
and materials properties would
lend themselves well to that.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.590
That's something that, with
my other hat on for a moment,

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.440
back at the University
that we're spending

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.900
a good deal of time on.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.990
We have a DARPA grant that
is focused on 3D printing

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:41.225
some artificial tracheas with
colleagues at UT Southwestern.

00:38:41.225 --> 00:38:43.100
My wife is actually here
sitting in the back.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.308
She's an ear, nose, and
throat, head and neck surgeon

00:38:45.308 --> 00:38:46.540
at UT Southwestern.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.660
And so we're working with her
and with some of her bosses

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.260
to do that.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.430
But in terms of market
adoption for a small company,

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:57.980
you can live off of
grant funding and things

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.980
for a long time.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.120
But in terms of
readiness to market,

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.250
there are quite a few
barriers to entry,

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:07.010
and we've focused a lot of
our immediate concentration

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.580
on these near-term,
high-value industrial markets.

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.650
And I think there's a huge
segment for medical research.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.270
But that will come.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.400
As a company is adaptive,
we've focused squarely

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.490
on the non-medical space so far.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:23.000
But I think we'll
continue to build

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.490
an IP portfolio
that may lend itself

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.210
to that in the near future.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.350
Thanks a lot for your time.
