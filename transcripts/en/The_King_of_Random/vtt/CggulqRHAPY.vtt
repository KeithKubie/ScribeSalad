00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.060
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
In today's video,
we're going to be taking a look

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.600
at the properties of magnetic
metals and the magnets themselves

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.900
when you heat them up
or even melt them down.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.720
[Music]

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.680
We've got a couple of magnets,
a bar of mild steel, and a furnace,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.800
and we want to see what happens
if we start combining these together.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.200
The magnets of course right now
are attracted to the bar of steel,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.400
but we want to see what happens
if we start heating these things up.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.710
If we get our steel
glowing orange hot,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.560
will it still be
attracted to the magnets?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.220
If we get our magnets
glowing orange hot,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.220
will they still be
attracted to the steel?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.920
And after we do all of those things,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.240
we might just try melting
some of these down,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.460
the steel and the magnets,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.050
until they're completely liquid,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.820
and see how that
affects the magnetism.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.239
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.300
We'll try heating up
a piece of steel,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.460
and seeing how long it retains
its magnetic properties.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.079
We'll then try heating up
the magnets themselves,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.750
and see how well they retain
their magnetic properties.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.320
Finally, we'll try
melting down both,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.360
and seeing how they
interact with each other.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.360
First up, we're gonna fire up our furnace,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.480
put our bar of steel down inside,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.590
so one end of it gets super glowing hot.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.930
We're going to pull that out,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.580
and see if it is still attracted
to either of our magnets.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.159
One end of our steel bar
is now glowing orange hot,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.760
and this furnace gets
up to about 2000 degrees.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.560
So let's see how magnetic
a 2000 degree bar mild steel is.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.159
So in theory, at about 1400
degrees, it stops being magnetic.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.680
Pretty much nothing
on the ceramic magnet.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.580
Our steel was glowing orange hot,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.360
and at that point,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.080
it was no longer attracted
to either of our magnets.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.869
The ceramic magnet
isn't all that strong,

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:38.869
so it shouldn't take

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.420
that much loss of magnetism
for it to not stick to that.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.560
But the silvery neodymium
magnet is very powerful.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.060
That thing has a lot of pull strength,
and that had no attraction to the steel.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.460
At approximately 1420 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.380
mild carbon steel is supposed
to lose all of his magnetism,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.909
and this bar was well
above that temperature,

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.180
so it doesn't really surprise me
that it got to the point where

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.549
it wasn't attracted to the magnets.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.781
In theory, the steel also has
to cool down to about 500 Degrees

00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:07.500
before it regains that
attraction to magnetism

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.030
after it's been heated up that high.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.600
So now, I want to try the reverse.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.010
I want to see what happens
if we heat our magnets up,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.400
to see if they stop
being attracted to the steel.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.140
[Music]

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.800
Oh!

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.720
And it's shattering immediately.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.660
Well, that didn't last long.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.940
That just exploded into pieces.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.010
So, now we know that
ceramic or ferrite magnets

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.620
really don't like to be heated up.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.200
That's just...

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.760
Gone.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.660
I got to say that
I know these are pieces.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.280
and so, they're not going to have
as much directional magnetic charge,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.290
but even just being
in there for that long,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.240
this isn't really sticking
to the tongs much at all.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.680
But our ferrite magnet has
now had time to cool down,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.860
and it is now doing a better
job of sticking to our tongs.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.320
Not every piece.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.560
That piece in particular seems quite weak.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.880
Furnaces had just a minute to cool off.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.060
So now, I can just re-ignite
this, and let that get nice and hot.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.820
Now these magnets are
mostly made of neodymium.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.400
Neodymium is atomic element number 60,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.930
and these magnets,
while largely made of neodymium,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.700
also contains some other metals.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.800
Neodymium on its own has a melting
point of 1861 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.940
which is below the temperature
that our furnace gets to.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.160
So it's possible that our whole
magnet could just melt in here.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.330
The magnets however are an alloy,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.080
and it could be that whatever
other metals are mixed in with it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.560
raises the melting point,
so our magnet will be fine.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.600
[Music]

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.960
That is one glowing-hot magnet.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.940
Let's see if it's
attracted to our steel bar.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.660
[Music]

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.160
Nothing.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.040
Zero attempts to grab onto that bar.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.420
It's not rolling with it.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.380
It's not sticking it.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.360
Just really zero.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.440
Let's take this out,
and set it on a brick.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.300
Not sticking to our tongs at all either.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.080
Let's see if it starts sticking
as it cools down

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.000
the same way that the steel bar
starts sticking as it cool down.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.220
While it's cooling down,
there's something else I want to try.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.810
I got these two identical square
magnets with a couple of holes in them.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.060
We're going to put one in the furnace,
heat it up till it's red-hot, take it out,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.400
and then place the other
magnet right on top of it,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.431
and see if it makes any difference
in how much magnetism this gains

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.700
back as it cools down.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.860
One of the square magnets is
heating up in the furnace.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.570
We've got our other square magnet,
and I want to see if it's attracted

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.820
to this first magnet we heated up.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.160
At this point, the first neodymium
magnet we put in there is still not

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.860
being attracted to the metal at all.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.900
So I'm curious of our fixed magnet here
will be attracted to that material,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.500
even though it's not attracted to steel.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.260
[Music]

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.400
That is a yes.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.140
So the bigger magnet that
we put in first, the cylinder,

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.410
is not attracted to the metal itself.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.100
But another magnet is
attracted to the cylinder magnet.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.780
That makes me think we have eliminated
all of the magnetism out of this magnet,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.480
and it may or may not come back.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.580
Let's pull our square magnet
out of the furnace,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.220
and let it cool down in
the presence of this magnet.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.900
[Music]

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.220
Not attracted to the tongs at all.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.980
Okay, currently, not attracted much.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.020
Maybe a tiny tiny charge.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.020
[Music]

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.900
Let's let those cool down completely.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.180
Our magnets have now
had long enough to cool down,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.860
and we have nothing.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.240
There is a very slight draw.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.740
It is really little,
but just barely feel it.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.180
It's not enough to lift the magnet.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.400
It's just barely enough to
feel a tiny tug of resistance.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.050
All right. Well, let's see about
our magnets cooled down together,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.960
a little bit to that.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.360
Still almost nothing.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.700
[Music]

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.660
Oh!

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.360
This magnet got ruined.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.820
So we have really depleted
these magnets of their charge,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.780
but a non-depleted magnet is still
very attracted to both of these.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.740
We've got our miniature arc furnace,

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.620
which gets well hot enough
to melt pieces of steel,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.690
and almost certainly
these magnets as well.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.920
First, We're going to melt down
a piece of mild steel,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.060
and see if there's any
magnetic attraction to it.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.860
I kind of doubt it since it does seem to
lose its magnetic attraction

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.139
once it's glowing orange,
but we'll see what happens.

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.110
We'll give it a try, and we'll even
let it cool down somewhat

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.180
in the presence of a magnet, and see
if that can magnetize the steel itself.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.680
Steel has a tendency to spark
quite a bit when it's melted

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.720
in this hot, so I am going to be
doing this with the lid on the furnace.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.180
To do our testing, we're going to have
a magnet stuck on the end of our steel bar.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.120
Once it's melted down,
we'll carefully remove the lid,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.640
and see what happens if we bring
the magnet into the melted steel.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:42.410
[Music]

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.360
I would say that is not
attracted to it at all.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.320
Big surprise!

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.880
Not really a big surprise.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.900
That was exciting.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.800
All right, that is starting to cool down,
and I'm just leaving this magnet near it.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.020
It could be that the heat from the molten
steel is just going to ruin the magnet.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.500
Oh-oh.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.980
Oh, I think the heat is winning.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.370
My magnet just slid
right off of my steel bar.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.340
I think my magnet has
lost its magnetic charge.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.460
[Music]

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.080
Steel has just really solidly
attached itself to our fire brick here.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.520
That is a new still
powerfully magnetic magnet.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.140
I'm going to take our chunk
of steel, let it cool down

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.660
in the water right next to that magnet.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.660
Chunk of steel cooled
down next to a magnet,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.020
it already ruined the magnetism
of the first magnet,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.880
cool down even further in
the presence of a second magnet.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.500
Has it gained any magnetic
properties of its own?

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.920
[Music]

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.220
I'm gonna say not so much.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.180
Well, let's move on.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.020
Let's see what happens if we
just melt down a magnet.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:08:00.740
[Music]

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.220
Well, that is a super bright, mag--

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.140
Holy cow!

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.640
That is giving off a lot of light.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.260
Like a lot.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.620
The inside is molten.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.860
Might've ruined my screwdriver.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.220
Oh Jesus!

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:28.560
[Music]

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.592
I think it was about
1400 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:08:31.592 --> 00:08:34.300
and this was definitely getting
hot enough to melt the steel,

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.940
which melted about
2500 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.320
but the magnets were not
melting as easily as the steel.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.970
So, something about the alloy
of the composition clearly

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.860
melts at a fairly high temperature.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.160
As a final test, I want to
see what happens if I try

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.960
and melt down this ceramic magnet.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:58.500
[Music]

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.900
There is some melted ferrite magnet.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.670
Cooled down fairly quickly.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.220
It doesn't like to stay liquid, and kind
of hard to direct the arc right at it,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.400
because as it heats up,
like it did in the other furnace,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.610
it just kind of shatters and goes everywhere.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.600
So, it doesn't like to stay in one
place to be heat it up nicely,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.800
but it does melt,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.340
and like all the other magnets
we've tested, as it melts,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.100
it really loses all of its magnetic power.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.860
No longer attracted to steel.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.160
Melting metal and magnets
really does seem to ruin

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.280
the magnetism that they have in them.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.640
The magnets stop being magnetic
when you heat them up too much,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.420
and they don't get it
back after they cool down.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.920
Heating up steel, while it's over that
mark of about 1400 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.520
it does lose all of its magnetic charge,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.700
but when the steel cools down,
it does become magnetic again.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.800
Melting steel down into a little blob.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.420
I was hoping that we would be able to
put a magnetic field around the steel,

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.880
but in putting the magnet
close to the liquid steel,

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.029
the magnet actually heated up so much
that it lost all of its magnetic charge,

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.800
and it's no longer attracted
to that piece of steel

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.250
or any other metal.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.820
It's just not a magnet anymore.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.000
It's just a block of was magnet.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.480
I know what to call that.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.240
Maybe someday in the future,
we'll try melting down steel again,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.100
and letting it cool down in the
presence of a powerful electromagnet,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.660
which shouldn't have its
field ruined by the heat.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.400
Guys, that's not all there is to see.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.020
That box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.230
and you can go check that out.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.440
The box at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.640
you need to be watching next.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.780
This bomb here in the middle
with subscribe you to the channel,

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.140
so you never miss a video.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.080
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.180
Talk to you then.
