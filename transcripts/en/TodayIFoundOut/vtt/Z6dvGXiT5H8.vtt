00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.460
Why Don’t Americans Use Bidets?

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.740
A mini-shower for your nether region, bidets
are a popular way worldwide to keep said regions

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.500
tidy, and there are plenty of extremely inexpensive
options for easily outfitting any standard

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.650
toilet with one.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.510
So why has this popular bathroom fixture not
caught on in the United States?

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.510
Old prejudices, (surprisingly new) habit,
and comfort-level.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.330
(Note: Toilet paper wasn’t commonly used
in the United States until the 20th century)

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.180
Believed to have originated in France, the
first bidets were simply a bowl of water over

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.500
which, after relieving herself, a person would
squat and then use a hand to splash and wipe

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.590
away any messes that remained.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.360
Eventually, a short narrow stool with a bowl
inset was developed that could be sat astride

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.730
for easier cleaning.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.820
As a person who is mounted on this contraption
resembles one sitting on the small, stout

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.519
pony, a “bidet” in French, the name was
soon adopted for the bathroom fixture.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.089
Christophe des Rosiers is credited with inventing
the bidet, although the first written record

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.439
of one appears in a 1710 account of the Marquis
d’Argenson, who noted that he had an audience

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.829
with one Mademoiselle de Prie “as she sat
astride her bidet.”

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.140
In 1750, an upward sprayer powered by a hand-pump
was added, and thus, bidet á seringue, (bidet

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.530
with syringe) was born.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.620
The modern bidet that resembles a toilet was
developed in the 19th century, and the very

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.250
popular bidet seat came about in the 1960s,
with one of the most popular invented by an

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.640
American, Arnold Cohen.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.479
In the 1980s, the modern seat was improved
with the creation of the “washlet.”

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.590
Using remote-controlled wands that spout water
jets and finish with a warm-air dryer, the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.229
washlet is hugely popular, particularly in
Japan.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.869
So why don’t Americans use them?

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.340
After all, if fecal matter got on just about
anywhere else on your body, you wouldn’t

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.280
just wipe it off with toilet paper and call
it good.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.640
Why should your derrière be any different?

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.350
Although there is no definitive answer in
each and every case as to why Americans eschew

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.190
a bidet, there are a few major contributing
factors.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.319
To begin with, there is the historical disdain
that 18th century Britons had for the French

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.459
aristocracy and its decadent and hedonistic
lifestyle.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.049
As the early American colonists were heavily
influenced by their British heritage, it is

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.270
thought that this sentiment came with them
to America, too.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.660
Another theory notes that during World War
II, the first (and often only) experience

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.110
many Americans had with a bidet was when soldiers
saw them in French brothels, which “perpetuat[ed]

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.599
the idea that bidets were somehow associated
with immorality.”

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.070
A third theory, perhaps most plausible, looks
to the classical process of bidet-ing.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.900
Unlike the use of a paper shield between hand
and butt, traditionally with the bidet (though

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.080
not so much anymore), the bare hand was used
to splash, wipe and generally clean both the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.420
junk and the trunk.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.940
As Americans traditionally have been extremely
conservative about such things (the first

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.099
toilet flushing didn’t even show up in cinema
until 1960 in the film, Psycho, partially

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.209
because of this), it is thought this may have
influenced the rejection of the bidet as indoor

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.590
plumbing became more and more common.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.410
The continued rejection today is then, perhaps,
more about habit and tradition, rather than

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.390
based on any rational idea- the classic, “that’s
how we’ve always done it” line of thinking.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.060
Even for those that use them in America, the
general notion of it being slightly uncouth

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.360
to talk about one’s bathroom hygienic practices
(which is also partially why it’s called

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.360
a “bathroom, restroom, lavatory, latrine,
washroom, etc.” instead of referencing what

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.360
actually goes on in said rooms most of the
time- peeing and pooping) also lends itself

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.920
to not spreading the word about the drastically
superior cleaning experience with bidets over

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.120
toilet paper alone.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.300
So even for those who aren’t nearly so prudish
today, they simply stick with what they know,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.810
namely toilet paper.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.390
Why The Switch Should Be Made

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.300
It’s dirt cheap (starting at around $25
for a basic model) and ridiculously easy to

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.870
install toilet seat variety bidets, with the
cost quickly being offset by the savings on

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.870
toilet paper.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.469
You see, unsurprisingly, bidet use drastically
reduces the need for toilet paper, of which

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.550
in North America over 36 billion rolls are
used each year.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.459
In addition, bidets (particularly those with
heated seats) offer comfort and greater hygiene,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.820
as the jets ensure your tush is thoroughly
cleaned (as opposed to the dingleberries and

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.320
skid marks that can result from using only
toilet paper).

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.400
This added comfort factor is particularly
beneficial to those suffering from a sensitive

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.020
backside at a given time, such as via swollen
hemorrhoids or rash.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.770
(Note, contrary to popular belief, everyone
has hemorrhoids, all the time.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.900
Yes, even you.)

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.790
Third, using too much paper, or even just
the thicker high-end kind, can lead to clogged

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.180
toilets and sometimes clogged septic systems
or clogged public sewer systems that require

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.100
a lot of money be spent to fix them.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.500
(This is particularly the case when people
use so called “flushable wipes” for cleaning,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.300
which help create something known in the sewer
industry as “fatbergs” that clog the pipes.)

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.580
Since little-to-no paper is used when a bidet
is employed, such blockages are much less

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.830
common in bidet-loving countries.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.600
For reference as to the expense, in San Francisco
alone, the city spends about four million

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.880
dollars annually just cleaning out fatbergs
according to Tyrone Jue of the San Francisco

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.240
Public Utilities Commission.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.070
Fourth, older people, among others, often
benefit from the bidet as the sprayer reduces

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.350
or eliminates the need for hand wiping – something
that can be difficult for those with arthritis,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.060
or who, just due to advanced age, disability,
or injury, are less mobile.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.710
Fifth, women who suffer from frequent urinary
tract infections may benefit from washing

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.930
with bidets, as opposed to only cleaning the
area during the once-a-day shower.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.390
By washing away the specific pesky microbes
responsible, there is less chance that some

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.120
will enter the urethra and cause problems.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.330
There are also significant cleaning benefits
during menstruation, which can be more easily

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.200
taken care of with relatively inexpensive
dual sprayer units that have a feminine hygiene

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:22.570
setting.
