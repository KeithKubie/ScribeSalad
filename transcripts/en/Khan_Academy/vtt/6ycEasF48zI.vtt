00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.720
Let's generalize the
mathematics that we've

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.100
been doing in the
last few videos

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.590
to calculate the real return.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.910
And maybe we'll come up with
some interesting formulas

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.395
or some simple approximations.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.020
So what we've been
doing is we've been,

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.186
at least in the first video,
we converted everything

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:15.420
to today's dollars.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.260
So the actual dollar
return in today's dollars

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.870
is the amount that we got
or the net dollar return.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.190
And the net dollar
return is the amount

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.360
that we originally
invested compounded

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.862
by the nominal interest rate.

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:32.320
And here we're assuming that
we're writing it as a decimal.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.810
So in the example we've
been using it was 10%.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.060
And so this is going to be 0.10.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.662
Or this whole value
is going to be 1.10.

00:00:41.662 --> 00:00:43.120
And so this is how
much we're going

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.390
to get after a year has passed.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.760
So in our example,
this was the $110.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.030
$100 compounded by 1.1.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.810
And then from that,
you want to subtract

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.010
how much we invested
in today's dollars.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.510
Well, we originally invested
P dollars a year ago.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.010
And in today's
dollars, we just need

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.690
to grow it by the
rate of inflation.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.190
And in the examples
we've been doing

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.410
we assume that the rate
of inflation is 2%.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.030
So that would be 0.02.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.280
So this expression
right over here

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.590
is actually the dollar
return in today's dollars.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.060
It's this value
right here that we

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.790
calculated in the first video.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.010
And to calculate the real
return we want the dollar

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.810
return in today's dollars
divided by the investment

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.230
in today's dollars.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.100
And once again, this is the
investment in today's dollars.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.050
It's the amount we invested
originally grown by inflation.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.770
And this right over here
gives us the real return.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.480
Now one thing we can
do right off the bat

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.194
to simplify this is that we
have everything in the numerator

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:50.360
and everything in the
denominator is divisible by P.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.401
So let's divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:55.730
by P. Simplify it a little bit.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.340
Just like that.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.140
And then we get
in the numerator,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.420
we get 1 plus N minus 1 plus I.
I'll write it like that still.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.310
All of that over 1
plus I is equal to R.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.200
And I'm giving some space here
because one simplification I

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.540
can do here is I can add 1 to
both sides of this equation.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.360
So if I add a 1 on the right
hand side, I have to add a 1

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.680
on the left hand side.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.450
But a 1 is the same thing as
a 1 plus I over a 1 plus I.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.080
This is completely
identical because this

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.720
is dividing the same
thing by itself.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.890
So this is going to be a 1.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.400
So we're adding a 1 on the left.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.848
We're adding a 1 on the right.

00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:44.306
And the reason why
I did that is it

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:46.139
comes up with an
interesting simplification.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.630
We have the same
denominator here.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.840
If I add the numerators, 1
plus I plus 1 plus N minus 1

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.340
plus I. So this and this
are going to cancel out.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.790
And we're going to be left
with, in the numerator,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.190
we're just left with a 1 plus
the nominal interest rate.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.080
In the denominator, we just have
a 1 plus the rate of inflation

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.320
is equal to 1 plus the
real interest rate.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.670
And then we can multiply
both sides times the 1

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.800
plus I. Multiply both
sides times 1 plus I.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.150
And we get interesting result.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.650
And to some degree, this
is a common sense result.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.740
And I want to show you
that it's completely

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.865
consistent with everything
we've been doing so far.

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:30.400
These guys cancel out.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.780
And when you compounded by
the nominal interest rate,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.310
that's the same thing as
growing the real growth,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.170
and then that compounded by
the rate of inflation, which

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.390
actually makes a ton of sense.
