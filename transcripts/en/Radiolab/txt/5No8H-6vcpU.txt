Speaker 1:          00:00          Coach. I'm just going to go. Yeah, just go do it. Ready? Yep. This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad, and I'm Robert Krulwich with you today. Our topic is Zeus. We're doing a little sort of chronological thing, tracing the line from past to present, starting back at those old nasty concrete enclosures, which I'm sure you love to visit as a little boy.

Speaker 2:          00:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19          What do you mean? You know you're a city boy, you, you, you don't have much animals here. Oh, there's nothing to do with New York. What do you like? Tennessee [inaudible] fine, but when you talk about, you know, enriching the lives of gorillas as we did before the break. It's a simple heartwarming story cause gorillas and our out, they have their vegetarians. Rankling it gets a lot more complicated when you switch to a Predator who likes to pounce and chase and bite. Yes, you're going to put those animals in a cage and their whole being is organized around killing things. Well, what do you feed them? Mm, I the question to a NPR science reporter. Nell boys. If we're talking like the big carnivores, like the Tigers that would normally be out in the wild. Ripping other animals to shred. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What are they? They're eating mostly this, uh, this is a little bag of, um, uh, kibble. It's, it's basically like a dog food. Yeah. Check it out.

Speaker 2:          01:16          Well, this is for a meeting animal. Oh, again, try one. All right. Skinny. Oh, that's like getting chalk.

Speaker 1:          01:31          This is what the predators eat according to now. Really? Why don't they just give them meat? That's sort of what she wanted to know. Testing the mini days before heading to the zoo. Testing them in the days before heading to the zoo. No, recently took a trip to the Toledo zoo.

Speaker 3:          01:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Oh, hi. I'm here to see Ann. She wanted to know what it might look like if a zoo actually gave the predators what they want in this regard. The Toledo zoo is pretty radical. Once a year they have this event they call the big feed, the big feed, the big feed to be opening. Thank, you know, got there a day early just to check things out. Okay. So I duck behind the Rhino House, go behind the scenes here. I go in the back door.

Speaker 4:          02:10          And where I finally end up is this kind of thing. Nondescript pillow kitchen. This is the kitchen. We have a freezer and refrigerator down here. Don't think about a kitchen being at the zoo, but there's a kitchen here. Yes, yes, there. So I'm sorry, your name again? Was Beverly scooting over screen over? Yes. Beverly's going over. And this kitchen is actually the reason I came. This is our freezer. You can run about 10 below the rat and we actually have rats in about four sizes. We have large jumbo monsters. And then we have packs of 50 mice, packs of 25 mice. And then these are the fuzzies. These are probably about 10 days old. The fuzzies and the pinkies are pretty much newborn. Here's the basic idea. You want to get closer to what the animals actually eat in the wild. So you want to give them some sort of whole animals pull as in like all the first eyeballs whiskers. So, um, what are things different today? Because the big fetus tomorrow hooves hooves. Yeah, the Tigers are getting some calves and that's not something that we give out like all the time. Calves. Can we look at it? Yeah. So they take me into the

Speaker 5:          03:24          freezer and in the corner, just so the one, the floor is this box and it's got a black garbage bag kind of thing in it, which we opened up, you know, like looking right up at me. I happens to be, the head part is the baby cab, but that's just the head,

Speaker 4:          03:41          the head. It was like a little baby. We got it. Little eyelashes, little ears. It's a baby cow, you know? And I put, oh baby cow. And then I thought, oh my God, tomorrow little children are going gonna be watching this baby cow. It'd be ripped apart by a giant wild cat. They're wild animals. You know, they, they live in a captive situation, but they still have those wild instincts. That's Beth stark. She's the one who brought carcass feeding to the Toledo zoo. The time we hear, oh, carnivores are meat eaters, but really they're not just meat eaters, they're flesh eaters. They eat other animals. And one of the challenges there is is you know, how do we, how do we provide for the welfare of the animals that while at the same time providing for the needs of our visitors.

Speaker 5:          04:29          So it's about 10 o'clock in the morning and the gates are open now. So visitors are starting to stream in about 15 minutes or so. They're going to start the tiger feed. The tiger feeding was the first feeding of the day. A big crowd was beginning to gather. Right now the tigers aren't in the pen. How many people? Oh, like maybe 150 people. A lot of little kids. So we brought the boy down Ben pumps since my wife told me about it, so he made sure we got her early to check us out. The carcasses were already out. The zookeeper comes out with her microphone and like sort of gives a little [inaudible] and Richmond program description of carcass feeding sures that we meet, why they do it, all the animals behavioral needs as well as their psychological needs. And nobody at this point is listening to the interpretive discussion of this because as she's doing this, I think I heard a door, they let the tigers into the pen.

Speaker 5:          05:21          Oh look, here come the Tigers. Watch brand. Look, the big ones coming down. One of the tires just like streaks across the pan and grabs the car. It's like, you know, it starts like immediately playing with it and I have never seen in all my years of Zulu going, I have never seen a tiger move that fast. Like at 1.1 of the Tigers was like carrying one around by the ear. You could see like the little cafes and it was dragging it around and what were people doing? Were they cheering? Were they crying? There was nobody there that seemed to be disturbed. It really, although here was a conversation that I heard many, many times the children would say, what is that? What is he eating? And the parent would say, I put a baby cow hates a baby cow. And the kid would say, why is he doing it, honey? The Tigers have to, well, that's what he eats, the food that they eat, and the child said, well, I don't need cow. Yeah, you do. And the parent would say, what? Of course you eat cow at home, hamburgers, hamburger. What do you think a hamburger is out of cows? And they would just be this shocked look on the kid. And I must've heard that conversation like five times. It's food hunting.

Speaker 5:          06:45          No, it's food.

Speaker 4:          06:47          Wow. That's like a birds and the bees kind of moment. Yeah, it really was. People are just fascinated by it. They appreciate being so close.

Speaker 5:          06:54          I see them back there. Right?

Speaker 4:          06:57          They'll say, Oh guy, that's really gross. But then moving closer for a better view. What Beth stark was telling me is that, you know the whole time that they've been doing this carcass feeding program and they would interview people afterwards and ask them questions. We did survey people. How did you feel? What did you think? And found that more than, and what she found, 98% of them is that the public is pretty much uniformly very positive and what they saw. Enthusiastic. One of the questions we put on the survey is, do you want to see more of this in which animals would you like to see? And so what did people say just about everybody. From what I can remember circled every animal we put every just about every animal, every animal, you know, like, you know, do you wanna see dead rabbits? Do you want to see dead rats? Do you want to see dead calves? Do you want to see dead deers? And do you want them to see them fed to polar bears, tigers, wolves, you know, like a Chinese menu, you know, like, pick your prey animal, pick your predator. Do you want to see that? And they're like, yes, yes. We want to see this. The only complaints where people didn't want rabbits fed at Easter and around Easter, you know, parents complaining or worrying that their kid was thinking that the eastern bunny was being eaten.

Speaker 5:          08:05          It just shows you how, like what the animals eat at the zoo is fraught with sort of human emotions and ideas about right and wrong. Here's another example. Okay? So when I was at the tiger pen, there was this woman who came up and was very interested. She didn't seem turned off by the idea that they were eating a dead calf. Right? Yeah. But then she got this very strange look on her face and she said, I hope that was dead. And I said, well, does it does it manner? I mean, because at some point it died, you know, does it matter whether it died at the hands of a human or the hands of a tiger? And it was late in the afternoon and I'm ready to go. So I turn off my tape recorder and just at that second, even though she's just expressed sort of relief that the calf was dead when it was put in the tiger's pen, she starts to tell this story that was so diametrically opposed to what she had just expressed that I just had to turn my tape recorder back on and say like, wait a minute.

Speaker 5:          08:59          Wait, can you start at the whole beginning? So what was happening? What happened? Um, a squirrel health through that layers on the snow leopards cage. She and her daughter had been hanging out by the snow leopards pin. There's this sort of net kind of above the pen. And there was this squirrel that had been walking on the net and it fell down. Cereal is here, lay down into the snow lepers pants. And her daughter described the story to me where the snow leopard, who'd just been like kind of hanging out kind of board, immediately began to stop. The squirrel was pouncing and the squirrel like started trying to get away. Her mother said it was like the standard dot. Oh yes. Like the snow leopard was matching all of the moves of the score on c pilot a move for me. And like the audience was kind of transfixed.

Speaker 1:          09:43          Excellent.

Speaker 5:          09:43          Her daughter like could not watt head when she thought the Squirrel was coming down. Yeah. Yeah. She took off. Her daughter couldn't watch, was hiding her face. And in the end the squirrel escaped. The Squirrel got away. He was smarter. And I said to the girl, well, how did you feel? Were you rooting for the Leopard or the Squirrel? Which one? And she said, laughing. I was rooting for the snow leopard. Huh. And I said, but you didn't want to see it eat the squirrel and you, you didn't want to see that. And she said, well, I still want to fit the snow leopard because I didn't want to see it, but I still wanted to see it because it is cool but nature. Right. Yeah, the wild. I think that that the reason they felt comfortable watching that and telling me about it was because it seemed like a, an episode that was not between the animals in the human. It was between the animals.

Speaker 1:          10:42          What about you? If you were that little girl, how would you watch that whole scene when you watch it kind of gleefully or more sheepishly.

Speaker 5:          10:52          You just watch. It's just happening in front of you. I mean, that has nothing to do with you.

Speaker 1:          10:58          It's funny, you know, sh she never mentioned the possibility of feeding live animals to um, a predator. By the way, Nell Boys' is a science reporter for NPR. Thank you. Now, not those frozen rat sickle things, but, but something that scurry then you can, yeah. Live feeding is a line which Americans use will not cross. The only places that do feed out live animals as far as we could find are in China. Lucky for us. Yeah. I live in Beijing. That's where reporter Jocelyn Ford lifts just over an hours bus ride outside of Beijing. We ask Jocelyn to go visit one of these live feeding parks. That's what they're called. Live feeding bark. You just get on a bus. They'd drive you right into the lines then, and they'll even sell you chicken. The chickens are about $4 each and the tour people sell them right there on the bus riding the bus.

Speaker 6:          11:54          They don't have the lion's den and one of the people on the bus, one of the tourists decided often don't care. I'm going to buy a chicken. I'm going to feed the lion and I can get the Allen County jail. That side of the bus, the guy who bought the chicken, he would kick it up, rested again. Here come the lion, and soon we had four or five lions sitting right under our window looking at us. You're circling us. Dionysus looks very intense. I tell you, they had the most intense look I have ever seen him anywhere. I mean they have these very cold amber eyes, angry, hungry eyes. Whoa. He's looks like he's ready to pounce and the guy with the chicken just opened the window, drop the chicken out second that lion grab the chicken and just [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          13:15          It helped me smell it. Then I noticed that his legs were still quivering. Now it's working away at it just sort of lipping it to bits that say a pile of feathers. Did it tell you what's your house? You, what's on your base? I asked a grandmother who was on the bus, she was with something like a five year old and I asked her if she thought this was a healthy thing to have this hurt her, her grandson watching this cruel event and she said, hey, it'll make him a braver guy if you don't eat them first they're going to use. And she was just very matter of fact about it, that one woman said, we should teach our kids to love animals. But at the same time, if you know the bigger animal eats the smaller animal, that's the way the world works. So you should understand this survival of the fittest, just your Darwin, Darwin [inaudible] and you should also understand where you fit into it.

Speaker 6:          14:26          We'll get to the army. If you're weak and you can't run fast escape or whatever, you'll become somebody dinner. And that's the lesson of life I think. I think in the United States that we've, we're often so far removed from the ugly part of the food we eat. We just get squeamish when we see it. Whereas especially the, the, the rural people in China, you know, they deal with life and death of animals around them all the time. And I think we're just closing our eyes to it. I, having said that, I, I mean personally I feel that it does make for a more humane society when you do feel sorry or compassionate about the animals around you. And there was no concern at the safari park here. Nothing of that sort. It was all about funding. Dan's. Okay. So at the end of the best ride, they dropped you off. I got a little, little circus-like place and they had a little fake shooting gallery with all sorts of repeating music. And I went, I went and looked under this dirty old tent over some, some metal rods, and there were rows of cages and tigers pacing back and forth and yelling. Have you ever heard of a tiger? Yowell?

Speaker 7:          15:56          Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, the cage, just the length of his body turned around, but that's about it. [inaudible] okay,

Speaker 6:          16:34          thanks to reporter Justin Ford.
