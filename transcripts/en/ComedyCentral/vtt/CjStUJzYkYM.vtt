00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:05.571
ANNOUNCER:<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
 the 45th and final</i>

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.540
<i>President of the United States.</i>

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:09.542
(applause and cheering)

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.511
-(reporters clamoring)
-(camera shutters clicking)

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.349
Mr. President, Mr. President.

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:18.384
-Quick question, Mr. President.
-Okay, okay, okay.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:22.422
Okay, everyone calm down
and don't panic.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:26.225
As you know, only a few hours
ago I was in Paris

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:28.761
with President
Emmanuel Lewis Macaroni,

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:32.498
and his beautifully fit,
tight wife.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:36.102
That's the kind of hottie you
find in Paris, not Pittsburgh,

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.804
let me tell you.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.872
But the events of
the past few days

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:42.208
have forced me to return home
to update you

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.744
on the status
of this terrible outbreak.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.145
What outbreak?

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:49.015
The horrible virus that has
infected the brains

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:52.552
of millions of people, forcing
them them to believe bogus,

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.054
ridiculous,
well-documented things

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.623
about me and Russia.

00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:00.593
Some know it as Kremlin-fluenza.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:03.763
To others it's Mos-cow disease,

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:07.733
and to an unlucky few,
it's Spy-arrhea.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.769
Uh, those aren't diseases.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.270
Yes, they are.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:14.474
I'm wearing the science coat.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.210
It's spread through
fake news media

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.212
and I alone can fix it.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.315
Now, don't worry, we're gonna
contain this outbreak,

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:26.385
because tonight's theme
is containment.

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:28.187
I want to ask you
about your son.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.722
My son, Eric?

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:32.191
Thank you so much for asking.

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:33.893
He's doing so great.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:37.263
Clear eyes, soft gums,
can't lose.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.465
No, no, your other son.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:42.702
-Jared, of course.
-Donald, Jr.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.171
Well, in a way,
Jared is the junior

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.807
I never Donalded.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.976
Those emails prove
that your son met

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.444
with a surrogate of the
Russian government.

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:54.580
No parent wants to talk about
their first born.

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:57.783
Your first born is like
the first pancake.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:00.853
It's misshapen,
it's a disappointment,

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:05.091
and you wish you hadn't named it
after yourself.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.026
You name your pancakes?

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:10.229
Keep my pancakes
out of your mouth.

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:13.166
Now, everyone,
barricade your doors,

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.301
convert all your assets to gold,

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:17.870
and throw your loved ones
under the bus.

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:19.805
I'm the president,
collude believe it?

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:23.510
Let's roll.
