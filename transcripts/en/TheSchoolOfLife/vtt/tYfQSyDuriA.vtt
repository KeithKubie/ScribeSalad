00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.740
Life requires us to be very sane pretty much all the time.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.480
On a daily basis we have to be responsible, polite, productive, thoughtful, patient, logical, reliable,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.880
and dazzlingly successful too.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.020
These obligations slowly crept up on us as we were growing up.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.140
Now, they are our constant realities.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.140
The problem is no one can really keep going like this over a whole lifetime.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.140
The burdens are two great; our minds too delicate.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.440
Unfortunately, society doesn't give us much room to fall apart.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.380
It wants us at the desk 9 a.m. sharp every day with a PowerPoint ready to go,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.440
and the pressure doesn't let up to with finally released sleep past 11 at night.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.960
So we have no option but to keep going;

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.200
while on the side we may well be drinking too much, waking up at odd times of night, addicted to the internet,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.040
calming ourselves down with sedatives, and developing all kinds of physical twitches in ailments.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:09.980
But in truth no good life can or should go by without a few quite open incidence of complete breakdown.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.240
Moments when we pull up a white flag,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.960
and declare ourselves simply unable to cope or fulfill any of our normal functions for a time.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.760
Rather than seeing this as an illness, this should be interpreted as evidence of normality and even health.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.540
During our crazy moments we might be lying in bed staring at the ceiling for long periods,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.040
seeming to make no sense, wearing strange clothes, and sitting on the porch all day doing nothing, shouting,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.860
singing, dancing, cavorting, being silly in a way when hasn't been for decades,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.480
making some unusual new friends, and taking off to strange places.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.420
Naturally, such phases won't be easy for those around us,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.640
but we should, collectively, know how to tolerate these faces without panic as just part of ordinary life.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.480
We allow our bodies to have moments of break down and rest; we should allow similar moments for our minds.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.280
In any case, the so-called sane world is pretty disturbed too once one considers it frankly.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.980
It's apparently mental health that we set ourselves the task of energetically destroying the planet,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.620
work to meet punishing but arbitrary economic targets, leave ourselves no time for anything but work,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.120
drown in toxic media, and develop unrealistic expectations about our bodies, relationships, and families.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.300
No wonder we need periods of true madness as a corrective.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.400
That said, the emphasis should always be on having a good mental breakdown.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.160
A good one is where we allow ourselves to reconnect with valuable truths that we've lost sight of:

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.040
emotions and insights that ordinary life has prevented us from investigating.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.660
Perhaps sexual exploration, creativity, heedless, contact with our bodies, empathy, ecstasy,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.660
or a new kind of self-knowledge.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.780
The idea is that we should return from the land of madness and plant in the fields of apparent sanity

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.580
a lot of pretty valuable seeds that can bear fruit and sustain us in the periods ahead.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.000
We should, at a collective level, give ourselves unfrightened accounts of what mad episodes mean,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.680
confident that a reconciliation with the demands of the world will eventually re-emerge.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.340
We are not automatons, but highly complicated, volatile collections of proteins

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.780
that needs careful and sympathetic administration.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:42.040
We should expect that periods of madness just do belong to every wise and good life.
