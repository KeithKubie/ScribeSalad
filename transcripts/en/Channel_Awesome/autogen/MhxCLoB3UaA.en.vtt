weird<00:03:35.620><c> a</c><00:03:35.950><c> strange</c><00:03:36.340><c> stuff</c><00:03:36.519><c> in</c><00:03:36.670><c> this</c><00:03:36.760><c> one</c><00:03:36.910><c> but</c>

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 align:start position:0%
weird a strange stuff in this one but
 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.449 align:start position:0%
weird a strange stuff in this one but
the<00:03:38.109><c> only</c><00:03:38.290><c> one</c><00:03:38.410><c> I</c><00:03:38.440><c> found</c><00:03:38.620><c> out</c><00:03:38.799><c> of</c><00:03:38.980><c> character</c>

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 align:start position:0%
the only one I found out of character
 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.870 align:start position:0%
the only one I found out of character
perhaps<00:03:39.700><c> is</c><00:03:40.120><c> that</c><00:03:40.780><c> Finn</c><00:03:41.440><c> would</c><00:03:41.739><c> scrub</c><00:03:42.160><c> as</c><00:03:42.370><c> much</c>

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps is that Finn would scrub as much
 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps is that Finn would scrub as much
as<00:03:43.120><c> he</c><00:03:43.269><c> does</c><00:03:43.480><c> like</c><00:03:43.750><c> he</c><00:03:43.900><c> really</c><00:03:44.440><c> screws</c><00:03:45.099><c> up</c><00:03:45.130><c> in</c>
