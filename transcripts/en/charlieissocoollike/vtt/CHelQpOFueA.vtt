00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.610
So, the world that we live in continues
to exist in a constant state of change, 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.790
and my life is no exception
to that rule. 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.430
What I'm trying to say is that I moved out.
You guessed that already, didn't you. 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.730
Casa de Cherimon is dead and gone.
Me and Alex have had our housemate divorce now. 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.860
I managed to keep all of the kids,
which makes me very happy. 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.030
He's only going to see them on fortnights,
but they love him more, so.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.720
Currently, I'm living
in house limbo. 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.300
I'm waiting to move into my
new flat, and while I do that, 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.320
I am staying here
with my girlfriend. 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.720
Ahh! He's got a girlfriend.
Yeah I do.  

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.920
Did you seriously think
this was my new bed? 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.840
She's called Emily, the same
Emily that I mentioned last week. 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.790
We've been dating for about six months now,
it's been going very, very well, 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.310
and I appreciate you not making a big deal
out it, thank you very much.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.470
There is something a little emasculating
about sleeping in this bed,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.090
and what you can't see is the whole thing is
patterned with many, many tiny little flowers, 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.990
but I think the thing that all men have
to deal with at some point in their lives

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.790
is the fact that we do kind
of like pretty things. 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.950
There is no doubt in my mind that
I wouldn't feel comfortable 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.210
going into a store and buying pink
detergent that smelled like lilies, 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.480
but, at the same time, I'm not going
to be complaining about the fact

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.150
that I will be smelling delightful
for the next two months. 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.890
Now while I'm staying here, I've had to move
the majority my stuff into storage, 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.760
which meant hiring a
Man and Van Service, 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.810
also known as the
Feel Pathetic and Puny Service. 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.980
Ciaran was nice enough to come over that
day in the hopes that he would help me  move, 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.230
but we spent the majority
of the time just sitting there, 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.830
watching a much more capable human
doing all of the moving for us. 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.010
And the one time when we did offer to
help out, we tried to move a desk 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.450
through the doorway and through the hallway,
and the moving guy was very much like, 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.920
"You should probably take the legs off before
you do that. It'll make it much easier."

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.020
But we were like, "No, we can use our
superior intellects to maneuver this

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.410
door in a way that will get
us horrendously stuck. 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.250
Eventually, we just had to bring it back
and take the legs of, like he suggested, 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.590
because he knows best 'cause
he moves stuff for a living. 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.490
Not everything that I own did
make it out of that house. 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.250
There was some stuff that I was like,
"You know, I should throw this away, 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.630
but it's a little bit too big and maybe
a little bit too cool to do that," 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.710
so, what I decided to do was
hide it in the attic. 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.950
So, when the next owner final
does decide to look up there, 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.040
they're going to have what I think
is a treasure trove of goodies. 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.950
They're going to find a couple of VCR players, an obnoxious
electronic Nerf Gun, and a unicycle. 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.200
Remember that unicycle?
Never learned how to rid that unicycle. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.870
As a whole, the moving experience has
been a mixed bag to say the least. 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.790
It's mostly just been
horrendously stressful. 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.810
But absolutely nothing compares to the
experience of being the last person to leave the house 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.380
and shutting the door, knowing
that your keys are still inside. 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.060
It was like leaving a hotel room
and like worrying that you might have 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.440
left something in there
times a thousand. 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.390
It was so stressful, but it
also kind of invigorating. 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.990
I would kind of recommend
moving to anyone 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.550
just so you can have that experience
once in your life. 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.130
It's pretty great. So, yeah. I've moved, gonna be
in my new place in a couple of months time, 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.010
and I have decided, to myself, that
when I move into my new place 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.690
after I've settled in a little bit,
I'm gonna get a kitten 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.500
because Alex never really liked animals
and I'm gonna be living on my own 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.940
and I quite like a little companion. 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.250
So there you go. That's a change
you're excited about. 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.870
Exactly. See you later. 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.180
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.220
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.590
Okay, here's last week's video
in case you missed it. 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.280
It's all about how I made my
second short film, "Offline." 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.190
It also happens to be the last video
ever to be shot in Casa de Cherimon, 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.640
so, very important historical record that everyone
should see at least once in their lives. 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.650
I promise, you'll be telling your grandkids where
you were when you saw, "Making Offline." 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.517
Alright, bye.
