00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.050
A lot of the games we've been talking
about use consumable in-app purchases.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.260
But there are three main
types of in-app purchases.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.240
Consumables, entitlements,
and subscriptions.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.520
Consumables are items that
get used up in the game.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.550
Sort of like food you consume and
have to keep buying.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.900
Only these are usually power ups that
you have to buy or earn over and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.160
over again.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.060
Entitlements are things that
the player buys and then gets to keep.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.015
Like a sword you get to keep or
level you can permanently unlock.

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:33.935
And finally, subscriptions
are things that the player gets

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:35.835
as long as they keep playing.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.265
Sort of like entitlements,
only you have to renew them over time.

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:42.195
So these are the three main
types of in-app purchases.

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:44.025
Let's look at some
real examples of these.
