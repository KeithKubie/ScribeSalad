00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,690
Hello, I'm Jad album rod and I'm
Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,470
We're still talking about numbers and
now we're going to switch though it'd be

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,180
it'd be fatigued, some of us, if you
think about them a little differently,

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,760
if you learn to embrace them
and give them a bit of a hug,

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,100
wonderful things can happen. I'm
going to introduce you to a m. Well,

18
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:13,600
a nosy man named Mark Nigrini.
I'm an associate professor.

19
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:18,220
At the school of business at the College
of New Jersey has a really heavy New

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,460
Jersey accent, but what he really likes
to do, what kind of accident was that?

21
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,450
It was kind of a, I originally
grew up in Cape Town, South Africa.

22
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:29,410
South African. Yes. He likes to
play detective and the clues,

23
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:31,410
he looks for numbers. I,

24
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:34,880
I can't walk past the number
without just wondering about it.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,570
What went into that number?
How did it get there?

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,580
For example, after I finished
filling up at a gas station,

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,140
sometimes I would just walk around and
look at the dollar amounts on the pump.

28
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,130
So he peaks in at the pump right
next door and it's rather amazing.

29
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:56,360
You can almost tell who's been
there before. If you see a number,

30
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:01,190
like a dollar 40 then you know,
oh teenager with no money. Why?

31
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:03,880
Wait, explain that. Cause that's
all the kid can afford. Quite dry.

32
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,220
Sometimes I'll see $10 and
40 cents and I'll say, ah,

33
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:10,220
you meant to do $10 but
you are a bit slow today.

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,070
So you'd go to the gas pumps and they
tell you all the [inaudible] little short

35
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,540
stories. Yes.

36
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,750
And his favorite story that numbers tell
actually starts back in 1938 so imagine

37
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:27,090
an office in Schenectady, New York
at the GE research laboratories.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,660
And in that office is a man
and he's sitting at his desk,

39
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,580
Mr. Frank Benford and Mr. Frank Benford
is a physicist and he's doing some

40
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,920
difficult calculations. I
was hunched over a book,

41
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,020
probably actually the one of the
most boring books you could imagine.

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,950
This is a book of logarithmic tables,
what our luck and with nicotine.

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,250
So locked tables were a very convenient
way of doing multiplication in the early

44
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:56,220
part of the last century. So remember
this is before there were calculators.

45
00:02:56,221 --> 00:03:01,221
So if you want it to multiply something
like a 145 times 3,564 you could just go

46
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,970
to this book and look it up.
So each starts with numbers.

47
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,360
You might want to multiply by one
new a hundred on the first page.

48
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,400
That 101 hundred and two up to 200 and
300 and the back of the book is like nine

49
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,540
hundreds the further you go,

50
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,840
the higher and higher the numbers
you use to multiply that trade.

51
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,100
So our Benford fellow,

52
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,130
he's sitting there doing miscalculations
and he's looking at the numbers

53
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,810
flipping to the bone.

54
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,410
He's staring at the pages and notices
something kind of weird. United State.

55
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,730
The first few pages were more
worn than the last few pages,

56
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:38,290
meaning more smudgy and darker and oily
as if he was using the front of the book

57
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,400
more than the last few pages. And
he wondered why is this happening?

58
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,570
Strange, not aware of favoring one
part of the book over the other.

59
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,550
Am I doing something a little?
Huh? Or maybe it's something

60
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,450
and that's when it hit him.

61
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,550
He thought maybe in this world
the are more numbers with loafers,

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,300
digits and with heifers, digits.

63
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,190
What more numbers that
start with one or two.

64
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,980
The numbers that start with seven,

65
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,470
eight or nine yet just because
his book is more, that's where,

66
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,630
that's what started him
thinking. So here's what he did.

67
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,750
He compiled some tens of thousands
of statistics that Steve Strogatz

68
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,500
mathematician at Cornell University,

69
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,940
just anything he could think of that
was numerical molecular weights of

70
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:26,090
different chemicals, baseball
statistics, census data,

71
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,560
revenues of all the companies listed on
the main stock exchanges in America and

72
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,580
everywhere he looked at all these
different category it seemed, yes,

73
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,450
there were more numbers beginning with
one in twos, that eights and nines wait,

74
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,670
really? Oh yeah, this has been
checked out again and again and again.

75
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,000
And it's true, it's eyes of rivers,
earthquakes and things like that.

76
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,230
Populations or a number of deaths
in a war, areas of counties,

77
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,820
stream flow data. What if you were to say,

78
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,600
get all the people in New York together
and look at their bank accounts,

79
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,250
bank account balances,

80
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,550
follow Benford's lonely perfectly meaning
that if you just look in at the amount

81
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:04,520
of money that people have,

82
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,780
matter of fact the in all the Mankins
you'll find they begin with one more often

83
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:10,760
than they begin with two perfectly. Yes.

84
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,270
So actually they begin
with one 30.1% of the time.

85
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:17,360
They'll begin with a to 17.6% of the time,

86
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,770
they'll begin with a three 12.5% of
the time. That's a big endurance.

87
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,380
Why was three DB, I'm sorry,

88
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:28,381
I keep going and the poor nine would
only occur as a first digit 4.6% of the

89
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:29,474
time,

90
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,340
which actually would make
the one approximately six
times as likely as the mine

91
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,780
and is quite amazing. That is more than
quite amazing. That's deeply suspicious.

92
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,210
I mean this is crazy what I'm telling
you and I can't give you good intuition

93
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:42,871
why it's true.

94
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:47,820
But Steve and mark and mini mini mini
map petitions would tell you despite what

95
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:50,520
you may think, there is a preference,

96
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,920
a deep preference in the world.

97
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:57,890
It seems for number sequences that
start with ones and then twos and then

98
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,890
threes. Um, I'm Robert

99
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,800
[inaudible] [inaudible] so what,

100
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,323
okay,

101
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,500
well this is not just a mathematical
curiosity jad no, no, no.

102
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:18,610
There is something you can do
with this information. What? Well,

103
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,670
when Mark Nigrini first
ran across Benford's law,

104
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,500
he thought, [inaudible],

105
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,860
maybe I can use this law,

106
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,493
the bus

107
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,520
for payroll fraud tax
return for you thought, hey,

108
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:37,090
we can use this to catch a thief. That's
right, huh? Hello, welcome to green.

109
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,950
He figured, if you look at a
bunch of numbers that they bank,

110
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,050
state minister expense report and so on,

111
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,940
and you see that the numbers
in the business do not
match the natural pattern of

112
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,774
Benford's loss,

113
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,260
or the numbers don't begin with one's
more than the and movie with Twos,

114
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,460
one with threes and so on. Then you
could say, hey, this is not natural.

115
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,390
This may not be true. This may be

116
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,420
fraud.

117
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,550
So he started giving lectures on the
idea that Binford is a way to catch

118
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,910
thieves. The only problem was they
didn't quite believe Benford's law,

119
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,440
which means the rest of my
talk isn't gonna go anywhere.

120
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,040
It is now my great
pleasure to introduce you,

121
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,460
one of the most fabulous people
I've ever had the name to say,

122
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,810
Darrow d Durrell [inaudible].

123
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,280
That will be the relativity. I definitely,

124
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,890
totally [inaudible] lead or it's
an illiterate to literative heaven.

125
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,440
It's like Palindromic yeah.
Itch Darrell Darell. Oh

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,270
Wow. And um, but I should say
Darryl is, uh, what did he call it?

127
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,850
He calls it, I'm a forensic
accountant. Forensic Accountant.

128
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,170
[inaudible] it means his job is to examine
numbers and figures to see if someone

129
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,480
is stealing. It's an
investigative process.

130
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,480
And while at first he was
unsure about Benford's law,

131
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,290
but skeptical.

132
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:01,290
One day I happened to talk to one of my
neighbors who was a retired statistics

133
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:03,910
professor and he should, oh.

134
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,970
Benford I have my students
do that proof every year.

135
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,110
He actually wrote out the proof
for me and it just, it's immutable,

136
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,120
which are your mathematical law.
And now it's one of his [inaudible]

137
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,420
favorite tools of his trade. We
have a case right now underway,

138
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,380
relatively small company, family
shareholders. There are four of them.

139
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,600
One of them feels like she has been,
uh, misrepresented as a shareholder.

140
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,030
Meaning she thinks these other three guys
may be stealing. [inaudible] yes. Ah,

141
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:36,950
yes. And I know you can't tell
us what this business is doing,

142
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,290
but is it a [inaudible]

143
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,270
say a regulated vision?

144
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,490
It's a vision that each of you purchase
on a regular basis through your local

145
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,330
governmental authority. [inaudible]
trash collection or lane. Sure.

146
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,060
Anyway, it's one woman thought
that she was being cheated,

147
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,290
so she's got an attorney involved.
The attorney requested data,

148
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,610
so we have seven years of income
tax returns and that's all he had.

149
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,280
Just tax returns [inaudible] yes, so
he edited them all into the computer,

150
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,320
aggregates them, run Benford's
and clicked on the graph.

151
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,190
We instantly saw NGO for
a couple of the years,

152
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,830
coincident with when the dispute began.

153
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,930
The way they've reported their taxes
violates Benford's very suspicious.

154
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,970
Yes. Blew out the Benford's pattern.

155
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,130
You mean like there are too
many nines on the tax returns?

156
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,980
Meaning if you look at the
tax returns at this company,

157
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,040
you will see a pattern that
isn't natural. Exactly.

158
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,880
Not enough ones and too many
sevens, eights, and nines,

159
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,390
but now you have to convince detectives
and then lawyers and then judges that

160
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,070
this is real evidence of wrongdoing,
but they've not heard of this thing.

161
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,613
Benford's she don't know about it.

162
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,340
As a practical tool has probably
been around maybe 10 years,

163
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,680
maybe 15 at the outset.

164
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm at a conference now with about 700

165
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,570
[inaudible] all of you here,

166
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,130
I've spoken four times and each
time I've asked about Binford,

167
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,390
who's heard of it? Who's familiar
with Benford's law? Maybe,

168
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,700
maybe 5% of the people.

169
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,370
Can you just look at penny a
couple observations? To me,

170
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,320
it doesn't make sense to
exclude the community when
your same result and they're

171
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:22,681
asking,

172
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:26,940
do judges allow Ben for the in as evidence
suggest that someone's committed a

173
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:27,780
crime there?

174
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,130
Case Law out there that actually cite
the use of Benford's law and Daryl tells

175
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,700
them, oh yeah, yes, you can use this
evidence in court. Yes, federal,

176
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,130
state and local from the
experiences we've had.

177
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,160
And then he tells them stories like the
case of the CEO stealing money to buy

178
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,360
automobile firearms, artwork,
jewelry run Benford's you, she, you,

179
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,260
you're still in federal prison or
the case of the dentist and his wife,

180
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:55,890
she began having an affair with a guy
who turned out to be a mess dealer.

181
00:10:55,891 --> 00:11:00,780
The dentist suspected her of having dipped
into the till run Benford's and boom,

182
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,891
busted.

183
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:06,891
She eventually pled or the guy with a $40
million Ponzi scheme run Benford's and

184
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,360
well almost boom. I mean, benefits
was an element in all these cases.

185
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,320
It wasn't the clincher,

186
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:18,321
but still it is a very compelling argument
and 10 years from now it'll be the

187
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,310
equivalent of a fingerprint.

188
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,210
[inaudible]

189
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,930
that's it. Huh? You still haven't
addressed the central mystery here.

190
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,410
Why in the world would there
be more ones than knives?

191
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:42,640
Shouldn't they be equally, uh,
equally coincidence? Yes. Well,

192
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:47,170
the answer is actually very
complicated and deeply mathematical.

193
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:49,870
The simple answer is, is
there an answer to that? Yes,

194
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:52,870
there is an answer and it has to do,
do you understand the answer? No.

195
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,100
I mean, I understand that it has
to do with logarithms and the,

196
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,760
and the business of doubling
and the culture of numbers.

197
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,540
But if you were to sit me down and say,
explain it to me carefully and, well,

198
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:09,300
I mean, no, it's just too numeric
for me to explain it to you.

199
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,583
Okay. Alright.

200
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,360
But I will now take a little sidestep to
a group of people who would be able to

201
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:17,250
explain it to us if
they were in this room.

202
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:20,100
But we didn't find them in this room.
We found them in, in other rooms.

203
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,360
We're rarely in the same
room that they are. Yeah.

204
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,330
So let's go with our reporter Ben Calhoun
and meet a crowd of mathematicians.

205
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,880
Ben. Yup. You'd decided to,

206
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,940
I don't know what some kind of a busman's
holiday you wanted to go to a math

207
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,300
conference. I did badly.
And what happened? Well,

208
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:40,630
I went to CUNY, which is the
City University of New York,

209
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,670
and it was a math conference called it.

210
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:48,520
It was on Combinator tutorial and
additive number theory. Oh, a good time.

211
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:52,150
Had by all, yeah. Goes by the,
a optimistic acronym camp.

212
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,770
So I had heard that if
I went to this room,

213
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,330
there was going to be a bunch of
mathematicians from all over the place,

214
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,800
petition from Sweden attending, and
they would be able to tell me condoms,

215
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,420
college, what their name was,

216
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,610
but they would have this other way
of identifying themselves. Right.

217
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,030
They had this number. My
number is two three two yeah,

218
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,700
three, three two minus three
actually. Oh, nice. Yeah,

219
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,820
I'm really excited about it. What, what,
what? What is the, what does it mean?

220
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,210
I'm okay too. I'm a three. Well, it's
an air dish number with an ear dish.

221
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,980
Air Dish is a guy. Oh,

222
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,040
so your air dish number is how many
steps away you are from this Guy Paul air

223
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:39,990
dish. So you're going to tell me his
story. Yup. Hey, you ready? Okay,

224
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,110
let me turn off my cell phone
so we don't ruin the best take.

225
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,090
That's Paul Hoffman. He
wrote a book about Paul dish.

226
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,300
So we start out in Budapest,

227
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:53,301
Hungary in 1913 it's spring two math
teachers have a son named Paul and he had

228
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:54,990
two sisters.

229
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:59,130
They were three and five in the had
scarlet fever and they died the day he was

230
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,080
born. I mean,

231
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,880
imagine that his mother loses her
two daughters and gains a son.

232
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,320
Oh my God. Yeah.

233
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:12,180
She was so terrified after that that
Paul would get a fatal disease and die,

234
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,080
that she didn't let him leave the house
pretty much for the first 10 years of

235
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:19,020
his life. She didn't let
him play with other kids.

236
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,970
Really didn't let him go to school,
didn't let him go outside. Also,

237
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:24,960
when he was one and a half,

238
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:29,670
his dad was captured and put in a Soviet
prisoner of war camp for six years of

239
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:30,504
his life.

240
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,920
So here's this kid at home
without other children around.

241
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,350
His mother is out teaching mathematics.

242
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,970
All the books in the house were math and
he taught himself basically to read by

243
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:43,410
looking at these math books.

244
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:48,330
And he also said to me that numbers
became my best friends. So I mean,

245
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:52,520
here's a kid who's, you know, whole
life has mathematics from the beginning,

246
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,070
but let's fast forward.

247
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,270
Paul Arish gets his phd in his early
twenties this is in the early 1930s

248
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,560
[inaudible]. Paul [inaudible] is
Jewish, which means he knows the,

249
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:11,120
he's got to get out of Hungary, that
he managed to get to the United States,

250
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,970
but he has to leave his family behind.

251
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,990
When the Nazis moved into Budapest,

252
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,350
four of his mother's five
siblings were killed.

253
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,920
His father died as they were occurred
in Jews and trying to move them into the

254
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,080
ghetto, and they only had his mother left,

255
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,990
but she was in Hungary.

256
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,850
And in 1941 Paul dish was
at Princeton University.

257
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,100
He was just 27 years old,

258
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,800
completely cut off from his family.
He was lonely and he was homesick.

259
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,110
I mean, this guy had no
conventional friendships.

260
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,880
He had no sexual relationships.

261
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:50,630
His only contact with the girl
was the people he worked with.

262
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,390
I mean,

263
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,430
that's what's remarkable to me is other
people who had been through this kind of

264
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:01,180
life experience might've ended up
in a mental institution or worse,

265
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,493
but he didn't.

266
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,590
He turned this sort of inwardness into
making mathematics a joyous and social

267
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:12,640
occasion. He started connecting
with people. I don't get this.

268
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:15,700
Like what do you mean?
Well, he started traveling.

269
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,050
He would hear about somebody who was
working on something interesting and he

270
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:21,850
would find a way to get there,

271
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,700
show up at their door and he had
this phrase that he would say,

272
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:30,090
my brain is open and he was there to work
with them on whatever it was that they

273
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:35,701
were working on and he just kept moving
mid a circuit of 25 different countries.

274
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Eventually he gave up almost all of his
possessions and he became essentially

275
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,070
homeless. He had no home, he had no home.

276
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,080
So everywhere he went people had to
put him up. And as a house guest,

277
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,950
the man was an acquired taste. He
didn't know how to do basic things.

278
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:56,440
He couldn't cook, he couldn't
even boil water for tea.

279
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,060
He could barely change his clothes.

280
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,810
Your dish didn't know how to tie his own
shoes until he was 11 he had some kind

281
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:06,160
of skin condition, so they only wore
silk, silk clothes. You had to wash.

282
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,760
I mean he went through life this
way and there was the schedule.

283
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,510
He did mathematics 20 to 22 hours a day.

284
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:18,090
He Bang pots and pans around
in the kitchen at 4:00 AM
because he wanted you to

285
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:19,750
come downstairs and do more math.

286
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,930
So why would anybody want
a visit from this guy?

287
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:24,440
This sounds like a walking
nightmare. You Cook for him.

288
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,360
I stay with him and wash his
clothes regardless of his shoes.

289
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,990
Regardless of all of it. You
wanted him to come see you. Why?

290
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,740
Because he was just that good.

291
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,820
This was like God coming to visit
you. He knew your strengths,

292
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:41,940
he knew how you thought and it
was fascinating to watch him.

293
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,900
I mean there were times like I went
with him to a math conference and he was

294
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:50,070
there in his hotel room and at one point
there were like 10 or 12 in the room.

295
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:51,390
Some are sprawled on his bed,

296
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:55,440
some are sitting on the floor and he'd
be working with one for a few minutes and

297
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,800
then he would turn to another and then
he'd go back to a third and he was

298
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:02,610
working simultaneously with all
these people in different problems.

299
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,340
Paul Air Dish wrote more
papers and collaborated with
more people than any other

300
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:11,910
mathematician who's ever lived.
He did mathematics with anybody,

301
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,230
even if the person was a dim bald.
[inaudible] well did mathematics.

302
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,620
Now let me just, what's
this people can do?

303
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,040
This is a Paul air dish
on his 80th birthday.

304
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,650
That's the only one dovish by an old man.

305
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:29,850
You can save so easy cue
of Zane curable disease,

306
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:34,851
a fly surrounded by a lot
of the mathematicians who
loved him and put him up in

307
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:39,240
their house. We want to express our deep,

308
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,220
warm feeling to you and I want wanted
to raise your distance for you.

309
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,683
He was a saint,

310
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,450
a singer, a saint.

311
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,620
That's Joel Spencer. He's a mathematician.

312
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,780
He was also friends with Paul Paula dish.

313
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,870
Now that he is is gone.

314
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,900
I think of him sometimes in a
religious context because he,

315
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:12,430
he gave this faith to those of
us that are doing mathematics,

316
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,280
which after all is if you
look at it from the outside,

317
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,680
it's a little bit of a strange activity.

318
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:22,681
While you put this enormous effort
into finding these these statements,

319
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,080
mathematicians will spend years of their
lives trying to prove these things that

320
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,430
you know from the outside look
totally obscure and pointless.

321
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,670
And yet it was clear working with him
that what we were doing was we were trying

322
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:45,221
to find truth with a capital t truth
that transcends our physical universe.

323
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,250
I think that's the reason why we like
to talk about our connection to Paul

324
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,590
because our feeling of mathematics,

325
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,780
that feeling for what we want mathematics
to be Paul Erdish was the embodiment.

326
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,890
Somewhere along the way,

327
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,220
mathematicians started keeping track of
their connection to Paul air dish and

328
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,930
that's what air dish numbers actually are.

329
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,560
If you published a paper with Paul
[inaudible], your air dish number is one.

330
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,640
If you published a paper with someone
else and they published a paper with Paul

331
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,460
Ordish, then your Erdish
numbers two and so on and so on.

332
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:35,380
So this is like all the people that Paul
ear additions some way has touched all

333
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:38,530
the people who are connected
to him through their ideas.

334
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,660
There are about 500 people
with [inaudible] number
one and about 8,000 people

335
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:45,590
with their, just number two. This

336
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,610
is professor Jerry Grossman at the
University of Oakland in Michigan.

337
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,580
And what he did was he took each ring
of erudition numbers and he charted it

338
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:55,414
out.

339
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,320
Heritage number three has
about 34,000 people in it, uh,

340
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,300
84,000 with their addition number
four, then they start decreasing

341
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,470
44,000 that's a lot of people.

342
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:10,250
So if you go ring upon ring upon ring
and you and you do the whole deal,

343
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:13,970
like how many people did this
man in the end influence,

344
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,910
I think it's about 200,000 mathematicians.

345
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,020
200,000

346
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,530
[inaudible]

347
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,920
200,000 picture that for a second.

348
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,550
It's like a solar system with more than
200,000 mathematicians all orbiting

349
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,520
around Paul Air Dish

350
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,140
[inaudible]

351
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,470
and your air dish number is

352
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,140
one it yes,

353
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,390
Dennis Eichorn is a number two
and your dish number is two.

354
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,990
I wrote a paper with, uh, my
advisor and the other students,

355
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,880
and she had written a paper
with a mathematician who
had written a paper with my

356
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,730
oldest number is three. Your
erudition number is one.

357
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,720
And everybody with heritage number
one knows that they've got that post.

358
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,680
Everybody in this room knows their
numbers. I would be very surprised if Kara

359
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,430
[inaudible],

360
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:27,430
Ben Calhoun's erudition number is oh
0.5778 dash minus one radical six coming

361
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:35,300
up, a story from our friend Steve
Strogatz, the mathematician from Cornell,

362
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:36,980
who tells about a friendship.

363
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,890
He has a very precious
friendship with his math teacher.

364
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,550
So it's all about mathematician, but
this is a very unusual friendship.

365
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,040
And Chad Abu [inaudible], I'm
Robert Krulwich sticking around.
