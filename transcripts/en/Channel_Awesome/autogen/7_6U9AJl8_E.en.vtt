but most of it are things I think I can
 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.490
but most of it are things I think I can
find or alter relatively easily there

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500
find or alter relatively easily there
 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.690

depth of field and leave the background
a little dark so that we don't really we

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:22.149
a little dark so that we don't really we
 

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:23.489
a little dark so that we don't really we
just get a hint of things that are going

00:12:23.489 --> 00:12:23.499
just get a hint of things that are going
 

00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:25.410
just get a hint of things that are going
on back there so I just hung some

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:25.420
on back there so I just hung some
 

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.260
on back there so I just hung some
curtains

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:26.270
curtains
 

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.330
curtains
and some fake windows to kind of give

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:28.340
and some fake windows to kind of give
 

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.700
and some fake windows to kind of give
the illusion but in the background that

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:30.710
the illusion but in the background that
 

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.190
the illusion but in the background that
they're in the restaurant you know you

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:36.950
that to and all kind of helps give the
 

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:37.800
that to and all kind of helps give the
illusion

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:37.810
illusion
 

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.060
illusion
so hopefully that works out I don't know

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.070
so hopefully that works out I don't know
 

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.860
so hopefully that works out I don't know
we kind of did some tests and it seemed

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:41.870
we kind of did some tests and it seemed
 

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.200
we kind of did some tests and it seemed
to look ok so kind of depends on how

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.210
to look ok so kind of depends on how
 

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.700

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:52.550
we'll find out so now on this side I
 

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.350
we'll find out so now on this side I
just we put some batten lights behind

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360
just we put some batten lights behind
 

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.950
just we put some batten lights behind
this structure with blue lights in them

00:12:59.950 --> 00:12:59.960
this structure with blue lights in them
 

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.470
this structure with blue lights in them
so it's going to shine up let you

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480
so it's going to shine up let you
 

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.880
so it's going to shine up let you
luminate the back wall it kind of gives

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:03.890
luminate the back wall it kind of gives
 

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.860
luminate the back wall it kind of gives
a really kind of cool blue light effect

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:05.870
a really kind of cool blue light effect
 

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.970
a really kind of cool blue light effect
and then I made these orbs just out of

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:09.980
and then I made these orbs just out of
 

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.430
and then I made these orbs just out of
some cheap LEDs hanging from string

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.440
some cheap LEDs hanging from string
 

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.770
some cheap LEDs hanging from string
whatever just to kind of give it another

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:14.780
whatever just to kind of give it another
 

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.970
whatever just to kind of give it another
extra look so the two lights against the

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:18.980
extra look so the two lights against the
 

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.040
extra look so the two lights against the
black background with the blue light

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.050
black background with the blue light
 

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.720
black background with the blue light
shining up and stuff like that some

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:22.730
shining up and stuff like that some
 

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.240
shining up and stuff like that some
splash of color I think will give the

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:25.250
splash of color I think will give the
 

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.710
splash of color I think will give the
illusion that they're in kind of like a

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720
illusion that they're in kind of like a
 

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.690
illusion that they're in kind of like a
a bar or a nightclub or something like

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:28.700
a bar or a nightclub or something like
 

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.610
a bar or a nightclub or something like
that so again it's only for like a

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:30.620
that so again it's only for like a
 

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.930
that so again it's only for like a
couple of shots that they're going to

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:31.940
couple of shots that they're going to
 

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.390
couple of shots that they're going to
need it for it's just to give it a

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:34.400
need it for it's just to give it a
 

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.920
need it for it's just to give it a
little bit of a look it's going to be

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:35.930
little bit of a look it's going to be
 

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.160
little bit of a look it's going to be
sort of out of focus so that way we can

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.170
sort of out of focus so that way we can
 

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.750
sort of out of focus so that way we can
just shoot it practically again and duck

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760
just shoot it practically again and duck
 

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.150
just shoot it practically again and duck
and edit it quicker so we don't get the

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160
and edit it quicker so we don't get the
 

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.800
and edit it quicker so we don't get the
opportunity to shoot a lot of set pieces

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:44.810
opportunity to shoot a lot of set pieces
 

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.080
opportunity to shoot a lot of set pieces

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.250
it in my teeth and because I really
 

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.879
it in my teeth and because I really
didn't have very many lines while I had

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:50.889
didn't have very many lines while I had
 

00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:52.679

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:40.149
and then it would fall out so we tried
 

00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:43.139
and then it would fall out so we tried
several times to do it and I went back

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:43.149
several times to do it and I went back
 

00:16:43.149 --> 00:16:46.020
several times to do it and I went back
to even trying to do the foil but

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:46.030
to even trying to do the foil but
 

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.450

didn't have really a lot of time to come
 

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.330
didn't have really a lot of time to come
up with a solution so we that's why we

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:57.340
up with a solution so we that's why we
 

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.540
up with a solution so we that's why we

then we had to add the beard and
everything so we kind of again came up

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640
everything so we kind of again came up
 

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.450
everything so we kind of again came up
with the idea of just putting we had a

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:51.460
with the idea of just putting we had a
 

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.200
with the idea of just putting we had a
wig cap that was a dark brown kind of

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.210
wig cap that was a dark brown kind of
 

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.490

like that to see how would look and
 

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.100
like that to see how would look and
basically we just decided that that

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:05.110
basically we just decided that that
 

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.500
basically we just decided that that
combined with just keeping the mask on

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:07.510
combined with just keeping the mask on
 

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.230
combined with just keeping the mask on
but like pulled up would alleviate

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240
