00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.840
Ever wonder what you did to deserve harsh
treatment from others?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.310
Well, sometimes it's not you but the work
people have to put in to improve their habits.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.559
Whether it's their deep-rooted insecurities
that caused them to lash out at you or their

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.160
inability to let go of the past, know that
you don't have to tolerate the toxic behavior

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.869
that people have to work out on their own.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.900
Here are five types of unhealthy people you
should walk away from, one; the Green Monster.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.910
Do you know someone who never seems happy
when you achieve something or always gets

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.170
competitive even over the littlest of things?

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.900
When jealousy drives them, it creates tension
between you two instead of building an authentic

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.780
supportive relationship.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.730
Envious feelings can also make it hard for
the individual to be happy for you when you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.210
want to celebrate special moments with them.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.399
Don't play into their comparison games and
never downplay your own achievements just

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.960
to make them feel better.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.800
Most importantly, ask yourself if you want
a true friend or a mere frenemy in disguise.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.330
Two: The nearest [?]. Life can get messy and
it's normal to feel dejected every once in

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.730
a while but if you know someone who is constantly
a Debbie Downer and dismisses your excitement

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.500
over future events, hobbies and dreams, it
makes it nearly impossible to share that happiness.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.730
Know that you don't have to stoop to their
level of pessimism.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.910
In fact, staying away from a negative attitude
will be beneficial for your health in the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.320
long run.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.710
Research has shown that high levels of cynicism
puts people at a bigger risk of developing

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.080
dementia compared to more open and trusting
individuals.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.430
Three: The slacker.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.460
Have you ever sat next to someone who wanted
to mooch off your work and get the same credit

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.460
for it?

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.060
Talk about unfair right?

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.930
These people lack motivation, don't care about
ethics and do whatever it takes if it means

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.930
taking the easy way out.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.060
You don't even have to work directly with
them to be affected by their lazy attitude.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.960
They might just bring the entire class down
with their lazy attitude.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.490
Whether they manipulate, guilt trip or sweet-talk
you, watch out for these sneaky individuals.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.090
They might seem like they care about you but
they only care about two things; fast results

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.200
and themselves.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.020
Four: The complainer.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.410
What's worse than wasting time complaining
about a situation Instead of changing it?

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.700
If you know someone who prefers to wallow
in self-pity instead of taking action, it

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.290
can be a bad influence on you.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.880
Toxic people who incessantly play the victim
card but never take responsibility for what

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.380
they are capable of fixing aren't just whiny,
they're self-absorbed.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.680
Five: The verbal abuser.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.350
People who know how to dish out criticism
but don't know how to apply it to their own

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.160
lives can be incredibly hypocritical.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.890
They continue to put others down because it's
easier than working out their own problems.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.680
Know that you don't have to take in what they
say and surround yourself with people who

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.630
will build you up Instead of breaking you
down.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.730
People who are verbally abusive enjoy attacking
you because it makes them feel better about

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.850
themselves.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.830
Your friends should be supportive of your
goals and help you strive forward instead

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.319
of holding you back.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.100
Do you encounter these types of people in
your life?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.310
Evaluate your goals and don't be afraid to
cut people out of your life.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.720
