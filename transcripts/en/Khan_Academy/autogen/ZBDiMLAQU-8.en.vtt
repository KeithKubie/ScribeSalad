00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:01.659
 Kenisa was asked to pull out 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.060
 7b ^ 2-5b + 1 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.400
 of 2b ^ 2 + 3b + 11. 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.040
 Its solution is shown below and we can see 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.475
 all the steps she has done. 

00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:13.725
 Asked at what step of the decision Kenisa made a mistake? 

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:15.445
 It is quite clear that she made a mistake, 

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:16.791
 because we are not given a variant, 

00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:17.883
 where there is no error. 

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:19.577
 Let's see what happened here. 

00:00:19.577 --> 00:00:21.875
 The first thing is - we want to get out 

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.918
 7b ^ 2-5b + 1, 

00:00:24.918 --> 00:00:26.336
 we want to get it out 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.920
 of 2b ^ 2 + 3b + 11. 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.220
 We see that in step one she did it right. 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.840
 It really subtracts 7b ^ 2 - 5b + 1 

00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:43.125
 of 2b ^ 2 + 3b + 11 .. 

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:44.195
 This is without error. 

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:46.215
 It seems that step one is good. 

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:47.793
 Now let's see step two. 

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:50.091
 It seems she wants to reveal the braces after the negative sign, 

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.692
 so the negative of 7b ^ 2 is, 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.500
 as you can see, minus 7b ^ 2. 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.580
 We will draw 7b ^ 2. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.240
 And then we have the negative to minus 5b. 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.220
 It will be plus 5b. 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.760
 So here, 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.460
 this should be plus 5b here. 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.545
 Let me do it in another color. 

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.378
 This should be plus 5b. 

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:18.140
 And then the negative of plus 1 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.254
 must be minus 1. 

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:21.785
 That should be minus one there. 

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.457
 Therefore, it made a mistake, 

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:26.174
 she makes a mistake in step two, 

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:29.263
 when revealing brackets after this negative sign. 

00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:32.490
 So step 2 is the place to which 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.625
 the error was actually committed. 

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.506
 From then on it looks right. 

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:41.452
 It subtracts the coefficients of members with b ^ 2. 

00:01:41.452 --> 00:01:44.309
 So 2b ^ 2 minus 7b ^ 2 

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:46.328
 gives us that there. 

00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:50.051
 Then, for members with b, you have 3b 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.160
 and then, let's see ... 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.280
 It should be 3b plus 5b, 

00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:56.964
 if he had properly uncovered the braces after the negative sign. 

00:01:56.964 --> 00:01:58.774
 But since she did not reveal the braces after the negative sign here, 

00:01:58.774 --> 00:02:01.793
 gets 3b minus 5b. 

00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:04.626
 Here should be 11 minus 1, 

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:07.800
 but because she did not correctly reveal the braces ... 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.360
 we have 11 plus 1. 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.637
 It should be 11 minus 1, as we said before, 

00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:14.423
 because we have to reveal the brackets after this negative sign, 

00:02:14.423 --> 00:02:16.374
 but she left it as a plus 

00:02:16.374 --> 00:02:18.163
 and that's why she got it there. 

00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:20.903
 Therefore, its actual error was in step two. 

00:02:20.903 --> 00:02:22.898
 Because from then on she makes the right calculations, 

00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:24.821
 just made that mistake.
