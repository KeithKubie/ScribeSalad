00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.120
ERIC LANDER: Hi, I'm Eric Lander.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm a professor of biology at MIT and a
professor of systems biology at the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.420
Harvard Medical School.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.980
I was one of the principal leaders
of the Human Genome Project.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.910
And today, I'm the president and
founding director of the Broad

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.420
Institute of Harvard and MIT, where
we're standing here now.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.320
And I'm the teacher for 7.00x,
Introduction to Biology,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.180
The Secret of Life.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.420
In 7.00x you'll be guided through the
basics of biology, starting with the

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.549
work of Gregor Mendel and coming up to
most current techniques being used in

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.750
genomics today.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.770
We'll explore introductory biology
in a way never done before.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.390
What's so amazing about modern biology
is in an introductory course you can

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.960
actually understand things that are
happening right at the frontier.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.530
And it's really pretty cool.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.270
This course has the same materials and
rigor that we give to MIT students

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.640
here on campus.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.350
Science is about asking deep and
fundamental questions, and then

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.455
teasing those answers out of nature.

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.780
Through your problem sets and
exams, you will learn to

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.080
think like a scientist.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.200
After completing this course, you will
be able to apply a common toolkit to

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.160
biological problems, and be able to
understand breakthroughs involving

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.070
cancer and heart disease, which you'll
read about in the news today.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.790
I have never been more excited about the
opportunity for all of us around

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.140
the world to talk together about this.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.110
Come join us on this journey.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.680
Everyone should know
the secret of life.
