00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.490
 ........ 

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.190
 In this video I will explain several examples of quadratic equations 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.820
 It is in fact a special formula, and it is also 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.150
 You will be ready for the next video, and we will talk about 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.670
 Complete the box 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.910
 So let me show you what I'm going to talk about 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.960
 Let's say I have 4 x +1 squared-8 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.330
 Is equal to zero 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.740
 Now, on the basis of everything they have done so far, perhaps 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.980
 I used to beat, then divide by 8, from 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.380
 The hard you will get here, then try to analyze it to its causes 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.600
 After that, we will get Q 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.220
 Minus something else equals zero 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.300
 And then you will say, Ooh, one of these things must be equal 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.990
 Zero, so it can be this or that 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.760
 We will not do this this time, because it is possible 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.810
 See something exciting here 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.090
 We can solve it without factors 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.050
 How can we do that? 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.950
 What will happen here if we add 8 for both parties 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.070
 Next to this equation? 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.480
 On the one hand equation will become 4 x 1 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.240
 Squares, and the existing octets will be deleted 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.130
 On the other hand, the 8 will be positive 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.780
 Now, what can we do on both sides of the equation? 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.090
 This is something strange, Vanilla! 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.170
 Solution equation 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.930
 This is not a hard fact 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.700
 We can take the two-sided box, next to the equation 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.600
 We can also take the square root 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.410
 So 4 o +1, I just took the square root for both parties 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.840
 We took the square root of both sides, of course 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.740
 You want to take the square root of positive and negative 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.390
 Because 4x + 1, it can be the square root positive for 8, or 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.400
 We can take the negative square root for 8 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.100
 So 4 + 1 is positive or negative 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.860
 Square root of 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.450
 Instead of 8, let me type the 8 on the 4 hit 2 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.350
 We all know that the 8 is also written as well, and it is clear that the square root 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.820
 For 4 x +1 squared is 4 o +1 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.500
 So we can take 4 x 1 equals .., we can take the common factor out, the 4 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.840
 Or square root for 4, equal to 2, which is equal to or positive 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.250
 Negative hit 2, the square root of 2, right? 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.460
 The square root of the 4 quadratic root multiplication of 2 is the same as Ka 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.290
 Square root of 4 multiplied by square root of 2, positive or 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.850
 The negative square root of 4, is 2 there 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.970
 Now, we can see market equations, with 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.340
 This is positive or negative 2 multiplied by 2 squared 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.020
 But it is not like that 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.010
 This is actually two numbers here, and we are like you 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.210
 Together we solve two equations 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.980
 We can write this 4 x 1 equal to positive 2 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.360
 The square root of 2, or 4 x 1 is equal to minus 2 multiplied by 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.510
 Square root of 2 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.110
 This sentence is equal to the one here 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.230
 Because we have a positive and negative here, for the phrase (or) 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.710
 Let me solve them all at once 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.360
 So if you subtract 1 from both ends of this 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.030
 Equation, what do I have? 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.330
 At the left end, I only have 4 o 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
 At the right end, I have - a fact you can not 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.260
 Mathematically, I mean, you can do it if you have 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.210
 Calculator, but I'll make it a plus-or-so 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.570
 Minus the square root, or 2 multiply the square root of 2 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.200
 This is a 4x value 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.560
 If we do it here, as two separate parameters, with the same idea 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.715
 We subtract 1 from both ends of this equation, get 4 x 

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:36.310
 Equal to 1 plus 2, multiply the square root of 2 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.150
 This equation, subtract 1 from both ends 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.090
 4 x equals -1 minus 2, multiply 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.560
 Square root of 2 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.970
 This sentence here is equal to the fullness of these two 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.880
 The sentences 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.590
 Now, the last step, we just divide both parties on 4, then 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.770
 You divide both sides by 4, and you get x equal 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.620
 1- Plus or minus 2, multiply the root 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.570
 Quadratic of 2, on 4 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.670
 Now, this sentence is fully equal to 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.550
 Divide each one of these on 4, and you get x equal 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.470
 1 plus 2, multiply the square root of 2, at 4 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.890
 This is one solution 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.270
 The other solution is that x equals -1 plus 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.370
 2 for root 2, all divided by 4 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.340
 This sentence and these two sentences are equal 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.230
 If you want, I encourage you to - to replace one 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.280
 This, just to be confident that something 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.960
 Strange such sentences can be a solution 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.970
 For an easy and simple equation like this 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.870
 So let's make up for it again 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:58.290
 4 hit x, or 4 hit 1-, plus 2 for root 2 on 4 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.450
 1 squared, minus 8 equals 0 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.350
 Now, all these 4 are deleted, and you have left 1- 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.260
 Plus 2 for root 2, plus 1, squared, minus 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.410
 8 equals 0 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.410
 These 1 and 1 are deleted, then 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.690
 We will have 2 root 2 squared, minus 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.840
 8 equals 0 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.680
 Then what will you have here? 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.460
 So when you are squaring these, you get 4 hit 2, minus 8 is 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.060
 Equals 0, that's true 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.300
 8 minus 9 equals 0 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.740
 When you try this, you will get the same 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.180
 the answer 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.220
 Let's start with another one that is similar to it 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.960
 Remember, these are special forms where we get 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.470
 Quadratic equations of our equations (mathematical equations) 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.620
 We will see that the quadratic equation is fully 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.870
 Is a fact derived from such a theory, because you 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.250
 A fact can transform any quadratic equation 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.050
 To a whole square equal to something else 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.525
 We'll see that after two videos from now 

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:08.260
 But let us prepare with vision 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.410
 Such a thing 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:16.650
 So let's say that you have a minus x minus 10 x plus 25 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.680
 Equal to 9 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.920
 Now, again your suspicions - which are not bad thoughts 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.960
 You will be subtracting 9 from both parties 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.320
 You'll get 0 at the right end, but before you do this 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.050
 Let's check these out quickly, let's just say, these 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.140
 Maybe a whole square of a double-edged equation? 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.150
 And you will see - well, the two numbers that if hit (weakened) 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.760
 I get 25 positive, and when I add them I get minus 10? 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.380
 I hope you jump (appear) to you minus 5 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:52.060
 So this sentence here is a minus 5 minus x 5 minus 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.495
 The left-hand tip will be shaped like a minus 5 square all 

00:06:56.495 --> 00:06:59.910
 The right side remains 9 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.540
 The truth I want to emphasize 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.860
 I do not want this to spoil all the training you have received 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.280
 On the factors yet 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.260
 We can do this when there is a whole box 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.210
 If you get, we decrease 3 hit (positive 4) and this will be 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.120
 Equal to 9 This will be the end 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.580
 You can not do anything 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.490
 Based on this 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.080
 Just because this square is full we can now say o minus 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.640
 5 All squared is equal to 9, and then we can take the root 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.060
 Quadratic for both parties 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.280
 So we can say minus 5 is negative or positive 3 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.050
 Add 5 to both ends of equation and get equal q 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:43.050
 5 positive or negative 3, or x equals - what is 5 plus 3? 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:49.780
 Well, o may be 8 or x may be equal to 5 minus 3, or x 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.340
 Equals 2 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.890
 Now, we could have done this quadratic equation 

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.070
 The traditional way, the way it is 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.160
 We wanted to do it 

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.600
 What will happen if we subtract 9 from each 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.230
 Both ends of the equation? 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.650
 You will get a squared minus 10 o 

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.820
 And what is 25 minus 9? 

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:16.040
 25 minus 9 is 16, and this will be equal to zero 

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.970
 Here, this will be a traditional transaction equation 

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.400
 The type we saw in the previous video 

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.710
 The two numbers, which when you take the product of their multiplication, get 

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:29.020
 Positive 16, and when you collect them you get minus 10? 

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.800
 Maybe minus 8 and minus 2 

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.390
 Jump to your thinking 

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:38.954
 Then we will get an x ​​minus 8 minus x 2 equals 0 

00:08:38.954 --> 00:08:43.710
 Then x equals 8 or x equals 2 

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.450
 This is the fun thing about algebra: you can do this 

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.670
 In two different ways, as long as you do them 

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.210
 Algebraically true, you will not get 

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.170
 Different answers 

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.330
 At some level, if you know this, this is easier 

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.950
 Because you do not need to do this little trick in your mind 

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.130
 In terms of, multiply the numbers if you hit them 

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.840
 You'll get 16, and when you collect them, you get minus 10 

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.340
 Here, you will say, well, these are minus 5 - I think you are 

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.020
 You have to do it 

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.020
 You should say, 5 hit 5 is 25, and negative 10 

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.160
 Are minus 5 plus (minus 5) 

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.050
 So I'll pull it off, you have to do it 

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.490
 With that little trick in your mind 

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.700
 So let's get to each other 

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.880
 Let's have one of these, just to make ourselves 

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.230
 Ready and ready here 

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:38.140
 So, let's say that we have x squared plus 18 x plus 81 

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.470
 Equals 1 

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.940
 So again, we can do it in two ways 

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.580
 We can subtract 1 from both parties, or we can discover that 

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:53.140
 These are the plus 9 plus x 9 plus 

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:58.010
 Here, 9 hit 9 are 81, 9 plus 9 are 18 

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.210
 So we can write our equation on the basis of X plus 9 

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.760
 All square equals 1 

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.940
 We take the square root for both ends, you get x plus 9 

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.240
 A positive or minus a square root of 1 

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.910
 It is 1 

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.140
 So Q equals - subtract 9 from both parties - negative 9 

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.866
 Negative or positive 1 

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:21.060
 This means that this can be equal to minus 9 + 1 

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.620
 Is minus 8 or o can be equal to minus 9 minus 1 

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.930
 Which is negative 10 

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.560
 Again, you can do it the traditional way 

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.730
 You can subtract 1 from both parties and you will get 

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:41.240
 On a squared plus 18 x plus 80 equals 0 

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.370
 You will say, 8 hit 10 equals 80, 8 plus 10 

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:50.850
 Equals 18, and you get x plus 8 hit x plus 10 equals 0 

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.640
 And then you get x it can be equal to minus 8, or x 

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.360
 Is equal to minus 10 

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.710
 This is a good setting 

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.250
 Now, I think we are ready to address (solve) the completion of Quadrature 

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:02.466
 ..........
