00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.740
So given that just using a higher resolution

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.470
image, everywhere, isn't a great solution, what do

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.610
you think you should do? Should you use

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.950
a low quality source image? Replace it with

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.460
JavaScript? Should you expect the server to give

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.840
you the proper pixel density image magically? Or,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.670
should you make several copies of the image

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.130
and conditionally request the right one from the client?
