00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.830
So what's the difference between a pure strategy and

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.040
a mixed strategy, Michael? Well, it's, it's simply this.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.318
A mixed strategy, simply implies, or means, some distribution,

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:13.058
over strategies. So in the case of two strategies,

00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:15.974
like we have here, where you can either, A

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.971
can be either a resigner or a holder, we're

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:22.049
going to simply say that the mixed strategy for A

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:25.835
is some value for P. Which is the probability

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:29.155
of choosing to be a holder. So do you, you see

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:31.830
what's going on here? So the only difference between a mixed

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.990
strategy and a pure strategy. Is that for a mixed strategy,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.180
you choose some probability over all the different strategies that you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.426
might choose. So you decide that, you know, going into this

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:45.276
I'm going to flip a coin. And half the time I'm going to

00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:47.889
be a resigner, and half the time I'm going to be a

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:51.800
holder. Say. Or 30% of the time I'll be a resigner.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.560
And 70% of the time I'll be a holder. Okay?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.980
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.960
&gt;&gt; Where as with pure strategies, you always chose

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.710
on or the other. So technically, it's the case

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.629
that a pure strategy's also a mixed strategy where

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.990
all the probability mass is on a single strategy.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.380
&gt;&gt; Makes sense.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.930
&gt;&gt; So in this case we're going to, in

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.510
fact, choose P to represent the probability for

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.895
A of choosing to be a holder rather than a resigner. And so P can be

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:20.760
0%, probability zero, or can be probability one, or

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.740
any value in between. You with me on that?

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's neat.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.360
&gt;&gt; Okay, good. To make certain you understand this I'm going to give you

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.220
a little quiz. Which I have up here on the screen. You ready?

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.120
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see it. [LAUGH] It's like those, those very square boxes.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.650
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.790
&gt;&gt; I didn't even realize what, what, what this could be about.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.877
&gt;&gt; It certainly couldn't be a quiz because Charles has never drawn a straight

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:42.388
box in his life. I had drew those Michael. It took me 17 hours.

00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:45.250
&gt;&gt; Oh man, you are, you're committed to this and I appreciate that.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.920
&gt;&gt; I am committed to this. Okay, so,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.692
given that we have a mixed strategy, and we

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:52.040
have a probability P of A being a holder,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.160
here's my question for you. In a world where

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.690
B is a resigner, okay? B is always

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.860
going to choose to resign. What is A's expected profit?

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.690
To make it easy for you, I copied the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.160
matrix over here in the upper right hand corner.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.430
&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait. If B

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.580
is always a resigner.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.550
&gt;&gt; B is always a resigner.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.530
&gt;&gt; Then, what's, and what is A?

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.540
&gt;&gt; A is going to choose to be a holder with probability P.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.650
&gt;&gt; Oh, so you want this to be a function of P.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.430
&gt;&gt; Maybe.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.970
&gt;&gt; If it's, if it's, okay, sure, maybe [LAUGH]. It could, well, I mean, yes.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.420
It's a function of P, it just might be a constant function that ignores P.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.625
&gt;&gt; It could be, in principle. Okay, now, after you figure

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:32.454
that out, I want you to decide, in a world where B

00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:37.258
is the seer, B always chooses to see the card. What would A's expected profit

00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:42.577
be, in a world where A will choose to be a holder with probability p. Okay?

00:02:42.577 --> 00:02:43.025
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:43.761
&gt;&gt; Got it?

00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:46.393
&gt;&gt; And that's going to be, oh yeah, that could be different

00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:49.840
because it's a it's a different strategy, though you know seering.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.310
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.500
&gt;&gt; Like like if you're a resigner you're a resigner, but

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.630
if you're a seer then what you are doing is seering

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.853
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:57.110
&gt;&gt; That would be an anagram of resigner.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.810
&gt;&gt; How do you see

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.430
these things?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.295
&gt;&gt; I don't know. They're just there. I just,

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:03.523
they words just kind of mix themselves up. Alright anyway,

00:03:03.523 --> 00:03:04.549
I'm, I think I am ready to do the

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.836
function. I'm, I'm ready to stop looking at the letters.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:09.040
&gt;&gt; Okay? And go!
