00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:10.630
KEN ARTHUR: Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.900
I'm Ken Arthur.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.800
I recently joined the
Talks at Google team,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.960
so I'm here to
introduce this talk.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.890
So without further ado, I'd like
to introduce Brian Kesinger.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.120
Brian joined Disney when he
was 18, becoming the youngest

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.980
animator at the company.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.140
He started as a layout animator
on Tarzan and his career

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.820
has filled many positions,
ranging from visual development

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.870
to story artist.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.820
Today he's going to talk
about his career, his art,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.970
and his series of books
featuring Victoria

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.790
and her pet land octopus, Otto.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.445
So, Brian.

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:43.528
BRIAN KESINGER: Thank you.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.890
Hey, everyone.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.930
Thank you so much for coming out
today and giving up your lunch

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.480
hour.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.140
It's fun.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.560
We had these sort of talks
at the studio, as well.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.790
And I'm usually sitting
where you're sitting,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.180
so it's very strange for me to
be on this side of the podium.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.980
So bear with me if I
have minor freak outs

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.370
or am at a loss for words.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.090
So as you heard in
the introduction,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm currently the head of
story on one of our projects

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.510
at Disney right now.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.390
So I primarily make my home
in the storyboard department

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.880
at Walt Disney
animation studios.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.390
I affectionately refer
to it as the day job.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.590
And I've been there,
now, for 20 years.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.420
As was mentioned in my
intro, I started on Tarzan

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.960
as a hand-drawn-- back
in the old timey days

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.170
where we drew things on paper--
drew backgrounds for Tarzan.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.580
It's also during
that film that I

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.810
started to learn a little
bit about computer animation

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.240
with some of the
deep canvas stuff we

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.870
were doing on that film.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.600
From there I moved
on to Atlantis.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.350
Thank you.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.060
And Treasure Planet, again
both in the layout department.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.750
But with each film, starting
to learn more and more computer

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.500
graphics and how they
related to animation.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.150
Before I jumped on to Bolt,
which was my first all CG film

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.540
that I worked on-- so I
transitioned from hand drawing

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.920
layout to digital
layout, which became more

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.210
like traditional cinematography
on live action films.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.580
And from there
went on to Tangled,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.910
Wreck It Ralph, Big
Hero 6 and Zootopia.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.270
And I just finished
working on Moana,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.480
which will come out this fall.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.110
So all during that time
where I drew for the studio,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.710
it was also very important
for me to draw for fun.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.570
And so I'd always carry
my sketchbook around

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.280
and draw everything
from a fierce samurai

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.640
to brooding minotaurs.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.370
Because I'm a big D&amp;D geek.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.810
Cyber ninja's, drunk
monkeys, more drunk monkeys,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.490
and cool dirt bike kids.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.860
And then one day
someone had contacted

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.130
me, a good friend
of mine, said hey,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.100
I'm having a
steampunk tea party.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.730
Will you draw an illustration
for the invitation?

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.820
I'm like sure, what's steampunk?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.335
And then I googled steampunk
and found out what it was.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.790
And I'm like, oh
that's really cool.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.090
And so I did this
illustration, and there

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.630
was something that really
drew me to this genre.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.330
You know all the great
Victorian fashion

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.350
was a key component to me, that
I really love about steampunk.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.530
And then all the kind of
sci-fi, retro sci-fi elements,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.730
were really fun for
me to play with.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.900
And something that
I realized I had

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.240
dipped into a little
while working on Atlantis

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.920
and Treasure Planet.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.400
Had kind of that
steampunk feel to it.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.610
So I already had some
muscle memory into it.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.220
So I started on this endeavor,
which I call the Tea Girls,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.565
and these were illustrations
that really celebrated

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:19.066
the prettier side of steampunk.

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:20.440
If you were to
look up steampunk,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.560
oftentimes it's a lot of
post-apocalyptic stuff.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.400
Or ray guns and
big giant robots.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.120
And I saw kind of a
hole in the genre where

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.570
it's like, well let's
focus on the pretty things.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.680
Let's focus on something
that's a little more

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.090
positive and bohemian.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.770
And so I thought,
well why not do that?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.840
Just to talk a little
bit about my inspiration

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.750
for these pieces,
this is an illustrator

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.200
by the name of Arthur Rackham.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.470
Do you guys-- have
you heard of him?

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.490
Pretty amazing artist.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.910
Kind of known for
his illustrations

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.250
in the original Alice
in Wonderland novels.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.630
And really cool.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.780
As you can see in
the art here, it's

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.370
more about draftsmanship
and line work,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.280
and the color is more wash.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.190
Kind of ink washes
and watercolor.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.770
And the drawing is really the
superstar of his illustrations.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.600
And I consider myself more of
a draftsman than a painter.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.530
So when I see people that can
do illustration work like that,

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.580
it really inspires me.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.500
Another great artist
is Leyendecker.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.530
And he was a tremendous artist.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.240
Kind of similar, I
guess, to Norman Rockwell

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.960
in that he would do a lot
of covers for the Post

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.330
and that sort of thing.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.590
But why I like him
more than Rockwell

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.950
is-- it's kind of small
in the image here--

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.950
but things are a little
more graphic and stylized.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.715
If you were to look at
the ringlets of her hair,

00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:02.890
it's a little more
sculptural than photo real.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.320
Still, you look at the image
and it looks very photo real.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.020
But there's little
tweaks here and there

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.040
that make it all
the more special.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.200
Also what I like
about his work is

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.830
he just includes the props that
are necessary for the scene.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.190
It's not a full illustration,
it's kind of a graphic design.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.050
You can see that on a
t-shirt or a poster.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.220
But everything is there to
really set the scene that

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.530
needs to be there.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.050
And you'll see how that has
become part of my work as well.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.370
Charles Dana Gibson.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.300
These are-- another
illustrator who

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.220
primarily worked in line work.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.330
He's creator of the
Gibson Girl, which

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.700
was kind of a very Victorian
poster girl for the era.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.170
And I just love his work.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.290
You look at this, and it's
just one solid line of action.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.490
From the head to the
hem of the dress.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.340
And everything
else in that image

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.930
really supports
the main feature,

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.300
which is the woman
reading the book there.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.650
And it's just all of his
illustrations are really good.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.100
Just being super clear,
even though there's

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.130
lots of sketchy lines in there
and it's a pretty dense image,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.500
your eye knows
right where to look.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.020
Between the balance of
composition and also value,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.240
which is kind cool.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.705
Brian Froud, of course
you guys know Brian Froud.

00:07:20.705 --> 00:07:24.320
A concept designer
in the 80s for Jim

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.700
Henson, and worked
on a lot of the work

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.950
on Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.510
I'm a kid of the
80s, so anything 80s

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.770
is-- I'm really into.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.680
And certainly Brian
Froud, I remember

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.430
getting the art books
back in the day when

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.810
I saw those movies.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.440
It's like, wow this is amazing.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.240
And he does a lot
of fantasy art.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.260
A lot of cool
fairies and dragons

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.950
and these troll guys, here.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.820
As mentioned before,
Mike Mignola.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.791
Who I didn't know until
working on Atlantis.

00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:01.290
Wasn't familiar with his work
because I was more of a Disney

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.440
geek than a comic book geek.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.430
And he was an early concept
designer on Atlantis,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:15.430
so I really dug his work
and his use stark values.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.230
Again, being a drafts
person and not a painter,

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.030
I love that most of the
work is put into the line

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.700
work and shadow areas.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.800
And then the color itself
is actually pretty flat.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.169
But still very, very effective.

00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:30.460
And then, of course, these two.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.720
Bill Watterson.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.850
My first memory
of comics was when

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.280
my dad gave me the
first collection

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.130
of Calvin and Hobbes.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.240
And I was little, and
I remember thinking,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.882
oh wow what a cool
coloring book.

00:08:44.882 --> 00:08:47.090
Because all the comic strips
were in black and white.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.200
So I colored most of them.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.860
But that got me to
know the art even more,

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.800
spending time with these two.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.340
Just amazing storytelling.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.920
And that's something I want
to stress with this talk today

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.790
is how much storytelling
you can get into one image.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.050
It's something that we do
in the movies at Disney,

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.340
we control every
pixel of the frame.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.810
And so you better make sure
that the pixel has earned

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:11.900
its way into the picture.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.210
Well, the same thing with
drawing and illustration.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.040
That's why, in older books,
there was usually only one

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.760
illustration per chapter.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.880
A picture is worth
a thousand words.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.100
It holds true.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.260
In every little detail, you want
to consider before putting in.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:33.410
And these artists that I showed
you certainly do all of that.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.170
And then I mentioned doing
reference into steampunk.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.500
There's no shortage of steampunk
imagery on the internet.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.970
And what was great was when I
was first starting out a my Tea

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.050
Girl adventure, these
were all strangers to me.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.140
But amazing artists.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.920
And usually all makers
and working in 3-D space.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.340
Sculptural, jewelry,
that sort of thing.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.950
But there wasn't
a lot of 2-D art.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.630
So I thought, oh maybe
there's an opportunity

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.400
to jump in and play
with these guys.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.280
And the result of that were
these five original paintings

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.230
here.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.900
Another thing that was
important for me in this process

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.770
was that, since I had
made the complete switch

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.470
to digital animation at work,
I was missing the drawing.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.420
I was missing putting
pencil on paper.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.040
And so this was an opportunity
to create something physical.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.530
Something analog,
which also played

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.980
into the steampunk aesthetic.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.180
In this digital age, you have
these people that are still

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.556
interested in having objects.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.930
And I thought,
well why not-- why

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.530
create just another
piece of digital art

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.320
that's just a file
on a computer,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.950
and do something special.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.890
So I did these five paintings.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.700
And they're all painted
with tea, something

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.540
that I thought also fits
into the genre of steampunk.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.220
And using different flavors
for different paintings

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.640
in different shades.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.260
I would treat it with
just a dab of watercolor,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.250
but for the most part it's tea.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.320
And it's what gives it,
also, that splatter feel,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.830
that energy to it.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.870
It was actually by accident,
because I was researching, well

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.850
how do you make stuff look old.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.180
And the internet told me,
well you age it with tea.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.410
And I said, great.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.270
And I didn't finish
reading the article.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.170
But I went and
made a lot of tea,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.680
and I took a tea bag out and
just started squirting it

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.110
all over the paper.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.290
And I said, internet you lied
to me, this looks terrible.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.990
And I had already done all the
line work, because I'm stupid.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.680
And the tea went everywhere.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.480
But my wife came over and she
says, well that smells good.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.580
And then she said--
and I said, yes.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.280
Smells good, but
looks like crap.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.110
And she says, no, I think
it looks kind of cool.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.240
You might as well finish it.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.480
If it's already ruined you're
not going to ruin it more.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.200
And I finished
it, and I actually

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.750
kind of like how they came out.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.430
And it did develop into
something that became

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.120
a signature for me, as well.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.850
Which was kind of cool.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.650
As you start to see more
stuff make the rounds,

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.370
you see that splatter effect.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.980
And you know, oh Brian
probably had a hand in that.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.910
So just to go into the
process of these tea

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.910
paintings a little bit.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.950
I always carry my sketchbook
with me wherever I go.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.930
And I do kind of what I call
Ouija board drawing, which

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.630
is just trying to move
my pencil on the page

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.170
and discovering what the
drawing is going to be.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.370
Rather than have an
image in my head.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.840
And I kind of just
move along the page

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.240
and find different
things that interest me.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.500
Different shapes
that interest me.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.010
But the main thing for me at
this stage is flow and rhythm.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.510
Not so much form and
solid drawing, but just

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.040
what kind of cool
gestures can I get.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.920
Once I'm happy with that,
I do a blue line sketch

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.992
on some pretty thick
watercolor paper.

00:13:01.992 --> 00:13:03.700
That's important,
because I'm going to be

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.370
putting a lot of tea on it.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:12.430
And the watercolor paper will
soak it up and not ruin itself.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.090
Once I'm happy
with the blue line,

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:19.160
I'll go over the blue line
with a really thin micron pen.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.530
It's like a point .01 millimeter
tip, because these drawings are

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.090
actually pretty small.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.830
Those ones I posted were
five by five inches.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:35.020
And then once I'm happy with
that, then I ruin it with tea.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.450
And for this one, because
it was a steampunk geisha,

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.350
I decided to use green tea.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.380
So it has a little
bit-- and that's kind

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.680
of the initial
layer where I'm just

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.720
letting it splatter and pool
and do what it wants to do.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.370
And then I'll go in with
a paint brush into my tea

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.680
and mix in a little
watercolor, and go in and just

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.630
push and pull values to get
to a finished piece like this.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.580
So, again, it's organic.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.890
It's happy accidents.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.300
All that kind of
fun Bob Ross stuff

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.310
put into steampunk
kind of veneer.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.580
These are some of my favorites
that I've done over time.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.340
Different flavors.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.690
Different compositions.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.710
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.120
And the purpose with
those-- actually,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.810
going back to those real quick.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.410
Because I did stories all day,
making stories was my job,

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.980
I wanted to come home
and not make stories.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.400
I wanted to just create art
that existed on its own.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.820
And could go in a
frame and there.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.110
Say I'm done.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:51.220
But I couldn't help, as I was
spending time with these girls,

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.626
to create stories with them.

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:55.000
And I think it
was just something

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.510
in the back of my
head that is like, OK.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.610
Well, what's this
person's story and how do

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.490
they relate to this person then.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.940
And so I thought,
OK, well let me

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:08.190
try to tell a story in the
steam world with this aesthetic.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.220
And I started to think
about how we create stories

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.250
at Disney, which is a
thing about universal ideas

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.420
and themes.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.200
Examples of these
are pretty obvious.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.980
There's the overprotective
parent, which we all get.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.540
Either we have
one or we are one.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.890
That's an idea that
we can all understand.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.720
It's when you tell that idea
through the world of fish

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.720
that it becomes
very interesting.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.570
And animation, to
me, is a metaphor.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.100
Right?

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.860
It's a way for us
to tell stories.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.650
They're fables.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.780
There's other moments in your
life, like your first kiss.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.740
Which we can all relate to.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.620
But, again, when you do it
over spaghetti with two dogs

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.350
it becomes charming
and memorable.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.780
And then there can be
even deeper emotions,

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.580
like dealing with
guilt. You know,

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.620
when it's a little puppet
whose nose grows when he tells

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.780
a lie it seems childish
and fun, but there's still

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.830
heart behind it.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.510
And it's why we get
behind these characters.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.930
So I'm thinking about
general ideas, what's

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.630
something we can all relate to.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.700
And then my wife
and I got a puppy

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.160
and we thought, well there's
lots of universal ideas

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.150
around raising a pet.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.170
And I thought, well.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.810
OK, so a pet in
the steampunk era.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.030
What would be a really
good steampunk pet?

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.090
And I thought, well an octopus.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.690
Because octopus are
amazing creatures,

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.450
and they had kind of become
the theme animal for steampunk,

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.130
if you will.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.240
So I thought of that old
classic 1920s illustration

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.010
where you had the high society
lady walking a greyhound.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.400
And I thought, well what's
a steampunk spin on that?

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.100
That would probably be a high
society lady with green hair,

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.270
walking her pet octopus
to the fire hydrant.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.520
Obviously.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.280
And as soon as
you start thinking

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.950
of your universal
idea, then everything

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.800
just becomes an overlay.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.410
Right?

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.384
And the hard work
is kind of done.

00:17:07.384 --> 00:17:08.300
Because you think, OK.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.550
Well you have a pet.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.280
Obviously they're going to
have accidents in the house.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.450
And how would an octopus
have an accident?

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.329
Well, they would ink everywhere.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.480
Bath time, of course.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.280
Otto is the only octopus that
actually doesn't like water.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.070
So that becomes particularly
troublesome for Victoria.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.240
And then I went to my sketchbook
and I just created a list.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.970
This is my writing process.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.290
I'm so much more visually driven
that the less writing on paper

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.560
I have to do, the better.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.600
But it did help as I was
planning out the first book,

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.570
Walking Your Octopus.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:51.450
A checklist of all different
scenarios, both pros and cons.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:55.930
And you can see, I couldn't help
but even doodle on these pages

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:56.910
as well.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.200
And then once the boring
writing letters part was done,

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.650
I could go and just start to
do these very rough vignettes.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.830
Again, going back to
the Leyendecker arts,

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.860
what props do I need
to sell the idea?

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.690
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.460
And these scribbly
drawings then get

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.370
into even scribble-- even
more scribbly drawings.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.000
This is-- can't you tell?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.720
It's Victoria offering a fish
to Otto if he sits up pretty.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.660
Obviously.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.060
But the main thing for me in
this sketch is A, the idea.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.480
OK, she's training
him with a fish.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.320
And B, what's the
compositional elements in this.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.250
And you can see
that long line, just

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.620
like in Gibson's work, of
her arm and the contrast

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.730
by the squiggly line of
Otto looking up at the fish.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.300
You get a nice
triangle composition.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.220
So once I have those
notes down for me,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.370
that's the hardest part.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.330
That's done.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.450
Then I can go and
make it look pretty.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.280
But this is the more
boring part for me.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.440
Where it's just, OK.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.420
Finish the line work.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.760
Finish the colors.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.380
But the idea is what's
important to me.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.040
And with visual
storytelling the idea

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.344
is the most important thing.

00:19:15.344 --> 00:19:17.010
I think that's what's
great about seeing

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.650
so much are on the
internet, is that it's

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.920
not about skill necessarily.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.187
It's about the idea.

00:19:23.187 --> 00:19:24.520
Does it make you feel something?

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.220
Does it make you laugh?

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.910
Some of my favorite web comics
are not drawn well at all.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.032
But I love them and
there's a charm to them.

00:19:34.032 --> 00:19:35.740
It's something I like
to encourage people

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.300
with, if you have ideas, is not
to be intimidated by your skill

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:39.980
level.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.600
It's the thought that counts.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.900
So I thought I'd show
this to you guys.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.230
It's a time lapse of one of my
pieces from start to finish.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.640
I draw in Photoshop for these
Otto and Victoria pieces,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.800
just because it's easier to keep
digital versions handy if I do

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.610
shirts and that sort of thing.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.060
But we'll give this a watch.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.690
It's about 5 minutes long.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.490
I'll give some
commentary over it,

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.680
as a chance for you to look
at art and not hear me.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.510
So-- Yeah, this was a
piece pretty early on.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.550
This was actually my second
Otto and Victoria piece.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.940
And you can see,
this whole video

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:25.920
is about six hours worth of work
boiled down to five minutes.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.850
You can see how roughly
I banged everything out,

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.030
compositionally.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.850
And now I'm going in and
refining a rough sketch.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.300
This isn't, still,
the final line.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.770
This is still rough.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.800
I find that when I
draw, the more work I

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.640
put into the rough
phase-- that's

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.550
where all of the
thinking and weight

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:49.080
is-- then the easier the
rest of the piece goes.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.190
So now that I'm
happy with the rough,

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.540
I'm going in and doing
more fine line work.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.360
You can see it start
to come into focus,

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.540
like an old timey Polaroid.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.910
And it's in this phase that
I'm using all of the old school

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.580
animation line work techniques.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.300
Thick and thin.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.620
Thick line at the bottom of an
object, where there's weight.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.900
Thin line at the top,
where there's not.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.720
Straights against curves.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.590
Getting the fabric to feel
like it's in movement.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.860
Little things, like
here on this umbrella.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.670
Those little dangly beads.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.974
It's one thing if I would have
just drawn them hanging down,

00:21:34.974 --> 00:21:36.640
but because they're
kind of at an angle,

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.400
gives some movement
to the whole thing.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.420
And then suction cups.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.350
Millions and millions
of suction cups.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.090
And this is another
example of why

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.060
you should do your
homework, because you

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.970
can see as I'm drawing these
hundreds of suction cups--

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.390
it wasn't until after this
piece that I researched.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.550
Octopus only have two
rows of suction cups--

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.640
--on each of their arms.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.270
So that's how you can tell
my older Otto and Victoria

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:07.030
drawings from my newer,
is by the suction cups.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.720
If there is a stupid
amount of suction cups,

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.270
they're early ones.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:14.680
If there's two, I've done
my homework and research.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.540
But you can see, too, I'm
adding a lot of weight

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.420
to these tentacles.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.140
How they're drawn, they feel
like there's some mass to them

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.980
and the bottom side that's
touching the ground is flat.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.770
And the top side is
more curvy, because this

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.810
is an octopus that's on land.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.890
So it's not going to be as
flowy as you would draw them

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.080
under the water.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.870
But they have a
little more weight.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:44.130
And so now that the final
art is done, final line art,

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.780
I'm going to go through
and do a shadow pass.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.350
And this is where we're digging
into Mike Mignola territory.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:55.900
Where there's these really kind
of comic book inking lines,

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.830
but on softer forms.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.970
So it's kind of a
fun mash up for me.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.580
Whereas normally
this style of inking

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.280
is used to draw Captain
America fighting Red Skull,

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.970
I'm using it to draw
very elegant ladies

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.090
and fanciful octopus.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.650
And it appeals to me.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.490
And, again, because
I'm a drafts person

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.650
I spend more time on the drawing
side than the painting side.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.700
As you'll see here,
the painting side

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.420
is mostly pretty flat painting.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:32.130
Because all the volume and form
is described by the line work

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:37.650
and not by the gradients,
highlights, or shadows.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.850
And again, I think it gives
it more of an animation feel.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.290
Which is why when people see
this work-- not knowing that I

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.730
work at Disney-- say, oh.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.910
It reminds me of Disney.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:47.580
I'm like, OK.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.080
Good.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.123
I'm doing something right.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:58.590
The green hair on Victoria was
kind of an afterthought, too.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:02.760
So much of steampunk
is muted colors.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.970
In fact, the joke
is steampunk is when

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.670
Goth people discover brown.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.620
And so I wanted,
again, for my art

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.310
to stand out in
the sea of sepia.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.250
And I thought, well
what better than to give

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.640
a color pop to Victoria and
give her that green hair.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.800
And what's been fun is
at conventions and stuff,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.960
when you see people dressed
up in steampunk, every once

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.300
in a while you'll see
a girl with green hair.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.510
And that's a pretty
cool feeling,

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:37.110
knowing that you've had some
influence on the group that

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.110
has been so accepting.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.090
Steampunk people are amazing.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.294
So we're wrapping up
towards the end of this.

00:24:46.612 --> 00:24:50.010
This step right here, with
all that mottled texture--

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:54.210
I had scanned one of
my tea splatter pages.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:59.100
Just with no art on it, so I can
overlay it on my Photoshop file

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.120
to give it a more organic feels.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.882
So it doesn't just
feel like digital art.

00:25:02.882 --> 00:25:04.340
So that's where
you get all the fun

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.410
splotches on Otto and Victoria.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.070
So that's that.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:16.050
A couple of my favorite
pieces from the first book.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.920
This is Otto and
Victoria at the dog park.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.660
Because it's very important
to socialize your pet octopus.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.730
You don't want them
being a bad pet.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.770
These are all dogs of either
mine or my friends, my family.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.830
So it's kind of a
photo album for us.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.540
This is Octopus By The Sea,
great for leisurely Sunday

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.890
boat rides.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.910
They are navigators, musicians,
and can pour a nice cup

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.310
of tea for you as well.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.010
Octopus love holidays,
so the more you

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:50.680
can involve them into your
holiday routine the more

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.390
they'll take to it.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.220
So they're really good
at jack o' lanterns.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.540
And then bath time.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.750
Of course, he's a gentleman
he's not going to peak.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:03.220
But he is there to help you out
at the end of a really, really

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.980
tough day.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.930
And then bed time.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.750
This was certainly
inspired by my kids,

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.350
when I would often fall
asleep before they did.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.070
But the octopus loves to
cuddle its favorite submarine

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.810
as it's off into dreamland,
being read its favorite story.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.610
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.810
And that is a
Cthulhu in the box,

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.340
just in case you're wondering.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.290
Another fun thing to do
with these characters

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.480
is to mash them up
with pop culture.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.050
I find they cross over really
well, they love to cosplay.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:42.150
So any chance I can meld
them with my interests

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.640
is always a win for me.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.700
And then the first book
got pretty popular.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.860
I was really honored
by how much it was

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.870
going around and being shared.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.430
And so the time came
to do another one,

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.910
and this was Traveling
With Your Octopus,

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.580
and this was a
chance for me to go

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.100
more global with my steampunk.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.660
A lot of steampunk seems
to be very European based,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.370
but I wanted to play
with that a little.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.680
And so I did some
American steampunk,

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.320
with the Wild West
or the weird West.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.200
Scotland, of course.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.790
Bagpiping on the Moors.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.970
In India, playing around.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.360
Making the trek
across the Sahara.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.690
The only thing more stubborn
than an octopus is a camel,

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.920
we all know this is fact.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.170
Again, in all of these
illustrations-- even

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.660
in going around the world--
I'm only including the details

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.250
that I need.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:48.180
You can see they all have the
striped background behind them.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.050
And it's really just
setting the scene,

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.970
putting the characters
in the forefront.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.050
I think that's also--
personally, for me

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.610
I spent the early
part of my career

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.610
just drawing backgrounds--
that I'd now like, screw that.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.410
I just want to draw
the characters.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.200
And it's laziness.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.970
But the really special thing,
and what's really touched me--

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.420
and it's something that being
an artist on the internet

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.840
these days, that you
wouldn't have gotten even

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.580
when I started back in
'96-- is the fan community.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.190
And people sending
you posts, or using

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.240
a hashtag Otto and Victoria.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.050
And then seeing this
beautiful, amazing cosplay.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.150
I had done some steampunk
artwork for Disneyland

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.900
and we did an opening
there, and what

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.500
was great was this
person on the bottom left

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.910
had dressed up as
Victoria at Disneyland.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.204
And what was amazing for me,
and I still get goose bumps,

00:28:39.204 --> 00:28:40.870
is when I was walking
through Disneyland

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:45.060
I saw her and kids taking
their picture with her, one

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.050
of my characters at Disneyland.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:51.460
It was a subversive kind of,
hey, that's kind of cool.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.500
And then it continued
with amazing tattoos,

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.090
kids sending in
artwork because they

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.500
love Victoria's green hair.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.630
This was kind of a
fun full circle mashup

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.550
for me, when someone sent
me a Calvin and Hobbes Otto

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.530
and Victoria drawing.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.990
Balloon art, because
everyone loves balloon art.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.900
And my favorite, Otto
and Victoria LEGOs.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.576
So pretty cool.

00:29:18.576 --> 00:29:20.950
But then, in the height of
this thing, what really struck

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:25.190
me is when my friend told
me, hey if you write Google--

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:30.371
if you Google Walking Your,
the first thing will be dog,

00:29:30.371 --> 00:29:32.870
the second thing will be cat,
and the third will be octopus.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.470
So I'm doing something right.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:40.090
And sharing this anecdote
here makes me even happier.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.740
So it was this work with
these two characters.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:47.920
A strong friendship between
unlikely people, especially one

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.360
that can't talk, that got
Marvel calling me and saying we

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.780
have a couple of
characters that we

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.390
think you'd be really good at.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:01.820
They're very odd and unique
friends, and one of them

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.260
can't really talk.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.290
Well he's got a very limited
vocabulary, at least.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.840
Would you mind doing
a comic with us?

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.290
And I thought, no.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.790
You guys are kidding.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.810
In fact, the first
couple of emails

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.230
I got from them I
thought was spam.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.080
Because it just said
Greetings From Marvel

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.010
in the subject line.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.822
And I'm like, delete.

00:30:21.822 --> 00:30:23.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.379
And it wasn't until the sixth
one that I actually read it,

00:30:26.379 --> 00:30:28.170
and it said that they
want to work with me.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.290
And I'm like, oh.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.802
OK, I'll read through next time.

00:30:32.802 --> 00:30:33.510
But it was great.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:36.290
Guardians of the Galaxy
had just come out last year

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:40.450
and Groot was kind of a
runaway character for them

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.790
so they wanted to give him
his own six issue mini series.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.620
And they said that they had
seen my Otto and Victoria work

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:51.180
and saw how expressive I could
get with a character that

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.300
really only had eyes, and
wanted kind of an animated

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.910
feel for their Groot book.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.740
So these are a few of
my pages, and this is

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.640
my first time doing comic art.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.230
And I was really flattered
when they told me

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:12.420
they wanted me to do
pencils, inking, and color.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.150
So all the art for the book.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:17.660
And then I got really stressed
when they told me they wanted

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.260
pencils, inks, and full color.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.989
And I'm like, I
still work at Disney.

00:31:21.989 --> 00:31:23.030
And they're like, I know.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:23.605
I know.

00:31:23.605 --> 00:31:25.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.330
So I'm proud of the work.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.830
I really did treat it like
it was an animated movie,

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.880
using color and tone.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.180
This was pretty early
on, where Groot really

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.370
has a desire to see the galaxy.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.920
So I really wanted to pump up
the saturation of that moment,

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.350
to really heighten the
emotional moment for him.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.960
Of course, it's
Marvel so there's

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.650
going to be big epic battles.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.350
Especially when they're
fighting cyberspace sharks.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.790
And so, you know, it was fun
to do these kind of full page

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.510
Marvel-esque drawings.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:02.100
But still in a
very cartoony way.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.750
Another thing I found
in doing this book

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.740
was because the
characters are so

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.640
weird, the more we can
ground their environment

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.790
and where they are in
relatable places, the more easy

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.300
it is to digest.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.680
It's something we talked
about on Treasure Planet.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.790
We had the 70/30
rule, where something

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.980
had to be 70% recognizable
and then just have

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.810
a 30% tweak on it.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.210
So if you look at the
ships in Treasure Planet,

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.890
they look like sailing ships.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.690
It's not until you look a little
closer and you see, oh wait.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.690
Those are like space
engines on the back

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.650
and they're floating
and that sort of thing.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:44.440
So stuff like this, where
the script pages called

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.940
for Rocket and Groot
to be discussing

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.510
their plans in a space port.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:52.230
I made it look like
a diner, and just

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.980
kind of a roadhouse
sort of thing

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.310
that we could all relate to.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.320
This was a fun
moment where Groot

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.190
has a fantasy of joining the
Marvel universe where all

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.500
the heroes are Groot versions.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.760
So you have Iron
Groot, Spidergroot,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.350
the Incredible Groot,
Howard the Groot, and then,

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:16.000
of course, Grootlactus
and the Silver Grooter.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.550
Which was pretty fun.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.690
And of course
during the sequence,

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.920
Groot is totally fangirling
and that drawing of Groot

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.690
is kind of how I felt during
this whole process of drawing

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:27.190
it.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.685
Like I was getting to play with
these amazing action figures.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:37.010
In the story, Rocket
and Groot get separated

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.230
and that presented
a writing challenge

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.890
in that Groot-- Rocket always
serves as Groots translator.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.330
So if you don't have him, how
is the reader going to relate?

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.520
How are we going to get
what Groot is saying?

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.260
And the writer of this series
of books, Jeff Loveness,

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.590
is an amazing writer.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.540
Works for Jimmy Kimmel,
that's his day job.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.320
Came up with this
great concept in that

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.820
the word bubbles, "I am
Groot" would become the frame

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.590
for what he's actually saying.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:07.250
It's hard to see in
this stage, but he's

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.090
saying I am Groot
in the first page

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.650
and the illustration
within those letters

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.500
are Rocket being taken
away by space pirates.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.350
And I thought that was
so clever in that it

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.489
gives a visual subtext.

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:21.920
So the reader instantly
becomes a translator

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.800
for Groot, which is pretty cool.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.679
This is another fun scene to
illustrate, how the two met.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.610
In some fun visual
storytelling here, you

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:35.170
can tell on the bottom
frame their relationship

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.989
to each other just by how
they're sitting and acting.

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:42.020
And on the next page,
when you turn the page,

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.719
you see that Rocket actually
stands up for Groot.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:48.070
And we revisit that page,
and now they're buddies.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.290
And again, all the
little details.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.110
How they're sitting
next to each other.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.679
It is literally,
too-- industry secret,

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.480
here-- it is the same drawing.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.340
Thank goodness for
Photoshop layers.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:07.230
I just move them together, so
that saved me about 30 minutes.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.040
This was another fun panel.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.750
This is Rocket and
Groot reminiscing

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.360
about their adventures.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.920
And it was fun to play around
with the framing, something

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.980
that we don't get to do in film.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:21.190
Because in film you're locked
into the rectangle, right?

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.460
Or a square, if
you're old school.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.930
But it's a locked frame
for the entire piece.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.550
In comics, you really get to
blow the doors open on staging.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:34.610
Even on this piece,
using branches

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.000
to break the frame instead
of the normal white boundary

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.160
boxes.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.170
There's a character we
meet in this series,

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.390
and she's called Numinus.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.860
She's the goddess
of fate and chance.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.120
And when Groot meets
her in the story,

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.650
she's feeling rather guilty
because all the fate and chance

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.640
that she's done
has usually turned

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.860
out bad for these characters
in the Marvel universe.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.270
Something as simple as being bit
by a spider, for Peter Parker,

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.970
ultimately, could be argued,
led to the death of Gwen Stacy.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:07.990
So on and so forth.

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:11.240
So, she's kind of
in a down place.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.600
But Groot, in his
own special way,

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.330
reminds her of all the
good that has come,

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:18.820
and all the good moments.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:23.460
And this frame was
really hard to work on.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.170
The page-- the written
page described it

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:30.450
as, "Groot describes all the
wonderful things of the Marvel

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.750
universe within the
words, I am Groot."

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.490
Right, thanks buddy.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.830
So it that took
forever to lay out,

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.190
but I'm really proud of it.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:43.560
And, again, it means something.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.870
It comes at an emotional
point of the story.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.920
So it's not just about
drawing for drawings sake,

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.690
it does have a place in the
story and an emotional beat.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.280
And I was really happy
that I got the two Captain

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.320
Americas in the letter A. I
just geek out with all of you.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.885
So it was-- that time in that
part of the galaxy had ended

00:37:05.885 --> 00:37:07.490
and it was wonderful.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:10.250
And then I decided to play
in another galaxy that

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.980
was more far, far away.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.210
And the Force Awakens
had just come out

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.984
and, again, I love
Calvin and Hobbes.

00:37:16.984 --> 00:37:19.650
And I thought, well I'm going to
mix peanut butter and chocolate

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:24.370
together and mash up Calvin
and Hobbes and Star Wars.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.960
Which, honestly, is
not an original idea.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.460
Everyone's kind of
done their pass--

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.830
there's Doctor Who mashups,
there's-- anything is mashed up

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:32.942
with Calvin and Hobbes.

00:37:32.942 --> 00:37:35.150
Eventually I want to do a
mashup of Calvin and Hobbes

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.260
with Calvin and Hobbes,
just to be meta.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.450
c in the meantime,
I've been doing this.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:44.390
Which was more just kind of
overlays of traditional Calvin

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.970
and Hobbes comics with
the new characters.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.180
And it was really
a fun chance for me

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.640
to play in Bill
Watterson's style.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.860
He has such a neat style.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.920
I really encourage you guys
to look at the art online

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.640
when you can or pull out
the books that you have,

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.830
because that guy
could draw anything.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.240
And drawing a TIE fighter
in Bill Watterson's style

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.170
is a really fun challenge.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.480
c it wasn't until I drew this
one where Han Solo says, "You

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.800
know, he gets this from
your side of the family,"

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.410
that I realized
there was a deeper

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.530
connection between Calvin
and Hobbes and Star Wars.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.254
And that's-- has anyone
seen Force Awakens?

00:38:22.254 --> 00:38:23.170
You guys have seen it?

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:23.830
Yeah.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.310
So Kylo Ren-- spoiler
alert-- Kylo Ren

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:30.890
is the son of Princess
Leia and Han Solo.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:34.370
And after watching the
movie I thought, wow.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.250
He must have been the
ultimate problem child.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.980
How must it have been in
that household growing up?

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.020
And then I look at
the Calvin strips

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.760
and, you know, the whole idea
of those terrible snowmen

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.610
that he would make.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:50.180
And the fact that he would be
using one as target practice

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.390
is maybe a little dark.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.450
But it's funny.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:57.190
And I think if you continue
that metaphor even further, well

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:01.010
of course Kylo Ren's imaginary
friend would not be a tiger.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.470
It would be Darth Vader.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:07.700
And these two in their Star
Killer tree fort would plan

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.390
rebel attacks against
the girl, Suzy Durkin's.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:15.220
Or Rey, in this case,
and her little droid.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.100
So again, that
whole relationship

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:22.390
between Calvin and Suzy really
tended to play out really well.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.680
And it was my first
genuine experience

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.600
of something going
viral, which was pretty

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.800
exciting to be a part of.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.110
I did these original
six images on a Monday,

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.900
and by Thursday
they were featured

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.760
on Huffington Post, Hollywood
Reporter, Entertainment Weekly.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.570
Ultimately getting a
call from Time Magazine.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:50.350
So it was pretty interesting,
the power of fandom

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.140
and the internet
teaming together

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.260
can really do some fun things.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.770
Of course, the
complicated relationship

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:04.630
between Kylo Ren and Rey--
who knows where it ends?

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.310
Maybe they'll be brother and
sister, like Luke and Leia.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.140
Then this will be extra creepy.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:14.470
But worse things have happened
in the Star Wars galaxy.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:16.170
And then, of course, babysitter.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.150
You know, mom and
dad want a day out

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.251
so Uncle Lando is
going to come by.

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:20.750
"So...

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.890
Does your mom ever
talk about me?"

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:27.440
"These babysitter's
getting worse every time."

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.830
So it's fun taking
quotes from the movie

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:33.970
and putting a fun spin on it.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.640
Childish spin.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:42.560
And, of course, little Kylo
will never go in mother's closet

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.950
ever again.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.760
Bath time is always an
intergalactic struggle.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.510
"The first order will
not stand for this!"

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.770
"Your first order
is to take a bath."

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.850
You know, dumb puns like that.

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:59.640
But at the end of the day
mom is always there for you,

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.950
to kiss you and your
stuffed animal goodnight.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:06.240
No matter how
complicated of an issue

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.960
you might have with
your own father.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.700
So that's kind of it
for my presentation.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.326
Do you guy have any questions?

00:41:14.326 --> 00:41:17.525
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.256
Thank you very much.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.740
AUDIENCE: I noticed
that you numbered

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.060
all the tentacles of Otto.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.430
But obviously, didn't,
you know-- they're not

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:32.190
including the final drawing.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.790
It looks like you draw
all eight tentacles,

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.260
no matter the perspective.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.572
BRIAN KESINGER: Yeah.

00:41:39.572 --> 00:41:40.780
AUDIENCE: Is that on purpose?

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.630
Or--

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.060
BRIAN KESINGER:
It is on purpose.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.330
And I do that on the
final illustrations.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.800
If I'm signing and
doodling, I'll only do four.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.320
Just for everyone's comfort.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.020
But, yeah.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.280
I do try to keep track of
them, just because it's

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.840
a fun challenge for me to come
up with eight ideas in one

00:41:58.840 --> 00:41:59.830
drawing.

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.274
And then, like I
said, he's a gentleman

00:42:02.274 --> 00:42:04.440
so we want to make sure
that all eight tentacles are

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.294
present at all times.

00:42:07.294 --> 00:42:08.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:08.784 --> 00:42:10.450
AUDIENCE: So actually,
we've met before.

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:11.550
I'm an artist as well.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.130
BRIAN KESINGER: Oh, yeah.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, from
like comic-con and stuff.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.940
BRIAN KESINGER: Awesome.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.320
Yeah good to see you again.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.410
AUDIENCE: I was
really curious, when

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:24.170
I watched-- was watching the
play by play of the digital art

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.743
and stuff.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.530
First of all, just sort
of a double question,

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.199
what tool do you use to
draw into the computer?

00:42:32.199 --> 00:42:33.240
BRIAN KESINGER: Oh, yeah.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.550
I forgot.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.539
I draw in Photoshop
and I use a Cintiq.

00:42:36.539 --> 00:42:37.705
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's a Cintiq?

00:42:37.705 --> 00:42:39.204
BRIAN KESINGER:
Yeah, it's a Cintiq.

00:42:39.204 --> 00:42:40.802
AUDIENCE: I'm so jealous of you.

00:42:40.802 --> 00:42:42.510
BRIAN KESINGER: I'm
spoiled with it, too.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.910
AUDIENCE: I believe it.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.330
I've got a Wacom Bamboo,
so I'm-- I'll get there

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:47.830
eventually.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:51.047
And then I was wondering if--
did you, for the line drawing--

00:42:51.047 --> 00:42:52.630
you probably don't
need it because you

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.740
are so experienced
with drafting,

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.120
but do you ever use the
pen tool in Photoshop

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.714
to get that final crisp line?

00:42:58.714 --> 00:42:59.880
BRIAN KESINGER: No, I don't.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.900
Yeah, because I have
some custom brushes

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.590
that I've gotten from
friends and everywhere

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.940
and they're more organic.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.560
And I want-- I kind
of want to fool people

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.770
into thinking that they're
not computer drawings.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:17.330
And there is a warmth
there that comes from that.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:18.776
It simulates--
the pressure I use

00:43:18.776 --> 00:43:20.400
simulates a Sharpie,
which is something

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.880
we do at work where
you take a Sharpie

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.490
and you cut the end of it so
that it has a chisel edge.

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:29.320
And then you can get
a thick and thin,

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.840
depending on your pressure.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.200
So that's what
this pressure does.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.190
So it's limiting in
a way, but that's

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.430
how it should be because real
artist tools are limiting.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:41.130
AUDIENCE: How do
you train yourself

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.280
to get that-- any suggestions?

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.400
BRIAN KESINGER: Just
practice, because it's

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.810
very weird drawing on a Cintiq.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:48.690
It's like drawing
on ice, you know?

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.930
There's no tooth
to it or anything.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:55.680
So we do most of our storyboards
at the studio on Cintiqs,

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.310
so that's every day, you know,
nine hours a day drawing on it.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:02.670
So you put your hours and
then you get used to it.

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:03.674
But, yeah.

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.340
Don't get frustrated
when you first try,

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.320
because it does
feel pretty alien.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:07.980
But, yeah.

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.327
Ultimately you get there.

00:44:09.327 --> 00:44:10.410
AUDIENCE: Awesome, thanks.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:11.540
BRIAN KESINGER: Thank you.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.022
Yeah, go for it.

00:44:14.022 --> 00:44:16.480
AUDIENCE: So first off I want
to thank you for coming here.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:16.920
BRIAN KESINGER: Oh, thank you.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.710
AUDIENCE: I'm sure
everyone here agrees.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:20.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:20.134 --> 00:44:22.550
I'm really happy that I got a
chance to come meet you here

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.970
because apparently I missed
you at the Geeky Tee's

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:25.940
grand opening where--

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.480
BRIAN KESINGER: Oh, bummer.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.660
AUDIENCE: I was told
that you came and went

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.910
while I was in the other room.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:30.070
BRIAN KESINGER: Yes, yeah.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.620
AUDIENCE: So the question
I have is, to a degree,

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:36.500
for my wife who is a--
she's in TV animation.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:42.040
And they tend to do all
traditional animation.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.285
Still digital, but 2-D.

00:44:43.285 --> 00:44:44.160
BRIAN KESINGER: Yeah.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.290
AUDIENCE: And sort
my general question

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.550
for anyone in the
industry is how do you

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.820
feel about that shift where
more things-- especially

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:55.320
in features-- have
gone to 3-D CG

00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:00.120
and you do you, at any point,
miss the traditional aspects,

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.890
whether it be
digital or on paper?

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:05.400
BRIAN KESINGER: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.450
I miss drawing
sometimes, which is why I

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:09.500
do all this stuff on the side.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.250
But there's a great animation
book, The Illusion of Life

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.050
by Frank and Ollie,
is one of the nine--

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.470
there were two of the
nine old men, Disney's

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:19.790
original animators.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.210
And they did this book, it's
like the Bible on animation

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.880
called The Illusion of Life.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.010
And I feel that
that's what animation

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.710
is, the illusion of life.

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:31.380
And the more we can do to make
that illusion real, the better.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.120
Which is where I see a
lot of strength of CG

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.640
and where I think a
lot of the audience

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.540
feels drawn into these
worlds that we do.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.040
Especially when you
go to see Moana,

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.260
I mean the stuff
in there is just--

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.230
it's like all goosebumps.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:51.910
And it's stuff that you can't
really get with 2-D. That said,

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:55.210
I love movies like
Secret of Kells.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:59.260
And-- what's the other one
he did-- Song of the Sea.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.500
Tomm Moore.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:06.710
And I love Fantastic
Mr. Fox and Kubo.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:10.920
I think there's lots of room.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.580
I think what's nice
is that there's

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.100
more diversity in the
media then there was.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:18.040
It used to kind of
be, like, all 2-D

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.580
and then the outlier
was maybe stop motion.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.400
But now we're
starting to see more,

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.030
and to me that's a good thing.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.150
And what's nice
about storyboarding

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:32.400
is it doesn't matter if it's
a CG production, hand-drawn,

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.010
or stop motion.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:37.960
It all needs to be story boarded
first and so, for job security

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.040
sake, story boardings a
place that I recommend

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.930
a lot of artists who
really want to draw

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:46.540
as their career look into.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.412
That and visual development.

00:46:48.412 --> 00:46:49.870
But does that answer
your question?

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:50.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.360
BRIAN KESINGER: In
another long winded way?

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:51.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.661
BRIAN KESINGER: OK, cool.

00:46:52.661 --> 00:46:54.594
Thank you.

00:46:54.594 --> 00:46:56.520
Anything else?

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.130
Yeah.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.565
Please, step up to the mic.

00:47:01.565 --> 00:47:03.940
AUDIENCE: So I just wanted to
let everybody know that I'm

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.160
married because of Brian.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:05.350
So--

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:06.250
BRIAN KESINGER: Mmm.

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:07.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.030
BRIAN KESINGER: That
was pretty special.

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.430
AUDIENCE: It was.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:10.346
BRIAN KESINGER: And
requires some explanation,

00:47:10.346 --> 00:47:11.195
that sentence.

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:12.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:15.034
AUDIENCE: If you just stop
by the tea room and bend five

00:47:15.034 --> 00:47:16.200
and I'll tell you the story.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.144
It's a great story.

00:47:17.144 --> 00:47:18.560
Everybody else has
had to hear it.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.122
But--

00:47:19.122 --> 00:47:20.080
BRIAN KESINGER: Uh huh.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:20.900
AUDIENCE: Anyway.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.870
So obviously Otto and
Victoria and the Tea Girls

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:27.627
hold, like, a big
place in my heart.

00:47:27.627 --> 00:47:29.960
And I was just wondering--
because I know how successful

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.266
your Kickstarter for
Dressing Your Octopus was--

00:47:32.266 --> 00:47:33.140
BRIAN KESINGER: Yeah.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.879
AUDIENCE: --so I was
wondering if that's

00:47:34.879 --> 00:47:37.170
where you plan on kind of
ending with those characters?

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.780
Or if you have any future
plans for Otto and Victoria

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.009
or for the Tea Girls.

00:47:41.009 --> 00:47:42.300
BRIAN KESINGER: I do, actually.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:42.820
For both.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:43.320
Thank you.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.640
And-- Yeah, we're working
on-- I'm doing a third book.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.820
So I just did a paper
doll book that, again,

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:56.800
in embracing kind of the old
world toy and steampunk vibe.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.456
I thought, well why
have a real toy when

00:47:59.456 --> 00:48:00.580
you could have paper dolls?

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.663
Because that's what they
would have had back then.

00:48:02.663 --> 00:48:06.640
So I talked to my publisher and
we decided to do a Kickstarter

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.270
for a paper doll book
that went really well.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.620
But I'm doing another
narrative book,

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.490
so I did Walking Your Octopus,
Traveling With Your Octopus

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:16.990
and I'm doing a
third one now called

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.350
Time Traveling
With Your Octopus.

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:23.910
So I get to do medieval
punk, and rikoko punk,

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:24.830
and future punk.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:28.270
So as I expanded the world
in the traveling book,

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.790
I hope to expand over time
with the traveling book.

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:33.940
And then I am really
excited because I'm

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:37.310
big into tabletop
games, so we're

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.900
working on a Otto and
Victoria board game.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.220
So that's going
to be really fun,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.810
and I'm really excited to
do the art for the boards,

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.530
and the cards, and-- it's going
to be a million components,

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:48.090
but--

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:49.130
AUDIENCE: You just made my year.

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.963
BRIAN KESINGER: Yay.

00:48:49.963 --> 00:48:50.740
Yay.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.300
And we'll probably be play
testing it at Geeky Teas, too.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:53.650
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:54.566
I'm going to be there.

00:48:54.566 --> 00:48:55.883
With green hair.

00:48:55.883 --> 00:48:57.120
BRIAN KESINGER: Awesome.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:57.630
Thank you.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:58.320
Thank you.

00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:58.820
Yeah.

00:49:03.001 --> 00:49:04.000
AUDIENCE: Keep it short.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.900
But since that you
mention now that you're

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.500
going to be doing
a time traveling,

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.910
would you ever
consider taking them

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:12.671
into the world of
Kazuo Yamazaki?

00:49:12.671 --> 00:49:14.420
BRIAN KESINGER: Oh,
that would be awesome.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.260
AUDIENCE: I think
that would be great.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.080
BRIAN KESINGER: Yeah, in fact--

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.000
AUDIENCE: I'd love to
see that, actually.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.850
BRIAN KESINGER: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:19.940
AUDIENCE: Like a spin off of
Calcifer or something from--

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:20.815
BRIAN KESINGER: Yeah.

00:49:20.815 --> 00:49:22.040
Oh, that would be awesome.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.520
I love those movies and
actually- I'm trying to think,

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.159
I haven't done a mash up
of them-- with them yet.

00:49:27.159 --> 00:49:28.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:29.740
I mean, I'll look out for that.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.100
BRIAN KESINGER: Yeah.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.320
AUDIENCE: You got me excited,
because once you said that I

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.802
was like, I was going to see
if you're-- going to ask you

00:49:34.802 --> 00:49:36.510
if you're going to
ever visit that world.

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:38.740
But now that you said that
your going to do time travel,

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.680
you could throw that in there.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.530
BRIAN KESINGER: Right.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:41.030
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:42.071
BRIAN KESINGER: Oh, yeah.

00:49:42.071 --> 00:49:44.930
Munn and OK Victoria
would be awesome.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.054
AUDIENCE: Sit here and
listen [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:47.054 --> 00:49:48.470
BRIAN KESINGER:
Thank you so much.

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:50.930
Thank you.

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:51.430
Yeah.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.300
AUDIENCE: Hi, love your art.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:58.860
BRIAN KESINGER: Oh, thank you.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:49:59.580
AUDIENCE: Really exciting.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.304
So one of our family
friends is a student

00:50:01.304 --> 00:50:03.220
at the art center studying
visual development.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.090
BRIAN KESINGER: Oh, great.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:06.048
AUDIENCE: And one of the
questions that came up

00:50:06.048 --> 00:50:10.990
was as a person working in an
animation studio like Disney

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.860
or DreamWorks, how
much of that art

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.550
is actually visible
to the public?

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:18.000
Do those visual development
layouts actually

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.290
showing in the movie?

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:21.110
Or is it all sort of digitized?

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:24.159
And is there art just for people
who are working internally?

00:50:24.159 --> 00:50:25.700
BRIAN KESINGER:
Yeah, it's more that.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.120
It's more internal.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.550
It's funny, visual
development and story

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.490
are more invisible art.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:32.990
Right?

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:35.500
Like, they're very
important to the process,

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.035
but ultimately they're just
a step to the final goal.

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.660
The nice thing about
visual development

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.270
is they usually put out
art books for these movies,

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:46.570
and that's the bread and
butter for those books.

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:48.750
Because of all the beautiful
visual development.

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:53.870
So it does get seen and-- but
it's usually in that form.

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:57.340
But if the painting
itself isn't seen,

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.900
it's certainly felt.
All the information

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.410
that's put in there, all the
knowledge of color, of scale,

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.010
all those principles
are what make

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:08.850
a movie-- like what
we do at Disney--

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:11.102
look as rich as they do.

00:51:11.102 --> 00:51:13.060
Because we have these
visual development people

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:17.230
that are just fine
artists to start,

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:19.880
and then they get
into animation.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.940
I caution people--
it's interesting,

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.820
there's a trend
now of people, oh.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:28.250
I want to be an animator, so
they just go learn animation.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:29.790
But if you look
at all the people

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:34.520
that started the Disney
studio, started the heritage,

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.080
they were all artists first.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.880
And then put their
art into the films.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.480
So it's tricky, because there
is a lot more great animation

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.840
instruction out
there, but remember

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.060
to balance that out and not
just make cartoons all day.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.370
As much as that's fun to do.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:51.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.150
BRIAN KESINGER: Cool, thank you.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:54.400
Well, thank you so much guys.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.860
I really appreciate your time.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.060
Thank you.

00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:00.410
[APPLAUSE]
