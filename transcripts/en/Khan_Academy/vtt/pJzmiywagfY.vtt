00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.050
We've learned a good bit
about the dot product.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.110
But when I first introduced it,
I mentioned that this was

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.730
only one type of vector
multiplication, and the other

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.150
type is the cross product, which
you're probably familiar

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.840
with from your vector calculus
course or from

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.090
your physics course.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.030
But the cross product is
actually much more limited

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.940
than the dot product.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.280
It's useful, but it's
much more limited.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.970
The dot product is defined
in any dimension.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.810
So this is defined for any two
vectors that are in Rn.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.160
You could take the dot product
of vectors that have two

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.650
components.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.020
You could take the dot product
of vectors that have a million

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.840
components.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.430
The cross product is
only defined in R3.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.960
And the other, I guess, major
difference is the dot produc,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.350
and we're going to see this in a
second when I define the dot

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.370
product for you, I haven't
defined it yet.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.140
The dot product results
in a scalar.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.850
You take the dot product
of two vectors,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.240
you just get a number.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.960
But in the cross product you're
going to see that we're

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.130
going to get another vector.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.185
And the vector we're going to
get is actually going to be a

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:17.570
vector that's orthogonal to
the two vectors that we're

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.230
taking the cross product of.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.580
So now that I have you excited
with anticipation, let me

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.370
define it for you.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.300
And you probably already have
seen this once or twice in

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.960
your mathematical careers.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.200
Let's say I have the vector a.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.680
It has to be in R3, so
it only has three

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.510
components: a1, a2 and a3.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.050
And I'm going to cross that with
the vector b and it has

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.910
three components:
b1, b2 and b3.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:54.650
a cross b is defined
as a third vector.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.360
And now this is going to seem a
little bit bizarre and hard

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.500
to essentially memorize because
this is a definition.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.120
But I'll show you how I think
about it when I have my

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.220
vectors written in
this column form.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.960
If you watch the physics
playlist, I have a bunch of

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.400
videos on the cross product
and I show you how I think

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.070
about the cross product when I
have it in the i, j, k form.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.620
But when I have it like this,
the way you think about this

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.880
first term up here, this is
going to be another three

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.550
vector or another vector in R3,
so it's going to have 1,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.320
2, 3 terms.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.570
For the first term, what you do
is you ignore these top two

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.330
terms of this vector and then
you look at the bottom two and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.670
you say, a2 times b3
minus a3 times b2.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.790
And I've made a few videos on
determinants, although I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.500
haven't formally done them in
kind of this linear algebra

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.490
playlist yet.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.260
But if you remember kind of
co-factor-- finding out the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.410
co-factor terms for when
you're determining the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.780
determinant or if you're just
taking the determinant for a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.260
2x2 matrix, this might
seem very familiar.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.740
So this first term right here is
essentially the determinant

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.770
of-- if you get rid of this
first row out of both of these

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.370
guys right here, you take a2
times b3 minus a3 times b2.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.890
So it's a2 times b3
minus a3 times b2.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.110
That was hopefully pretty
straightforward.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.600
Now, not to make your life any
more complicated, when you do

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.100
the second, when you do the
middle row, when you do this

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.150
one right here, so you
cross that out.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.150
And you might want to do a1
times b3 minus a3 times b1.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.380
And that would be natural
because that's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.380
what we did up there.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.800
But the middle row you
do the opposite.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.310
You do a3 times b1 minus
a1 times b3.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.890
Or you can kind of view it as
the negative of what you would

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.180
have done naturally.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.310
So you would have done
a1 b3 minus a3 b1.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.490
Now we're going to do
a3 b1 minus a1 b3.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.640
And that was only for
that middle row.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.120
And then, for the bottom
row, we cross that out

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.300
again or ignore it.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.490
And we do a1 times b2, just like
we do with the first row.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.980
Times a2 b1.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.930
Or minus a2 b1.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.920
This seems all hard to-- and
it is hard to remember.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.280
That's why I kind of have to get
that system in place like

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.130
I just talked to you about.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.650
But this might seem pretty
bizarre and hairy.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.870
So let me do a couple of
examples with you, just so you

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.390
get the hang of our definition
of the dot product in R3.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.200
So let's say that I have the
vector-- let's say I'm

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.950
crossing the vector.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.730
I have the vector 1,
minus 7, and 1.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:58.180
And I'm going to cross that
with the vector 5, 2, 4.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.475
So this is going to be equal
to a third vector.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.920
Let me get some space to
do my mathematics.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.170
So for the first element in
this vector, the first

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.950
component, we just ignore the
first components of these

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.610
vectors and we say minus 7
times 4 minus 1 times 2.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.680
And these are just regular
multiplication.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.830
I'm not taking the
dot product.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.570
These are just regular
numbers.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.050
Then for the middle term, we
ignore the middle terms here

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.660
and then we do the opposite.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.270
We do 1 times 5 minus
1 times 4.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.410
Remember, you might have been
tempted to do 1 times 4 minus

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.380
1 times 5 because that's how we
essentially did it in the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.900
first term.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.240
But the middle term
is the opposite.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.290
And then finally, the third
term you ignore the third

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.030
terms here and then you do it
just like the first term.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.260
You start in the top left.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:04.340
1 times 2 minus 7.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.240
Put that in parentheses.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.500
Minus minus 7 times 5.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.070
And so that is equal
to-- let me see.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.500
What do we get?

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.580
Minus 7 times 4.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.890
I don't want to make a careless
mistake here.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.960
That's minus 28.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.880
Minus 2.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.490
So this is minus 30 for
that first term.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.540
This one is 5 minus 4.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.530
5 minus 4 is just 1.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.430
And then 2 minus minus 35.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.680
So 2 minus minus 35.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.690
That's 2 plus 35.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.370
That's 37.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.220
So there you go.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.280
Hopefully you understand at
least the mechanics of the

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.400
cross product.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.950
So the next thing you're
saying well, OK.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.000
I can find the cross product
of two things.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.790
But what is this good for?

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.400
What does this do for me?

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.580
And the answer is, is that this
third vector right here,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.170
and depending on whether I stay
in the abstract case or

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.600
whether this case with numbers,
this is orthogonal to

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.680
the two vectors that we took
the cross product of.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:21.920
So this vector right here is
orthogonal to a and b.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.330
Which is pretty neat.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.210
If you just go think about the
last video when we were

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.250
talking about normal vectors
to a plane, we can define a

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.080
vector by-- we can define
a plane by two vectors.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.130
If we define a plane-- let's say
that I have vector a right

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:45.020
there, and then I
have vector b.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.680
Let me do vector b like this.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.650
Those define a plane in R3.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.510
Let me define your plane.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.530
So all the linear combinations
of those two guys, that's a

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.010
plane in R3.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.370
You can kind of view it
as they might form

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.940
a subspace in R3.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.630
That forms a plane.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.070
If you take a cross b, you
get a third vector that's

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.840
orthogonal to those two.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.070
And so a cross b will
pop out like this.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.310
It'll be orthogonal to both of
them and look like that.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.940
And so this vector right
there is a cross b.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.500
And you might say, Sal, how did
you know-- I mean, there's

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.070
multiple vectors that
are orthogonal.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.960
Obviously, the length of the
vector, and I didn't specify

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.900
that there, but it could pop
straight up like that or why

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.630
didn't it-- you know, you just
as easily could have popped

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.610
straight down like that.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.130
That also would be orthogonal
to a and b.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.190
And the way that a cross b is
defined, you can essentially

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.930
figure out the direction
visually by using what's

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.390
called the right hand rule.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.880
And the way I think about it
is you take your right hand

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.290
and let me see if I can draw
a suitable right hand.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.320
Point your index finger
in the direction of a.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.910
So if your index finger is in
the direction of a and then I

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.340
point my middle finger in
the direction of b.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.150
So my middle finger, in this
case, is going to go

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.370
something like that.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.250
My middle finger is going to
do something like that.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.560
And then my other fingers
do nothing.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:18.780
Then my thumb will go in the
direction of a cross b.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.710
You could see that there.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.750
My thumb is in the direction
of a cross b.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.890
And assuming that you are
anatomically similar to me,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.860
then you still get
the same result.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.270
Let me draw it all.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.810
So this is vector a.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:39.320
Vector b goes in
that direction.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.010
Hopefully you don't have a
thumb hanging down here.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.480
You know that a cross b in this
example will point up and

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.160
it's orthogonal to both.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.740
To kind of satisfy you a little
bit, that the vector's

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.570
definitely orthogonal or that
this thing is definitely

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.720
orthogonal to both of these,
let's just play with it and

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.960
see that that definitely
is the case.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.500
And what is orthogonal?

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.490
What is in our context, the
definition of orthogonal?

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.740
Orthogonal vectors.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:15.040
If a and b are orthogonal, that
means that a dot b is

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.770
equal to 0.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.490
Remember, the difference
between orthogonal and

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.090
perpendicular is that
orthogonal also

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.340
applies to 0 vectors.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.550
So these could also
be 0 vectors.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.910
Notice that I didn't say that
any of these guys up here had

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.140
to be nonzero.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.450
Well, in a little bit, we'll
talk about the angle between

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.280
vectors and then you have
to assume nonzero.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.290
But if you're just taking a
cross product, nothing to stop

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.580
you from taking-- no reason
why any of these

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.180
numbers can't be 0.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:43.530
But let me show you that
a cross b is definitely

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.710
orthogonal to both a and b.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.220
I think that might be somewhat
satisfying to you.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.780
So let me copy a cross b here.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.710
I don't feel like
rewriting it.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.250
OK.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.500
Let me paste it.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.310
OK, bundle up little other
stuff with it.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:12.800
Let me take the dot product of
that with just my vector a,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.730
which was just a1, a2, a3.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.530
So what does the dot
product look like?

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.260
That term times that, so it's
a1-- let me get some space.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:31.710
It's a1 times a2 b3 minus
a1 times that.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:37.350
Minus a1 times a3 b2.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.110
And then you have plus
this times this.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.670
So plus a2 times a3.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:47.530
So plus a2 times a3 times b1.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:55.720
And then minus a2 a1 b3.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.180
And then finally, plus-- I'll
just continue it down here.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:10.050
Plus a3 times a1 b2 minus
a3 times a2 b1.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.680
All I did I just took the
cross-- the dot product of

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.590
these two things.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.750
I just took each of this.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.010
This guy times that was equal
to those two terms. That guy

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.370
times that was equal to the next
two terms, equal to those

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.840
two terms. And then this guy
times that was equal to those

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.740
two terms. And if these guys
are really orthogonal, then

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.280
this should be equal to 0.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.020
So let's see if that's
the case.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:35.030
So I have an a1 a2 b3, a
positive here, and then I'm

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.640
subtracting the same
thing here.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.940
This is the same thing as a1 a2
b3, but it's just a minus.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.380
So that will cancel
out with that.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.460
Let's see, what else
do we have?

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.670
We have a minus a1 a3 b2.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.740
We have a plus a1 a3 b2 there,
so these two are going to

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.950
cancel out.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.970
And I think you see where
this is going.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.960
You have a positive a2 a3 b1 and
then you have a negative

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.050
a2 a3 b1 there.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.790
So these will also cancel out.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.370
Now, I just showed you that
it's orthogonal to a.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.110
Let me show you that it's
orthogonal to b.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:17.680
Let me get another version of
my-- the cross product of the

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.940
two vectors.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.640
Probably scroll down
a little bit.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.730
And let me go back.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:28.570
And let me multiply that
times the vector b.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.440
b1, b2 and b3.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.700
I'll do it here just so
I have some space.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:43.430
So b1 times this whole thing
right here is b1 a2 b3 minus

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.530
b1 times this.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.360
Minus b1 a3 b2.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.350
Let me switch colors.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.420
And then b2 times this thing
here is going to be b2-- so

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.690
it's going to be plus.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.630
This is all really one
expression, I'm just writing

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.430
it on multiple lines.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.630
This isn't a vector.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.030
Remember, when you take the dot
product of two things, you

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.990
get a scalar quantity.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.020
So plus b2 times this thing.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:14.450
So b2 a3 b1 minus b2 a1 b3.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.730
And then finally,
b3 times this.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:30.620
So plus b3 a1 b2
minus b3 a2 b1.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.970
So if these guys are definitely
orthogonal, then

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.460
this thing needs to equal 0.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.620
And let's see if that's
the case.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.400
We have a b1, a2, b3.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.750
So b1 and a b3.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.430
b1 a2 b3, that's a positive
one and this

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.190
is a negative one.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.860
You have a b3, an a2 and a b1
so that and that cancel out.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.310
Here you have a minus
b1 a3 b2.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.550
So you have a b1 and a b2.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.110
It's a minus b1 a3 b2.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.530
This is a plus the same thing.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.400
Just switching the order
of the multiplication.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.620
But these two are
the same term.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.560
They're just opposites of each
other, so they cancel out.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.740
And then finally, you have
a b2, an a1 and a b3.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.410
It's a negative.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.000
And then you have a positive
version of the same thing.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.990
So these two guys cancel out.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.860
So you see that this
is also equal to 0.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.360
So hopefully you're satisfied
that this vector right here is

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.800
definitely orthogonal
to both a and b.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.610
And that's because that's
how it was designed.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:28.980
This is a definition.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.510
You could do a little bit of
algebra and you could have

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.680
without me explaining this
definition to you, you could

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.440
have actually come up with this
definition on your own.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.000
But obviously this was kind
of designed to have other

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.920
interesting properties to it.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.010
And I'll cover those in the next
few videos, so hopefully

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.730
you found that helpful.
