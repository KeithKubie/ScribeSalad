00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.250
Widespread publicly funded, mandatory education
has only been around since about the 19th

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.250
century.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.280
Before then, the responsibility of providing
schooling to children fell primarily on their

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.280
families.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.480
Upper- and middle-class families tended to
hire tutors or send their children to a private

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.690
school run by a schoolmaster.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.469
That didn’t mean the children in lower-class
families missed out on learning how to read

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:54.469
and write.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.650
They often learned this at home, through apprenticeships,
or at church-funded schools.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.360
In addition, some poor families scraped together
enough money to pay for their children to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.860
receive an education.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.170
Some even worked out a barter arrangement
with teachers where they paid with surplus

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.300
produce from the family farm.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.970
For instance, poor students from farming families
in Denmark and Sweden often brought baskets

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.700
of potatoes or apples to school as payment,
among other staples (the potato being used

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.420
for food, and the apple generally used for
making drinks at the time).

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.640
In the United States, things changed when
various social reforms came about in the 1800s.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.400
The reforms addressed issues ranging from
food sanitation, treatment of the mentally

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.439
ill, and even education.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.490
Schools became publicly funded and subject
to regulations in order to ensure that all

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.719
students were more or less getting the same
educational opportunity.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.020
By 1913, a majority of the states in the United
States of America required that schools be

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.840
paid for by the government.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.399
However towns on the sparsely settled western
frontier still often bore the responsibility

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.740
for paying for a teacher in the town.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.929
As before, they recruited teachers, and they
provided a schoolhouse where classes could

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.680
be held, a place for the teachers to live,
fuel for heating, and often food.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.680
In these sorts of arrangements, students were
also often tasked with helping the teacher

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.050
maintain the schoolhouse, such as gathering
on Saturdays to give it a thorough cleaning.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.349
That tradition of bringing food to teachers
continued even as the United States government

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.092
took over the responsibility for funding public
education in the West.

00:02:17.092 --> 00:02:20.970
The baskets of food were eventually replaced
with smaller amounts as the old “Boarding

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.040
Round” room and board pay system was replaced
by more in the way of a cash salary.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.790
But why do schoolchildren traditionally give
apples to their teachers?

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.459
As mentioned, there are records of students
from such places as Denmark and Sweden bringing

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.590
both apples and potatoes to their teachers,
among other things, so why don’t students

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.060
traditionally give potatoes to teachers?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.959
There are two generally accepted answers,
one or both of which possibly contributing

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:43.959
to this tradition over other food items like
the potato.

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.260
For the first theory, teachers were often
seen as a moral influence into the lives of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.260
children.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.140
(Indeed, the “Boarding Round” system often
insured that teachers toed the line with the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.030
community’s moral standards- teach something
outside of this, and suddenly see something

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.469
like your food or heating fuel payment disappear.)

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.329
Along with this, the “Tree of Knowledge”
in the story of Adam and Eve in the Book of

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.980
Genesis has often been mistakenly referred
to as an apple tree.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.019
This is partially thanks to Aquila Ponticus,
who was a second century translator translating

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.620
the Old Testament from Hebrew to Greek.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.770
He took the liberty of referring to the Tree
of Knowledge as an apple tree, even though

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.140
the original text doesn’t say that.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.080
It’s likely that he chose this due to the
fact that he was translating it into Greek

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.329
for Greeks and that in Greek mythology apples
were seen as symbols of desire and destruction.

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.420
Due to the prevalence of this “Tree of Knowledge”
/ apple tree idea, it wouldn’t be an out

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.110
of place gift, then, for students to give
their teachers an apple, the fruit representative

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.510
of knowledge.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.500
On to the second popular theory for the continuance
of giving apples- apples arrived in North

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.170
America shortly after the Jamestown Colony
was founded in the early 1600s.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.010
These apples, unlike the ones found in supermarkets
today, tasted bitter, but they could be used

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.030
to make hard apple cider.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.230
Many people, whether rightly or wrongly, considered
hard cider a safer beverage than water because

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.260
widespread sanitation of drinking water did
not yet exist.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.340
Apple trees also flourished in a variety of
climates, contributing to the popularity of

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.340
the fruit.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.220
The sweeping social reforms that allowed schools
and education to become regulated also posed

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.970
a major problem for apples.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.050
The temperance movement that spanned from
the mid-19th century to the early 20th century

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.050
sought to eliminate the drinking of alcohol
in the United States.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.240
Apple growers scrambled to re-brand the fruit
in order to remove themselves from the controversy.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.690
Careful cultivation caused the fruit to lose
its bitter taste and to become sweeter and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.360
sweeter with each new generation of apples.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.630
Marketing campaigns also played a part in
the apple’s new image.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.280
Phrases like “An apple a day keeps the doctor
away” were dusted off and used to brand

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.160
the apple as a healthy snack.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.040
So the theory goes that students and their
parents who wanted to get on a teacher’s

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.940
good side saw apples as a way to give the
teacher a healthy, cheap snack, which was

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.000
also quite versatile, able to be used now
for both drink and a sweet treat.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.140
Thus, they chose to keep giving this food
item, rather than something like the potato.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:17.040
The term “apple-polish” was coined in
the early 1900s and means that a student is

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.710
trying to get favors from their teacher- essentially
a brown-noser or suck-up.
