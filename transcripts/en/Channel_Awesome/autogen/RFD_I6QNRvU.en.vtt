when you CGI there and that even CJ
would<00:16:25.970><c> you</c><00:16:26.060><c> I</c><00:16:26.480><c> think</c><00:16:26.870><c> even</c><00:16:27.139><c> if</c><00:16:27.350><c> you</c><00:16:27.380><c> did</c><00:16:27.680><c> like</c>

you know a full prosthetic like and you
 

00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
you know a full prosthetic like and you
try<00:16:31.040><c> to</c><00:16:31.070><c> put</c><00:16:31.310><c> that</c><00:16:31.459><c> in</c><00:16:31.579><c> three</c><00:16:31.820><c> dimensions</c>

00:16:32.319 --> 00:16:32.329 align:start position:0%
try to put that in three dimensions
 

00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:34.660 align:start position:0%
try to put that in three dimensions
something<00:16:33.320><c> just</c><00:16:33.560><c> was</c><00:16:33.769><c> not</c><00:16:33.949><c> coming</c><00:16:34.279><c> off</c><00:16:34.490><c> right</c>

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
it didn't I got used to it as it went on
so<00:16:41.600><c> I</c><00:16:41.630><c> was</c><00:16:41.750><c> okay</c><00:16:42.079><c> but</c><00:16:42.139><c> something</c><00:16:42.560><c> was</c><00:16:42.889><c> for</c><00:16:43.100><c> me</c>

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:43.250 align:start position:0%
so I was okay but something was for me

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:46.790 align:start position:0%
it's when his helmets on i buy it more
 

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
it's when his helmets on i buy it more
the<00:16:47.029><c> second</c><00:16:47.329><c> the</c><00:16:47.389><c> helmet</c><00:16:47.690><c> comes</c><00:16:47.839><c> off</c><00:16:48.019><c> and</c><00:16:48.410><c> he</c>

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
the second the helmet comes off and he
 

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.009 align:start position:0%
the second the helmet comes off and he
just<00:16:48.740><c> looks</c><00:16:48.920><c> like</c><00:16:48.980><c> a</c><00:16:49.310><c> chewed</c><00:16:49.730><c> purple</c><00:16:50.360><c> eraser</c><00:16:50.810><c> I</c>

00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:51.019 align:start position:0%
just looks like a chewed purple eraser I
 

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:53.949 align:start position:0%
just looks like a chewed purple eraser I
think<00:16:51.560><c> yes</c><00:16:51.829><c> I</c><00:16:52.250><c> think</c><00:16:52.760><c> I</c><00:16:53.000><c> mean</c><00:16:53.180><c> in</c><00:16:53.360><c> terms</c><00:16:53.540><c> of</c><00:16:53.779><c> the</c>

00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
think yes I think I mean in terms of the
 

00:16:53.959 --> 00:16:56.470 align:start position:0%
think yes I think I mean in terms of the
actual<00:16:54.529><c> CGI</c><00:16:55.190><c> with</c><00:16:55.550><c> him</c><00:16:55.699><c> I</c><00:16:55.819><c> think</c><00:16:56.089><c> it's</c><00:16:56.269><c> some</c><00:16:56.449><c> of</c>

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
actual CGI with him I think it's some of
 

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.460 align:start position:0%
actual CGI with him I think it's some of
the<00:16:56.600><c> best</c><00:16:56.810><c> I've</c><00:16:56.990><c> ever</c><00:16:57.019><c> seen</c>

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
the best I've ever seen
 

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.009 align:start position:0%
the best I've ever seen
I<00:16:57.740><c> mean</c><00:16:58.190><c> with</c><00:16:58.399><c> him</c><00:16:58.550><c> moves</c><00:16:58.790><c> around</c><00:16:58.970><c> the</c><00:16:59.389><c> CGI</c><00:16:59.839><c> is</c>

00:17:00.009 --> 00:17:00.019 align:start position:0%
I mean with him moves around the CGI is
 

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.110 align:start position:0%
I mean with him moves around the CGI is
bad<00:17:00.380><c> it's</c><00:17:00.620><c> like</c><00:17:00.680><c> how</c><00:17:01.010><c> do</c><00:17:01.069><c> you</c><00:17:01.250><c> just</c><00:17:01.459><c> his</c><00:17:01.639><c> design</c>

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
bad it's like how do you just his design
 

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.110 align:start position:0%
bad it's like how do you just his design
that's<00:17:02.510><c> what</c><00:17:02.660><c> yeah</c><00:17:02.990><c> there's</c><00:17:03.740><c> something</c><00:17:04.120><c> some</c>

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's what yeah there's something some
 

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.299 align:start position:0%
that's what yeah there's something some
designs<00:17:06.079><c> and</c><00:17:06.290><c> the</c><00:17:06.350><c> earlier</c><00:17:06.650><c> designs</c><00:17:07.100><c> when</c>

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:07.309 align:start position:0%

they kept him in the shadows and some of
 

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:10.150 align:start position:0%
they kept him in the shadows and some of
those<00:17:09.020><c> things</c><00:17:09.169><c> when</c><00:17:09.410><c> you</c><00:17:09.500><c> keep</c><00:17:09.679><c> a</c><00:17:09.829><c> character</c>

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%

in<00:17:10.250><c> the</c><00:17:10.309><c> shadows</c><00:17:10.669><c> they</c><00:17:10.819><c> automatically</c><00:17:11.270><c> feel</c>

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:11.569 align:start position:0%
in the shadows they automatically feel
 

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.510 align:start position:0%
in the shadows they automatically feel
cooler<00:17:11.870><c> somebody's</c><00:17:12.829><c> running</c><00:17:13.010><c> around</c><00:17:13.220><c> in</c>

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
sunlight with his helmet off I'm just
like<00:17:17.350><c> I'm</c><00:17:18.350><c> not</c><00:17:18.470><c> blaming</c><00:17:18.799><c> the</c><00:17:18.860><c> CGI</c><00:17:19.220><c> people</c><00:17:19.549><c> I</c>

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:19.610 align:start position:0%
like I'm not blaming the CGI people I
 

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.890 align:start position:0%
like I'm not blaming the CGI people I
actually<00:17:19.760><c> picked</c><00:17:20.059><c> the</c><00:17:20.150><c> CGI</c><00:17:20.480><c> and</c><00:17:20.630><c> the</c><00:17:20.689><c> movie</c>

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:20.900 align:start position:0%
actually picked the CGI and the movie
 

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.530 align:start position:0%
actually picked the CGI and the movie
was<00:17:20.990><c> really</c><00:17:21.260><c> solid</c><00:17:21.500><c> I</c><00:17:21.919><c> think</c><00:17:22.370><c> yeah</c><00:17:22.490><c> it's</c><00:17:23.360><c> not</c>

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:23.540 align:start position:0%
was really solid I think yeah it's not
 

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.059 align:start position:0%
was really solid I think yeah it's not
that<00:17:23.600><c> it's</c><00:17:24.020><c> that</c><00:17:24.230><c> the</c><00:17:24.350><c> character</c><00:17:24.770><c> design</c>

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:25.069 align:start position:0%
that it's that the character design
 

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.860 align:start position:0%
that it's that the character design
itself<00:17:25.520><c> just</c><00:17:25.819><c> lends</c><00:17:26.030><c> itself</c><00:17:26.329><c> to</c><00:17:26.419><c> a</c><00:17:26.540><c> certain</c>

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
itself just lends itself to a certain
 

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.710 align:start position:0%
itself just lends itself to a certain
like<00:17:27.049><c> yes</c><00:17:27.580><c> yeah</c><00:17:28.580><c> I</c><00:17:28.790><c> thought</c><00:17:29.150><c> about</c><00:17:29.210><c> it</c><00:17:29.570><c> till</c>

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
like yes yeah I thought about it till
 

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.330 align:start position:0%
like yes yeah I thought about it till
now<00:17:29.750><c> but</c><00:17:30.140><c> you</c><00:17:30.530><c> know</c><00:17:30.590><c> I</c><00:17:30.650><c> understand</c><00:17:31.070><c> that</c><00:17:31.220><c> I</c>

mean didn't really bother me too much I
just<00:17:32.750><c> thought</c><00:17:33.020><c> Josh</c><00:17:33.710><c> Brolin's</c><00:17:34.100><c> performance</c>

just thought Josh Brolin's performance
 

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
just thought Josh Brolin's performance
came<00:17:34.910><c> through</c><00:17:35.270><c> that</c><00:17:35.900><c> oh</c><00:17:35.960><c> absolutely</c>
