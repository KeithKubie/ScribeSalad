I'm actually producing that research and

I'm actually producing that research and

this this is something so you know I
 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.530 align:start position:0%
this this is something so you know I

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
code up this algorithm myself yeah using
 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.710 align:start position:0%
code up this algorithm myself yeah using

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
open source software and hey that's
 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
open source software and hey that's
great<00:05:10.140><c> and</c><00:05:10.320><c> everybody</c><00:05:10.470><c> should</c><00:05:10.740><c> do</c><00:05:10.860><c> that</c>

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 align:start position:0%
great and everybody should do that
 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.460 align:start position:0%
great and everybody should do that
except<00:05:11.670><c> that</c><00:05:11.940><c> not</c><00:05:12.090><c> everybody</c><00:05:12.540><c> wants</c><00:05:13.200><c> to</c><00:05:13.260><c> do</c>

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 align:start position:0%
except that not everybody wants to do
 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.220 align:start position:0%
except that not everybody wants to do
that<00:05:13.680><c> and</c><00:05:14.520><c> so</c><00:05:14.730><c> there's</c><00:05:14.940><c> this</c><00:05:15.120><c> sort</c><00:05:15.390><c> of</c><00:05:15.480><c> tension</c>

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 align:start position:0%
that and so there's this sort of tension
 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
that and so there's this sort of tension
here<00:05:16.410><c> right</c><00:05:16.590><c> that</c><00:05:16.770><c> I</c><00:05:16.800><c> I</c><00:05:16.890><c> decided</c><00:05:17.610><c> it</c><00:05:17.730><c> was</c><00:05:17.820><c> very</c>

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 align:start position:0%

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 align:start position:0%

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 align:start position:0%
do the classification but this isn't an

ago<00:05:40.860><c> about</c><00:05:41.280><c> open</c><00:05:41.580><c> GIS</c><00:05:41.970><c> started</c><00:05:42.840><c> getting</c><00:05:43.110><c> me</c><00:05:43.260><c> to</c>

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
ago about open GIS started getting me to
 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
ago about open GIS started getting me to
admit<00:05:43.920><c> that</c><00:05:43.950><c> maybe</c><00:05:44.400><c> there</c><00:05:45.330><c> are</c><00:05:45.360><c> some</c><00:05:45.900><c> it's</c><00:05:46.230><c> not</c>

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 align:start position:0%
admit that maybe there are some it's not
 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.250 align:start position:0%
admit that maybe there are some it's not
this<00:05:46.560><c> sort</c><00:05:46.740><c> of</c><00:05:46.800><c> yes</c><00:05:47.040><c> or</c><00:05:47.220><c> no</c><00:05:47.370><c> open</c><00:05:47.820><c> kind</c><00:05:48.030><c> of</c>

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 align:start position:0%
this sort of yes or no open kind of
 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
this sort of yes or no open kind of
question<00:05:49.260><c> there</c><00:05:49.530><c> is</c><00:05:49.560><c> a</c><00:05:49.800><c> a</c><00:05:50.180><c> continuum</c><00:05:51.180><c> openness</c>

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 align:start position:0%
question there is a a continuum openness
 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
question there is a a continuum openness
and<00:05:51.990><c> so</c><00:05:52.080><c> this</c><00:05:52.230><c> picture</c><00:05:52.950><c> here</c><00:05:53.130><c> is</c><00:05:53.280><c> supposed</c><00:05:53.520><c> to</c>

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 align:start position:0%
and so this picture here is supposed to
 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
and so this picture here is supposed to
suggest<00:05:53.940><c> that</c><00:05:54.090><c> over</c><00:05:54.360><c> time</c><00:05:54.600><c> along</c><00:05:55.050><c> the</c><00:05:55.200><c> road</c><00:05:55.440><c> of</c>

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 align:start position:0%
suggest that over time along the road of
 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.500 align:start position:0%
suggest that over time along the road of
my<00:05:55.770><c> career</c><00:05:56.100><c> I</c><00:05:56.160><c> discovered</c><00:05:56.700><c> maybe</c><00:05:57.300><c> there's</c>

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
my career I discovered maybe there's
 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
my career I discovered maybe there's
actually<00:05:57.810><c> a</c><00:05:57.840><c> sort</c><00:05:58.140><c> of</c><00:05:58.170><c> continuum</c><00:05:58.860><c> of</c><00:05:59.010><c> openness</c>

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 align:start position:0%
actually a sort of continuum of openness
 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.830 align:start position:0%
actually a sort of continuum of openness
right<00:05:59.640><c> not</c><00:05:59.820><c> everybody</c><00:06:00.060><c> has</c><00:06:00.360><c> to</c><00:06:00.510><c> be</c><00:06:00.600><c> able</c><00:06:00.690><c> to</c>

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
right not everybody has to be able to
 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
right not everybody has to be able to
write<00:06:00.990><c> their</c><00:06:01.140><c> own</c><00:06:01.200><c> algorithms</c><00:06:02.180><c> in</c><00:06:03.180><c> order</c><00:06:03.480><c> to</c>

be open in order to be doing some aspect
 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.260 align:start position:0%

so<00:06:09.780><c> it's</c><00:06:10.290><c> this</c><00:06:10.410><c> continuum</c><00:06:10.980><c> and</c><00:06:11.040><c> I</c><00:06:11.100><c> kind</c><00:06:11.310><c> of</c>

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
so it's this continuum and I kind of
 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.490 align:start position:0%
so it's this continuum and I kind of
want<00:06:11.490><c> to</c><00:06:11.550><c> talk</c><00:06:11.700><c> about</c><00:06:12.090><c> that</c><00:06:12.300><c> today</c><00:06:12.900><c> as</c><00:06:13.170><c> a</c>

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
always really great if you can do that
 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:45.820 align:start position:0%
always really great if you can do that
because<00:06:44.600><c> it</c><00:06:44.690><c> can</c><00:06:44.900><c> drive</c><00:06:45.110><c> your</c><00:06:45.380><c> point</c><00:06:45.590><c> home</c><00:06:45.770><c> a</c>

comedians<00:06:47.300><c> use</c><00:06:47.419><c> it</c><00:06:47.569><c> a</c><00:06:47.600><c> lot</c><00:06:47.720><c> as</c><00:06:47.900><c> well</c><00:06:48.130><c> and</c><00:06:49.130><c> so</c>

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 align:start position:0%
comedians use it a lot as well and so
 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
comedians use it a lot as well and so
we've<00:06:49.880><c> got</c><00:06:50.060><c> this</c><00:06:50.240><c> sort</c><00:06:50.389><c> of</c><00:06:50.509><c> big</c><00:06:51.729><c> the</c><00:06:52.729><c> four</c><00:06:53.060><c> V's</c>

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 align:start position:0%
we've got this sort of big the four V's
 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.180 align:start position:0%
we've got this sort of big the four V's
of<00:06:53.599><c> Big</c><00:06:53.810><c> Data</c><00:06:53.990><c> and</c><00:06:54.229><c> we've</c><00:06:54.349><c> got</c><00:06:54.500><c> the</c><00:06:54.650><c> four</c><00:06:54.889><c> R's</c>

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 align:start position:0%
of Big Data and we've got the four R's
 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.020 align:start position:0%
of Big Data and we've got the four R's
of<00:06:55.550><c> openness</c><00:06:55.970><c> and</c><00:06:56.889><c> so</c><00:06:57.889><c> if</c><00:06:58.009><c> you</c><00:06:58.099><c> really</c><00:06:58.340><c> want</c><00:06:58.550><c> to</c>

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 align:start position:0%
of openness and so if you really want to
 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.650 align:start position:0%
of openness and so if you really want to
make<00:06:59.180><c> an</c><00:06:59.300><c> impact</c><00:06:59.509><c> you</c><00:06:59.690><c> need</c><00:06:59.840><c> alliteration</c><00:07:01.660><c> but</c>

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660 align:start position:0%
make an impact you need alliteration but
 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.230 align:start position:0%
make an impact you need alliteration but
basically<00:07:03.020><c> idea</c><00:07:03.380><c> is</c><00:07:03.620><c> that</c><00:07:04.400><c> in</c><00:07:04.849><c> order</c><00:07:05.060><c> for</c>

basically idea is that in order for
