00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.890
An 11,500-year old infant has been unearthed
in Alaska -- and “Sunrise Girl-Child’s”

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.540
DNA suggests that rather than several migratory
waves over time, all Native American ancestry

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.030
traces back to one massive migration.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.460
And to breed plants that use water more efficiently,
researchers at Iowa State University are measuring

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.020
exactly how long it takes for corn plants
to move water from their roots to their leaves

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.520
using graphene plant tattoos.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.520
Vsauce!

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.520
Kevin here.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.540
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.329
The world’s first photovoltaic expressway
has debuted in China.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.740
Qilu Transportation Development Group has
built a 1-kilometer stretch of road that has

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.270
a bottom layer of insulation, a middle layer
of solar-powered batteries, and a top layer

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.309
of transparent concrete.

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.940
The electricity will power highway lights,
cameras, and signs -- but the developers are

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.530
hoping that it will power electric cars and
melt snow in the future.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.930
But the cost is high -- it's $458 per square
meter compared to $5 for a standard asphalt

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.460
road -- and the 1 kilometer stretch will only
create enough electricity to power 93 homes

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.460
for one year.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.350
So this has a long way to go before it becomes
like a thing.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.390
Shrimp claws took 150 million years to develop.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.380
A study of 114 species of shrimp has revealed
how they’re able to snap their claws.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.930
Researchers at the University of Alberta found
what they call ‘extreme biology’ -- shrimp

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.820
evolving to make use of an air vacuum that
stores and expends energy… in a snap.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.670
Shrimp use the snapping motion to communicate,
attack prey, and defend themselves.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.030
So that 150 million years was totally worth
it.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.939
And shrimp are delicious.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.070
Millions of diabetics could benefit from a
skin-like surface.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.979
Currently, diabetics have to prick their skin
to monitor blood sugar levels -- not only

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.720
is it painful, but it can result in infections
and other complications.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.760
But researchers at in Beijing have found that
ultra-thin, skin-like biosensors can reliably

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.409
monitor glucose levels in a non-invasive way
-- which means more comfort and better monitoring.

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:26.010
20 years ago, Apopo started training “Hero
Rats” to detect landmines and diagnose tuberculosis

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.150
-- and they’re getting more efficient.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.469
It takes 4 days for a lab technician to evaluate
100 samples of sputum or for a minesweeper

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.120
to cover an area the size of a tennis court.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.349
A Hero Rat can do either job in just 30 minutes.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.030
Research and development includes teaching
rats to indicate the presence of mines by

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.120
flipping a collar switch and identifying the
presence of new diseases.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.499
So thanks, rats.

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:55.530
We tend to think of robots as rigid, metal
creations -- for now.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.040
The Keplinger Research Group at the University
of Colorado is developing ‘soft’ robots

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.069
that mirror the makeup and movements of biological
muscle tissue.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.160
Soft robotics allows machines to be as forceful
or gentle as they need to be, and researchers

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.019
say the muscle-like electrical actuators that
make industrial and commercial applications

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.920
possible can be produced now for about 10
cents.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.079
Humanity has milked its first platypus.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.760
The male platypus has a venomous spur on its
hind feet that it uses to compete with other

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.120
males for mates, but until now, no one has
extracted the venom.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.629
Tim Faulkner of the Australian Reptile Park
successfully took a sample of venom which

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.529
includes a hormone that may be useful in treating
diabetics.

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:45.540
The world’s first DJ robot is spinning in
the Czech Republic.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.870
A club in Prague challenged robotics manufacturer
KUKA to make a robotic arm that controls the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.279
action and can respond to the crowd.

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:55.810
And the challenge was accepted.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.569
But the robot music revolution isn’t happening
quite yet -- the club is alternating between

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.219
human and robot DJs every hour.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.569
Do tiny sea turtles that hatch on the beach
get tired when they don’t make it to the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.969
water quickly enough?

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.769
Researchers at Florida Atlantic University
put them on a treadmill to find out.

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.400
Sea turtles crawl toward the light, which
means urban glows can disorient them.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.060
FAU researchers found that the turtles crawl,
rest, and keep crawling even after hours of

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.060
effort.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.270
They’re little crawling machines and as
a wise zombie child once said, “I like turtles.”

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.910
At Columbia University’s Robotics and Rehabilitation
Lab, exoskeletons are helping train people

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.650
to walk again....

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.740
The goal is to be able to build and design
lightweight, wearable exoskeletons.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.750
An exoskeleton that doesn't have explicit
joints that can either assist them in their

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.539
movement or train them so that they can eventually
walk without these exoskeletons.

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.270
To come up with novel inventions in science
and technology, we need to develop our own

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.639
toolkits and frameworks for understanding,
instead of blindly memorizing formulas.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.300
Brilliant's interactive problems are a great
way for you to really understand math and

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.300
science.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.620
They have everything from Number Theory, to
Mastering Casino Blackjack, or this one I

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.620
really like that explains Solar Energy from
the ground up - we all know that solar panels

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.900
absorb the Sun's energy, but what is it that
they actually do?

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.080
Your brain will thank you.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.810
Now I’m gonna leave you with an ANYmal robot
which greets a new friend in an interesting

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.810
way…

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.810
You'll see.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:47.590
And as always, thanks for watching.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:06:06.190
Small calculator, a really silent electronic,
a really fast thinker, one that works anywhere

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.979
on battery or plug-in.

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.430
One with all the calculator know-how you'll
probably ever need.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.159
Introducing, the world's smallest electronic
calculator from the maker of the world's most

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.770
complete line, Sharp.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.460
Introducing the ELSI-8 -- the world's smallest
electronic calculator by Sharp.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.659
A price tag to match.

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.340
$345, complete.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.860
ELSI-8 -- the answer.
