00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to talk briefly about histograms as a special case of a bar chart.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The key difference is whereas the bar charts we discussed so far

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
were defined over 2D data, the histograms look at 1D data.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That is, there is only one dimension of data that is being plotted.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let me start with an example.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Here is a fictitious data set about annual income.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Suppose at some company I asked software engineers how much annual income they make.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Again, this data set is contrived.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Of the nine people I asked, here is the survey of different annual salaries.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In the histogram case, I make a bar chart that concerns itself with only one thing,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which is called "frequency," which is short for "count,"

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that will group these salaries into three different buckets--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
from $120,000 on, $130,000 on, and $140,000 on.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What the bar chart plots is the frequency at which people asked fall into the different categories.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Specifically, I am asking you what is the count for the salaries that fall into

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the $120,000 to $130,000 bucket. Please answer it here.
