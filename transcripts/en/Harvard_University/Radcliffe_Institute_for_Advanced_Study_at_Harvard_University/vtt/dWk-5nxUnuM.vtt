00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.500
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.350
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.850
I'm dean here at the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.080
and I'm delighted to welcome you
all to this afternoon's Davis

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.660
Lecture to be delivered by
novelist Garth Risk Hallberg.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.560
At Radcliffe, scholars,
scientists, and artists

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.900
pursue innovative
research and engage

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.190
in cutting-edge creative work
across disciplinary boundaries.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.640
We are also dedicated to sharing
the fruits of their study

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.670
with public audiences through
lectures, conferences,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.200
and exhibitions.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.140
Each year we adopt
a thematic focus

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.810
for some of our programming.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.020
This year's theme is
urbanism-- a topic

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.690
that draws together
students and faculty

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.660
from many parts of
Harvard and connects them

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.030
with public officials
and creative artists.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.570
One such artist is
today's speaker,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.900
Garth Risk Hallberg, author
of the highly acclaimed novel

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.849
City on Fire.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.100
This lecture is
also very special,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.150
because it is the first of
this year's Davis Lectures.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.660
The Davis Lecture series was
established by Kim and Judy

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.320
Davis, and I am thrilled to have
Kim right here in the first row

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.120
with us in the audience.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.780
Kim and Judy are enthusiastic
supporters of the Radcliffe

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.810
mission to bring leading
thinkers to Cambridge

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.540
for the purpose of tackling
important questions,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.520
whatever the field.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.890
We have two more Davis
Lectures to look forward

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.960
to this academic year.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.450
Brian Greene, a physicist
and mathematician

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.130
at Columbia University
will speak on Thursday,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.250
February 9th at 4:15.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.460
And Dava Sobel, a highly
regarded science writer,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.110
will give a talk on Thursday,
April 13th at 4:15 as well.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.550
Today's lecture is called
Organized Complexity, the Novel

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.130
and the City.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.520
Garth certainly knows something
about organization, complexity,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.660
and novels.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.500
City on Fire is more
than 900 pages long,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.850
and I did bring my copy here,
in case you haven't seen it.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.930
So you don't have to
just take me at my word.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.570
And it is not just
about any city.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.950
It is about a specific city
at a specific moment in time--

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.637
New York City in the
tumultuous decade of the 1970s.

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:28.970
Now, in addition to being the
dean here at the Radcliffe

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.720
Institute, I am also a
20th century US historian

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.520
in the Harvard
history department.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.310
So I'm going to put
on my historian's hat

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.640
and introduce you to
New York in the 1970s

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.980
from an historian's
perspective, to help set

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.410
the scene for Garth's lecture.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.630
First, let's back up a bit.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.570
The decades following World
War II witnessed the most

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.570
sustained economic
growth in US history.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.640
Wealth grew.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.340
Inequality shrunk.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.210
Coming out of the New Deal of
the 1930s and 1940s, labor,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.160
business, and
government officials

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.070
all shared the assumption
that government

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.940
and the private sector both
should play important roles

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.850
in creating broad-based
economic prosperity

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.750
for the benefit of individuals,
corporations, and government.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.590
Well-paid workers and secure
union and corporate jobs--

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.500
it was argued-- would
protect the purchasing power

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.610
of their fellow citizens through
their own mass consumption.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.000
Moreover, leaders all
presumed that economic growth

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.080
and post-war affluence
would go on forever.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.450
New York City shared
that confidence.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.330
It was home to public
hospitals, to zoos,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.610
to well-stocked
public libraries,

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.140
an affordable public transit
system, and a tuition-free City

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.490
University.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.230
Its public sector even
included some social safety net

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.570
for people who were down
and out on their luck,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.210
and it enjoyed adequately
resourced police

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.950
and fire departments.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.050
But just below the surface, New
York did have serious problems,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.720
and access to all
of those amenities

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.170
varied along lines
of race and class.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.320
Only for white middle class
and some working class

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.600
New Yorkers was the post-war
era a time of ease and optimism.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.480
In the late 1950s,
industrial production

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.300
scaled back nationwide,
particularly

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.360
in eastern urban
centers like New York.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.470
The garment industry started
to abandon Manhattan.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.360
Electronic factories,
food production plants,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.240
and other small and
mid-sized employers

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.230
in the city's very diversified
economy began to shut down,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.380
eliminating good
working class jobs.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.020
Activity along New
York's busy ports

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.230
declined, and with it,
employment opportunities

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.710
for the thousands who made
their living on the docks.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.660
To make matters
worse, the closure

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.690
of the Brooklyn Navy
Yard and other New York

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.990
military installations
cost the metropolitan area

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.660
tens of thousands of jobs.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.820
By 1969, full scale
recession had set in.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.770
Meanwhile, many New
York corporations

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.670
began to join in
the nationwide trend

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.900
of relocating to the suburbs.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.030
Companies like Pepsi and
Shell Oil, to name just two,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.740
just moved their corporate
headquarters out of the city.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.890
And as companies left, they took
their tax dollars-- as well as

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.890
their middle class
workforces, whose tax

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.790
contributions were then
lost to the city's coffers.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.250
New York responded
to its shrinking tax

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.990
base by turning to
finance to pay the bills.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.090
The city sold bonds and
borrowed from private banks

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.670
to pay for basic services.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.140
Then as the 1970s progressed,
interest rates spiked.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.010
In 1975, bankers warned
the United States Treasury

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.350
and members of
Congress that New York

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.530
was about to be shut
out of credit markets.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.990
New York City's mayor and
the governor of New York

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.200
traveled to Washington
DC to request federal aid

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.600
for New York City.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.150
Without it, basic services
would have to be suspended.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.980
The Ford administration's
refusal to extend aid

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.100
was immortalized in a famous
newspaper headline that read,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.820
"Ford to city, drop dead."

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.420
New York City plummeted
into a fiscal crisis.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.950
It cut 63,000 municipal
employees from its payroll,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.200
reduced the number of teachers
by 25%, hiked fares and fees,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.610
suspended building projects,
reduced garbage collection,

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.500
and shuttered police
and fire stations.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.490
The cuts brought two
priorities into direct conflict

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.470
with each other-- namely,
fiscal responsibility

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.480
and social responsibility.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.360
Decades earlier, labor,
business, and government

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.330
officials had all
assumed that these two

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.860
types of responsibility
could go hand in hand,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.480
but in the crisis
of the 1970s, it

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.510
seemed like New York City was
forced to choose between them.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.280
The choice would turn out to be
a burning question, literally.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.670
Arson raged through parts of
the city, like the South Bronx.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.030
Some commentators accused
public housing residents

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.700
of setting the fires
themselves, but the evidence

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.190
points strongly to
private real estate

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.150
interests trying to cash
in on insurance payouts.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.900
Hints of such schemes
appear in City on Fire.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.270
And then when it seemed
like things could not

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.650
get much worse, lightning struck
a Con Edison power substation

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.110
on the Hudson River.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.330
The whole city blacked
out, just at the time when

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.500
police and fire departments
were being slashed,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.630
which dramatically hindered
an effective city response.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.210
This is the New York City
we confront in City on Fire.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.520
For centuries, the
tools of the novelist

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.240
have helped us better
understand cities.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.260
Charles Dickens
brought to life London

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.360
in the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.730
Victor Hugo painted
vivid portraits

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.740
of 18th century Paris.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.040
Richard Wright revealed
a 1930s Chicago

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.440
as few readers had seen it.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.170
Salman Rushdie
immortalized Bombay

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.660
in the first decades
of Indian independence.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.600
Doubtless you have
your own favorites.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.750
Garth Risk Hallberg's novel City
of Fire joins this tradition,

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.340
and we are fortunate to
have him with us here today

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.659
to talk about it.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.242
Now, please join me in
welcoming Garth Hallberg.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.250
- Hi, I'd like to thank
Radcliffe for having me,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.790
and I'd like to think Liz
for that warm introduction.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.411
I can say I haven't
done a lot of these,

00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:59.160
but I've done enough
to tell you that it's

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.850
rare to actually learn something
when you're being introduced.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.322
So that's a great
pleasure for me.

00:09:08.322 --> 00:09:12.340
I'd like to offer a
preemptive apology for what's

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.260
about to follow.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.290
As a writer, you start out
kind of aggrieved at the fact

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.357
that nobody cares
what you think.

00:09:19.357 --> 00:09:20.940
But after a while,
you get almost used

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.040
to it-- almost attached to it.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.900
There's a certain freedom in
being ignored and marginalized.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.080
At any rate, this whole genre
of public talk is new for me

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.170
and just conceptually
kind of bizarre.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.910
Last month, Bruno Latour, the
eminent philosopher of science

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.260
was here, and I wonder what
illumination I can possibly

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.470
offer about cities, or
culture, or life on earth

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.700
that can stack up
against Bruno Latour.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.980
And yet, I entered this
date in my calendar

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.370
back in January, because the
central theme at Radcliffe

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.890
this year is one
close to my heart,

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.470
and one very close to the heart
of the novel City on Fire.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.790
As the date has
approached, I've been

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.880
beset by terrors
and night sweats,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.720
wondering where to even begin.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.420
But this last week
has been-- what's

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.100
the word I'm looking
for-- clarifying.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.290
It's been clarifying.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.790
It's caused me to
completely trash

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.010
the bit about Dickens
and Virginia Woolf

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.700
and the bit about Goedel's
incompleteness theorem,

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.800
but it has been clarifying.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.320
Where I want to
begin, in fact, is

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.530
with that horrible red
and blue map of America

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.500
I keep seeing
everywhere-- or would keep

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.050
seeing if I could bear to look.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.620
Now, anyone with a passing
acquaintance with demography

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.590
knows that this map is
profoundly misleading.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.050
It gets treated as evidence of
a lopsided division between what

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.400
I believe Dr. Ben Carson called
the coastal elites on the one

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.110
hand and quote "we the
people" on the other.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.500
Don't grasp the distinction
or don't accept it?

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.180
Just look at the map.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.920
Coastal elites, tiny,
tiny, tiny, tiny.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.330
We the people, vast, vast.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.850
And just semantically,
who would dare

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.130
to argue with we the people?

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.930
Who doesn't feel like
giving the elites

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.530
that last shove into the sea?

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:33.430
But with all due respect to
the map and to Dr. Carson,

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.100
the truth is that a
coalition of working class

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.650
swing voters, business
minded burghers,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.740
traditional cultural
conservatives,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.730
rock ribbed retirees, and--
yes-- some misogynists,

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.100
and xenophobes, and
ethnonationalists

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:53.410
doesn't in 2016 add up to
a silent majority-- or even

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.690
a silent plurality.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.690
By an admittedly thin
but substantial margin,

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.060
it's still a vocal minority.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.770
As right-leaning
coalitions have been

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.860
in every presidential
election since 1988,

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.190
with the exception of
2004, and surprisingly

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.340
in most congressional
elections too.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.830
Given the one-person
one-vote principle,

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.560
it'd be far more accurate for
the infographic to feature

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.290
an auditorium of 100
people-- 47 of them

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.200
in red t-shirts and
48 of them in blue.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.030
Now, 47 out of 100 is
still a lot of t-shirts.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.030
And the Madisonian system
makes generous allowances

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.550
for the rights of the minority.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.340
One wonders if those allowances
will be respected by those now

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.350
coming into power.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.680
But talk of the
largest voting bloc

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.560
of Americans as a tiny
elite, opposed to we

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.040
the people or-- god
help us-- the heartland,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.750
is rank propaganda.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.960
And treating it as such
would be a healthy first step

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.800
in the national pogrom avoidance
program I think all parties can

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.860
agree is worth pursuing.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.680
In the contest for which end
of the political spectrum

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.040
is more in touch with
hard work or suffering,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.690
or more out of touch
with conditions

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.560
on the ground, or cozier
with power, or more American,

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.400
there can be no winners.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.980
In a more particular
sense, though,

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.600
and the one in which I think
the infographic was originally

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:25.480
conceived, the red-blue map
remains intensely revealing.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.970
And that is that the
support for a center

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.090
left liberalism,
keen to blunt but not

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.630
transform the rough
edges of capitalism--

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.030
however large that support
is in democratic terms--

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.160
remains concentrated in
major metropolitan areas.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.010
I imagine nowhere more
concentrated than right here

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.200
in Cambridge, Mass.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.900
Probably nowhere more
concentrated than in this room

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.450
at this moment.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.840
And conversely, support for
a center right or right wing

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.606
agenda has its base outside
those concentrations.

00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:01.480
It is likely that the
center exists somewhere

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.090
in the suburbs, and
that the red gets deeper

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.020
the sparser the population is.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.990
Now, ever since 2000, when
the red-blue map first reared

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.150
its head.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.590
There's been a lot of
theorizing about the origins

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.380
of this geographic split.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.020
There's the theory
of self-segregation--

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.360
that on both sides
of a partisan divide,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.700
people are choosing
increasingly to cluster

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.650
with the like minded.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.080
And there's obviously
some truth to that.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.120
But it doesn't strike
me as a new development.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.920
It's worth noting, also, that
the self-segregation theory

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.100
flatters the assumptions,
both of urban liberals who

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.060
like to think of small towns
as havens for racists gun nuts,

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.940
and of small town dwellers
who think of urban liberals

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.030
as smug self-satisfied
hypocrites.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.660
So I'm not sure how far
self-segregation gets us

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.540
as a practical analysis.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.270
There's also the theory,
convenient for the right

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.780
and gaining steam on the left,
that the uneven distribution

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.010
of voters somehow maps neatly
onto the uneven distribution

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.120
of income, that the latte
liberals have prospered

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.390
at the expense of
factory workers.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.090
Certainly, the cultural
shibboleths of the tech set

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.550
and the hipsterati,
the conflation

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.000
of progressivism and
consumerism have done nothing

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.360
to undercut this idea.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.230
And there is a
generational sense

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.470
of classes being
formed and dissolved--

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.360
with maybe the
beard as a floating

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.640
signifier of some kind.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.580
But Portlandia remains
a vanishingly small

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.120
political force, and
to me the conflation

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.440
of the Obama voter and the
one percenter is a canard.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.810
Suburbs in small
towns and rural areas

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.140
have their elites, too,
whose fortunes rise and fall

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.920
with elites everywhere.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.890
And I can tell you
from experience,

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.200
a lot of those people
vote Republican,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.650
as do plenty of captains
of industry and finance.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:05.000
More interesting to me and
more plausible is the idea

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.070
that perhaps there
is a different kind

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:12.920
of causal nexus, that living
in cities somehow gives rise

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.500
to certain values
and assumptions,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.200
rather than resulting from them.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.970
As would, in this
analysis, living

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:22.900
in small town or rural America.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.790
The idea is that urban
and non-urban America

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.280
are not even really
speaking the same language,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.080
because they're
describing what feels

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.960
like two different worlds.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.830
Now, it doesn't logically or
morally follow from the fact

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.500
that there are two ways of
seeing a problem that both

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.900
must be equally valid.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.170
But I don't really want to use
this time to pass judgment over

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.260
whether someone's right
and someone's wrong.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.620
Rather, having been lucky enough
to spend half my life in one

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.590
part of the map and
half in another,

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.290
and to have now spent 10
years of my life thinking

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.430
about cities, I thought this
would be an interesting time

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.950
to try to excavate
some of the principles

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.619
and values that
living in a city--

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:09.710
or writing a 900 page
novel about one--

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.430
foreground in the
human experience, how

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.630
those principles and values are
rooted in urban experience--

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.890
especially the experience of
my particular city, New York--

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:27.050
and also in the experience of
reading and writing novels,

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.360
because what I
found as I wrote was

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:35.830
a kind of peculiar resonance
between the novel and the city.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.570
That resonance, that for
me has been the only way

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:43.430
to know I'm in the
ballpark of a human truth,

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.430
my hunch as a New Yorker is
that some of these principles

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.540
and values will be at first
blush familiar and reassuring

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.570
to an audience of Bostonians.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.060
The real value in
articulating them

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.030
is in bringing us down into
the complex soil where they're

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.060
rooted, because understood
in their deepest

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.910
sense, these
principles and values

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:09.680
are not only rich and
satisfying but disconcerting and

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.010
uncomfortable to live
with and challenging--

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.800
as is any human truth.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.830
In fact, it's going
to be my contention

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.210
that humanism in the age of
neoliberal disarticulation

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.600
has become complacent
precisely in its eagerness

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.350
to ignore the more challenging
underpinnings of its own value

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:35.030
system, and that attempting to
look at them more honestly--

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.190
and indeed to
confront them-- would

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:42.050
go a long way toward explaining
the massive blind spots that

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.790
have evidently come to
afflict city dwellers,

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:50.210
and toward getting us out of
the deep democratic shit I'm

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.880
pretty sure we're now in.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.540
Maybe that's what
novels are for.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.360
Now, one of those principles--
I'm going to argue--

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.920
involves the primacy of the
concrete, the situational,

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:10.950
the contextual, the local over
the big giant abstraction.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.180
Let me try to ground my
later remarks by talking

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.260
to you, first specifically,
about where I'm coming from,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.170
about cities, and
non-cities, and how

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.680
I came to write City on Fire.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.560
I grew up in eastern
North Carolina

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.040
in a town called Greenville,
which at the time

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.720
was so insignificant that no
one really knew where it was.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.810
Later after I'd left, I'd
mention the town to people

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.990
and they'd go, oh,
right, Greenville.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.300
And 9 times out of 10,
they'd be confusing it

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.255
with its larger and more
glamorous cousins Greensboro

00:19:47.255 --> 00:19:50.440
in NC and Greenville, SC.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.980
Oh, right, they'd say.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.790
Greenville, I think I went
to a cousin's wedding there.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:00.110
I'd say right down
the road from Rawling?

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:04.070
Yes, they'd say, and I'd
say, nope, that's Greensboro.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.010
Or I'd say big view
of the mountains?

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.300
And they'd say, yeah.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.200
And I'd say that's
Greenville, South Carolina.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.870
But Greenville, North Carolina--
at least the Greenville

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:19.460
of my childhood-- was 18,000
people, some strip malls,

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.060
a land-grant college,
and a fading downtown.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.160
Surrounded by miles
and miles of fields,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:32.990
a little pin stuck into the
map of down East, tobacco road.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.840
For reasons I still
don't understand,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.870
I didn't feel entirely
at home there.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.440
I can remember even at 5 or 6
feeling like a fish flopping

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.630
around on a dock,
unaware that there

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.237
was such a thing as an ocean.

00:20:47.237 --> 00:20:49.070
But a lot of it felt
to me to have something

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.030
to do with the town's
conservatism, which I don't

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.180
mean in a political sense.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.260
I mean something closer
to the town's sense

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.270
of what makes a
character and how

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.550
to keep a community from
being swallowed back

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:05.180
into the wilderness
that surrounds it.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.510
In Greenville in the early
part of the Reagan Revolution,

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.960
there was still an old-fashioned
sense that if you were a boy,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.710
you grew up to follow whichever
of the five acceptable paths

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:19.210
the men in your family had laid.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.630
And if you are a girl, you
had your own prescribed paths.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.020
And how you measured your
value, was by how closely

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.940
you hewed to the channel.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.207
That's if you were white.

00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:34.040
If you were black, there
was a different set

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.470
of channels to follow.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.780
And any tensions
that may have arisen

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.010
along the various frontiers
of race, and sex, and class,

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.010
and personality were
not to be spoken of

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.080
or acknowledged, but suppressed.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:53.570
The very existence of a
frontier was suppressed.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:58.000
Well, that wasn't
going to work for me.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.820
Like many a passionate reader,
I found my first escape

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.719
in reading.

00:22:03.719 --> 00:22:05.260
Actually, I'm not
sure if the reading

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.890
was an escape from
the alienation

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.220
or a cause of
further alienation.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.770
Probably, it was both.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:17.420
But, oh, it was amazing to me at
7 or 8, the cover of every book

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.635
was like a door.

00:22:18.635 --> 00:22:22.910
You opened it and walked
right across the threshold.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:27.340
And though I loved and
love all manner of fiction,

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.792
the books I loved most then
were those that built a world.

00:22:31.792 --> 00:22:33.250
I remember the
three or four months

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:38.390
I spent inside CS Lewis'
Narnia, which of course enacts,

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.450
in its central image of
the wardrobe, that very act

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.420
of opening a door
and walking through.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.230
I remember devouring
the hobbit in the course

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.220
of a single 15-hour car
ride, lying unbelted

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.230
in the way back of
the station wagon--

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.340
because those were
the days, right--

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.740
and emerging at a rest
stop, as from dreams,

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:05.870
unsure which world I was in--
the deep South or Middle Earth.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.400
But there was
another fantasy world

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.920
I encountered in those
early years-- no less

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.100
fantastical or vividly colored.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.120
I found it in EB
White's Stuart Little,

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.660
and again in Harriet the
Spy, and in Judy Blume,

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.450
and in From the Mixed-up Files
of Mrs. Basil E Frankweiler.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.580
It was called New York City,
and like any fantasy world,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.480
it was filled with
eccentric characters

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.750
crossing each other's paths.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.250
It held a myriad of adventures,
of quests, the fabled 8 million

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:36.750
stories.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:44.050
But New York also had a
few unusual properties.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.480
First, unlike Middle
Earth or Narnia,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.720
you could look it up
in the trucker's atlas.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.500
You could-- at least
in theory-- go there.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.410
Second, unlike Middle
Earth or Narnia,

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:01.400
it wasn't the property
of any one writer.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.190
Anyone-- perhaps including even
me-- could begin a story there,

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:10.070
without subtracting from
or reducing the whole.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:15.250
It didn't belong to anyone
and so belonged to everyone.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.480
A final curious thing
about New York I noticed.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.100
You opened to the
copyright pages of books,

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.480
and they all come from New York.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.040
John Updike has that great line
about reading The New Yorker

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.190
as a kid.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.750
He talks about a
great river of print

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:37.509
flowing from 42nd Street to
Shillington, Pennsylvania.

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:39.050
And that's something
like what I felt

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.350
when I realized that that's
where the books come from.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.140
I think I imagined skyscrapers
made out of paperbacks

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.610
stacked on their sides.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.365
And I thought, that must
be the best place ever.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.100
Later on, I became a
disaffected teenager,

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.970
in a way that seemed to me
then completely unprecedented

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.890
in the history of the world.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.330
Greensville had
gone from feeling

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.120
like a backwater to
feeling like a prison,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.550
and Stuart Little wasn't
quite a big enough channel

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.720
to run my feelings
through anymore.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.250
I found my refuge in my new
obsessions-- poetry and punk

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.170
rock.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.700
Both of them seemed to
present alternative ways

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.910
of being in the world.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.850
In my poetry reading,
I was promiscuous.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.720
In no other aspect of my
life as a teenager can

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.240
I say that but in
my poetry reading.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.740
I read Dante.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.890
I read Tennyson.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:40.370
I read Whitman,
Dickinson, Ashbury.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.700
I wrote poetry, very
badly, but in a way that

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.530
got me interested
in the avant-gardes

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:51.410
of the 1950s, '60s, and '70s,
which led back to New York.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.900
And thought some of the most
vital punk rock of that era

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.880
was coming out of the
post-hardcore scene

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.980
in Washington DC, there was also
this place at the roots of punk

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.910
that likewise
pointed to New York.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.800
That New York-- the New York
of Lou Reed, and Patti Smith,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.880
and Jim Karole,
and Ted Berrigan,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.800
and Joey Ramone-- wasn't
the gleaming postwar edifice

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.950
that EB White had painted,
but something equally

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.070
enchanted-- a place
that was entirely

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:27.650
edge, entirely frontier, a
place where all the tensions

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.190
were right on the surface.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:34.440
This meant, on one hand,
that it was dangerous.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.160
You could get stabbed at your
locker or hassled up town.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.050
You could overdose or cross
paths with a psycho killer

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.240
outside beneath
the marquee moon.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.770
And I think I was fascinated
even then by the fact

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:51.310
that this incredible outpouring
of creative expression

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:55.620
in poetry, in punk, in hip
hop, in painting, performance

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.950
art-- this thing that gave us
much of what was culturally

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.250
interesting in the world of
the 1990s and much of what's

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.530
culturally interesting
now-- came out

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:08.580
of a few blocks of downtown
Manhattan at this period,

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.950
as if a garden were to
come bursting through

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.340
with some broken
squares of sidewalk.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.320
How could fear and freedom,
creation and destruction

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.640
live so closely together?

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.970
On weekends and in the
summer starting at 16,

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.500
I began going up to DC, which I
could reach in 3 and 1/2 hours,

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.860
pushing 75 miles an hour
in my dad's old car,

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.950
to see punk shows and
crash on people's couches,

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.010
and effectively
run away from home.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.130
I'd made some friends there
through poetry and punk.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.930
But there was also
this girl I'd met

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:50.340
who lived four hours
further on by bus or by car

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.320
in New York City.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.860
And that's how it ended up in
the city for the first time

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.970
20 years ago last month.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.150
I was chasing a girl.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.220
Now it's rare to
dream of something

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.620
and then attain it in
real life without a tinge

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.770
of disappointment
at its actuality.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.080
But in this case,
New York seemed

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.750
much as I had dreamed it.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.270
Perhaps this was because
I hadn't romanticized away

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:19.880
the tensions, contradictions,
and mysteries of the city.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.350
I had romanticized them.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.770
And in the 90s, maybe even
more so than in the '70s,

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.490
they were everywhere you looked.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.450
It was an amazing point
in the life of the city.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:35.130
This was the early Middle
Giuliani era in New York,

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.130
and he was still refining
the methods of social control

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.070
and oppressive banality I think
we can all look forward to

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.920
in the near future.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.900
But beneath his
efforts to clean up

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.620
the city were traces
of the wilder, dirtier,

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.520
and more heterodox city
he was trying to erase.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.490
I remember stepping off the
bus in the Port Authority bus

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.290
terminal.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.150
The first thing you'd
see across 8th Avenue

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.460
were the glowing neon signs
of the peep shows-- Peepland

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.560
and Peeporama.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.140
And then way down
42nd Street, you'd

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.950
see the sign for the Lion
King-- these two things,

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.360
right next to each other.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:21.300
And the tension, the sense of
layering, was magic for me.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.180
I was captivated, too,
by the dense parfait

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.385
of class, and race, and
age, and sexual milieu.

00:29:28.385 --> 00:29:31.190
[? SEAM ?] If you were
17, and a would-be poet,

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.540
and willing to
say yes, you could

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.180
hit a reading at a private
high school uptown,

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.880
jump a turnstile, smoke some
pot with a future member

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.130
of The Strokes, go to
a bar in the Village,

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.740
and end up sleeping on the
roof of some artist's hovel

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:48.270
on Avenue C. You could go to
a rave in the Brooklyn Bridge,

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:51.630
or to gay karaoke, or
check out bondage gear,

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.270
or become a traveling jester
for an hour with the yuppie pub

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.480
crawl, or spend a memorable
Sunday morning being toured

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.570
around Harlem by a
smart and homeless

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:04.412
and possibly schizophrenic
woman named Deborah Little.

00:30:04.412 --> 00:30:06.953
You can even actually climb to
the top of the Brooklyn Bridge

00:30:06.953 --> 00:30:07.971
then.

00:30:07.971 --> 00:30:09.720
I'm not saying I did,
because I'm not sure

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.410
if this is being taped,
but one could climb

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.310
the top of the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.950
No one would stop you.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.980
And something changed
in my writing.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.320
For a week after
that first visit--

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.320
and unconnected from it,
I thought-- my poetry

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.500
deepened and became real.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.950
And then after a week in
which I wrote the only seven

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:38.370
real poems I'll probably ever
write, the gift just left me.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.500
I knew it had left me that.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.920
It wasn't coming back no matter
how many subsequent weekends I

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.730
spent in the city.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.950
I ended up not making it
to New York for college,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.130
on account of being
unable to afford it.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.320
I went to St. Louis
instead on a scholarship,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.710
and wrote four years'
worth of bad prose,

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:03.450
and met and chased the girl
who would become my wife.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.030
After we graduated, she
wanted to go to grad school,

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:10.105
and we thought, great, now
we'll move to New York.

00:31:10.105 --> 00:31:12.480
But it turned out, she couldn't
afford grad school there,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.675
either.

00:31:13.675 --> 00:31:16.050
She got a fellowship to go to
the University of Maryland,

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.000
just outside of Washington DC.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.530
And I remember thinking,
well, the city will wait.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.200
The girl probably will not.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.200
So we moved to DC.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.500
That was the summer of
2001, the first summer

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.620
of the rest of my life,
the beginning for me

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.930
of the adult world.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.860
And there came a day that fall,
maybe six weeks into my first

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:45.120
full time job, when it suddenly
seemed like maybe New York

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.900
wouldn't wait, like maybe New
York wouldn't be there the next

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:54.960
day, like maybe Washington
wouldn't, and life wouldn't.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.330
Like all the things
I loved and taken

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:01.620
for granted were in fact
radically contingent,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.966
hovering on the
verge of destruction.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.197
I'm going to skip over the bit
about how the novel came out

00:32:09.197 --> 00:32:11.030
of this experience,
maybe it'll will come up

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.690
in the discussion portion.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:17.150
But just suffice it to say that
mixed in with all the grief

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.550
and trauma I felt--
and many of us

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:24.260
here felt-- having watched in
real time as thousands of lives

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:30.190
were impossibly snuffed out,
was a different kind of grief,

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:34.910
as if the city itself
had been snuffed out.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:38.000
And a question
about what exactly

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.220
it would have meant for New
York this beacon to disappear.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:50.840
What about New York was unique,
and sacred, and unreplicatable?

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:55.070
Which was something like asking
what was it about this city

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.530
that I loved?

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.500
And at some point after
spending a lot of time up there,

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.160
bearing witness, and just
before I moved there for good,

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.530
I had this flash of
inspiration that everything I'd

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.830
been seeing, and feeling,
and wondering about in 2001,

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:14.270
2002, 2003, wanted
to express itself

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:20.990
through this enormous
story of 1975, 1976, 1977,

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.950
that other time, when the
city, as you heard from Liz

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:29.596
was broken, and vulnerable, and
open, and hovering on the edge.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.420
I worked through
the first draft,

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.577
trying to preserve in a
way the sense of confusion.

00:33:38.577 --> 00:33:40.160
The important thing
was not to propose

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.470
an answer of the
city's unique meaning

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:46.640
but to gesture
toward the question.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.910
Nonetheless, the book
started to teach me things,

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.530
as books will when
you're writing them--

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.640
or possibly the city
was teaching me,

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.830
or maybe it amounts
to the same thing.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.740
These are the
values or principles

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.220
I was trying to gesture
at earlier, the things we

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:07.130
urban dwellers can't easily
forget but also can't

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.889
seem to quite remember.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.480
And to talk about
a few of them, I'm

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.510
going to borrow some
vocabulary from a book that

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.090
became very important to
me right around the time

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.790
I started the second draft,
when I finally got around

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:21.989
to reading it.

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:24.389
That book is Jane
Jacobs' The Death

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:28.630
and Life of Great
American Cities.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.650
In no way is City on Fire
a programmatic engagement

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:34.170
with Jane Jacobs' ideas.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.030
In fact, I may be
misreading them

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.090
to suit my own purposes, which
is always a productive strategy

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:40.770
for a novelist.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.420
But I can say that
her book-- or possibly

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.080
my impressionistic
misreading of it--

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.610
gave me a way to
understand things

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.760
that, when I was imagining
the book into existence,

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.820
I felt I was
discovering on my own.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.110
So here they are.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:02.730
Principle one, it
must be concrete.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.360
This is an intuitive value for
the fiction writer, I think,

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.690
yet one that a long novel will
insist upon, each time you

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.530
start to forget it.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:16.110
Life takes place, not in the
abstract, but in the concrete.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:19.800
Not in rules, bus in practices.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.790
With students, I like to
use the word incarnate.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.400
Novelistic truth is
a function of what

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.650
is given flesh in the
text, through detail,

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:34.730
point of view voice, drama,
and above all context.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:39.060
And because a novel offers
room for multiple contexts,

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.480
it's a unique vehicle
for paradox and irony,

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.150
for holding conflicting
ideas in the mind.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:50.050
I like the example of Henry
James' Washington Square.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:53.980
The heroine's father, Dr.
Sloper, brings into the novel

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.710
a bunch of moral
precepts, which are

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.420
in the abstract unassailable.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.940
Yet confronted with the concrete
circumstances of his daughter's

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.190
position, he ends
up seeming to us,

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:10.000
the readers, profoundly wrong.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.650
It's also interesting
and connected

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.140
to concreteness to think
of modernists like Becket

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.560
or Gertrude Stein, who
in various projects

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.250
attempt to evacuate from the
novel much of its tropism

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.860
for what's concrete
and specific.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.230
But Beckett's work,
even Beckett's work,

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:29.790
gets its life from the pebble
in the pocket, the lone tree,

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:34.530
and above all from its
incredible solidity of voice.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:38.020
The primacy of the concrete over
the abstract has historically

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.690
been a little harder for urban
theorists to admit, in part,

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.660
because they carry a burden
that novelists don't.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.110
People don't come to novels
to have their problems solved.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.120
They go to planners.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.280
But Jane Jacobs'
work in reacting

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.420
to the excesses of abstraction
in her nemesis Robert Moses

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.070
and in architects Le
Corbusier, reminds us

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:07.570
that cities too are a form
of reasoning in concrete.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:12.540
They defeat in their specificity
and dependence on context

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.750
all top down efforts
to rationalize them.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.180
All you have to do to
see how specifics insists

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.130
on themselves, to do
it Jane Jacobs did

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.340
and what some novelists do, is
spend a week carefully watching

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:32.830
a city block, or a subway
platform, or an elevator.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.410
There may be various
rules and regulations,

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.720
but there will also
emerge from the context

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.470
of sorts of unspoken pacts,
compromises, arrangements,

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.750
workarounds.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.520
The same is true of
Nabokovian attempts

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.690
to treat your characters
like galley slaves.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.050
If they're real characters,
they will surprise you

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.850
in their specificity.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:55.600
The concrete always wins.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.760
Principle two, it
must be diverse.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.980
Diversity is often
treated nowadays

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.430
as a commodity, a
kind of managed good.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.860
But in fact, as
Jacobs shows, anytime

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.220
you gather specific and concrete
parts into the arrangement

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:18.160
we call a city, diversity
naturally assert itself.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.110
There's an odd
fact about plumbing

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.480
that a perfectly
smooth pipe will not

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.250
allow the water to flow down.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:27.170
You have to have
roughness of texture.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.950
And in engineering, a
bridge of sufficient length

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.680
that maintains identical
tension at all points

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.760
will break the first time
a car drives across it

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.400
or the wind blows the wrong way.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.620
And so in some strange way, it's
dangerous to treat diversity

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.130
as a decorative item
or a token of virtue.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:47.050
It's not a luxury product.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.540
It's a necessity.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:54.300
This is true of novels too and
of long novels in particular.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.740
It's possible to achieve
an effect of ruthless

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:01.750
unity in something as short
as, say, Meloy or Paula Fox's

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.652
desperate characters.

00:39:03.652 --> 00:39:05.110
But if you look
close, you'll start

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:09.920
to see the irregularities,
the diversities, the cracks.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:14.320
And in a long novel, even the
illusion of ruthless unity

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.216
is an impossibility.

00:39:16.216 --> 00:39:19.930
It took me a lot of trial
and error to figure this out.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:23.680
A 900 page novel that maintained
the illusion of ruthless unity

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.530
you get in Meloy would cause the
reader to blow her brains out.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.850
Even Beckett doesn't
maintain it in his trilogy.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.840
Variation-- I mean, I think, in
the third part of the trilogy,

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.650
the narrator is a worm
living in a flower pot

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.700
or something like that?

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.350
Variation and diversity is key.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.629
And I discovered as I
wrote and revised the novel

00:39:46.629 --> 00:39:48.670
that the more I could get
scenes, and characters,

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:51.160
and sentences to be
unlike each other,

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.670
the more the novel would
move and have resilience.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.840
Principle three,
and this is going

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.380
to sound like an about-face
from the previous point.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.350
It must connect.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:10.180
Somehow, for all the various
and discrete people, and images,

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:14.860
and scenes that make up a
living novel and a living city,

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:19.240
there has to be patterning, a
sense of unifying commonality

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.180
animating the whole.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.150
It's easiest to see this
in the field of literature.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:29.152
A novel of pure randomness,
something like Andy Warhol's

00:40:29.152 --> 00:40:32.680
A not a novel which has readers.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.260
And so in the
non-abstract framework

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.080
I'm arguing we should adopt,
not really a novel at all.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.080
Whereas in something like
Jonathan Franzen's The

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.690
Corrections, you have dozens
of patternings running

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:47.020
through the diverse material,
binding it together--

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.860
from family connections
among the characters,

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.700
to somewhat more
mechanical connections

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:57.070
among with subplots, to a
delicate leitmotif of hands.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.112
It is interesting that we
rebel as contemporary readers

00:41:00.112 --> 00:41:02.320
against the bit where the
pharmaceutical company that

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.180
makes Alfred's
medication turns out

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.210
to be connected somehow with
the demise of his train company

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.130
or whatever.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:11.500
To us the kinds of connections
that Dickens delighted

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.960
in making in his
novels of London,

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.020
the various past crossings
and coincidences,

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:22.510
feel artificial,
Victorian, unrealistic.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.780
Perhaps they don't emerge from
the specific and the concrete

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.930
but read as imposed
abstractions.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.510
But I wonder, to play
devil's advocate,

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:33.910
whether this speaks to
some alteration in how

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:36.670
we urban dwellers move
through our cities

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:40.120
and in what kinds of connections
we open ourselves to.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.700
I can literally
remember a night at 17,

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.580
when I started out
on Central Park West,

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.680
in the very nice apartment
of an investment banker,

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:54.040
and ended up on the roof
of an artist's squat,

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.040
on Avenue C. Come
to think of it,

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.290
I remember talking to a
guy on the next roof over.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.800
And he turned out to be
the friend of a friend

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.642
and also the son of the former
bishop of Washington DC.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:11.470
Finally, on the
principles and values

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:15.910
of the novel and the city, I'll
quote Wallace Stevens' poem

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.820
Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.972
"It must change."

00:42:22.972 --> 00:42:24.430
Actually, let's
just call this what

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.360
it is, a principle
of life itself--

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.230
change, change, change.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.260
I think when we talk about a
novel having a sense of life,

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:38.110
we're really talking about it
having a sense of modulation,

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:44.250
of dynamism, of change, or we
wouldn't read pass page one.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:46.500
Certainly, any
time I found myself

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.650
getting stuck in this novel,
whether between sentences

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:53.670
or between chapters, I learned
to tell myself accept it.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.480
Something has to change.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.750
Cities too are, as a
character in the book

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:02.440
puts it, sites of
concentrated change.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.690
And of course we know this.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.980
And still we complain about
the glassy condo towers,

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.600
the disappearance of the mom
and pop shop, the growing

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.280
crappiness of public transit.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.070
Or like Edith
Wharton's characters

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:18.210
in The Age of Innocence,
sitting around in 1850,

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:21.960
talking about how
New York is so over.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.180
We retreat, like my
characters, into fantasies

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.480
of stopping time at
some ideal point,

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.020
rather than opposing the
changes we don't like

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.230
with our own vision of change.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:37.920
I suppose change is the hardest
of these principles to accept,

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.920
because it isn't
a one shot deal.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.940
You have to accept
it anew every day.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.520
You have to keep changing.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.550
And this is-- not
incidentally-- what

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:51.190
I think people get profoundly
wrong about Jane Jacobs,

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:54.150
and what we tend to get
profoundly wrong about cities,

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:59.050
and urban experience, and maybe
literature, and politics, too.

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.090
I came to Jane
Jacobs with the sense

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.500
of a desirable what
of urban planning,

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.550
a static target-- you know,
mixed use development,

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:12.520
human size streetscape, the
magic elixir of diversity,

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:16.690
all the stuff that's become
canonical, even if-- as I've

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.190
been trying to point
out-- we recoil

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.432
from some of its challenges.

00:44:20.432 --> 00:44:22.390
But The Death and Life
of Great American Cities

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.320
is a funny book in that
it's built inductively

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.130
rather than deductively.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.340
The big idea tying the
whole thing together

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.154
only comes at the end.

00:44:31.154 --> 00:44:33.070
So if you don't read to
the very last chapter,

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.100
you never quite grasp the
why and the how of what

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:38.730
Jacobs is arguing,
and you never quite

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:42.630
get that she's not proposing
a vision of stasis,

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:48.020
but a beautiful and terrifying
vision of constant change.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.440
Her final chapter is called
The Kind of Problem a City Is,

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.930
and it underpins all her
talk about diversity,

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.570
and specificity, and connection.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:00.690
And it's where I'd like
to leave you today,

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:04.045
as we turn to the discussion
part of this program.

00:45:04.045 --> 00:45:06.820
In it, Jacobs
draws a distinction

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:11.400
between two kinds of systems--
disorganized complexity

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.250
and organized complexity.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.440
The names can be a
little bit misleading.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.440
Disorganized
complexity, basically,

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.050
means a system whose
variables can be treated

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.820
in isolation from each other.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:28.050
Statistical methods,
computers, data

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:31.420
are excellent for
analyzing such systems.

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.260
Think of a life insurance
company for example.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.500
The life of each
subscriber is a variable,

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.110
but barring some
national catastrophe,

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.000
the life expectancy of a
subscriber in California

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.550
will have very
little interaction

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.570
with a life expectancy of
subscriber in Nebraska.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:50.790
And so they can be treated
separately in isolation.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.900
And various actuarial
principles and laws

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.530
of averages that I
frankly don't understand

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.190
will lead to
predictable behavior

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:00.630
for the system as a whole.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:04.570
The human body, suggests
Jacobs, is an example

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.740
of organized complexity--
dense with variables,

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.130
each of them interacting
in complex and dynamic ways

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:17.550
with the others-- recursions,
feedback loops, paradoxes.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.320
This is why it's
impossible to speak

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.320
of a risk-free
medical intervention.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.880
You put a cast on a broken
leg, which is great,

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.980
but a whole range of
variables from mental health

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:30.960
to cardiac health is affected
by limiting the range of motion.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.170
It's a delicate dance of
nodes and connections.

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:38.480
And to change one piece
is to change the whole.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.210
It is Jane Jacobs' great insight
that no matter how useful

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.780
the drive toward more and
greater data has proven,

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:50.260
a city is the latter kind of
problem, a problem of organized

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:54.780
complexity, and that trying
to isolate and then engineer

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:59.070
its various facets in a
static and abstract way

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.220
will only take you so far.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:06.730
It is the methods of the life
sciences, biology, of medicine,

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:10.210
rather than the laws of physics,
that are applicable here,

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:13.230
because again every
facet is knit together

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:16.070
in an organic whole.

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:19.860
This happens to be an almost
perfect description of the kind

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.960
of problem a novel is.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.110
And this homology is perhaps
the single biggest reason

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.610
that from Dickens, and Eliot,
and Balzac, and Tolstoy,

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:31.940
to Mrs. Dalloway, and
Herzog, and Underworld,

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.650
and the Emperor's
Children, the novel

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:38.300
has been such a perfect
tool for analyzing a city

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.280
and getting at its meaning.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.030
For if a novel is to
have any life at all,

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:48.570
it will ultimately reveal to
its inhabitants the creativity

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:52.230
and comfort, security and
freedom, order and vitality,

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:55.860
innovation and tradition,
as well as all of the values

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.420
we would like to think
we approve and espouse--

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.760
the local, the diverse, the
connected, the changing,

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.860
for example-- are not
discrete variables that we

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.980
can manipulate independently.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.940
They are linked together
in a complex network,

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.960
and attempting to manage
any of them in a vacuum

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.560
will have costs
for all the others

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.150
and for the system as a whole.

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.780
You impose a more
rigid narrative.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.960
You cost your people
their freedom.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.360
You liberate your
people completely,

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.710
and the story
holding them together

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:34.500
decays into incoherence.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:38.030
You attend overmuch
to aesthetic beauty,

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:40.980
and you lose the sense of life.

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.940
You hew too closely to
life as it has always been,

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:48.510
and you lose all
possibility of beauty,

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:51.420
all possibility of change.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:56.070
And so, ultimately, the
idea of a closed society--

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:58.440
whether the a
society of tradition

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:03.710
or the society of virtue--
is as oxymoronic as the idea

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:08.020
of a perfect novel
or a perfect life.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.150
There can be no
possibility without risk,

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:14.070
no creation without
destruction, and no

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:19.020
getting through the whole thing
without setbacks, reversals,

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:22.050
hope, and pain.

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:24.480
You attempt to pick
and choose among these,

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.500
to drive toward unity,
perfection, abstraction,

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:32.620
fixity, is a very
human response,

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.520
whether it's coming from
the left or from the right,

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.150
from red America or
from blue America.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.900
But though talking
heads said that heaven

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.730
is a place where
nothing ever happens,

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.270
this utopia doesn't sound like
somewhere anyone would actually

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:50.110
want to live.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:53.090
But I suppose we should all
be thinking our lucky stars

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.460
that we're not there
yet, not even close.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.113
Thank you.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.020
- Let me just tell you a
little bit about Claire.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.520
She is the author of
several works of fiction.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.210
I assume many in the audience
have read them, most recently,

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:19.520
The Woman Upstairs, which
was published in 2013.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.800
Two of her novels, The Hunters
and When the World Was Steady

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.420
were finalists for the
PEN/Faulkner prize for fiction.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.650
Claire has been a longtime
friend of Radcliffe,

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:29.630
as I mentioned before.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:32.580
She was a fellow
from 2004 to 2005.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.630
And she's stayed involved
with the Institute, which

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:37.130
we're very pleased about.

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.380
While she was here, she worked
on a novel called The Emperor's

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:45.270
Children, also set in New York
during another tumultuous time,

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:47.970
the period surrounding the
attacks on the World Trade

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:50.730
Center towers in 2001.

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:52.460
And The Emperor's
Children was named

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:57.500
one of the top 10 best books
of 2006 by The New York Times.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.360
Now, I'm going to
move over here.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.875
I did bring-- this
is the paperback,

00:51:01.875 --> 00:51:05.040
so we don't give quite--
it's not quite fair.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.090
Yours was pretty big,
when it was in hardback.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:09.340
- A lot of smaller.

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.190
A lot smaller.

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.250
- But I'd like to
just start, Claire.

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:15.690
We've heard from
Garth, and I should

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.320
say that when Garth
accepted our invitation,

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.920
we were very excited.

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.940
And he was very open to the
idea of having a conversation,

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.210
not just giving a lecture.

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:27.380
And it immediately
came to me that Claire

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.960
was the perfect person to be in
conversation, because she too

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.270
had written a book
about New York

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:35.420
at a very particular
moment in time.

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.670
So I'd like to start by
asking you, Claire, to give us

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.560
a little sense of
your own story, of how

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.380
you came to Emperor's
Children, why New York.

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.560
You too are not a
New Yorker by birth.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.580
You, as I understand it,
you're part Canadian.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.800
Your mother's Canadian.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.730
Your father was French Algerian?

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:56.580
- He's French.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.380
- French.

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.960
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.500
- Why this book?

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.610
And why this time?

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.460
- Well, I mean,
it's interesting.

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.080
Maybe Garth in a
minute will tell us

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:15.420
a little more about how City
on Fire came out of 9/11.

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:18.000
- Because you have that
in your book as well.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.080
- Well, it happens.

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.380
You know, it just
happens at the end.

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:26.130
But I had started a
novel set in New York,

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:29.100
and then 9/11 happened.

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:34.887
And then I had to throw away
what I had, and think maybe

00:52:34.887 --> 00:52:36.470
I would write something
else, or maybe

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:38.420
I would-- maybe we
would never write again.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:42.515
Maybe it was a time for
poetry, and prose was finished.

00:52:42.515 --> 00:52:45.240
- Hopefully not irony, right?

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:52.090
- And then when I
began with a sense

00:52:52.090 --> 00:53:03.020
that The Emperor's Children is
a sort of August 1914 novel.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.360
It's about the time
before coming to an end,

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:11.110
and I remember one of the
reviewers saying in irritation

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.170
you know for almost
all of the book it just

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:14.838
seems like any ordinary year.

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.180
But of course, if you
remember back to 2001

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.100
until September 11,
it really just did

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.250
seem like any ordinary year,
which was sort of the point.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.980
I had wanted to write a novel
set in the city about people

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:37.840
in the city.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.050
And that was in
part, because it's

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:45.080
true-- I was not
born in New York.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.440
My father worked in New York.

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.110
My parents lived in Connecticut.

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:50.089
I went to college
in New Haven, and I

00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:52.130
went then went off to
graduate school in England,

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.671
and all my friends
moved to New York.

00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:56.822
And I kept thinking there's
my life, waiting for me.

00:53:56.822 --> 00:53:57.530
There is my life.

00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:58.405
It'll still be there.

00:53:58.405 --> 00:54:00.062
My life is waiting.

00:54:00.062 --> 00:54:01.520
But somehow I never
got there, so I

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.811
thought well, I'd better just
make up a story about it.

00:54:03.811 --> 00:54:06.290
- I'd like to follow up on--
I was going to ask you what

00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:09.340
Claire alluded to, which is
that many critics have said that

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:14.690
even though your book is set
in the 1970s and the event that

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:19.880
disrupts the world that you've
created is the blackout,

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:25.340
that in many ways that was kind
of a proxy for 9/11 in many

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:25.840
ways.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.304
And so could you talk a
little bit about that?

00:54:28.304 --> 00:54:29.720
- Well, do you
remember that there

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:34.670
was that whole thing
in 2002 and 2003,

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:36.689
almost comical, of
like people wringing

00:54:36.689 --> 00:54:38.480
their hands in the
newspaper, and like, oh,

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.230
when will the fiction writers
weigh in on September 11, which

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:44.630
was kind of odd,
because you were like,

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:46.085
do you people know how long?

00:54:46.085 --> 00:54:49.860
- Right, I mean, when did
the Vietnam stories come?

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:58.810
- And so I remember when your
book came out, which was 2006,

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:05.630
and like really appreciating
how deftly it handled that,

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:10.940
because it does have such
a large impact on even

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.810
just the plot, in a way.

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:15.740
And I stole something
from you, so thank you.

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.524
Yeah, I mean, just
the way that you

00:55:17.524 --> 00:55:19.940
throw a catastrophe in the
middle of an urban environment,

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:23.600
and the characters can't
get to each other, which

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.296
can be really awkward
depending on where they are

00:55:26.296 --> 00:55:27.670
and where they're
supposed to be.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:36.390
But what I specifically
admired was exactly that,

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:40.900
it did not feel like a
novel about September 11.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:46.220
And the only successful
things that I've

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:50.170
read that really went right
at it are, I think arguably,

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:52.935
Deborah Eisenberg's story,
Twilight of the Superheroes

00:55:52.935 --> 00:55:56.740
and more arguably
DeLillo's Falling Man.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.690
And I would argue for.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:03.530
But I really wanted
to resist that,

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:08.050
and yet I was changed so
much as a person by that.

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.400
I know, partly by
virtue of it really

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.720
being-- I mean it would've
been like turning 22 in August

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:21.630
of 1914, and leaving college,
like a kind of Hans Castorp

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:23.390
thing, like, here's
the world, and it just

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:26.300
is completely not what
you were expecting.

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.840
That I couldn't not
get it into the novel,

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.190
and so somehow I
was wanting to write

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:34.690
about a city at a time of
crisis, but not this crisis.

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:36.572
And something came to me.

00:56:36.572 --> 00:56:37.530
- OK, that makes sense.

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.550
So let's talk a little bit
more about New York, which

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:44.030
figures into both of
your books, and you

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:48.680
were suggesting, even in
some ways taught you--

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.050
as you talked about
Jane Jacobs-- about how

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:54.320
to write a novel in
terms of the qualities.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.130
Is New York just a setting?

00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:59.690
Is it a character?

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:01.340
Is it one thing?

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:05.540
Is it a very fragmented
sort of place

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.760
that people experience
very differently?

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.980
Tell us about how
what New York meant

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:13.770
to you in writing these novels?

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:16.479
- Well, I was just
curious, because I

00:57:16.479 --> 00:57:18.020
had assumed that
you had lived in New

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.480
York for some period of
time because the novel is

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.940
very persuasive in that way.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.940
- People still say I'll
send it to you in New York.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.440
And I say, no, I
don't live there.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:33.170
- So someone who didn't live
there, how do you see it?

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:39.730
- Well, as I said, I
feel I didn't live there,

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:43.030
but I lived there, if
you know what I mean.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:48.890
My father worked at 50th and
Third Avenue for 15 years.

00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:53.110
I think there were so many
things about your novel and so

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:55.890
many questions I'd love to
ask you in terms of the city

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:59.590
and you imagining the city in
the 1970s, which of course you

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:02.530
are too young to
have experienced

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.490
in any conscious way.

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:10.660
But I have memories of-- I
was at boarding school here

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.610
between 1980 and 1983.

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:16.540
And going to stay with
friends in New York,

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:19.300
and it was the time when you
went to stay with friends,

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.340
and their parents
were just away.

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:25.340
You were 14 years old, staying,
their parents were just away.

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:29.470
Yeah, that doesn't happen
now, I think, in the same way.

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:33.910
But you really
captured that aspect

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:37.795
of the city, and of course,
for me at least, place

00:58:37.795 --> 00:58:39.190
is always a character.

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:44.630
It's how much of
a character it is,

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:48.220
and New York being so diverse,
concrete, and enormous

00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.816
is going to be a huge character.

00:58:50.816 --> 00:58:54.700
But for you, it wasn't a random
choice to choose the '70s.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.387
How did you?

00:58:56.387 --> 00:58:58.220
That New York is such
a particular New York.

00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:58.380
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.840
- Do you get the sense sometimes
of-- I mean and this is

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.310
a little trite but-- of having
the material kind of choose

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:05.470
you.

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:08.580
I'm not a very
rational-- I'm not

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:10.750
a very administrative
or top-down thinker.

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:12.760
I tend to sort of
wander around confused,

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.310
and then it's
like, oh, I suppose

00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:16.450
I have to write that story.

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:19.240
- But I know that I have
to write that story,

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.730
but the thing of New
York, of the city,

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:23.380
and of the diversity
of the city,

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:28.030
and of the as it were the
Hamilton-Sweeneys' Sutton Place

00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:30.670
house and the squat.

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:34.470
And just things like
Tompkins Square Park,

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:36.100
right, when I was
in college, there

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.230
were riots in
Tompkins Square Park.

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:42.100
I think by the time
that was in my novel,

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.750
Mr. Giuliani had made sure.

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:45.970
He had evacuated--

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:48.830
- Condos in the center
of Tompkins Square Park--

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:51.220
- All problematic
citizens, or subcitizens,

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.230
as he might see them,
in order to make sure

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:55.570
there were not more riots
ever in Tompkins Square Park.

00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:58.000
But you had to re-imagine
yourself back into it.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.070
- Well, there's that essay
that Benjamin's Arcades Project

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:05.980
sort of erupts out
of, that was to be

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.610
called Paris, the Capital
of the 19th Century.

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:14.290
And one does have the
feeling that the 20th century

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:18.610
version will be New York, the
Capital of the 20th Century.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:21.460
And it's interesting.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.650
The analysis that
Benjamin gets is actually

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:25.120
very, very specific.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.520
It's not just any old
place, or it's not just

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.330
the biggest one of these things.

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.750
It has its own character.

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:35.110
And there is something for
me about the 20th century

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:45.870
having been a century of tribes
suddenly mixing together.

01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:50.250
It's probably the most murderous
century we've had so far,

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:53.890
although that's probably true
of every century, sad to say.

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:58.750
But at the same time, there's a
sense of also the 20th century

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.360
is the one in which it
was suddenly conceivable

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.300
that people of
different sexualities,

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:08.290
ethnic backgrounds, classes
might-- that period you

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.530
were describing,
I think, there was

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:14.590
less of the social liberation,
although that was coming.

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:17.080
I think you would
still in the '60s

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.670
have rather been in New York
than Alabama if you are gay.

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:26.530
But there was this
sense of an experiment,

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:30.872
like a crazy experiment.

01:01:30.872 --> 01:01:31.930
How did you put it?

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:36.070
You said the something
equality and some social?

01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:38.410
- Social responsibility
and fiscal responsibility--

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.534
- Social responsibility
and fiscal responsibility--

01:01:40.534 --> 01:01:45.610
- Were kind of in
collision in the 1970s.

01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:48.970
And the argument's being
made that what was ultimately

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:50.860
most socially
responsible will be what

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.870
was most fiscally responsible.

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:54.940
I mean, those were very
important conversations

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:55.606
that people had.

01:01:55.606 --> 01:01:57.670
- And somehow the whole
social side of the city,

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:02.410
the whole drawing together of
these great masses of people

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:08.650
from all over the world was
also underwriting and was

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:13.750
underwritten by this huge
economic miracle-- I mean,

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.251
what now looks to
us like a miracle.

01:02:15.251 --> 01:02:16.875
Back then, you would
have just thought,

01:02:16.875 --> 01:02:18.020
oh, this is every day life.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.660
And what interested me, I
guess, about this period is--

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.190
in the novel and what interests
me about like this week

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:29.440
is-- it's one of those moments
where the inherent tensions

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.500
erupt and the question of is it
possible for things that go on

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.340
like this comes to the fore?

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:42.560
- It strikes me that you
both have protagonists

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.710
who are young people.

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:50.150
And so some of this feeling
one's way in the city

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:54.110
is a young person's project.

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:57.080
So you have Mercer, the
aspiring writer who comes,

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.520
who in many ways may be you,
who comes from the rural South

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.040
to the city, going to write
the great American novel.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.570
You have William,
the alienated heir

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:12.230
to this family fortune
that his sister,

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:15.290
trying to live an ordinary life.

01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:18.260
Samantha and Charlie,
suburban kids

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:22.520
from Long Island, who
see New York as the way

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.290
to escape suburbia
and live a real life.

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:29.290
And you too build
your novel around

01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:34.150
these privileged graduates
of Brown University who

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:37.630
come to New York
with great dreams

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.940
but they don't seem to
be getting anywhere.

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:44.045
And then there's the
more working class

01:03:44.045 --> 01:03:44.920
cousin from New York.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:50.980
But these are all young
people, for whom the city seems

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.690
to hold out these promises.

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:55.460
Was that a deliberate decision?

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.430
How did you particularly,
Claire, come to that decision

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:02.150
that you would get a novel
that would culminate in 9/11

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:05.315
would be about young
people's dilemmas?

01:04:05.315 --> 01:04:06.295
- Liz, I was young.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:14.900
Really, I think the
city is obviously--

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.400
exactly what Garth was talking
about in the early part

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.400
of your talk-- this repository
of dream and fantasy.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:27.170
And from Balzac onwards,
from Lost Delusions onwards,

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:29.940
the idea of the provincial
comes to the city

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:34.910
and discovers all of the
things-- the diversity,

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:39.170
and the corruption, and
vice for the first time,

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:41.190
but also ambition.

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:46.340
And I'd actually be
really interested to read

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.420
the novel about the
55-year-old doing that.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.170
I mean, I think it'd be a
really interesting novel,

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:56.147
but it isn't an instinctive.

01:04:56.147 --> 01:04:57.605
- I actually really
like that idea.

01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:05.120
- But I think there is
the buoyancy of the city

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.647
and the maelstrom is
like the cliche-- oh,

01:05:10.647 --> 01:05:12.730
that's a young person's
thing to move to New York.

01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:14.210
- It's interesting.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:17.690
When I was suggesting
that maybe it's

01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:21.582
not just that New York happens
to be the biggest game in town

01:05:21.582 --> 01:05:23.290
in the 20th century,
but that it actually

01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:27.560
has its own kind of
personality, that that's maybe

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.380
a distinction that I would
make between New York and, say,

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:35.630
Chicago, or Baltimore,
or Memphis, or something.

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:41.000
There's a youth
culture-- I mean,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.270
there always has been--
that draws people there.

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:51.570
Also it's the city
of reinvention.

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:53.256
Like you maybe go
to Chicago to work

01:05:53.256 --> 01:05:54.380
on the Mercantile Exchange.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.910
I love Chicago.

01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:01.590
If you're an actor,
you go to Chicago.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:06.080
But in most ways,
you come to New York.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.480
And Paris was that
in the 19th century.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.440
- And Berlin is that
to some extent now.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:16.250
And I think there's
also this sense of--

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:18.481
- Berlin and-- God help
us-- San Francisco.

01:06:18.481 --> 01:06:20.900
- Well, but I going say that
I think one of the things,

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.670
maybe not to
Francisco any longer,

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:25.360
because-- the French word
that is in my head is

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.484
[SPEAKING FRENCH] and even if
you were telling your story

01:06:29.484 --> 01:06:31.400
about we couldn't afford
to go to grad school.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.000
We couldn't afford.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:32.980
We couldn't afford.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.630
That was my story too,
I couldn't afford.

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:37.130
I could afford to
live in London.

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:38.090
It used to be cheap.

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:40.560
But I couldn't afford
to live in New York.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.231
And I think that
part of the is what

01:06:45.231 --> 01:06:47.230
you're willing to put up
with when you're young.

01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:53.350
Is it Jenny's first flat
that has the bathtub.

01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:57.484
I remember them, the
bathtub under the counter.

01:06:57.484 --> 01:06:58.900
- I had pages and
pages that I had

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:00.240
to cut, just all those little--

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.500
- You cut pages, Garth?

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.540
- I cut so many pages.

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:05.690
It was twice as long.

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:08.250
- But what you'd put up
with to be in New York.

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:10.900
And that's part of the
exhilaration and thrill of it.

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.400
But rare is the 55-year-old
will put up with it.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.250
- Though it was also a time
of when there were many ways

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:19.150
to live in New York.

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:23.000
And it seems now there
are increasingly fewer.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.310
Brooklyn is no longer
what Brooklyn was.

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:28.310
I don't know what the new
affordable part of New York

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:31.730
is, but your people are living
in all different kinds of ways

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:35.680
in New York-- group
houses and whatever.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.110
So but I did want to weave
just a little more time

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:40.410
for our discussion
before we open it up.

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:43.840
I gather from some
of the articles

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.910
I've read that Scott Rudin has
picked up the rights to make

01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:51.880
a film, based on the book.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.500
And I'm curious
about whether that

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.710
is in fact happening,
what your expectations are

01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:00.400
about the film.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.320
In many ways, the
novel is a product

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.970
of the 19th century-- television
and film, 20th and 21st.

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:10.720
Do you think that the
film by definition

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.050
will have to be very different?

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.995
It will be shorter, unless
you're planning for--

01:08:14.995 --> 01:08:16.870
- Better be in a
miniseries, don't you think?

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:17.740
They can't do it in two hours.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.729
- So what's the plan?

01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:23.620
And did you actually have any
film interest in your book?

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:24.257
- Yes.

01:08:24.257 --> 01:08:25.090
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:27.370
- Long and boring story.

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:29.950
- Claire and I know each
other just well enough,

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:32.710
I presume, for her to
know that I am very, very

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:37.720
deliberate about a lot of
choices that I make, let's say.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.970
And I've noticed that you
look at certain writers'

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:40.899
bibliographies.

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:45.479
Notice an eight or nine year
gap, and you go what happened?

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:47.020
And you start to
ask around, and it's

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.500
like, oh, they got sucked
into the screenplay dungeon

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.189
or whatever.

01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:59.290
So my policy following having
used older writers by proxy

01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:02.990
is to remain as remote
as I can possibly be.

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:06.015
- So you will not be involved
in-- but it isn't happening?

01:09:06.015 --> 01:09:06.640
You don't know.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.770
- I wouldn't know.

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:12.556
- But may I ask-- it couldn't
be for a two hour film.

01:09:15.392 --> 01:09:17.380
It would have to be something.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.652
I think that's--

01:09:18.652 --> 01:09:21.130
- There's a two-hour film in
there just struggling to get

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:23.060
out.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.810
- We cut 200 characters.

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:26.060
They're not on the [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:29.810
- The blackout will
probably come a lot sooner.

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:33.819
- Well, how do you make
a movie about a blackout?

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:34.979
The whole thing third act.

01:09:34.979 --> 01:09:37.439
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.510
- Avant-garde.

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:40.550
- So Claire, what's
your story with film?

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:46.990
- I think it was a long
process where it was optioned,

01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:49.810
and then, one set
of people get--

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.689
you can't imagine how many
times I've read in Variety about

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.720
the imminent filming of my book.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.190
But lo and behold, the house
of cards doesn't stay up.

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:06.220
You have to let it go.

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.800
It's a different medium.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.230
If they're going to make
a movie-- in my case

01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:15.299
I think at this point I can say
with confidence they're not--

01:10:15.299 --> 01:10:16.840
but if they're going
to make a movie,

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.400
they have to be
free to adapt it.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.010
And there's that wonderful
story about Nabokov writing

01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:25.630
the screenplay for
Lolita and them

01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:27.713

you, wonderful, wonderful.

And as he walked out, tearing
it up and beginning again.

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:34.180
It's just such a
different medium,

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:38.410
and any filmmaker
will need the leeway

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:41.110
to do whatever
they're going to do.

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:44.020

and find that City on Fire

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:45.360

- Oh, right, that they'll
make that dramatic a change.

01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:52.225
- I think it's just a
completely different--

01:10:52.225 --> 01:10:54.430
- Werner, and Hans,
and all of that.

01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:57.880
- Though it does strike me that
this appetite people have now

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:03.520
for these series, and watching
they will just sit there

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.689

another of-- we're all doing it.

And there's a lot of attention.

That's where the writing
talent is now in television,

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.690
not movies, and all that.

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:17.820
- But just to say a little
something about that,

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.690
there was this big-- at the time
I sat down to write the book--

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:23.980
there was this big
narrative about--

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:27.640
it was like bookstores
were going bankrupt.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.920
Publishers were not far behind.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.670
And everyone was said to be
unable to sustain attention

01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:35.648
for more than 140 characters.

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:41.050
- And you thought
I'll prove them wrong.

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:41.727
- Au contraire.

01:11:41.727 --> 01:11:43.560
I thought, oh, this
novel was unpublishable.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.770
But the punk in me
was like, perfect,

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:52.835
then I don't have to worry
about what Heidegger called das

01:11:52.835 --> 01:11:54.580
Mann, like the they, the them.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.750
What do they think?

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.575
It was just what
does the book want?

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.810
But I did notice everyone
was on their 53rd

01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:08.580
hour of The Sopranos, which is a
remarkable feat of achievement.

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.177
- Or The Wire or The Americans.

01:12:11.177 --> 01:12:13.510
- And I had this feeling,
watching those shows that they

01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:17.590
had stolen an entire-- or
not stolen, appropriated--

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:22.990
adapted an entire grammar
from the novel that I loved

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:26.710
and could be put to deeper
purposes in the novel,

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:31.630
because of just what is unique
about the novel as a form.

01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:35.470
And I did have this
feeling of well, you know,

01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:38.020
I'm taking these things back.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.970
And by the time I
got out of my garret

01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:43.420
with my incredibly unwieldy
manuscript, I looked around

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.300
and suddenly people
were going to bookstores

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:49.294
and that meant large,
ambitious novels were--

01:12:49.294 --> 01:12:50.460
- Change had been happening.

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:51.640
- Yes.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.210
- So maybe these series
are sending us back

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:58.720
to the long book, which I do
want to close on just asking,

01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.940
and then we'll open it up.

The mic is in the aisle.

So this is a long
book, and you've

01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:07.360
suggested that you have even
cut, that it was even longer,

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.090
and you've cut it.

01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:11.860
Why is it such a long book?

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.369
And I am curious.

01:13:13.369 --> 01:13:15.160
- I think if you have
to ask that question,

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.210
it's not a successful book.

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:21.100
- No, did you worry
that if it was too long,

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.171
you would lose these
readers who were--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:13:24.503 --> 01:13:27.650
- You reviewed Teju
Cole's Open City, right?

01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:28.960
- I did, yeah.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.690
- Wonderful book.

01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:36.270
And I read it, and I just
thought, what an elegant way

01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:38.900
of going at urban experience.

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:43.020
And I thought, why am I not
smart enough to do that?

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:50.140
I don't have the talent to adopt
that kind of economy of means.

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:55.090
But what I was specifically
interested in about the city

01:13:55.090 --> 01:14:01.090
was the ways that they teeter
on the edge of falling apart,

01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:03.940
the ways that they come
right up against the boundary

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.310
conditions for
their own existence,

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:10.390
by attempting to do too much and
be too much to too many people.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:15.190
And so I wanted to make
a city out of prose,

01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:19.630
and actually, like at a
certain point, I cut back.

01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:21.270
This is the organized
complexity thing.

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:24.520
I cut back to a certain thing,
and it and it fell apart.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.330
It wouldn't hold
together anymore.

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:30.730
And I had to actually
work back out

01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:32.680
to something slightly larger.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.880
And it was like really
just fascinating

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.980
and a little bit baffling
to me, but I just knew.

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:43.440
I was like, oh, it dies
with too much constraint.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.350
- It's about you have
to hit the balance.

01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:46.600
- You wanted to say something.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.016
- I just wanted
to respond to that

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:52.960
and say I disagree with your
framing of why you didn't

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.880
write a book like Open City.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.800
- Well, I'm being a little--

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.237
- Yeah, you're throwing
on the self-deprecation.

01:14:59.237 --> 01:15:00.320
You don't need to do that.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.372
- My hair shirt.

01:15:02.372 --> 01:15:04.110
- But it is true
that there are two--

01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:06.430
it is the novel of the
flaneur, as it were,

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:09.550
and it is the city
as an interior space.

01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:12.820
The city as interiority,
as opposed to the city

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:17.470
as the teeming,
diverse, concrete world.

01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:21.190
And I think it's just actually a
different novelistic tradition,

01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:26.722
in which you have as many
certainly as many ideas

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.180
and as much
interiority and as much

01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:33.770
history, and a whole
lot else besides.

01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:36.310
It's just a different approach.

01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:48.526
And I do think that balance
of constraint and freedom--

01:15:48.526 --> 01:15:53.409
it makes total sense that
it's like a geodesic dome

01:15:53.409 --> 01:15:53.950
or something.

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:56.950
You have to get the
proportions right.

But I know we need to
move out to the audience.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.570
One tiny question
that I have for you

01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:07.460
is that I know when
I start something,

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:10.810
I usually have a
sense of its scale.

01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:16.190
And I wondered if from the very
moment you envisaged you knew?

01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:16.690
- You did.

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.274
- I did.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:20.440
- That's why you put it in
a drawer for three years.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:27.190
- Yeah, it was two minutes and
45 seconds in July of 2003,

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:30.460
I thought aha.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:38.710

page count, word count, all

01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:42.760

well about Venice, but also

buy, and they don't live there.

become a trend.

point about constant change--

I was in boarding school
here in 1980 to 1983.

- The Mug and Muffin was gone,

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:42.090
I know exactly what you're
saying about money and cities,

01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:43.980
and I think there
are obviously very

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.280
important conversations
to be had about that

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.370
and work to be done.

01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:50.790
On the other hand, people
are moving to cities

01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:51.870
in unprecedented numbers.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.244
Are we not reaching
a point where

01:19:53.244 --> 01:19:56.160
more than half our
population is in cities now?

01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:03.240
People are fleeing the vast red
map, precisely for the cities.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.830
And not everybody's rich.

01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:07.710
So it seems to me that
one of the things that

01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:10.440
does happen that
hopefully is to the good

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:16.260
is that there isn't just
Paris, and New York,

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:22.140
and London, and Berlin,
but also Austin, Texas, and

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:26.754
Philadelphia, and Seattle,
and Atlanta, and so on.

01:20:26.754 --> 01:20:28.170
- Now, I could say
having recently

01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:30.595
been to all these cities
that Seattle's unaffordable.

01:20:30.595 --> 01:20:32.770
Austin's getting unaffordable.

01:20:32.770 --> 01:20:34.920
But you have to read
Jane Jacobs on this,

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.560
because I think there's a
chapter about-- I think she

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.900
calls it catastrophic money.

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:45.270
And she talks about one
of the neighborhoods

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:48.420
she uses is the South
End, I think, of Boston

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:52.350
and how the magic of this
specific confluence of factors

01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:54.420
that makes it wonderful
at a certain time

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:57.182
will eventually lure
in-- it will become

01:20:57.182 --> 01:20:59.640
a commodity for those who can
afford it, and then kill what

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.848
was great in the first place.

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.200
That's just sort of the cycle.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.810
But there are places.

01:21:09.810 --> 01:21:13.110
I spent a lot of the first
part of the year traveling

01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.740
around Europe.

01:21:16.535 --> 01:21:19.080
Berlin is an amazing city,
because you can throw anything

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.090
at it, and it's so big that
it just sort of swallows it.

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:33.000
But Lisbon, Budapest-- there
are a number of other cities

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.220
that they're not on our maps.

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:37.560
They're not on my map, because
I'm old and boring now.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:42.840
But if I was young,
that would be the place.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.430
And those places
will get settled,

01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:49.100
and then the catastrophic
money will flow towards those.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.290
So I don't know that
trying to manage it

01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:56.730
by freezing cities
in place-- there's

01:21:56.730 --> 01:21:59.310
a degree to which that works,
like Jackie Kennedy stopping

01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:01.470
the destruction of
Grand Central Station.

01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:05.550
But there's a degree to
which it's a losing battle

01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:07.240
to try to just
freeze it in place.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.970
And I think what I
was trying to suggest

01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:14.190
is we have to oppose
a vision of change

01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:17.070
to the change that's happening,
rather than opposing it

01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:20.850
with sort of fixity.

01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:22.980
- I'm Jonas.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.570
How much research did
you do for this book?

01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:29.520
And did the research
change the path

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.490
for some of your
characters in smaller ways,

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:36.860
like was that store on
that street and so on?

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:38.480
- I mean I'll just
disappoint you.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:44.400
I'm not a big researcher
as a novelist.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.250
Someone asked E.L. Doctorow
about how much research

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:52.230
did you do-- fabulously
persuasive fictional edifices

01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:55.410
set in historical periods--
and he said, how much did I do?

01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:59.835
I did just enough, just
enough to persuade you.

01:22:59.835 --> 01:23:02.970
Our art is not an art of fact.

01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:05.030
It's an art of belief.

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:08.870
And I did this interview
with Javier Marias on Friday,

01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:10.469
and he did this
amazing Marias thing

01:23:10.469 --> 01:23:13.010
where he flipped it around, and
we got to where we were like,

01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:15.260
oh, belief is more
real than fact.

01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.490
He had me totally persuaded.

01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:20.260
I have no idea what he
said, but we're working in--

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:23.330
- Well, but it's clearly
true in our new America.

01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:27.830
- Yeah, well, it's probably
always been true in some way.

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:34.910
But the rhetoric of fiction is
very, very interesting thing

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:35.780
to think about.

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:39.380
And as novelists,
we think about it.

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:44.390
And I think it's almost
something that never occurs

01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:49.100
to the reader, but--
just for example,

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:51.200
it seems intuitive that
the more research you do,

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.660
the more persuasive
something becomes.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:24:00.124
And yet often the more you pile
up, the more anxious you seem.

01:24:00.124 --> 01:24:02.040
I think James has written
really well on this.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.480
The more anxious you
seem to show the reader.

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.340
You lose the
authority that comes

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:09.410
from feeling like, I got this.

01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:11.210
I know this cold.

01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:13.820
I didn't live in New
York, but I know it.

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.730
I wasn't alive, and I was
born at the end of the '70s,

01:24:16.730 --> 01:24:18.350
but I know them.

01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:22.700
And so I felt that the whole
fiction-making mechanism

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.980
would somehow be
paralyzed if I backed up

01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:28.960
my dump truck of research.

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:35.030
And in fact, you
get to facts that

01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:37.520
are true on the
level of research

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.140
but false to people's memories.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.940
And then they'll
treat them as false,

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.410
even though they're true.

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:46.280
So what I did instead was
I tried to write the book,

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.940
and trust my imagination, and
trust the things that would

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:52.040
pop out at the end of my pen.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.444
And then when I had a
draft, I did go back.

01:24:55.444 --> 01:24:57.110
I wanted to know if
the store had moved,

01:24:57.110 --> 01:25:00.200
but I wouldn't
necessarily change it.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:04.070
I'm unwilling to let things be.

01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:05.600
- But there's a
kind of authenticity

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.507
you knew you had to create,
even if it wasn't accuracy.

01:25:09.507 --> 01:25:10.340
Those are different.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.280
- That word authenticity
is so problematic in a way

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.320
that no one talks about.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:21.250
But I never questioned the
authenticity of your New York.

01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:25.430
And now that I know that you
didn't spend a lot of time

01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:28.790
living there, if I was a
certain kind of critic,

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:33.080
I know I would be tempted
to be like, is it authentic?

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.540
But it has the
authenticity of belief,

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:37.130
and the authenticity
of persuasion,

01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:39.230
and the authenticity
of imagination.

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:42.260
And that's the only
authenticity there really is.

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.120
I hate to burst anyone's bubble.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:50.060
But I got this from
watching Patty Smith.

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:52.420
The performance is
the authenticity.

01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:54.350
There's nothing.

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:57.710
There's no non-performed thing.

01:25:57.710 --> 01:26:00.532
- I read an interview in which
you said something that's

01:26:00.532 --> 01:26:02.240
very similar to one
of my favorite things

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.670
that Peter Carey
said about writing

01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:07.970
Oscar and Lucinda, where he
said I looked at it as a science

01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:09.830
fiction of the past.

01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:12.530
And you started by
saying as a kid,

01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:14.660
you loved reading books
that built worlds,

01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:18.720
and I think that's what fiction
does, is build the world.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.110
And if it builds a
world successfully,

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:25.550
you're ready to jump in.

01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:27.230
As a reader, you're
ready to jump in.

01:26:27.230 --> 01:26:30.050
And I think then it
isn't-- as you say--

01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:33.364
it isn't about the
minutiae so much.

01:26:33.364 --> 01:26:35.280
- And conversely, if you
build in a kickstand,

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.355
so that it's kind of
leaning on the real world,

01:26:39.355 --> 01:26:40.580
it doesn't work.

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:43.940
It has to be autonomous, even
if everything in it is 100%.

01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:49.010
So Wolf Hall is an amazing--
I could have never done that.

01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:51.350
And you know everything
in it is true.

01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:54.290
I mean, you just know she
did a ton of research,

01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:57.380
and she wasn't paralyzed by
it, because she's not me.

01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.800
And yet it's
completely autonomous.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:08.060
It is sufficient unto itself,
and if Cromwell had never

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.850
existed, it wouldn't
be any less of a novel.

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:12.110
- It would be as convincing.

01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:15.200
And the historical
novel I always think of

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.790
is The Blue Flower, which for
me is Penelope Fitzgerald's

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:22.505
The Blue Flower, which is
the ideal historical novel,

01:27:22.505 --> 01:27:26.150
in which the
historicity-- is that

01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:27.420
appropriate in this context?

01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:27.961
I'm not sure.

01:27:27.961 --> 01:27:32.270
But it is so profoundly
embedded that you forget

01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:34.740
that it's a historical novel.

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.740
Then there's a moment
where they some weird sort

01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.720
of late 18th century soup.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.570
You know, like, oh,
I guess it isn't now.

01:27:42.570 --> 01:27:43.390
- It's so real.

01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:45.680
- But it's not calling
attention to itself.

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.740
- And as a genre, maybe this
is why I usually rebel against

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.129
the-- like I don't think of this
as a historical novel at all.

01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:54.170
And it's a genre I tend
to have a lot of problems

01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:59.510
with, because it generally
tends to want to lean

01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:01.580
on the real world for a prop.

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:05.150
But the great artists
who do it, it--

01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:06.020
- It lifts off.

01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:07.400
- It lifts off.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.170
- Well, we are out of time.

01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:11.420
And I just want to
ask you to join me

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:15.880
in thanking Claire and Garth
for this very [INAUDIBLE]
