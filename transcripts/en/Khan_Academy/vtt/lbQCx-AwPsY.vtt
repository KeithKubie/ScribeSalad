00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Tutor] In this video, we're
going to talk a little bit

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.799
about how modern technology
like social media

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.799
has enhanced the communication
power of the presidency.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.440
Now, being president
has a lot of advantages,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.745
but politically one of
those advantages is that

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.148
as president, you're
automatically newsworthy.

00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:23.907
So cameras and shows
are gonna be interested

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:27.070
in talking to you, hearing
what you have to say.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.040
Now, this has always been
the case for presidents.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.340
If they wanted to publish
an editorial in a newspaper

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.260
back in the 1790s, they
could have done that.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.398
But one major advantage
that presidents have today

00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:43.050
is advances in communication technology.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.050
And by that, I mean not only
the wealth of media choices

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.870
that are out there in terms of channels

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.643
and methods of distribution like YouTube,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.090
but also social media

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.540
like Facebook or Twitter.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.900
So why would presidents be interested

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.630
in using social media in the first place?

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.970
Well, check out this graph
from the Pew Research Center

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.970
that shows how much the
following of politicians

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.770
has grown in just four
years, from 2010 to 2014.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.770
You can see that it doesn't
matter how old someone is

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.090
or whether they're Republican or Democrat.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.530
Across the board, the
percent of registered voters

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.810
who follow candidates for office

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.920
has doubled in just this short time.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.810
So what does this mean for
the president in particular?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.100
Well, one thing it does
is make it much easier

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.853
for the president to do
something called going public.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.870
And going public is when

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.770
the president goes
directly to the electorate,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.320
speaks directly to the people

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.410
to gain support for their policies.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.700
So they're bypassing members of Congress

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.290
and speaking directly to the electorate

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.220
to try to drum up support

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.360
for whatever policy they'd like to enact.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.690
And the range of diverse media outlets

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.880
that serve different demographics

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.440
means that it's pretty
easy for the president

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.413
to speak directly to whichever demographic

00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:37.980
he or she's interested in talking to.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.280
So they can craft a message

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.433
that appeals to one specific demographic.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.430
For example, let's take a look at

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.500
an appearance that former
president Barack Obama

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.360
made on the internet
show Between Two Ferns.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.300
- Have you heard of the
Affordable Care Act?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.390
- Oh yeah, I heard about that.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.660
That's the thing that doesn't work.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.702
Why would you get the
guy that created the Zune

00:03:06.702 --> 00:03:08.640
to make your website?

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.270
- Healthcare.gov works great now,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.346
and millions of Americans
have already gotten

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:15.150
health insurance plans.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.435
And what we want is for people to know

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:19.990
that you can get affordable healthcare.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.020
And most young Americans,
right now they're not covered.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.540
And the truth is is that
they can get coverage,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.540
all for what it costs to
pay your cell phone bill.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.337
- [Tutor] So you'll
notice that in that clip,

00:03:34.337 --> 00:03:37.638
Obama was speaking
directly to young people,

00:03:37.638 --> 00:03:41.780
going through a show that young
people were likely to watch

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.900
and even using language that
was geared toward young people,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.900
like saying that healthcare costs

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.780
about as much as your cell phone bill,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.608
all in service of trying
to promote the policy

00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:54.810
of the Affordable Care Act.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.420
Barack Obama was also the first president

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.373
to create an official presidential
Twitter handle @POTUS,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.270
President of the United States,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.600
which then in the transfer of power

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.760
from the Obama administration
to the Trump administration

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.173
now is the official Twitter
handle of Donald Trump.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.220
And Trump is particularly
well known for using Twitter

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.520
to reach a broad audience.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.860
Check out this tweet

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.240
from July 5th, 2018, which talks about

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.800
Trump's position on immigration laws.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.090
So let's read these.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.640
Congress must pass smart, fast

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.650
and reasonable immigration laws now.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.990
Law enforcement at the
border is doing a great job,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.860
but the laws they are forced
to work with are insane.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.410
When people, with or without
children, enter our country,

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.500
they must be told to
leave without our country

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.900
being forced to endure
a long and costly trial.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.970
Tell the people "Out" and they must leave,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.370
just as they would if they were
standing on your front lawn.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.320
Hiring thousands of judges does not work

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.410
and is not acceptable.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.456
Only country in the world that does this.

00:05:08.456 --> 00:05:10.920
So you can see what Trump is doing here

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.500
is speaking directly to the people

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.912
and asking them to influence Congress

00:05:16.912 --> 00:05:19.800
in support of his policy stance.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.582
So using Twitter allows Trump to speak to

00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:25.021
more than 50 million followers,

00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:29.060
and it allows the president
to have a rapid response

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.390
to events as they unfold.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.920
So instead of having
to wait for a newspaper

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.560
to print an editorial
tomorrow or on Sunday,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.670
it's possible to speak to the electorate

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.100
within minutes of an
important event happening.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.530
So overall, modern
technology and social media

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.530
have really increased the
impact of the president's power

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.810
to communicate with the electorate,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.010
to get out policy initiatives
and to advertise them,

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.353
and to speak quickly and
directly to the people.
