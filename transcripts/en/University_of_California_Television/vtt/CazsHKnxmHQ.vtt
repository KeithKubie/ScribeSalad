- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal, naked large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.540
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.360

we got here. An exploration made possible

thank you to the organizers here of CARTA

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.950
for inviting me to participate and thank
all of you, a great crowd, for coming out

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.160
to see this fascinating topic explored. I
tend sometimes to be accused of nihilism

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.940
with regard to the origin of Homo because
my view is we actually know nothing about

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:45.220
the origin of Homo, just saying. And the
reason is simple in my view; is that while

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.570
it is true that we have a pretty good
fossil record of the genus Homo, the Homo

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.280
lineage as Bernard just finished
explaining, by around 2 million years ago

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.090
with some diversity and different adaptive
packages in different species: erectus,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:13.940
habilis, rudolfensis. On the assumption
that these three forms shared a common

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.330
ancestor at some point. That common
ancestor lived older than 2 million years

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:28.120
ago in a period of time in which we have
not a fender and a tire and a piece of

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.100
gear shift, but in which we have a
fragment of tire thread, which we have a

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.730
fragment of a headlight. And we are trying
to reconstruct an evolutionary history of

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:53.030
a group for which we basically have a car
wreck. And this is what we have to solve,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.700
this is the problem we have to solve and
this comes from field work and I'm going

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.970
to illustrate for you today in my view
where I think the genus, the Homo lineage

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.040
arose and where we have to re-double our
efforts for increasing the representation

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.910
of this lineage older than 2 million years
ago. Now, as Bernard ably suggested, the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.030
modern history of the study of the
evolution of the genus Homo really begins

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.560
with Louis Leakey and colleagues and the
recognition of the species, Homo habilis

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.620
in 1964 based on material from Bed I in
Olduvai Gorge dated to between around 1.7

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.660
and 1.75 million years, they discerned in
the type specimen of the species older by

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.220
Hominid VII what they thought was a
human-like dextrous ability in the hands,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.020
they discerned a notable increase in
endocranial volume, brain size, in

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.910
relation to then known Australopithecus
species, mostly from southern Africa and a

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.780
reduction in tooth size which they saw as
emblematic of an overall gracilization of

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.520
the chewing apparatus in almost a
human-like arrangement. And putting these

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.370
three characteristics together with the
plentiful stone tools that had been

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.860
recovered for years in these sediments,
they arrived at the conclusion that this

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.880
species, habilis, belonged near the base
of the genus Homo. So convinced were they

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.500
of this conclusion that Philip Tobias, one
the co-authors of the species, was able to

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.190
write in 1965 that Homo habilis
represented that last remaining major gap

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.450
in the pleistocene evolution of the genus
Homo, “of the story of human evolution, ”

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.290
to quote him directly. And in this
phylogeny shown here from one of Tobias'

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:53.200
papers, you can see the genus Homo is
represented as a single, gradually

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:01.910
evolving line characterized by uniquely
human characteristics related to large

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.630
brain size, reduced canine teeth, a
perfection of bipedal locomotion as we now

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.650
see it, a slowing down of the growth
trajectory, technology, language and so

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.570
forth. This was a package of
characteristics seen in modern humans and

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:27.700
thought to go back in time to at least 2
million years as an integrated whole,

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.700
along this slowly emerging lineage
culminating in Homo sapiens. The problem

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.780
was of course is that older than 2
millions years ago, there was virtually no

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.860
fossil record that could be confidently
associated uniquely with our lineage. And

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.780
so whether these characteristics emerged
piecemeal, step-wise and therefore each

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.330
demanding a separate explanation for
origin, or whether they emerged as a

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.620
package together, where one explanation
would take care of them all, could not be

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.820
discerned. Now a lot has happened, as
Bernard has pointed out in the years since

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:14.160
early 1960s. And beginning in the 1980s,
in large part due to the work that he and

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.660
others have done in those years, we now
see the genus Homo as a much more

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:28.450
complicated array of species. In my view,
there are at least three broadly

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:35.260
contemporaneous forms present at around 2
million years ago whereas in 1964, the

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:41.250
Leakeys would have said there's one in the
genus Homo: Homo rudolfensis, Homo habilis

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:47.160
and Homo erectus. And one of the lessons
that we have learned from the appreciation

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.650
of greater diversity in our own genus at
this period of time, is the idea that

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.560
there is not one adaptive package that can
describe them all, but there are perhaps

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.400
multiple ones. And the question is which,
if any, are germane to the origin of the

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:09.160
lineage itself? Or, are they all, in one
form or another, subsequent developments

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:16.030
to the establishment of the lineage?
Following on Bernard's talking about

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:23.150
Toyotas and Clades, my appreciation, my
rendering of the information available

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:30.420
from these three forms between around 1.7
and 2 million years ago is that they do,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:35.230
in fact, constitute a monophyletic group.
This is not the place to go into a

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.740
detailed rendition about the evidence for
it, but I think it speaks fairly clearly

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.730
to the idea that these three at 2 million
did in fact share a single unified

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:51.870
ancestry predating that time period,
moving back towards the 3 million year

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:58.400
mark. And the question is, where is it?
And who was it? And here's where we run up

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.840
against a roadblock. Now, why is this
important more than just for the purposes

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.910
of putting cladograms or phylogenies on
the page is because in the last decade or

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:17.010
two, information from global climate
change, paleo-climatic change, has made it

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.400
clear that the tim period in which many
people suspect the Homo lineage arose was

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:32.380
one of a very widespread, impactful change
in global climate, creating an expansion

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:39.110
of ice sheets, reduction in sea levels,
drying out of the African interior. And

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:46.930
that time period has been focused right
after the 3 million year mark; 2.8, 2.7

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:55.970
and so forth. And that drying out of
Africa has been seen as motive in the

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:03.220
origin of the robust Australopithecines,
the origin of the genus Homo, even to

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.910
stone tool manufacture. This has become
the prevailing hypothesis that the

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:14.400
complexification, if you will, of hominids
and the origin of technology is all

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.660
associated with the local impacts of these
global changes. The problem is that

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:26.120
there's no fossil evidence for the genus
Homo that is informative on exactly what

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.730
those changes were at this particular
point in time. We do have of course

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:38.570
Oldowan tools at around 2.6 million. And
as Bernard and others have pointed out,

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:45.740
perhaps that is a proxy for the genus Homo
or maybe it isn't. It's not outside the

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.670
realm of possibility given what we know
about how chimpanzees can make tools that

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:57.310
some Australopithecus is capable of making
them, too. So, questions and an absence of

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:05.420
evidence. And here is the sum total of the
fossil record of the genus Homo between 2-

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:12.210
and 2.5 million years ago. It would fit in
a shoe box and leave room for a decent

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:21.830
pair of shoes. All of these fossils have
been promoted by one person or another,

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:27.180
one group or another as identifying the
genus Homo older than 2.0 million years

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:32.230
ago and all of them have been doubted. And
I'm not going to go through them here to

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:37.460
point out the weaknesses and strengths of
the various arguments, other than to say

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.150
that the very fact that there's debate can
be traced to the fact that there's

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:49.700
relatively little evidence. And this is
why groups return to Africa, go to the

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.500
field to African sites, in East Africa, in
South Africa all the time focusing on this

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.920
time period which, in my view, is one of
the most intriguing of all the time

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:05.270
periods in human evolution to increase our
understanding of the fossil record. One

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:11.020
area where the group from The Institute of
Human Origins which I direct at ASU has

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.710
been focusing on, of course, for years is
Ethiopia. We've worked at the Lucy site

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:22.510
more or less continuously since 1990. And
colleagues of mine, Dr. Kaye Reed at ASU

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.070
and Chris Campisano and others, have
expanded the work, the IHO work in

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.850
Ethiopia, to a place called Ledi-Geraru as
seen here as slightly north and east of

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:38.960
the Hadar area. What attracted them to
this area? Two things, knowledge that the

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.430
environments represented by the sediments
in this area looked different from those

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:50.530
that were very common and well-understood
in the Lucy time period, older than 3

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:57.980
million, some 20, 30 kilometers away at
Hadar. And second, the suspicion verified

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:03.040
since then that the rocks may actually
represent a slightly younger time period

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.370
and that's important because at Hadar, as
you will see, we have Lucy species,

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.250
Australopithecus afarensis up to about 3
million years and then we jump across

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.750
three quarters of a million years and we
have a jaw of Homo with some stone tools

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:24.940
at 2.3 million. Lucy, Homo; older,
younger. Gap in the middle, let's try to

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:33.060
fill it. And that was their mission. Now,
in the lower Awash Valley, these areas

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.650
around Hadar and middle Ledi and Gona and
Dikika and Woranso-Mille, there are

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:46.810
excellent sediments going backwards in
time from around 3 million years ago. And

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.010
we have an excellent set of sediments in
places like Gona and Hadar that take us

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:58.660
forward from around 2.5 million years ago.
It is the time period in between that is

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:04.270
critical and is germane to the questions
about where the three forms of Homo that

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:11.390
we know of at 2 million perhaps emerged
from? And these sediments are present

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:20.190
amply, now well-studied in the Ledi-Geraru
area spanning in time from around 2.8

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:26.120
million years to about 2.6 million years.
And what's really important to understand

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.370
about these sediments, and this is both an
advantage and a disadvantage is that they

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:38.820
are not continuous across time, but
instead are exposed in fault blocks,

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:44.960
adjacent fault blocks which means that
each block of sediment is a unified slice

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.920
of time separated from another block next
to it which has itself a unified period of

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:57.190
time with slight gaps in between them.
Disadvantaged because we can't trace

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:02.160
evolutionary events continuously but
advantage because fossils that come,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.540
demonstrably come, from particular fault
blocks can be narrowed to a very narrow

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:12.950
range of environments and associations
with other animal species, etc. So, a plus

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:20.090
and a minus. And here is the Ledi-Geraru
area. Kaye and her team have been working

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.340
her for more than a decade before they
found their first hominid. Looking at the

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:29.880
fauna, looking at the geology, trying to
understand the environments. And by the

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.240
way, this is an area called the Lee Adoyta
basin and you can see here, here's one

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.350
fault block, here's another fault block,
and here's a third fault block. They're

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.770
about three or four fault blocks just
exposed in this one view, very clearly

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:49.580
delineated. You can see one of the faults
running right through here. Now, back in

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.760
2013, Kaye and her group of
paleontologists were surveying an area in

00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:00.200
the Lee Adoyta basin called the Gurumaha
block just in the one fault block. And at

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.950
the base of this one hillside, there's a
volcanic ash that is now well-dated, very

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:12.610
precisely dated to 2.8 to 2, plus or minus
a handful of years, in the million year

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:21.370
range. And on one winter's day, one of our
graduate students at ASU, Chalachew

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:30.040
Seyoum, was surveying up on this hillside
and found this little jaw. That jaw eroded

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.750
out of this hill, perhaps in a recent rain
storm and resides about 10, maybe 12

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:42.870
meters above that volcanic ash. And on the
hillside, there are no sediments up above

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:49.590
younger that the jaw could have floated
down from. It eroded out of that hillside

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:55.450
and it's around 10 meters above the tough.
So here's the jaw after it has been

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:01.730
cleaned up. And I'm here to tell you that
it answers some questions, answer some

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:09.140
very specific questions. It doesn't answer
all the questions. But there's a myth out

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:15.210
here in Paleoanthropology that unless you
have a complete skeleton, you're not

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:18.980
prepared to answer any meaningful
questions and I wish to dispel that myth.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:24.440
You know, since Raymond Dart named
Australopithecus in 1925, there have been

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:32.030
a plethora of hominid species named,
recognized; Australopithecus africanus,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:38.180
Paranthropus robustus, Paranthropus
boisei, Homo Habilis, on and on. Many of

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.240
them, if not most of them on the basis of
material that we here today would

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.780
consider, at best, imperfect. A fragment
of a jaw, a bit of a brain case, some

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:53.900
teeth, and the fact of the matter is is
that in the intervening years, the vast

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:59.080
majority of those species recognized on
the basis of imperfect material have been

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.990
verified as to be meaningful evolutionary
units. We are not at sea when we have

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:10.360
small fragments. We are limited in the
type of questions we can ask. If complete

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:15.590
skeletons were the answer to all of our
questions, then Lucy would have settled,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:23.220
once and for all, the debate about when
early humans made a commitment to

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:28.800
terrestrial bipedality. Instead, she
generated what is now going on to five

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:36.270
decades of debate about that question. It
depends on the question and this question,

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:41.250
the question that we address to this jaw,
is it the same thing as Australopithecus

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:46.280
at 2.8 million or is it something
different? And I engaged in that question

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.270
with my former PhD student, Brian Brian
Villmoar now at University of Nevada, Las

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:57.760
Vegas, and Chalachew Seyoum our graduate
student who found the jaw. And we came to

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.400
the conclusion that in many respects, it
differs from your standard issue

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.530
generalized Australopithecus jaw. Seen
here on the left is a nice jaw of Lucy's

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:13.200
species, Australopithecus afarensis and on
the right is a reconstructed from a scan

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.790
of the specimen from Ledi-Geraru. We
noticed that the jaw differs

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:24.150
rather...these two jaws differ rather
remarkably. The afarensis jaw is typically

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:31.780
long and narrow with fat molar teeth,
primitive pre-molars and so forth. And our

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:38.140
major comparison was to something like
this, one of the jaws from the Dmanisi

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:43.830
site dated to about 1.8 million years
which is attributed to Homo erectus. And

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:48.050
there's a much greater similarity in the
shape of the dental arch, in the form of

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.580
the teeth, the pre-molars being
symmetrical and so forth, to this 1.8

00:19:52.580 --> 00:20:01.370
million year old Homo erectus jaw than to
Lucy's species. And it extends also to the

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.480
architecture of the jaw and I'm not going
to go into the details here, but

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.440
underneath the pre-molar, the afarensis
jaw is characterized by a highly sculpted

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:15.460
out, contour like a chimpanzee probably
do, to the very large canine teeth absent

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:20.780
in the Ledi-Geraru jaw. The back part of
the mandible where the vertical part

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.630
called the ascending ramus arises from the
body of the jaw is located in the Ledi jaw

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:31.580
well back of the third molar, not forward
as it is in Lucy's species over the second

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:39.300
molar. And the upper and lower boundaries
of the mandibular borders beneath the

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:45.590
teeth and at the base are more or less
parallel. And in Australopithecus, they're

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.840
not, it gets shallower to the rear. And by
the way, it's also true of

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:55.400
Australopithecus africanus which is
slightly closer in age to the Ledi jaw in

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:02.050
South Africa, the same kind of thing. So,
when we made the comparison to jaws of the

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:07.570
genus Homo, later in time obviously
because we don't have much in the 2.5 to 3

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:13.350
million year period, the similarities were
very apparent to us. This is a jaw that

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:21.870
exhibits characteristics that forecast
anatomy that is common, the most common

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:27.480
anatomical patterns in jaws of the genus
Homo younger than 2 million. So we

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.420
published it, in not quite a year ago, in
the Journal of Science as a 2.8 million

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:38.170
year old jaw of the genus Homo. Now does
it answer questions about what were the

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:44.790
adaptive packages present early on in the
lineage leading to us? Of course. But what

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:53.460
it does do is that it puts one data point
in an area that is otherwise a void in the

00:21:53.460 --> 00:22:00.930
evolution of our own genus. Question is
what kind of environment did it live in?

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.090
Did it live in a dry environment? Did it
live in an open one? Germane to the

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:11.460
questions about what drove early evolution
of Homo. And data that's been put together

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:19.270
by Kaye Reed and given to me for this
purpose shows that this jaw is found in a

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:27.260
context of animal species that lived in
essentially grassland environments, very

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:36.190
different in terms of how open or closed
the habitats were compared to time periods

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:42.220
in which Lucy's species lived. And this is
just a couple hundred thousand years

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:48.830
later. Now, I hasten to add here, I am not
asserting that the origin of the genus

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:54.150
Homo is due to a drying out of the
environment. But one thing we can say,

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:59.690
because of the very confined time period
of the Gurumaha fault block in which the

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:05.440
mandible and the fauna on which this
inference is made, suggest that the modal

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:11.130
environmental signal at 2.8 in this area
is one essentially of a grassland

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:16.580
environment. And we can see that by
looking at some of the other animal

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.800
fossils that have been found associated
with the horizon from which that mandible

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:27.790
has come. This is the Gurumaha block,
these are El Salafin bovid frequencies and

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:32.480
the horse frequencies, both of which of
course are well-known grazers. And

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:38.020
together, in the Gurumaha block, they
constitute nearly 40% of the macrofauna,

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.190
excludes elephants and hippos and stuff.
I'm not saying it's dry, we're saying it's

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:48.000
open. So it's 40% of the macrofauna and
that is very impressive compared to the

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.480
frequencies back in Lucy's time starting
just 200,000 years earlier. Opens up areas

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:03.130
for inquiry. And finally, some new data
coming out of Kenya from Sonia Harmand's

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:10.360
group suggests that stone tool use, in
fact, began not with the genus Homo,

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:16.970
maybe. But perhaps as long ago as 3.5
million years when we have

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:24.170
Australopithecus. And if these finds are
verified, it opens up a whole new range of

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:30.260
possibilities looking at the adaptive
packages that constitute the ancestral

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:37.890
platform from which the genus Homo
emerged. And so to finish up, here we have

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:42.450
Ledi-Geraru, here we have our formerly
first appearance, a former first

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:48.280
appearance of stone tools now pushed back
here perhaps and does that imply that the

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:54.640
genus Homo itself has even an earlier
origin than we think of at 2.8, perhaps

00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.800
back as far as Lucy? Or could Lucy herself
have been the first stone tool maker?

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.041
Thank you.

00:25:03.922 --> 00:25:06.922
♪ [music] ♪

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:20.400
- [Philip] We've heard a lot at this point
about the evolution of hominids in Africa.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:26.690
It's a complicated history for sure. Let
me at this point just cut to the chase and

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:34.380
say that humans moved out of Africa
probably just after 2 million years ago

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.770
and it will be that part of the record
that I want to emphasize this afternoon.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:47.300
The site of Dmanisi in the Georgian
Caucasus is very important, records the

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:53.610
oldest known, at this point, the oldest
known occupations of Eurasia beginning

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:59.100
before 1.85 million years ago. We don't
actually have human remains that are that

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.990
old, but certainly there are stone tools
approaching that date. The good part about

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:11.250
Dmanisi is that in fact we have not just
scraps of headlamp and bumper and so

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:18.500
forth, but virtually whole skeletons and a
number of them. Now we have five skulls in

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.000
various states of repair or disrepair.
Along with them, there are post cranial

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.410
bones associated with one juvenile
individual particularly perhaps but not

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:36.850
clearly associated with one of the adults.
Also the material is extremely

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:42.600
well-preserved. We're very fortunate in
that respect. Along with the humans, of

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:48.540
course there are animal bones and many,
many of them and there is a very complete

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:53.230
lithic record to go along with this
material which is well-preserved, as I

00:26:53.230 --> 00:27:00.960
say, in a very carefully studied
stratigraphic context. Several of the

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:08.280
specimens from Dmanisi have been in the
past likened to African Homo erectus but

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.700
the skeletons are quite primitive. One of
them in particular is strikingly so, Skull

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:18.910
5 which I will talk about. At the moment,
I think it's fair to say that the

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:23.530
taxidermic identity and the
paleobiological significance of the

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:30.140
Dmanisi materials remain controversial.
Certainly there have been plenty of

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:36.030
suggestions and I'm afraid I've been
responsible for some of them but we'll see

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:45.240
where things go. Dmanisi is situated in
Georgia. Georgia is stuck there between

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:51.760
the Black Sea and the Caspian with
Azerbaijan off to the east. From Tbilisi,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:58.090
the capital, it's about an hour and a
half, an hour and 45 minutes ride. Roads

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:02.870
are pretty good these days. Roads were
terrible 15 years ago. Things have

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:09.080
improved. Down to the site, Dmanisi is
just a few kilometers from the Armenian

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:20.110
border. This is the obligatory excavations
in progress slide. There are about four

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:25.780
meters of sedimentary deposits at Dmanisi.
Much of this stuff is volcanic in origin,

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:32.430
it's very ashy. There are some other
sediments and silts, but ash is always a

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:40.560
primary component which is a good thing.
The stratigraphy is complex, all of the

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:46.500
sediments are piled atop the Mashavera
basalt which is about 1.85 million years

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:52.090
old, that's the bottom of the site, the
earliest record, 1.85 million years is the

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:57.940
date obtained from radiometric
methodology. It is secure. The

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:05.130
stratigraphy at the site is complex
partially because there are a number of

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:11.350
piping features. Water was present near
the site during periods of heavy rain and

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:19.530
so on. Pipes formed underground and then
progressed through breaching to collapse

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:24.470
towards the surface filled with sediments
then got buried again. So it's been a

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:30.650
mess, it's been very hard to sort it out.
Our geologist, Reid Ferring, has done a

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:41.430
huge amount of work in this respect, huge
in the Trumpian since. But there have been

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:52.200
problems. The first traces of human
material were found at Dmanisi in 1991.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:57.240
Excavations in fact have been underway at
the site for quite a period of time before

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:04.820
that. The site is underneath an old
medieval town that was on the Silk Road.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:10.790
The archeologists were busy at Dmanisi for
some time poking around the foundations of

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:15.150
the old buildings and eventually they
began to dig up stuff that didn't seem to

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:22.650
belong there, not just the goats and fish
bones from medieval suppers, but things

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:28.040
that looked quite antique indeed. The
paleontologists came in and ascertain that

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:38.790
yes, the material was ancient, deeper
excavations got underway and in 1991, the

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:46.720
folks at Dmanisis were rewarded with this
jaw, the D211 mandible. It's remarkably

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.590
complete, not all of it is there. But what
there is remarkably well-preserved. It's a

00:30:52.590 --> 00:31:00.090
small jaw and in a number of respects, it
does look like Homo erectus. You've seen

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:07.040
one reference to this specimen already.
The teeth are about right for Homo erectus

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:13.450
as are the proportions of the mandible
itself. The cranium which turns out to be

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:22.100
the match to the little mandible was found
later in 1999, D2282 is a small cranium,

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:31.800
very small capacity, surprisingly so for
Homo erectus. Only a bit more than 650 CCs

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:38.580
in this case. Despite the small brain, the
thing does share a number of

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:48.930
characteristics with particularly early
African erectus. This hulk turned up at

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:57.380
the site in 2005. It's way down at the
bottom of the site and within a few days

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:02.370
after the fossil had been uncovered and
cleaning was underway prior to trying to

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:08.370
lift it out, there was a very heavy rain.
Things were very nearly washed out. Of

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:12.780
course we have a cover over the site,
there is protection, but it rained so much

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:18.320
and so long that water began to trickle in
around the sides of the excavations and

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:25.220
things were dicey for a while.
Fortunately, D4500 survived. There it is

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:35.100
all cleaned up. It turns out that the
cranium found in 2005 is a perfect match,

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:41.890
once again, to a mandible, D2600, which
had been found earlier in the year 2000.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:50.060
The upper and the lower, the cranium and
the mandible simply clicked together once

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:54.770
the stuff have been cleaned off, there was
no doubt at all. There is some pathology

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:59.330
on the mandible that matches, comparable
pathology in the region of the ear of the

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:08.210
cranium so there is no doubt about the
match. More than other Dmanisi hominins,

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:16.870
Skull 5, as this one is known, exhibits
very robust morphology. It's pretty

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:23.710
clearly a male individual. Determining sex
in the case of these fossil hominins is

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:30.320
often tricky, often can't be done very
accurately. But in this case, we think we

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:39.420
have a match, the skull says male all
over. Such a pattern given the fact that

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:48.370
it has the smallest brain of all the
Dmanisi hominins because it is unexpected.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:55.810
Normally for other primates, humans too of
course, but for primates, higher primates

00:33:55.810 --> 00:34:01.520
generally, males tend to exceed the
females in brain size by something like 8

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:10.310
to 10 to 15%. So, having the tiniest brain
attached to the most robust cranium and

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:22.080
jaw is a bit surprising. You can see that
there is a good deal of variation within

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.900
the Dmanisi assemblage. The little jaw
goes with a smallish brain case which is

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:37.790
quite gracile in its construction. We peg
that one Skull 2 as likely a female. Skull

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:44.610
5, on the other hand is much more robust,
clearly distinctive in a number of

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:54.180
respects. Number 1 is like Homo erectus,
number 4 is a small individual. That one

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:59.670
seems to have lived to a ripe old age
since it had lost almost its entire

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:05.380
dentition, maybe one tooth was still in
place at the time the individual died.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:10.460
That one may or may not be male, we're not
sure. Anyway, there is a great deal of

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:18.990
diversity at Dmanisi. The crania do look
different. This raises the question of

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:23.960
"How many species might be documented at
the site?" This is a question that's been

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:32.500
plaguing us for some time. I think myself
on the basis of the shared anatomy among

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:38.860
the Dmanisi individuals, they have a
common bow plan extending not just to the

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:44.420
cranial vault but to the face insofar as
we have it represented. And also to the

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:53.020
details of the cranial base suggest, the
common bow plan suggests that all of the

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:59.840
individuals are drawn from just one group.
We've done extensive resampling analysis

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:05.350
as well which cause us to come to the same
conclusion that really, in fact, the

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:11.140
skulls, the post-cranial remains that go
with them, are drawn from just one

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:17.050
population. Now there is stratigraphic
evidence relating to this question. It

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:22.160
doesn't solve the question of course, but
it's important information. It's good to

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:30.590
know that the material was all washed into
these deposits or arrived in the site by

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:36.690
one means or another at about the same
time that is the duration here can't be

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:42.390
more than a few hundred or perhaps a
thousand years or so according to the best

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:49.740
analyses conducted by the geological side
of the team. We'll say, then, that it's

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:55.640
very likely that the Dmanisi assemblage
samples a population belonging to a single

00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:00.320
species. I know there may be objections to
this. I'm sure there will be, there have

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:08.930
been in the past. If it's true, then such
a situation is quite rare. Of course, at

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:13.840
most localities where hominins are
discovered, you've heard a lot about East

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:22.710
Africa at this point, Koobi Fora, Olduvai.
Also at Sangiran in Java where there are a

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:28.130
number of fossils. The material is
scattered through a very long sequence of

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:35.970
deposits covering a long period in time.
Time as a contributor variation just

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:45.540
cannot be discounted. If the Dmanisi
fossils document what we can call a

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:51.740
population in the past extending over
quite a number of years of course, then

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:56.790
the next question, the next important
question is how the Dmanisi sample may

00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:04.320
relate to the hominin taxa that have
previously been recognized. Skill 5 of

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:13.110
course has a very small brain case, a very
large projecting face in the vault. Also

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:18.240
in the basal cranium, there are some
resemblances, not a lot, but some

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:26.010
resemblances to Homo erectus. Skull 3
which I have not shown you a picture of

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:32.650
before is the sub-adult from Dmanisi.
Skull 3 is pictured here down below. Skull

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:39.170
3 is similar to Homo habilis. This is true
for the bow ridge, the extended brow ridge

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:43.520
development. It's true particularly for
the shape of the vault, the rounding at

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:52.530
the back and for the mid-facial profile.
Skull 3, I must point out, is sub-adult so

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:57.160
we must allow for some extra growth to
have occurred if the individual had grown

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:03.800
up. It might have looked, had it grown up,
a bit more robust and a bit like the skull

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:13.920
to the left there, Homo habilis KNM-ER
1813. Skulls 2 and 4 also have their

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.470
peculiar aspects, of course. They have a
number of primitive characters that they

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:30.620
also share some features with Homo
habilis. So, which species? There is, as

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:39.130
I've pointed out, much variation within
the Dmanisi paleodeme. This is not an easy

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:46.450
question, the question as to which species
may be represented. Skull 5, the very

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:52.710
small brained and very robust and very
primitive looking individual does indeed

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:57.770
share some characters with
Australopithecus as well as Homo. So

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:04.550
perhaps in this case, the line, the
division between Australopithecus on the

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:12.750
one hand and earlier Homo on the other is
not so clear cut after all. Many of these

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.870
shared similarities are primitive
characters and unfortunately they don't

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:22.900
help us much in answering key questions
about phylogenetic affinities. Other

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:30.850
characters expressed in the Dmanisi
materials are Homo erectus-like and pretty

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:35.200
clearly they are specialized characters,
characters that have changed during the

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:42.050
course of evolution, characters that are
said to be derived. These characters

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:47.550
include the form of the brow ridge for
example which is larger and bar-like, a

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:54.340
little bit of midline, keeling on the
vault, details of temporal bone

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:59.750
construction, things of that sort on the
underside of the vault. Indeed, when

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:05.940
Skulls 1 and 2 were first described back
in the year 2000, they were grouped with

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:14.980
early Homo erectus from the Turkana basin.
If the fossils are included with Homo

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:19.850
erectus, clearly that's one way to deal
with the material is simply to lump it

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:26.980
with Homo erectus. If that is the course
we take, then it must be recognized that

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:34.110
the boundaries between Homo erectus on the
one hand and other early Homo taxa will

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:41.430
become less distinct. It will be
particularly difficult to distinguish

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:48.720
early Homo erectus, African Homo erectus
from specimens attributed to earlier Homo

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:56.680
to Homo habilis in particular. Homo
habilis is considered apart from Homo

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:05.910
rudolfensis. So, to sum up at this point,
here is again a speciose view of Hominin

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:13.810
phylogeny done by Bernard Wood with Meave
Leakey several years ago. You can read the

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:21.680
caution sign. To sum up then, there is
apparently no simple answer to the

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:28.440
question as to which species may be
represented at our site. Indeed this

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.900
question is often a tricky one. It's been
a hard one for paleoanthropologists to

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:43.500
deal with for a long time. In one view,
this view expressed on the slide, Dr. Wood

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:50.480
showed you another version of this very
spaciose hominin phylogeny. In that view

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:57.040
hominin evolution has produced a veritable
flowering of lineages over more than 6

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:04.490
million years. Such bushiness, as it were,
is particular evident for the 2.5 to 1

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:11.860
million year ago interval. This interval
in which Paranthropus on the one hand,

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:22.440
Australopithecus and Homo are represented
by multiple species for each group. At

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:28.820
Dmanisi the fossils seem clearly to be
Homo. Now there are some points of overlap

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:33.740
with Australopithecus as I pointed out,
but I would say unbalanced the evidence

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:39.270
favors grouping all of our fossils with
the genus Homo, very little doubt about

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:47.000
that. At the same time, the assemblage at
Dmanisi does not fall neatly into one of

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:55.370
the taxonomic packages that have been
proposed: Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis,

00:43:55.370 --> 00:44:02.870
Homo ergaster, Homo erectus and so on. If
I were pressed and I do feel pressed at

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:11.260
this point, given the morphological
resemblances of Dmanisi to both Homo

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:19.440
habilis in a very strict sense, just those
fossils allocated to Homo habilis, not to

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:26.300
Homo rudolfensis. Given the resemblances
of our material to Homo habilis, and to

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:33.580
early Homo erectus, particularly African
Homo erectus, I would probably argue, I

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:40.590
will argue, that it is most reasonable to
place all of these fossils within a single

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:49.210
evolutionary species. I would say that the
Dmanisi fossils constitute just one

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:57.850
population within this unbranched lineage.
Now, this is not to raise the specter of

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:03.680
just one species at a time, or to suggest
that there isn't a great deal of diversity

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:09.080
in the hominin record, clearly there was
particularly in that interval after, about

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:17.110
2.5 million years. But as far as our
evidence is concerned, it seems to me the

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:23.320
best way to go, simply to place all the
fossils within one evolutionary species.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.460
Then of course we'd have to argue about
what to call it, but this is not the place

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:32.417
for that. So, with that, thanks for
listening. Thanks very much.

00:45:33.345 --> 00:45:36.345
♪ [music] ♪

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.770
- [Pascal] Thanks very much for this great
afternoon, to all the speakers. I'm

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:50.420
especially grateful to Dan Lieberman for
having set the stage with a lot of carnage

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.370
and meat-eating, because the molecules I
talk about today have to do with

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:58.420
vertebrates and what we eat and what
happens to it in our bodies. So this

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:03.540
afternoon I'd like to share an idea about
a way that a molecule could be driving

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:10.810
speciation and share some evidence for it
in Vigo [sp], not in primates but in mice.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.720
I like to start with by acknowledging the
people who've done some of the heavy

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.580
lifting, including Fang Ma who's back in
Chengdu, a former lab member and Darius

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:22.530
Ghaderi and my team here especially Stevan
Springer and Miriam Cohen, as well as my

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:28.620
collaborators, Ajit Varki and his team.
The kelp there in the background is

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:33.660
actually an analogy I use when I talk
about the glycocalyx. Every living life,

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:40.130
every living cell has a sugar coat called
glycocalyx which consist of glycolipids

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:45.050
and glycoprotiens that completely cover
the cell and give it its molecular

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:50.310
identity. These molecules swing around
very much like the kelp in the ocean right

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:57.550
here. And if we make ourselves hundreds of
millions of times smaller and land on a

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:01.620
cell, one of my favorite cells, a
mammalian sperm cell, we would see

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.170
something that reminds us of one of these
kelp forests. These are the glycolipids

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:11.780
and glycoproteins. All of them share short
sugar chains on them, each little sugar is

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:17.520
about one nanometer big. And what they
share is that most of these chains

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:24.460
terminate in a sugar coat sialic acid that
helps define the identity of the cell type

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:30.170
and it tells the body that this is a self
cell. So sialic acid can be thought of as

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:36.680
a very potent self signal. You can
visualize them here with an antibody and

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.400
you see the entire surface of the sperm,
it's payload so to speak is the haploid

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.340
genome in blue. And the surface of the
sperm is completely covered in sialic

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:51.820
acid. To go back to the kelp analogy,
macrocystis kelp has these big terminal

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.990
bulbs that help it float and it defines
the outer edge, the molecular frontier of

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:02.370
every cell, that's what you can think of
as sialic acids. They're very important

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:06.450
because they're telling the body that this
is self and they play a role in

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:12.370
fertilization, in gestation, in
development including during pregnancy.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:17.550
Peter Medawar many years ago coined the
phrase "immunological paradox of mammalian

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:23.020
pregnancy" where a female, a mother, is
gestating an individual that is

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:28.850
genetically not identical to her within
her body, in a very intimate contact. The

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:33.550
interface between the fetal cells of the
trophoblast and the mother includes these

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:40.380
sialic acids, these sugar molecules found
on cell surfaces of all vertebrates. This

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:46.060
matters, it can be quite dramatic. This
young fellow here was born in 1963 and he

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:52.550
had a problem; his mother was type O, had
a lot of antibodies against type A blood.

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:57.970
And they had a former son and his father
was type A. So what happened during the

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:02.540
pregnancy is that the antibodies that his
mother were making passed through the

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:07.910
placenta and almost killed him. He was
born with massive hemolytic disease of the

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:11.830
newborn that had only been described a
couple of years earlier. And it's only

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.470
because he was given two complete blood
transfusions that he can stand here today

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:22.660
and give a talk. So sugars and mismatches
of sugars are really important. But I

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:26.390
would like to propose that there is
another immunological paradox and it's the

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:32.770
one about mammalian fertilization. How do
sperm manage to survive this journey from

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:38.230
insemination to the place of fertilization
way up in the ampulla of the oviduct? If

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:43.450
you think back, when you were a sperm, the
reproductive tract of your mother was

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:51.480
about the equivalent of six kilometers,
we're back to running. Of course, hundreds

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:56.330
of millions of potential you's were
inseminated, but only one made it up all

00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:01.250
the way to the ampulla. And that is partly
due to a massive influx of immune cells of

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:06.840
the mother upon insemination that take out
and actively kill, potentially select,

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.020
most of the sperm. Only a few hundreds
make it to the oviduct where they

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:15.510
capacitate, they start sprinting,
galloping and one of them meets the egg

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:23.160
and fertilizes it. So, females may be
scrutinizing and even selecting sperm. Why

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.170
would they do that? Well, one thing they
might have to look out for is, is it the

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:32.030
correct species? Male mammals are quite
famous for trying to mate with anything

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:38.260
that is shaped roughly like that. But the
female might be interested in some read

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:42.840
out of the fitness of the male who made
the sperm or in the fact that the male is

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:47.480
genetically compatible also more
importantly that the sperm is still

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:54.120
functional. Wasting one precious egg on a
sperm that already lost its acrosome and

00:50:54.120 --> 00:51:00.880
is not fit to make a surviving embryo
would be a terrible waste. So, I come back

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:06.300
to the sialic acid on the surface of cells
and in most mammals, the two most common

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:11.350
sialic acids are called N-acetylneuraminic
acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid, AC and

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:17.250
GC for short. What is interesting is that
there's an enzyme the modifies AC to GC

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:22.960
and humans are natural knock outs. This is
work by Ajit Varki's laboratory that over

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:28.410
the last 15 years has found the mechanism.
We are knock out for a gene that was an

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:33.290
insertion of a selfish piece of DNA that
destroyed the gene. We cannot make the GC

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:38.000
anymore. All of us in this room are pure
AC on our cell surfaces. So the cell

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.390
surface of a human differs dramatically
from that of most other mammals. So with

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:48.250
all our close living ape relatives, we
share AC. But because of a mutation that

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:53.900
is quite well-timed with three different
methods using coalescence, molecular clock

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:58.410
and the type of element that is present,
we know that this mutation happened

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:03.770
between 2 and 3 million years ago. And we
know that it causes us to only have one

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:09.200
type of sugar on our cell surface, of
sialic acid. Now you'd think it's a tiny,

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:15.160
tiny change in DNA, why could this be a
big deal? I haven't mentioned that your

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:20.280
average cell has tens to hundreds of
millions of this molecule. So a tiny

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:25.970
change in your DNA changes the flavor, the
molecular flavor of your cells in a big

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:31.210
way. A human cell would appear in one
flavor and a non-human cell in a

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:35.380
completely different flavor. What could
have driven this? You're looking at a

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:39.630
model of a cell surface of a red blood
cell which make up over 80% of all your

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:43.620
cells. And they're targeted by some of the
most important pathogens that we know for

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:49.300
human kind such as falciparum, malaria.
This molecule encircled is glycophorin A

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:55.440
that carries a lot of sialic acid which
malaria uses to get into the host. So a

00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:00.260
couple of years back with Ajit, we
commented on the fact that it is known

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:06.380
that the apes that still make most of our
great ape cousins sick, they use sialic

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:11.110
acid that we don't have anymore. They
cannot infect us. So, one possible driving

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:15.930
force for the loss of this sugar initially
might have been to escape a pathogen such

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:21.170
as an ancestral malaria. We got a nice
break. Unfortunately, much, much later in

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:26.940
the Neolithic with agriculture and the
expansion of Anopheles mosquito species,

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:31.470
malaria caught up with us with a vengeance
and is now highly specific for the sugar

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:38.360
we have on human cells. Now,
interestingly, as we've heard somewhere

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:43.610
along the line to Homo, we became top
predators and we regularly engage in

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:47.970
hunting or scavenging or a combination of
both. And when you eat this non-human

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:53.340
sugar, you actually incorporate it and you
start making an immune reaction to it. So

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.920
after having lost the sugar, we started
getting regularly immunized to it and

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:03.890
making antibodies. And there is ongoing
work showing that this is incorporated, is

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:09.050
relevant for modern Homo sapiens, all of
us who eat red meat which is the biggest

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:13.580
source of this non-human sugar, continue
to immunize ourselves and to incorporate

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:19.540
it. So several years back, we asked,
"Well, could it be that if sperm differs

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:24.340
so dramatically that a change in cell
surface sugars could actually have been

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:28.420
involved in this reproductive
incompatibility that I was unlucky enough

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:32.450
to suffer from when I was born? That was
ABO blood groups, very unusual, a rare

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:37.290
case. But this would have been a very
powerful point, a way to immunize the

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:41.690
mother against the sugar she doesn't have.
Could this have been involved, this

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:48.010
mutation? The fixation of it, could that
have been driven? Could that have driven

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:54.600
the speciation along the lineage to modern
Homo? So one thing we could do at the time

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:59.320
is obtain chimpanzee sperm in a
non-invasive fashion. I shall not go into

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:05.890
details. And expose those chimpanzee sperm
to human serum with antibodies and show

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:10.400
that they die. But the reverse is not
true. We could also show that compliment

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:15.700
gets deposited on sperm. It seems to be an
antibody-driven killing mechanism in human

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:21.350
serum. Luckily by then, there was a model
mouse that carried the same mutation that

00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:26.430
we humans carry. You can see that the
wild-type mouse has the non-human sialic

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:32.870
acid on its sperm, the knock out mouse
doesn't. And so we said, "Well, let's use

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:37.110
these mice to prove whether this mechanism
could function." And we could show that

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:42.910
yes, the immunized mice would make
antibodies that stick to the sperm. The

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:46.730
two groups of females, we mated with
different males, had similar comparable

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:50.970
levels. And there were antibodies very
importantly in the female reproductive

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:57.770
tract of these mice. So, that would be a
way to model female immunity being hostile

00:55:57.770 --> 00:56:04.410
to the ancestral molecule. And after
hundreds of mating experiments,

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:08.970
effectively the only group of pairings
where there was a 30% reduction in

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:14.990
fertility was with females lacking a
sugar, making antibodies against a sugar

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:22.690
that was on sperm that was mismatched.
Now, 30% reduction in fertility, is that

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:28.220
important? Could that drive speciation?
And this is where Stevan Springer came in

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:33.910
and came up with an instantaneous model of
selection with pay-off matrices of all

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:39.680
possible combination between the genotypes
of males and females. Interestingly, this

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.050
process could not start by sexual
selection. This is a type of sexual

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:49.500
selection, female immunity, punishing
sperm for carrying the wrong sugar. But if

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:55.360
a pathogen were to introduce and favor the
mutation, very quickly as the frequency of

00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.280
the mutation rises in the females, males
get rewarded by also losing the sugar

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:05.150
because they gain compatibility. And after
a certain moment, you can cross a

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:10.650
threshold from negative selection in
females, in pink, to a net positive

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:14.470
selection in black. In males, as soon as
there is enough females that lack the

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:19.890
sugar, it is worth losing the sugar. So
that should gain compatibility. We modeled

00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:29.190
the effect of both the degree of
incompatibility and promiscuity and it

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:35.590
showed that with a promiscuity of about
three matings per ovulation. So a female

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:40.160
would have to mate between two and five
males for each egg. And a frequency of

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:46.640
only about 0.4% which is 1 in 25 females
will be homozygous. This process would

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:52.660
become a directional selection fixing the
allele. So in a cartoon version, the idea

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:57.140
is that pathogens are prominently driving
the sugars on your cell surfaces, that's

00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:01.830
why we have blood groups. But usually
these changes go back and forth. And they

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:06.670
generate selection that oscillates and
results in polymorphisms that do not fix.

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:13.260
But if this process comes on the sexual
selection via female antibodies against

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:18.280
molecules on the sperm, you have
directional selection that rapidly fixes

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:23.820
the loss of functional mutation. So what
we propose might have happened somewhere

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:29.310
in the past and possibly at the beginning
of the genus Homo is a very important

00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:35.190
pathogen driving changes in the glycocalyx
of the host. Some of the hosts would have

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:40.950
been homozygous. They would have looked
very different. The females by virtue of

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:45.380
their new mode of life with much hunting
and contact with other animal products

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:49.520
would have been immunized against this
sugar. That immunity also protected them

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:55.120
from infection from these bugs, but it
would preclude optimal compatibility with

00:58:55.120 --> 00:59:00.200
males that still had the ancestral
molecule, eventually driving apart two

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:06.160
populations even within the same sympatric
environment. So as a model for sympatric

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:12.840
speciation of ancestral hominids. The hope
now is to get fossil material to actually

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:19.280
look for incorporated monosaccharides as
far back as 3 or 4 million years and find

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.630
out which lineages still have both sugars
as opposed to which lineages already had

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:27.440
just one sugar and would make a better
candidate for our ancestors.

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.209
Thank you very much.
