00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.570
ANN: I'm here to
introduce Max Gladstone.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.850
When Max came to audition
for the writers group

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.730
that we are now both
a part of, my hopes

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.730
were not particularly high.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.500
We'd had a couple
of folks try out,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.640
and their writing was mediocre
and, more importantly,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.350
their critiquing style was
very soft and very bland.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.120
"Oh, I liked this story a lot.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.210
It's really nice."

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.520
The unofficial motto
of our writers group

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.530
is that we're cruel
because we care.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.630
And Max fit right in.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.080
He was a magnificent contrast
to the previous people

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.890
that we'd had.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.980
His story was nothing like
anything we'd read before.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.950
There was no trite retelling
of "The Wheel of Time".

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.070
There were no Isaac
Asimov knockoffs.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.970
And his crits were brutal
in the best possible way.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.100
He would tell you that your
magic system was not coherent.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.340
It didn't make sense.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.880
But without going into
the Brandon Sand--

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.482
Sandenburg?

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:08.190
Yes, there we go.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.070
SPEAKER 1: Sanderson.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.440
ANN: Brandon Sanderson level
of, "and the magic system

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.550
is the whole story."

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.010
This weekend, he critted
one of my stories

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.440
and I ended it and
I put, holy crap,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.660
I didn't realize I had
that many problems.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.720
Oh, this is awesome.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.430
It's like having a readability
reviewer for your prose.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.020
Max has readability.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.450
He crits our work,
without a linter,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.170
for style, for content, for
repetition, and ultimately,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.420
for originality.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.900
Max takes his stories
and he'll find two

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
completely disparate things,
like economics and blood magic,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.820
and shove them together.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.010
And the net result
is that we end up

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.600
with something like
"The Craft" verse,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.610
where we all really
enjoy what we're

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.310
reading because we've
never read it before,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.137
but it has all of
the bits and pieces

00:01:58.137 --> 00:02:00.720
that we're already familiar with
so we don't sit there and go,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.870
I am confused, and
instead you go,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.790
what's going to happen next?

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.940
And so on that note, my friend
and also an excellent author,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.682
Max Gladstone.

00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:16.162
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.100
MAX GLADSTONE: Thanks so much.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.840
When Ann started talking
about the first meeting

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.040
that I was at BRAWL, I
suddenly remembered--

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.510
because I'd never had any
experience with doing a fiction

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.570
critique in the way that it's
typically done in the science

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.850
fiction fantasy circles before.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.250
I had done a couple of
fiction classes in college.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.700
I wrote a lot on my own.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.660
And I had bashed around a bunch
of fanfiction with friends.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.120
So when I sat down
to read the stories,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.700
I got out the red pen
was going line by line

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.770
with the crosses and the
circles and the arrows

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.470
and the this is that, and
is that, is that, is that?

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.960
And it's amazing that
you guys didn't just

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.470
set me on fire after the
ends of that meeting, but.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.140
It was enormously helpful, also.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.030
I thought I might read a little
bit from the beginning of Ruin

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.870
of Angels," which is the sixth
book in The Craft Sequence

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.340
series, which my agent continues
to groan whenever I describe

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.020
it that way.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.830
I tell him, they're
different things.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.900
They're different things.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.540
A series is the
sum of a sequence.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.870
And then he told me that
the next time he sends out

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.880
a book of mine on
submission, he's

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.170
going to just replace the bio
with, "Max writes some stuff."

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.970
So fair deal.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.480
Power relationships in
everything, I guess.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.550
So I'm going to read the
first chapter and then

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.440
a bit of the second
chapter, that I imagine

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.900
you guys might get a
kick out of, and talk

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.380
a little bit about the books,
about where the ideas are

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.450
coming from and
where they're going,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.415
open it up for questions,
and hopefully we

00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:53.290
can have a nice chat.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.980
Chapter one.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.990
Ley built her sandcastle
below the tide line.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.760
Kai warned her, of course.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.550
What else was an
older sister for?

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.970
When Ley chose her spot
and planted her flag,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.800
Kai said, "It will drown."

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.519
That last word tugged at her,
as if it left a hook in her lip.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.470
She almost apologized,
but stopped herself.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.540
Drown was the right word.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.100
You couldn't avoid words
just because they hurt.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.320
When Ley sculpted the
gap-toothed ramparts of her

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.840
keep, like castles from the
kind of Schwarzwald fairy tale

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.020
picture books where
kids got eaten,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.640
Kai said, "You see, that's
the tide line up there,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.770
where the seaweed's drying."

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.440
When Ley carved a curtain wall
with a bright blue trowel,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.210
packing wet sand
between her palms,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.670
Kai said, "Your wall's too
thin to keep the water out."

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.860
"It's not to keep the
water out," Ley said.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.470
"It's to keep out our enemies."

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.080
"You don't have enemies."

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.680
Ley shrugged and dug her moat.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.270
Mom wasn't there to help.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.980
Today was a mourning day.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.830
She'd gone with her sisters
to Kai's father's grave

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.350
to paint her face with
ashes and sit naked, alone,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.720
until the tears came.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.030
She had grieved with her
children, noble and sharp

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.910
in mourning white, the day the
bearers brought her husband

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.510
home.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.170
She stood chin out, brow
high, eyes bright and black,

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.170
impassive as a Penitent
on the outside.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.800
Each body holds multitudes,
the old songs sang.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.300
As a mother, she
helped her children

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.070
mourn their shipwrecked father.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.760
As a wife, as a woman, as
someone who had lost a friend,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.300
she needed time alone to break.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.760
She left Kai in charge
because Kai was older

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.770
and because Kai didn't
set things on fire just

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.370
to see what color they burned.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.970
But Ley only had
the vaguest grasp

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.950
of the meaning of the
phrase "in charge,"

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.990
and Kai knew better
than to test her younger

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.850
sister on this point.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.300
She still had bruises from
the last time she tried.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.820
So Kai left Ley to work
and climbed the beach

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.450
to build her own castle
clear of the coming waves.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.410
The sand was drier here
and didn't pack as well,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.599
so she brought a halved
coconut shell to the surf,

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.640
filled it with water, and
carried it up the beach

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.290
to moisten the sand.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.570
She built a spreading
bay city like Kavekana,

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.820
with a mountain behind
it like Kavekana'ai,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.580
and studded the shoreline
with pebble statue Penitents

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.610
watching seaward for the
return of long-gone gods.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.500
Heroes.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.779
Fathers.

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:26.320
Each time she went
back to the ocean,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.310
her sister's city had grown.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.370
Ley excavated alleys
with her fingertips

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.940
and cut decorations on rooftops
with a sliver of bamboo.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.500
From above, her city
looked intricate

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.070
as a Craftwork diagram or
a work of high theology.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.200
Ley, kneeling, brooded
in her swimsuit,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.880
brows low as if to cut off
the half of the world that

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.100
didn't concern her--

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.550
the beach, the volcano
rising inland, her sister.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.460
She bit her lower
lip as she worked.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.250
"You have to do
something," Kai said.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.930
She chose her words carefully.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.550
That was the joy of words--

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.340
you could control them
when all else failed.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.820
"Or the whole thing
will fall down."

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.280
Up the beach, bigger kids
shouted and screamed.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.080
A pale-skinned
Iskari tourist girl

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.540
dove to return a volleyball
serve and fountained sand

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.740
where she fell.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.920
The sea lay calm to the
horizon, but no one swam.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.910
The red flag was up
today, gallowglass

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.010
swarming beneath the water with
their long, stinging tendrils,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.360
though they could not
be seen from shore.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.610
White sails bellied on the bay.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.440
Cutters and dinghies
and barques wheeled

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.420
in defiance of the
massive container ships

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.600
moored near West Claw,
at the deepwater port.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.820
"You weren't listening."

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.560
Ley didn't look up.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.640
Fine.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.890
Kai Let Ley build
her doomed city.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.330
Kai marched back up the beach.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.760
She added houses to her
island and dug its bay deep

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.830
for the tide,
rolling in, to fill.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.840
Standing, she judged it good.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.171
Then she turned back.

00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:51.522
Ley's metropolis
sprawled on shore.

00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:53.980
She'd worked out in a spiral
from that central keep, spread

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.740
townhouses and factories,
extended her lanes as she

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.660
came around to them again.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.939
Kai knew the world she
had built from sand,

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.980
but she knew Ley's world,
too, though she'd never

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.480
seen it before.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.570
Those broad thoroughfares with
the divided roads and sidewalks

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.860
were commercial streets--

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.360
no, processional
boulevards, down

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.550
which ancient emperors
once marched in triumph,

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.440
bookended by arches.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.649
There were palaces there
high temples, here a factory.

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:19.690
To the north, alleys grew
so narrow Ley could not

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.981
have made them with her
fingers, must have dredged them

00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:23.380
with her bamboo strip.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.750
She had found a dream
city inside them both

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.720
and made it real.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.420
And the tide rolled in.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.200
Ley's hands didn't stop.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.570
The rest of her knelt rigid
beside the districts she

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.450
shaped, while her thin fingers
carved and built and stroked

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.059
sand smooth.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.650
Kai grabbed her coconut
shell, ran below Ley's city,

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.560
and started to build a wall.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.470
She built artlessly because
art was not the point.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.510
She did not know why
Ley ignored her, why she

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.490
made this weird, familiar city.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.250
She did not know why Ley left
glittering traces of her soul

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.410
in the ramparts
beneath her fingers.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.850
But she suspected.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.160
She could have asked Ley,
taken her by the shoulders

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.470
and shaken her and
screamed until she

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.870
stopped and tried to explain.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.110
But Ley's face reminded Kai
of Mom's in-morning white,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.450
and the words she might say
if Kai forced her to speak

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.080
were words Kai knew she
could not bear to hear.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.060
So she built the wall.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.760
With her hands, she built it,
with her own surging shoulders

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.180
and legs, with Mom's thick
fingers and Dad's fierce grit.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.070
She gutted the sand
with her coconut shell.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.200
The sun burned her eyes
and warmed her skin

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.630
and covered her with sweat.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.160
"Boy!"

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.284
a voice called to her in
Iskari from up the beach--

00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:34.850
the volleyball girl, drunk,
in a white bathing suit.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.110
"Boy, you can't stop the tide."

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.550
Kai ignored the girl, whose
friends shushed her and tried

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.860
to explain.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.420
Kai's wall was more of a hill,
really, with a moat behind it

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.250
deep as Kai was tall.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.440
She judged the wall's
height against the tide line

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.810
and started to curve upslope
to guard the outer edges

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.040
of Ley's city.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.990
She sweat and trembled.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.250
There wasn't time.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.100
She couldn't close the eastern
wall before the tide rolled in.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.930
She knew this and
did not let herself

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.170
know, because if she knew,
she would have stopped trying.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.060
An audience gathered
up the beach, tourists

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.660
and other monsters drawn by the
two girls striving in the sand.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.340
A skeleton in a
flower-print shirt

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.810
watched them,
rolling a newspaper

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.310
into a tighter and
tighter cylinder

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.000
between his fingerbones.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.260
Kai ignored them
and kept fighting.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.660
The water rose as
she built the wall.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.270
Every wash of surf bore
more sand from the wall

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.665
back out into the deep.

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:26.780
Kai wasn't padding
the sands down now,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.210
just digging it, tossing
it up, and hoping.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.190
Behind her, a wave
splashed into the moat.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.410
Wet sand stuck to Kai's feet.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.220
She sank.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.390
The wall cracked.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.820
Salt rivers poured in and
soaked her to her waist.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.710
The north wall sloughed
into the water.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.200
Kai scrambled to shore it
up, but the next rushing wave

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.610
tore her feet from under her.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.710
She went down in a
tangle of limbs and foam.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.710
Waves and crosscurrents
tossed her, tumbled her,

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.900
and she spilled from
the moat onto the beach.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.390
She spat out saltwater and
sand, and when she recovered,

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.530
she looked back,
expecting disaster.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.030
But Ley's city stood.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.805
The waves covered
it and drained way

00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:02.180
through carved
alleys that should

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.240
have collapsed like Kai's wall.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.620
Ley stared down through
the water and to the wash,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.930
and her city did not die.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.529
Ley's soul shimmered
in the sand.

00:11:11.529 --> 00:11:13.070
She had built herself
into this city,

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.137
mixing soulstuff into
the sand with water.

00:11:15.137 --> 00:11:16.970
And now she stood above
the world she'd made

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.190
and willed it real
against the waves.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.600
The sand held its shape.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.430
The city sank, but stayed.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.670
It would not break
while she had breath.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.840
Ley rose like a goddess over her
creation as the tide rolled in.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.460
She stretched out her hands
as if to calm the waves,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.680
and for a moment, Kai
believed they might obey.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.990
Then Ley fell, screaming,
into the dirty water.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.720
She gasped surf, gagged,
choked, disappeared

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.255
in the wash and foam.

00:11:43.255 --> 00:11:45.500
Kai ran into the water,
caught her flailing sister

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.940
around her shoulders, and
dragged her to dry sand.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.610
Ley coughed up fluid,
screamed again,

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.050
though she had no breath.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.720
A white phosphorescent
thread wound around her leg,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.830
menacing and tiny--

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.140
a gallowglass tendril,
torn free and sent

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.720
drifting on the tide
in search of a victim.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.880
Probably not fatal.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.560
Kai gloved her hands
in a gob of seaweed

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.510
and pulled the tendril free.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.130
Snot ran from Ley's nose.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.380
Her eyes rolled white
behind slitted lids.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.960
She breathed deep and fast.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.190
Venom leaked through
Kai's makeshift glove

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.470
and burned her palm.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.600
With the tendril gone,
Ley stopped screaming

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.850
but didn't open her eyes.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.220
Kai slung her sister's
arm over her shoulder

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.000
and pushed up with her legs.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.450
She took three steps
and stumbled into water.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.160
Building the wall
had exhausted her.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.080
She could not take Ley's weight.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.590
She ground her teeth and
tried to will herself upright.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.020
She stood, too fast.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.850
Someone else held
Ley's other side--

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.350
the Iskari girl in the white
suit, the one who'd called her.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.010
"Boy," she said again in
Iskari, "what was she doing?"

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.060
Kai hadn't expected
that question.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.060
She didn't think the
Iskari expected it, either.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.200
She was scared of screams.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.130
That was all.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.350
She didn't know why Ley fell.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.320
Easy to see she'd never suffered
a gallowglass sting before.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.210
A gallowglass would
leave a bright red scar

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.520
on that sharp pale skin.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.860
The girl was embarrassed,
like tourists sometimes

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.330
felt when they helped
or even noticed locals,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.310
and talking to cover her nerves.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.680
"Playing," Kai replied
in the girl's language

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.900
and didn't correct her
about the other part.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.030
The girl helped her
carry Ley upslope.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.820
The crowd drew back as they
approached, clearing space

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.290
on the boardwalk.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.900
They set Ley down carefully
beside a discarded resort

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.070
brochure.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.770
The skeleton watched them both
from behind ruby spectacles,

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.325
newspapers still
clutched in his hand.

00:13:27.325 --> 00:13:28.700
He could have done
something, Kai

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.020
thought, a Craftsman like that.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.616
All the power in the world
at his beck and call.

00:13:32.616 --> 00:13:34.490
Lightnings danced when
he crooked his finger.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.190
He could have stopped
the pain at once.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.420
He adjusted his
spectacles instead.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.190
A lifeguard shouldered
through the crowd.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:47.270
The girl asked, "Why did she
stay when the tide rolled in?"

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.680
Kai didn't answer.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.020
The lifeguard bent low,
took a charm from his neck,

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.640
and applied it to the sting.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.380
Blood seeped through torn
skin, but at the charm's touch,

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.720
Ley's flesh calmed.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.010
Blood stilled.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:02.360
Ley stopped shaking and
drew her first even breath.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.510
"She wanted to
save it," Kai said.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.430
Her voice hooked after "save."

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.800
Speaking Iskari forced
her to gender the pronoun,

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.410
and she wasn't sure
whether she chose right.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.120
She remembered
Ley's expression, so

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.610
like Mom's, unwavering
and fierce as pallbearers

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.050
approached their gate.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.080
She could have said, save him.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.850
Behind her, the sun
set and the tide

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.380
rolled up, the ocean at ease as
if it had never killed a man.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.160
The parapets and pinnacles
of Ley's city melted.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.650
Its arches seeped
out into the deep.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.820
Saltwater filled
Kai's model bay,

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.480
and her tiny
Penitents stared out

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.390
over the flat, poisoned sea.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.640
"Save what?" the girl asked.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.230
But Kai wasn't sure.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.010
And if she knew,
she would not say.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:50.510
So chapter 2 starts about
20 years later, give or take

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.920
a bit.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.850
Who would break into a
bank to leave something?

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.920
The practice is more common
than one might think,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.336
though practitioners'
motives tend

00:14:59.336 --> 00:15:02.660
to involve eventually removing
more than they originally left.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.240
You might duck the banks
wards, dodge its constructs

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.800
and revenants and
demonic and even

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.250
sometimes living human guards,
evade its detection magics,

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.730
dance across its
pressure plate floor,

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.440
answer ye its riddles three,
and leave a beacon glyph

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.090
to guide tunnelers,
or a mechanism that

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.256
would disable all that
security during a later, more

00:15:19.256 --> 00:15:20.597
forceful raid.

00:15:20.597 --> 00:15:22.430
A simple listening
device in the right place

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.460
could yield the intelligence
to corner or crash a market

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.920
or make a small substantial
killing, literal

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.450
or metaphorical.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.270
But few people would break into
a bank just to leave something,

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.570
and fewer still would
break in to leave a letter.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.680
So while the mailroom of Iskari
First Imperial in Agdel Lex

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.720
noticed that the vellum envelope
that appeared in their priority

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.610
delivery box one
workday morning,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.620
sealed with blood-colored
wax and the impression

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.897
of a wolfsbane flower, lacked
the customary sender's marks,

00:15:48.897 --> 00:15:50.480
the demon on duty
believed this merely

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.770
an administrative oversight.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.140
Mortals.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.859
Honestly.

00:15:55.859 --> 00:15:58.025
If the letter needed shipping
to the Shining Empire,

00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:59.800
or west across the
sea to Alt Coulumb,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.544
or even north to
Telomere, the demon

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:02.960
would have wasted
precious minutes

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.790
hunting down the
relevant admin so as

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.870
to bill the postage properly.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.650
But an envelope for internal
delivery needed no postage.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.840
Even so, the demon hissed
and pondered taking

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.180
bloody, demonstrative action.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.760
She'd warned the admin pool
against using priority flags

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.750
for internal mail.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.400
In-building post
went round hourly,

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.020
and while some
market developments

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.030
did need immediate
response, once you

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.920
let people flag
intraoffice mail, even

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.600
inane check-ins
mysteriously ended up

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.710
marked "triple urgent."

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.469
A little bloodshed ought to
help clarify the situation.

00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:34.010
The mail demon
consulted the building

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.920
register and found-- odd--
the recipient unlisted.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.260
Perhaps it was meant for
outside delivery after all?

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.750
But no address or postage.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.120
She closed her many eyes
and replayed in her mind,

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.030
as her therapist had suggested,
a comforting series of human

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.520
screams, starting with
a 10 on the pain scale

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.140
and counting down.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.900
That relaxed her
enough for work.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.410
Then she checked the guest
list and realized her mistake.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.460
Kai Pohala, whoever
she was, was only

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.451
visiting the office
for a single day.

00:17:00.451 --> 00:17:02.450
The message's sender
couldn't meet her in person

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.940
and wanted to be sure the
letter arrived before she left.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:05.880
Sensible.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.430
Saved postage, even.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.557
No one need die today.

00:17:09.557 --> 00:17:12.140
Though you never could tell when
a bleak morning at the office

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.654
might look up.

00:17:14.654 --> 00:17:17.480
Thank you.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.520
So the book had
been out for a week

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.730
when somebody sent me a
message on Twitter saying,

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.000
just so you know, I sent
the mail demon portion

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.730
to one of the guys
who wrote "Sendmail."

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.530
And then I died a
little bit of joy.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.130
So yes.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.470
The Craft Sequence is one of
those threads in a sweater

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.200
that you start pulling and
then the entire sweater

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.180
starts to unravel after you.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.850
That's kind of how the
sequence has built itself.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.690
Back in 2008, I'd recently
returned from teaching in China

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.410
and was looking for work when,
basically, the world economy

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.510
tripped and fell
into a wood chipper.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.720
And as I was trying
to piece what

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.840
was going on together and
spending a lot of time

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.090
wandering around Harvard Law
School, where my wife was

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.280
a student at the
time, and sneaking

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.600
into student seminars
that had been formed

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.350
with exactly that
question in mind-- like,

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.120
what just happened?

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.240
And as I started seeing
more and more professors

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.970
drop out or fly
off to Washington

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.249
because, oh my god, the
American financial system

00:18:25.249 --> 00:18:26.540
is in the middle of a collapse.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.190
We need to do something
about this right now,

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.610
I kind of got this
sense that we were

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.760
going through an enormous
apocalyptic moment.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.610
But you couldn't exactly
walk down to New York

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.290
and find the
smoking crater where

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.610
Lehman Brothers used to be.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.120
You couldn't say,
here is the ruin

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.580
of AIG in shatters and
shards upon the mountainside

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.010
like the Balrog in
"Lord of the Rings."

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.950
It was all happening on
a kind of spiritual plane

00:18:54.950 --> 00:19:00.170
of existence, on a realm of
contracts and ideas and images.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:04.760
And from there, I kept pulling.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:10.460
A the more I learned, the more
I reached for my arch trad-nerd,

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.850
"Dungeons and Dragons"
vocabulary to start describing

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.480
what was going on, and also
the religious work that I had

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.700
studied--

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.100
that I'd learned
from my parents, too.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.160
We have a vocabulary, a very
long-standing vocabulary,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.580
for dealing with enormous,
invisible forces that

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.500
guard our destiny, and
it's the vocabulary

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.660
of magic and religion.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.230
And so much of what changes
the material conditions

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.400
of our lives these days
transpires in a world

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.690
that we can't touch or
feel but is, nevertheless,

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.810
the same world.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.320
It's a world that sort of
directly affects us, directly

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:44.880
shapes us.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.550
It's not this dualist separation
that we sometimes talk

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.660
about in philosophy, depending
on our particular bent.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.520
So it started off with
that-- this notion

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.340
that you have bankruptcies that
work a lot like necromancy.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.050
You have corporations
and governments

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.790
that work a lot like gods.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.910
You have people who work in--

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.980
especially now that
you have a modern model

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.130
corporation with a
mission statement

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.290
or a set of collective
ideals that everybody

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.410
is attempting to strive
for, at least in theory.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.600
It starts to resemble
a priesthood,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.210
or it starts to think of
itself as a priesthood,

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.210
depending on who
you're talking to--

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.340
the sense of corporate
mission or the sense

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.010
of governmental mission.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.100
And then you have,
obviously, the people

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.100
who are coming in to pray, the
people who are coming in to use

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.930
or to participate
or whose lives are

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.150
formed by the decisions that are
made inside the big cathedral

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.650
building.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.390
So once I had those threads,
"Three Parts Dead," which

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.540
is about basically a bankruptcy
proceeding that's taking place

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:54.210
on a dead god in a
hope of "fixing" him

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:58.770
before his city starts to
fall apart, took shape.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:03.600
But the more I pulled on that
thread, the more connected

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.610
it seems to the
fabric of what it

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.730
means to be aware and
alive and operating

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.570
in the early 21st century.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.450
And this is where
I say things that

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.535
start to get me a
little bit in trouble.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.960
If you go back to look at 1950s
and '60s classic golden age

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.346
science fiction,
people anticipated

00:21:28.346 --> 00:21:29.970
that we would be
living in a world that

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.580
had many of the conveniences
and many of the powers

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.630
that our world now has.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.350
We have regular flights up
to resupply the International

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.310
Space Station.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.910
There is, in fact, a
kind of Heinlein-esque

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.530
or self-styled
Heinlein-esque individual

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.830
building private space
planes and things like that

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.840
out in the Southwest.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.540
A lot of people were definitely
playing into that image set.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.310
But the old school
science fiction

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.960
also anticipates a
world that is much more

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.380
end-user knowable
and serviceable

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.960
than ours has ended up being.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.780
You have people in
"Have Spacesuit--

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.690
Will Travel" who are building
rocket ships in their backyard

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.740
fundamentally, or oh, I just
got this space suit kit out

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.810
of an ad in the back
of the newspaper

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.970
and I can tool it all
together, and now I'm

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.880
going to go out to pressure
test the space suit.

00:22:24.894 --> 00:22:27.060
These are things that some
people do in our reality,

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.610
but it's a more limited class
of people that is doing them.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.450
And for a lot of folks, the
incredibly complicated tools

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.629
that they employ on
a day to day basis

00:22:35.629 --> 00:22:37.920
to figure out how they're
going to get to the Starbucks

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.875
around the corner
might as well be magic.

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:44.250
You have something
in your pocket

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.880
that might as well be a
magic mirror, in that you

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.570
expect it to behave in a
certain, consistent way.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.770
You propitiate it in
a certain fashion.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.900
You recognize that there
is a system behind it that

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.000
has complex interactions,
of which you only

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.050
see this tiny little aspect,
this sort of user interface.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.990
And some people know
pieces of what's

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:07.590
happening behind the
glass, but very few--

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:11.670
and I'd wager basically
nobody knows everything that's

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:12.810
happening behind the glass.

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.420
The systems that we
use have eclipsed,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.970
even at this reasonably
rudimentary level,

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.920
if you're thinking
about the next potential

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.710
3,000 years of human
technological development,

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.820
if we're lucky and
we get to do those,

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.220
have already eclipsed
our ability to comprehend

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.620
as individual human actors.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.110
And so it starts to feel
a lot more like magic.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.810
And I think this is
part of the reason

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:43.520
that fantasy has come to own the
airwaves and the movie sphere

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.100
recently.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.230
You get science
fiction movies which

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:52.020
tend to be about very
immediate problems-- something

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:57.000
like "Ex Machina," which is a
movie about simulated humanity,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.160
artificial intelligence,
some of the immediate threats

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.300
or immediate moral
and ethical quandaries

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.190
that we're facing as a species.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.290
But the big blockbusters
are basically

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.822
fantasy blockbusters, not
only the explicit ones

00:24:09.822 --> 00:24:12.030
like the Lord of the Rings
series or the Harry Potter

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.260
films, but also the
Marvel cinematic universe,

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.010
the superhero universe,
which is fundamentally

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.620
a fantasy setting with a
couple bits of science fiction

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.720
that are glommed on.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.430
You have grand, dramatic
action in a world that

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.130
is much harder for
individual human beings

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.280
to know and control.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.380
And that places
certain challenges

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.010
for the writing of fantasy and
for the doing of technology,

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:48.390
also, in everyday life.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.700
As a fantasy writer,
that inspires

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.030
me to keep going in and trying
to make fantasy that actually

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:57.810
looks and kind of feels the
way that our world feels-- make

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.680
stories that not only
pull people into them,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.270
but are enlightening about
how you relate to a world that

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.780
is much bigger, older, more
complicated than certainly

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.350
you're told in grade school,
the extent to which we're all

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:16.020
setting out from Hobbiton
as we begin our careers

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.970
and are coming to
understand that we're

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.180
part of struggles that are
much older and more complicated

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.785
than any of us
conceive at the outset,

00:25:24.785 --> 00:25:26.910
or at least that many of
us conceive at the outset.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.760
I don't know.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.790
And from the
perspective of somebody

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.750
who's out to build
systems, the question

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:39.712
is what sort of illusions
are you presenting?

00:25:39.712 --> 00:25:41.420
What sort of surfaces
are you presenting?

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.670
What sort of rituals
are you creating?

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.220
And what are the consequences
of those rituals?

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.460
What does the system encourage
people to do to one another

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.917
and with one another?

00:25:50.917 --> 00:25:53.000
I don't claim to have any
answers to all of these.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.800
I just think that they are
questions that we don't yet

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.860
have any set answers for
and that are important

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.660
and we need to be living
and thinking through.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.150
And I suggest-- and this
is where I'm going with all

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:08.930
of my books--

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:18.350
that it is worth looking to
older methods of interpreting

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.230
unseen forces or vast
forces to understand

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.920
how people have historically
related to things like destiny

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:30.110
or the weather, to ask like
what are people's expectations

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.540
and how do they relate to
things like, I don't know,

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.460
Wi-Fi or persistent
connectivity.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.830
But that's just an
out-there theory

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.870
right now that I'm
still working on.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.444
I'd love to have some questions
from the audience right now,

00:26:45.444 --> 00:26:47.360
or else I can just
continue babbling about all

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.160
of these things for a while.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.444
Anyone have a thought?

00:26:50.444 --> 00:26:51.860
AUDIENCE: OK, so
there's no number

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.140
in the title of
"Ruin of Angels"--

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.140
MAX GLADSTONE: Oh, gosh.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.150
AUDIENCE: And more generally,
it took a long time

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:02.510
before somebody pointed out
to me that the first five are

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.750
actually numbered in
chronological order,

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.670
despite the order in
which I read them.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.790
And of course, reading
them as they come out,

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.340
there are a bunch
of obvious oddities

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.100
like reading the
story of an adult

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.370
and then getting to finally
see the childhood where

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.346
a lot of this came from in
a later book in the series.

00:27:22.346 --> 00:27:23.720
But I would love
to hear what you

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.710
have to say about the order
of the books and the order

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.320
that you think people will read
them in now or in the future

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.347
and what the thinking was behind
the chronology of the world.

00:27:34.347 --> 00:27:35.180
MAX GLADSTONE: Sure.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.620
Thank you.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:41.360
For those of you who are
coming more new to my work,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.360
I made a terrible,
horrible, bad mistake

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.430
when I started
working on this that

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.980
actually, like a
lot of my mistakes,

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.960
had very good
reasoning behind it.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.790
So I'll walk you through it.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.300
I loved and still love
Terry Pratchett's novels.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.540
The Discworld books
are, for my taste,

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.530
one of the best examples
that's out there

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:07.930
of how to assemble a coherent
complicated, multifaceted world

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.680
that we see from a lot
of different angles

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.250
and a lot of different points
in time and points of view.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.502
But a frustration I
always had as a kid

00:28:15.502 --> 00:28:17.210
getting all of these
books out of order--

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.570
living in rural Tennessee and
having a tiny local bookstore--

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.600
was that I had no
sense where "Guards!

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.170
Guards!"

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.170
was with respect to
"The Fifth Elephant

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.930
or, even though I could
kind of tell one of them

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.150
was coming after the
other, how many books there

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.056
were in between,
or when characters

00:28:34.056 --> 00:28:36.680
were making an offhand reference
to some adventure they've had,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.170
whether I had just missed a
book or whether the book hadn't

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.980
been localized into North
American publishing markets

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.270
yet, or what.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.580
For a really long time,
there was a book, "Jingo,"

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.340
that was missing
from the city guards

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.320
sequence in American
publication,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.840
I guess because they thought
that the word "jingo" was too

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.370
weird for an American audience?

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.140
I don't even know.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.220
But I had to track down
and finally import it.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.430
Anyway.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.602
Really amazing books,
but what order are

00:29:04.602 --> 00:29:05.810
you supposed to read them in?

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.014
What order do things
even happen in?

00:29:08.014 --> 00:29:09.680
Are you, in fact,
getting the first book

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.970
in the series when you
think you're getting

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.560
the first book in the series?

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.530
So I thought, well, I admire
that kind of random access

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.600
approach to worldbuilding for
a couple of different reasons.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.780
One, it gives you
the feeling that I

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.690
think we all have in
our lives of coming

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.110
into the middle of the story
even as we start embarking

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.060
on our own personal story.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.389
You start off and you think you
kind of know what the world is

00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:37.430
and how it fits together,
but pretty quickly, you

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.170
learn that your initial
conceptions maybe

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:40.130
had some flaws in them.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.546
You needed to build
out your sense

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:44.720
of how the world
is and then revise

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.010
your own path accordingly.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.240
So "Three Parts Dead" is a
story that starts in a middle.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.720
Tara Abernathy is beginning
her career as a Craftwoman

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.860
and she has certain
convictions about how

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.860
the world fits together.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.100
Gods are old-fashioned
and antiquated and like,

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.860
oh my god--

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.990
so to speak-- why are we
still doing any of this?

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.031
I don't understand why
all these religious people

00:30:05.031 --> 00:30:06.440
are getting out of it.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.990
Gosh, well, I guess I'll
just chop up their deity,

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:12.050
sew it back together, and move
on with my life, or [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:14.600
as the case may be.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.590
And that's where
she's coming in.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:24.200
She understands an initial,
kind of high school

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.860
historical viewpoint of what's
happened in the last 150

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.440
years of her world, where
the Craft came from,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.330
what happened in the God Wars.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:33.260
She's very smart.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.190
She's very driven.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.667
She's very good
at what she does,

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:37.250
but she doesn't have
that context yet.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.708
And "Three Parts
Dead" is the story

00:30:38.708 --> 00:30:41.880
of her getting some
of that context.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.550
But then we see
the entire picture

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.340
from another perspective
in "Two Serpents

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.700
Rise," which is the next book.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.980
We see it from the
perspective of a city that

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.630
was colonized or conquered
very early in the God Wars

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.800
and has since developed
as a world of Craftsfolk

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.700
specifically rather than
Tara's perspective, which

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.650
is a Craftsperson
who is an outsider

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:07.920
to a religious community.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.380
And Dresediel which Tara,
again and again, talks about as

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.590
this really awesome place and
she genuinely loves going to

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.380
and really is excited
about, has a whole bunch

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:21.200
of issues that are more
or less invisible to her

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.810
but become very
visible when we see it

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.600
from the perspective of people
who grew up there and live

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.750
there every day.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.350
But of course, they have a
perspective on their own city's

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.694
history that is warped by
the narratives of its history

00:31:32.694 --> 00:31:33.610
that they've received.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.270
So when we see Dresediel Lex
again in "Last First Snow"

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.580
about 20 years
earlier in its run,

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.860
we discover that some
things that the characters

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.160
thought were true aren't true.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.730
We discover that the narrative
about a particular sort of riot

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:56.881
and uprising that happened
in the city's past

00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:59.130
is close to the story that
people are telling about it

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.140
20 years on but isn't actually
what people are telling about

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:02.900
it 20 years on.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:08.260
So you get this
multi-faceted view

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:12.130
of the history of the setting
and of meta-plot, to the extent

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.170
there is one in
The Craft Sequence.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.420
You see it from this
facet and then this facet

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.820
and then this other
facet over here

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.000
and you start to get
a sense for the whole.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.430
This is a challenge
in epic fantasy,

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.310
usually, because
often, even if you're

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.680
trying very hard
in an epic fantasy,

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.110
you get one basic through line.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:36.335
You get your main characters
or your party of adventurers

00:32:36.335 --> 00:32:37.210
who are going around.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.640
And they go to this one city,
and this one city behaves

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.098
in a certain way
and it's like, oh,

00:32:41.098 --> 00:32:44.125
this is the city of the
super honorable people.

00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:47.560
When I was a kid, I loved
reading David Eddings' books.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:53.320
And David Eddings is the arch
king of this exact thing.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.890
This is the sneaky
person country.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:02.265
Everyone in this country is
super sneaky all the time.

00:33:02.265 --> 00:33:02.890
We have a king.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.414
He's the sneaky king.

00:33:04.414 --> 00:33:05.080
We have thieves.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.970
They're extra sneaky thieves.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.070
We have knights who are
honorable but sneaky

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.420
about being honorable.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.060
Meanwhile, over here, exactly
one country over-- they

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.300
share a border-- it's the
land of super honorable

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.616
like southern French
courtly romance people

00:33:18.616 --> 00:33:19.990
who are all living
as if they are

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:24.817
in a southern French courtly
romance all the goddamn time.

00:33:24.817 --> 00:33:25.900
You can go around the map.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.420
There's the poison
people, and there's

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.070
people who like trading a lot.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.570
And it's as bad as--
or as elementally

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.540
considered as any "Star
Trek" planet of hats.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.640
And there's a weird--

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.040
this might be a
strange word to use,

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.340
but there's a weird
sort of imperialism

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.673
in thinking about worlds that
way, or in building worlds

00:33:48.673 --> 00:33:53.110
that way because, of course,
if you want to privilege

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:57.132
the perspective of our
main character Garion

00:33:57.132 --> 00:33:59.590
in the David Eddings books,
for example, as he is traveling

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:03.040
around, it might entirely seem
that this culture over here,

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.580
the "sneaky" people, but he's
only been there for two days.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.790
And most of those two days,
he was running for his life

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.360
from some orc-type
individuals or getting blasted

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.530
with magic or something.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:15.187
He has no clue.

00:34:15.187 --> 00:34:17.770
He showed up and somebody picked
his pocket and his conclusion

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:19.103
was, this is the sneaky country.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.845
Not that places don't have
their own authentic character,

00:34:25.845 --> 00:34:27.219
but it's very hard
to get a sense

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:30.500
of what that authentic character
is when seen from outside.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.030
So I jumped around, as I was
writing the books, in history

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.830
and in geographic
setting and I thought,

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.040
I'm going to make things
really easy for people.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.825
It's obvious what
order I wrote the books

00:34:40.825 --> 00:34:44.030
in because it just says
that in the copyright page

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.890
and you can see that on Amazon.

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:47.139
Your bookseller will tell you.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.630
It's easy to know what
order they came out in.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.710
But what order do they
happen in chronologically?

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.168
I'll just put a
number in the title

00:34:53.168 --> 00:34:55.690
of each one saying what order
they fall on the number line.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.555
And then that'll let
me to leave a gap,

00:34:57.555 --> 00:34:59.680
and then I can put something
into the gap later on,

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.830
and this had confused
people for five years.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:04.910
This is the classic
case of overdesign.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:08.520
Excellent feature.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.240
It confuses the
crap out of people.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.940
And I've been getting this same
question, or variations of it,

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.850
again and again.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.254
Not to throw you under the
bus for asking the question.

00:35:17.254 --> 00:35:17.920
It's a good one.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.770
I get it a lot.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.860
I talk about this because
it is important to learn

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.520
from one's own mistakes.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.120
So of course, I thought,
ah, brilliant idea.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.620
I've finished the
first five books.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.720
I've tied them into a knot.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.690
We've filled in all of the
gaps in the number line.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.660
And now what I want to do, that
I've shown this world that's

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.160
in the midst of a giant crunch,
where people are desperately

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.467
trying to figure out what
happens next-- oh god,

00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:42.550
there are no good options.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.140
There seems to be
no good options.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.290
The sad truth of reality is that
entropy always marches forward.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.500
And even if there
are no good options,

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.600
you need to start
taking action, or things

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.250
are going to start happening
around you, or both.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.200
So the rest of the books in
The Craft Sequence, the idea

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.514
is time is going to
be marching forward

00:36:00.514 --> 00:36:01.930
and our characters
are going to be

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:06.910
dealing with a rapidly evolving
and worsening situation.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:09.121
So every book after
this is just going

00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:10.870
to be one after the
other after the other,

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.030
so I'm just going to take
the numbers out of the title.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.380
Plus, we have a different
cover treatment.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.267
It's sort of like a
season two of the series.

00:36:16.267 --> 00:36:17.350
It'll be really intuitive.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.330
And it's not been
intuitive at all!

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.040
So I don't know.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.520
I need quality
testers or something.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.500
Well, OK.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.580
So the writing group is-- the
writing group are actually

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.212
quality testers for the actual
fictions, and what I need is,

00:36:31.212 --> 00:36:33.670
I don't know, a business manager
to come and whop me upside

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.740
the head every once in a
while, or I don't know--

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.990
this is why I'm very
happy with my new agent.

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:39.460
Anyway.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.730
Long, convoluted answer
to a very simple question.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:46.010
But my apologies for everything.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.770
Yes?

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:49.710
AUDIENCE: So maybe this is
another frequent question

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:51.370
because it's a
little bit related.

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:57.930
But I'm curious if taking
this non-linear chronology

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:02.410
and exploring the reasons for
earlier things, if you ever

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.650
get to a point where you
regret a decision that you made

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:11.870
in an earlier book and have a
temptation to retcon something,

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:14.670
and if that happens,
how you deal with that?

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.060
MAX GLADSTONE: Yes and also no.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.810
Yes, there have been a couple
worldbuilding decisions

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.436
that I made when I was writing
"Three Parts Dead," like names

00:37:25.436 --> 00:37:27.310
for calling things,
where it was a little too

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:28.768
close to the name
of something that

00:37:28.768 --> 00:37:30.190
was in a real-world culture.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.320
And some of those I caught and
changed, and some of those I've

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.486
been living with ever since.

00:37:33.486 --> 00:37:35.290
And that's fine.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.830
But in general,
in terms of things

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.710
that are not connected
to nomenclature,

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.790
like large-scale developments
of cause and effect

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.200
through the series, that
hasn't happened so much.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.430
This it partly a
virtue of containing

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.050
the stories for each
book to the book

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.780
itself, so most of the
cause-and-effect stuff

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.270
that happens in a book
is done by the time

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.670
you turn the last page in it.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.430
So there are a few state
changes in the world that

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.800
need to carry over and I need
to keep track of from book

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.330
to book, but I
don't need to keep

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:11.770
track of a timeline of
the internal chronology

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.920
of each book in any
subsequent book.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.830
It's also easy to explain
any possible variance

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:19.300
between people's
stories from book

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.920
to book as a variance of
their knowledge of history

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.020
or as somebody
misremembering something.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.519
There's a sense of the timeline
of the Skittersill Rising,

00:38:28.519 --> 00:38:31.060
which was the subject of "Last
First Snow," that isn't really

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.610
reflected in "Two Serpents
Rise," which I wrote earlier,

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.830
but the only sense of
that timing that we get

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.390
is from Caleb, who spends a
decent chunk of the second half

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.230
of "Two Serpents Rise"
dying of extreme blood loss

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.500
and could reasonably be
said to have a skewed

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:51.520
perspective on the situation.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.970
So it's great.

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:57.490
The other side of it is, my
own angle on worldbuilding

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:02.121
is a little less encyclopedic
than that of many epic fantasy

00:39:02.121 --> 00:39:02.620
people.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.330
Personally-- I don't
think there's actually

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:08.860
a right or wrong
way to go about it.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.340
There are just ways that you
naturally go about it or not.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.450
There's the Tolkien angle, where
you accumulate this enormous

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:20.290
worldbuilding document that is
full of all your random ideas

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.790
for things, and some of them
connect and some of them don't.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.560
Some of them are going to
be relevant to the books.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.630
Some of them aren't.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.730
You're building the
bottom 90% of the iceberg

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:31.390
so you know what goes on top.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:34.900
The way that I think of
worldbuilding, especially

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.750
in a large work like this,
is kind of like a Go board.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.130
Are people familiar with
the game of Go at all?

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.380
I've used this analogy a
couple of times before.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.440
I apologize if anyone
has heard me make it.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.977
But you start off in Go
with 19 by 19 blank board.

00:39:51.977 --> 00:39:53.560
You're playing against
another player.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.620
You're each laying
down stones in sequence

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.900
to try to basically
wall off sections

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.687
of the board with
your color of stones

00:40:01.687 --> 00:40:02.770
or their colors of stones.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.900
So you've got a white
player and a black player.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:10.210
And the trick with the early
stages of the game of Go

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.420
is you're rarely playing stones
that are right next to one

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.800
another, to build a very tight,
connected wall, because it's

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.360
much faster to play
stones that are

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.859
all the way on the other side
of the board from one another.

00:40:21.859 --> 00:40:24.160
You can build a very loose
network that then you

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.320
go back to fill in later.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.650
So in the course of writing
any given book in The Craft

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.591
Sequence, I'm laying
a stone over here,

00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:34.090
and then I'll mention
something that

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.570
happens two continents away or
an author that somebody likes,

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:40.730
and that becomes a stone that's
way over on the other side.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.330
So when I am eventually
writing a book that's

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:45.610
focusing on the upper-right
corner as opposed

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.910
to the lower-left corner
that I've been focusing on

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.490
in the previous
volume, I'll know, OK,

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.230
what do I know about this place?

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.860
Well, somebody there really
likes this particular author.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.300
They have very spicy food.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:58.960
They make rugs.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.170
There's this particular
myth that was echoed.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.720
There's a whale
migration near there.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.530
And I have a lot of freedom
within the minimal constraints

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.480
that I've imposed on
myself up to that point.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.030
So by keeping the
framework very loose,

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.210
it becomes an aid
to creativity when

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:26.930
I get to actually filling
in that corner of the map.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:28.850
So no on that level.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:33.640
I've never really regretted
any major decisions

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.500
that I've made
outside of, again,

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.140
the name of one or two people.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:43.630
But yeah, those decisions, and
even those offhand references,

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:47.800
end up becoming huge helps when
it comes to writing a book out

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.620
and also offer me
plenty of flexibility

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.410
for investigating the
corners of the map

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:56.290
that I haven't
really gone into yet.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.022
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned at some point

00:41:58.022 --> 00:41:59.605
during your opening
statement that you

00:41:59.605 --> 00:42:04.030
were interested in how
people operating in systems

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.650
behave in reaction
to those systems,

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:08.860
or how systems might force
them to react to each other

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.320
or treat each other.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.387
So that obviously
implies that you've

00:42:13.387 --> 00:42:15.470
sort of built political
systems or magical systems

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.870
or economic systems
or social systems.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.850
Where do you go for
inspiration, or how do you

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.430
develop those in the
course of your writing?

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.410
How do I develop the
systems that I develop?

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.350
A lot of research is
what it comes down to.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:38.240
I'm rarely writing
cultures or systems that

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.320
are strict [INAUDIBLE]
strict fictional importations

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.060
of other cultures,
but I'm often thinking

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.780
about a particular region or
a particular sort of conflict

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.070
that I can flesh out.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:54.020
I go to academic anthropology
a lot for this sort of stuff

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.710
because anthropology
tends to focus

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.786
a lot more on the
ways people respond

00:42:59.786 --> 00:43:01.160
to their environment
and the ways

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.700
people socially code or socially
react to their environments

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:10.370
than on the specific
evolving physical conditions.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.340
Kavekana, which is where the
initial excerpt that I read

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.080
from "Ruin of
Angels" takes place

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.180
and where "Full Fathom
Five" takes place,

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.170
is set on a vaguely
Polynesian island.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.860
And I was really interested
in the question of cargo cults

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.310
and the development
of local religions

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.550
in the context of a much
larger imperial system.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:36.810
So I read a lot about
how those came to be

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.140
and what role they were
playing, and it turned out

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.890
to be much more nuanced
than I'd initially thought

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:44.180
from your reflexive sense.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:49.230
Oh, the cargo is dropped off
and then you worship the cargo.

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.650
I started seeing it.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.980
And anthropology texts were
talking about it much more

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.250
as a revolutionary movement,
or as something that's

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:03.800
happening in response
to a worldview that's

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.130
encountering something that's
basically out of its context.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:12.470
So you have a worldview
in which the sea is kind

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.720
of the border of the known.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.810
You can travel between islands,
but there's always the sense

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.630
that there's this enormous,
vast expanse of water beyond all

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.060
of the islands that you know.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.380
Maybe you can cross it.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.100
Maybe you can't.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.090
But what's over there
is fundamentally weird,

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:29.667
and that's where the
ancestors go when they die.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:31.250
And then all of a
sudden, these people

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:35.060
show up in ships from all
the way across the world who

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.890
talk about coming
from a land that

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.740
is across that
unknowable gulf of water,

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.879
and who seem fundamentally
different from anyone

00:44:43.879 --> 00:44:45.170
that you've encountered before.

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:46.670
And you can start
talking about them

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.980
as spirits in a
way that recognizes

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.714
that they are certainly
not from wherever you are.

00:44:52.714 --> 00:44:54.380
They're not part of
the deal that you're

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.410
a part of with your
landscape and your culture.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:01.700
And the initial is like--
oh, it's sort of silly.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.650
The initial experience upon
reading about a cargo cult--

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:09.770
like, how weird, they
are talking about a rifle

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:11.420
as a magical object--

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.120
becomes a lot more
sensible when you recognize

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:20.540
that a colonial settlement
doesn't have any of the tools--

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.736
the European colonial
settlements in Polynesia

00:45:24.736 --> 00:45:26.360
doesn't have any of
the tools that they

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.640
need to build a lot of
the technological goods

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.230
that they're importing.

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:32.790
You can say, oh,
yeah, we made this.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:34.670
The hell you did.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.380
Can you show me
the factory that's

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.020
going to make you a rifle?

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.720
You guys are planting exactly
the same crops we're planting.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.340
You have slightly
weirder houses,

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.780
and you have stuff
for your dress,

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.300
but you're fundamentally human.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.710
There is absolutely no
way you made this thing.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.570
Obviously what's
happening is you

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:53.030
are intercepting the shipments
that our ancestors are

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:56.320
sending to us and
using them against us,

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.070
so there's going to
be some redress coming

00:45:58.070 --> 00:45:58.820
when that happens.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.860
You're getting this from
a supernatural agent

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.650
because obviously it's
a supernatural agent.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:10.595
And that jump of conceiving
of a foreign set of power

00:46:10.595 --> 00:46:14.720
relationships and a foreign
set of technological material

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:20.150
conditions in a truth system
that you grew up using--

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:23.510
sort of ritualizing a
different people's knowledge--

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.380
is a process that I
find really fascinating,

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.421
and that's something that
academic sociology gets

00:46:27.421 --> 00:46:28.040
into a lot.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.460
So I found James C. Scott's
"Seeing Like a State"

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:37.910
enormously useful in building
the girders of this approach.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.400
There's a great book by Michael
Taussig called "The Devil

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.160
and Commodity Fetishism
in South America," which

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:48.170
is about what happens when
you take people who don't have

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.300
a capital economy
and you thrust them

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:52.640
into the conditions
of a capital economy.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.800
And one of the things
that can happen,

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.720
anyway, is that they
conceive of the capital

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.850
economy as witchcraft
and corporate existence

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:04.610
as a fundamentally satanic
mode of being, which I think

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.080
is pretty cool.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.080
You start seeing when
Colombia is colonized

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:13.520
and when villages are forcibly
shifted over into a plantation

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.390
mode of agriculture.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:15.980
People are either
enslaved or put

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:20.720
into exploitative
agriculture-company-store kind

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.800
of situations.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.920
You start seeing attempts to
describe what interest is.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.035
Like, what is this
thing where I have money

00:47:27.035 --> 00:47:28.160
and then I have more money?

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.720
Well, what happens,
you see, is you

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.400
plant the money in
the ground and then

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.920
you sell your soul to
the devil, and the devil

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.020
ensures that more money is
going to grow up from it.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.670
So you get a kind of witchcraft
interpretation of something

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:43.250
that feels like a very intuitive
part of the financial system

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:44.750
to somebody who's
grown up in it.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.060
So those are things
that really inspire me,

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.604
and those are
directions that I keep

00:47:48.604 --> 00:47:51.020
looking for as I'm trying to
figure out next steps to take

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.070
The Sequence.

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.030
I want to thank
everybody for coming.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.050
And if you guys want to come up
and continue the conversation

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.880
afterwards, I'm totally
happy with that.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.030
We have some books
that I can sign, also.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.290
And thanks so much
for having me.

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:06.640
[APPLAUSE]
