00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600
bicycle and and you you just keep
 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.230
bicycle and and you you just keep
turning over the possibilities I mean I

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240
turning over the possibilities I mean I
 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.670
turning over the possibilities I mean I
solve half of my problems you know

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680
solve half of my problems you know

or something you know yeah and so you
 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.590
or something you know yeah and so you
got to be thinking all the time about

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600
got to be thinking all the time about
 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.240
got to be thinking all the time about
about it and you got to be interesting

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250
about it and you got to be interesting
 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.680
about it and you got to be interesting
enough so that you're thinking about it

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690
enough so that you're thinking about it
 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.920
enough so that you're thinking about it
and and and that's really then when you

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930
and and and that's really then when you
 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.290
and and and that's really then when you
go in the laboratory or sit down it's a

be only one right answer and you were
 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.940
be only one right answer and you were
expected to see how to get the answer by
