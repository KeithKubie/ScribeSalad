expanding this because if you look at

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
expanding this because if you look at
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.060
expanding this because if you look at
what is happening in the emerging world

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
what is happening in the emerging world

you later through me is it really

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650
you later through me is it really
 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.670
you later through me is it really
required you really need that you don't

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
required you really need that you don't

you want to think about the ecosystem I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
you want to think about the ecosystem I
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.030
you want to think about the ecosystem I
think we have to do something about it

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
think we have to do something about it
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.640
think we have to do something about it
and oh by the way if you start the risk

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
and oh by the way if you start the risk
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.039
and oh by the way if you start the risk
at the ecosystem the probability is that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
at the ecosystem the probability is that
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.740
at the ecosystem the probability is that
we will perhaps get a lot more out of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
we will perhaps get a lot more out of
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.350
we will perhaps get a lot more out of
this and a lot of the problems that we

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
this and a lot of the problems that we
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.149
this and a lot of the problems that we
are confronted with things like climate

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
are confronted with things like climate
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.609
are confronted with things like climate
change things like of deforestation

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
change things like of deforestation
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.249
change things like of deforestation
things like species extinction perhaps

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
things like species extinction perhaps
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.499
things like species extinction perhaps
might be mitigated and perhaps might go

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
might be mitigated and perhaps might go
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.030
might be mitigated and perhaps might go
there and we might actually start to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
there and we might actually start to
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.249
there and we might actually start to
learn to live in harmony thank you very

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
learn to live in harmony thank you very
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.030
learn to live in harmony thank you very
much look forward to response
