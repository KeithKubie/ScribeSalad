00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.290
PROFESSOR: I know I'm
not Dr. Sadoway.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.920
I'm one of Dr. Sadoway's
younger colleagues so--

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.270
but class is beginning,
so let's get started.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.010
Dr. Sadoway, of course, would
like you to know that he would

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.850
very much love to be with you
here today and he would

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.490
probably like that very much
more than what he's doing now,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.920
which is sitting in a secured
area secured by the Secret

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.670
Service about to meet
the President.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.630
So you can ask him all about
it when he comes back.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.410
Associated with that, I have
one request for you.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.990
Today, when you're leaving,
some of you may be used to

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.480
leaving that way.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.950
Don't leave that way.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.250
Leave any other way.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.330
This way's fine.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.710
In the back is fine.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.320
Just don't leave that way.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.090
OK.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.800
So last time, we talked
about x-rays

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.370
defraction and Bragg's Law.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.700
And x-ray defraction and Bragg's
Law has a lot to do

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.360
with perfect crystals.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.120
So perfection, right?

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.300
We've been dealing with perfect
crystal so far and

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.840
today, we're going to be dealing
with imperfections.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.430
So defects.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.130
And in the field of material
science, the field that I work

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.130
in along with Dr. Sadoway.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.970
there's a saying due to one of
the most famous material

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.130
scientists that says that
crystals are like people.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.500
It's the defects that make
them interesting.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.450
So now you've heard that saying
and you can roll your

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.450
eyes from now on every time
you hear it because it's

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.660
repeated it very often.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.080
So let's see.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.040
What do we mean by defects?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.900
Well, there's two types of
defects, broadly speaking,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.840
that we're going to be talking
about, and we can classify

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.010
those into two categories.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.260
One of them is chemical.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.750
So far, we've been dealing with

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.200
chemically perfect materials.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.720
So ones that are made up of one
element or ones that are

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.220
made up in stoichiometric
quantities of two elements,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.110
but you can also have chemical
imperfections.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.640
You can have impurities.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.690
You can have alloying elements
and we're also going to be

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.395
talking about atomic
arrangement.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.420
And in the case of atomic
arrangement, we're dealing

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.000
with structure, right?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.500
Here we're dealing
with chemistry.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.250
Here we're dealing
with structure.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.230
You know about crystal structure
so you know what

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.290
perfect crystals look like,
but real materials are not

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.410
perfect, neither in the chemical
sense nor in the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.330
structural sense.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.360
So perfect crystals don't really
exist. You have always

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.540
some forms of imperfections and
we'll go over those today.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.040
So in the case of chemical
imperfections, we have,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.730
broadly speaking, two types.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.980
Good ones--

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.910
Dr. Sadoway labels them with
a smiley face so I

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.090
will do that, too.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.120
And bad ones are a sad face.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.890
So both are defects and whether
they're good or bad

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.080
depends on their utility.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.790
Are they useful or are
they detrimental?

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.620
If they are detrimental, we
call them impurities.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.720
And if they are good, we
call them other things.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.970
For example, dopants.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.540
We studied dopants, right?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.620
Dopants are a type of impurity,
they're a kind of

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.270
imperfection, but
they're good.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.770
We use dopants.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.860
We use them in semiconductors.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.320
Also, alloying elements,
you can put in

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.520
the elements yourself.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.490
Those are examples of good
chemical imperfections.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.670
When it comes to atomic
arrangements, we're going to

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.690
spend a little bit of time
talking about that in more

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.960
detail in just a minute.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.480
But broadly speaking, they are
situations where you don't

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.810
have perfect crystal in order.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.250
You have disruptions and that
perfect crystal in order--

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.260
either in the form of missing
atoms or extra atoms or

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.420
differently oriented
unit cells of the

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.300
crystal and so forth.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.530
So we'll talk about
that a little bit

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.350
more in just a minute.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.615
So one thing that I forgot to
mention maybe is that we have

00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:37.870
a test coming up--

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.220
That is, I'm sorry.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.580
Celebration of learning, second

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.030
celebration of learning.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.930
And those are your
room assignments.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.730
You don't have to necessarily
write them down now, but

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.580
you'll see them again.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.670
So I just wanted you
to see them.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:56.230
A through Ha in 10-250,
He through Sm, 26-100,

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.510
So through Z, 4-270.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.360
OK, so let's go into the
taxonomy of defects.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.430
So I mentioned that there are a
number of different kinds of

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.120
defects, and we can do better
than to say simply, defects

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.660
exist. We can actually start
to classify them.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.380
So there are, broadly speaking,
four types of

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.050
defects, which we classify
based on dimensionality.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.190
So there's 0-dimensional defects
and 0-dimensional

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.850
defects are point defects or
point defect clusters.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.800
It's just like in math.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.110
A point has 0 dimension,
right?

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.150
1-dimensional defects or line
defects, things that thread

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.870
through a material like a
shoestring or something, and

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.600
we'll have an example of that
in the form of dislocations.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.990
Then we have 2-dimensional
defects.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.700
Those are interfacial defects.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.270
So if you have interfaces
between two different kinds of

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.700
materials or if you have two
crystals that are misoriented

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.980
with respect to each other,
those are examples of

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.660
interfacial defects.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.830
And we also have
bulk defects--

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.250
3-dimensional defects
like inclusions.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.110
We'll go over some of those.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.490
So let's start out with
point defects.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.830
Point defects are those
0-dimensional defects.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.820
They're points, just
like in math.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.190
And there are a number of
different point defects that

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.340
we can look at.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.780
We have our substitutional
impurities, interstitial

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.750
impurities.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:26.380
The general overall recurring
theme in these point defects,

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.860
regardless what type they are,
is that they are localized

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.730
disruptions.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.260
So a lattice, a crystalline
lattice, is a regular

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.150
arrangement of atoms, and a
point defect is a very local

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.240
disruption in that regular
crystalline arrangement.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.310
And those disruptions can
occur on lattice sites.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.130
So basically, on the positions
where you would see atoms

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.690
normally, they can also occur
between lattice sites.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.690
So they're localized rifts,
you can say, in the

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.710
periodicity of a crystalline
material.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.760
And here's just an illustration
of the way that

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.370
these different point
defects play out.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.200
So let's start out by
looking at this one.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.740
This is a substitutional
impurity atom.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.550
So it's an impurity.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.190
So it's a type of chemical
imperfection.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.710
You can imagine that this is,
for example, some kind of FCC

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.010
material like copper, for
instance, and suppose that you

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.950
have an impurity of some sort
like iron, and it sits there

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.030
and it replace one of the
copper atoms. So this is

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.580
called a substitutional
impurity.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.570
It substitutes for the regular
atom that would have sat at

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.050
that location.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.160
Substitutional impurities.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.980
There's another picture.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.340
There's your substitutional
impurity up there.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.000
We'll get to the other ones
in just a moment.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.560
We already talked about some
substitutional impurities.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.740
So dopants.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.010
If you have boron or phosphorus
or silicon, that

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.140
boron or that phosphorus
replaces the silicon that

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.020
would have sat at a certain
lattice site.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.730
So the dopants we've studied
so far are types of

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.830
substitutional impurities and
we call them good impurities

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.640
because they give us desirable
properties.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.670
They are dopants.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.270
They're good impurities.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.540
Then we have alloying
elements.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:21.320
I am not a very big fan of
sodas, but if you were

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.000
somebody else who is a big fan
of sodas, then you might, for

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.810
example, drink a lot of sodas
out of aluminum cans.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.660
Those aluminum cans are really
not pure aluminum.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.950
They're alloys.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.750
They're alloys with other metals
to give them the good

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.910
properties that they need
in order for the

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.240
forming process to occur.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.090
So if you ask yourself,
how do you actually

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.780
make aluminum cans?

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.230
They're stamped out from sheets
of aluminum, but it's

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.520
not just aluminum by itself.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.010
Aluminum by itself would just
tear if you do that.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.910
So if you alloy it,
you give it better

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.010
properties so it's ductile.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:59.250
You can deform it to very large
strains and that's a

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.950
good thing in the case
of alloying elements.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.140
Another one that he showed
you was nickel and gold.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.370
That's if you want to change the
color of gold, if you want

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.610
to be very creative when
you're proposing.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:15.230
So that's a good kind of
substitutional impurity.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.360
There are also contaminants.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.520
Contaminants are bad kinds of
impurities, but before we get

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.710
to the contaminants, let me
just show you what good

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:24.760
impurities can do.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.860
So this is the Hope Diamond.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.080
It's in the American
gem collection.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.230
You can actually find
out more about it.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.670
I'm not a big gem expert, but
anybody who looks at this Hope

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.450
Diamond can immediately
see that it's a

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.890
really pretty diamond.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.670
But you guys are ahead of
everybody, because in addition

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.020
to knowing that it's a pretty
diamond, the fact that it has

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.320
boron impurities in it already
tells you what the majority

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.100
charge carrier is.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.220
So when you go to this gem
collection, you can educate

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.160
everybody else.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.020
So those are all good
impurities.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.460
There are also bad
impurities--

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.180
contaminants.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.310
Lithium in sodium chloride
is an example.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.630
So if you were using saline
solution, for instance, in an

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.070
IV and you had lithium in
there, that is very

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.070
detrimental to the person
who's receiving that.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.350
That's definitely
a contaminant.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.200
You don't want those.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.160
That could make you die.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:33.280
So let's move on to some other
types of point defects.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.900
Here's another type
of point defect.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.410
So just now we talked about the

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.390
substitutional impurity atom.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.490
Now we're going to talk about
the interstitial.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.610
The interstitial's very
different from the

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.970
substitutional.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.130
In the case of the
substitutional, we have a

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.730
lattice site, which instead of
being occupied by the regular

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.800
atom that would have occupied
it in a perfect crystal, is

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.340
occupied by a chemically
distinct atom.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.010
In the case of an interstitial
impurity, that impurity can

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.900
sit in the space in between
lattice sites, so-called

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.150
interstitial sites.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.590
That's why we call them
interstitial impurities.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.830
And interstitial impurities or
interstitial atoms can be both

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.430
chemical impurities, and
obviously, they are rifts in

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.230
the atomic arrangement so
they are structural

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.520
impurities as well.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.530
Why do I say chemical?

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.700
The reason is because if this
is, for example, iron, if this

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.870
is an iron matrix and you have
a carbon atom sitting in the

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.780
interstitial site which makes
steel, then that's an example

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.460
of a structural defect, but it's
also a chemical defect.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.190
If, for example, you have, on
the other hand, iron sitting

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.670
in a nuclear reactor and it's
getting bombarded all the time

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.160
by energetic neutrons, then
interstitials are being

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.140
created by atoms getting knocked
out of their lattice

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.350
sites and they're getting put
into interstitial sites.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.820
So that's creating defects that
are chemically the same

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.960
as the surrounding matrix
material, but which are

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.050
structurally distinct.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.090
So those are interstitial
atoms.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.860
So here's another picture
of interstitial

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.720
atoms. There it is.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.060
It's not sitting on a regular
lattice site.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.630
It's sitting in between
lattice sites.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.120
It's sitting in the space, in
the interstitial space between

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.400
atoms. And I already mentioned
to you the fact that if you

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.760
put carbon into iron, those
atoms go into interstitial

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.970
sites and there would give iron
some of its beneficial

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.340
properties, which we
look for in steel.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.780
So some of the good mechanical
properties.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.340
Here's another example of a
situation where an atom goes

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.020
into a lattice and create an
interstitial impurity.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.970
So lanthanum-nickel
5 is a prototype

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.560
hydrogen storage material.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.180
It takes up a huge amount
of hydrogen.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.090
It takes up a greater density
of hydrogen than liquid

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.040
hydrogen, actually, so if you
expose this to hydrogen, the

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.340
hydrogen just goes right
in, and it sits in the

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.950
lanthanum-nickel 5 lattice
as an interstitial atom.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.240
So this is considered
to be as a prototype

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.390
hydrogen storage material.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.420
Unfortunately, it's extremely
expensive so it's not being

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.510
used very much these days, but
on the other hand, it goes

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.400
well with our gem theme in this
particular lecture in

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.150
terms of expensive things.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.530
Here's another example of an
interstitial impurity.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.890
This one is not an
alloying element.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.880
It's a contaminant.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.780
So hydrogen, but this
time in iron.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.710
So hydrogen in lanthanum-nickel
5 is good.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.130
We want to store it.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.530
Hydrogen in iron is bad because
it actually degrades

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.520
the mechanical properties of the
iron, unlike carbon, which

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.160
gives us steel, which is good.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.910
You put hydrogen in,
it embrittles it.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.300
So hydrogen embrittlement in
steels is a big problem.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.340
And it's actually one
of the challenges

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.680
to a hydrogen economy.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:04.160
If you have steel pipelines or
valves or various pieces of

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.570
machinery, structural components
that are made out

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.290
of iron that are constantly
exposed to hydrogen, over

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.150
time, they're going
to brittle.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.630
They're going to become
very difficult to use.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:19.260
It's one of the challenges in
that whole undertaking.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.050
OK.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.490
So we're going fairly at a
clip here through these

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.870
taxonomy of point defects.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:30.010
So in the taxonomy of point
defects, perhaps the easiest

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.760
defect to understand
is the vacancy.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.160
So when you think of the
vacancy, think of the hole

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.700
that we talked about in the
case of semiconductors.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.480
Vacancy is nothing.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.410
It's a missing atom.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.470
So if you have a crystalline
lattice and it's FCC or it's

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.930
BCC or it's simple cubic,
whatever you like, and you

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.930
know that there's supposed to
be an atom at a certain

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.930
lattice site and it's not
there, that's a vacancy.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.870
That's a situation where you
have an unoccupied lattice

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.800
site and there are different
ways to form these vacancies.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.780
They can be formed during
crystallization.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.650
If you heat up a material, the
number of vacancies decreases.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.740
So if you quench it really
quickly, you can actually trap

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.180
the vacancies before they can
leave in service under extreme

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:14.760
conditions.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.140
I mentioned just a moment ago
that interstitials can be

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.520
created if you irradiate a
material, if you bombard it

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.390
with energetic particles, like
neutrons for instance, you'll

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.000
create interstitials, sure, by
knocking atoms out of their

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.880
atomic sites, but what's
left behind after you

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.720
knock that atom out?

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.340
Vacancies.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.910
So actually, you create two
defects at the same time:

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.160
vacancies and interstitials.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.250
So I think we probably have a
picture here of a vacancy.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.210
A vacancy is nothing.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.450
It's just empty space.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.700
That's a vacancy.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.140
There you go again.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.390
Nothing.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.290
So we've gone through a bunch
of taxonomy, right?

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.090
So we know now that there are a
number of different kinds of

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.960
point defects in crystals.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.390
We've talked about
interstitials.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.040
We talked about vacancies.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.130
We've talked about
substitutionals.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.750
What can we say about these
defects quantitatively?

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:20.430
So let's take the vacancy and
derive or write down what is

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.200
the number of vacancies that
you can expect to find in a

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.720
given material at a certain
temperatures?

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.930
So to do that, let's be a little
bit more quantitative.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.443
Suppose that you
have a crystal.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.800
I'm showing you a plane, for
example, a 1 1 1 plane in an

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.990
FCC material and how do
you create a vacancy?

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.070
You simply remove an atom.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.150
So you had an atom.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.920
Now you have no atom.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.320
You've created a vacancy.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.020
When you created that vacancy,
you broke all the bonds

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.610
between the atom that used to
be there and the neighboring

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.040
atoms. Breaking bonds
costs energy.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.580
So it costs energy to
create a vacancy.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.600
It costs energy to remove an
atom from the place where it

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.730
would have been because
you're breaking bonds.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.470
So in this case, I have six
bonds that I broke.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.930
If I were looking at some
material, for example, placing

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.510
our cubic material in 3D, I
would find that I would be

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.260
breaking 12 bonds to the 12
nearest neighbors, and so on

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.170
for all the different
crystal structures.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.260
So we actually then take that
information, the fact that

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.290
we're breaking bonds, and
encapsulate it in a single

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.330
descriptions of how
much energy it

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.310
costs to create a vacancy.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:40.870
And we call that the vacancy
formation energy.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:47.340
So this is an energy and so
it's expressed in eV.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.620
Its units are electron volts.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.500
You can convert them to joules,
anything you like.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:01.820
And if you wanted to then
compute how many vacancies

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.320
there are in a given crystal,
well, first of all, it costs

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.720
energy to make them, so why
would you ever even have a

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.470
vacancy in the material?

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.270
Well, no material is perfect.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.120
We know that from studying
materials, but what causes it

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.030
is the fact that at finite
temperature because of the

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.430
Boltzmann distribution that Dr.
Sadoway told you about a

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.540
few lectures ago, just like in
the case of intrinsic charge

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.790
carrier promotion in
semiconductors, you can get

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.640
thermal formation
of vacancies.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.320
So that Maxwell Boltzmann
distribution can actually

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.310
cause there to be vacancies
despite the

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.290
fact that there are--

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.220
that it costs energy
to do that.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.410
So how can we actually use
that to express how many

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.370
vacancies we have in
a given material?

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:52.150
So I'm going to write down an
expression for how many

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.590
vacancies you can expect to find
at a given temperature on

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.030
the basis of their formation
energy, OK?

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.530
So let's do that.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.510
This is going to be the fraction
of vacant sites.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.260
So if you have a given
material--

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.930
FCC, BCC, whatever you like--
you know that there's a

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.870
certain number of lattice sites
per unit volume, and you

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.010
learn how to calculate
those things.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.650
And to quantify the number
of vacancies, you have to

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:20.590
basically say, what fraction
of those sites does not

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.390
contain an atom?

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.860
Is that 1/100 of a percent
or is it 1% or how many?

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:32.200
So this is actually going to be
expressed as a ratio, which

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.480
I'm going to call this.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:48.670
This is the number of vacancies
per unit volume and

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:58.195
this is the number of atomic
sites, also per

00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:05.200
unit volume, OK.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.200
So this is the definition of the
fraction of vacant sites.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.420
And how do we express it?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.860
Well, we express it using
a very simple formula.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.590
This formula contains a factor
here which is experimentally

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.110
determined.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.190
This is an empirical factor
and then an exponential.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:32.710
So the exponent we take here,
the vacancy formation energy,

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:38.120
and we divide it by the thermal
energy at the given

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.510
temperature of interest.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.200
So this is actually telling you
that to form vacancies,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.910
you actually have two
competing factors.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:52.130
On the one hand, you have the
bonding energy that makes the

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.540
difficult-to-form vacancies
because you're breaking bonds,

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.810
you're taking it an atom out.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.720
On the other hand, you have this
thermal energy, Boltzmann

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.300
constant times the temperature,
and the thermal

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.210
energy is competing with
that bonding energy.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.640
And when that thermal energy
is high enough, you can

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.740
actually start knocking atoms
out despite the fact that it

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.930
costs you some energy, and
obviously when this ratio is

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.760
very large, that means that the
bonding predominates, and

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.250
when it gets smaller, that means
the thermal energy is

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.560
more and more sufficient to
actually knock atoms out of

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.520
their positions and cause
there to be vacancies.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.500
So when you do these
calculations, make sure to use

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.770
the absolute temperature in
Kelvin, and dimensional

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.180
analysis will tell you the
units of the Boltzmann

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.110
constant have to be energy
units per degrees.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.830
So eV's per Kelvin,
for instance.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.480
So this is the absolute
temperature.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.740
This is the vacancy formation
energy and this is the

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.990
Boltzmann constant.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.910
So what that means is that at
any given temperature, you'll

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.790
actually expect to see some
fraction of vacancies.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.970
So let's actually try to do a
calculation with an actual

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.360
vacancy formation energy and see
how many vacancies we get

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.870
at a given temperature.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:34.830
So to do that, we've been
provided with what is the

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.100
common currency in science,
which is published

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:43.790
experimental data, which we find
from published journals

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.820
which we find online through,
for example, Web of Science.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:54.950
And from this journal, we find
that for copper, the vacancy

00:22:54.950 --> 00:23:04.800
formation energy is 1.03
electron volts.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:11.410
Furthermore, in the same journal
in the abstract there,

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:17.450
you'll find the magnitude of
this constant A, which as I

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.610
told you is experimentally
determined.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.265
This quantity A we call
the entropy factor.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.120
And even though there's no way
to very easily derive it--

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.800
I can't tell you what's the
entropy factor for iron and

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.930
you can't really tell me just
by thinking about it--

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.070
nevertheless, it turns out that
this factor usually fall

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.720
within a certain range.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.590
It's usually between
0.1 and 10.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.810
That's usually the range
and what you find As.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.750
And in the case of copper, it's
very much in that range.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.520
It's just 1.1.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.700
So let's use this information
to actually figure out how

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.840
many vacancies we expect to
see in copper at the given

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.090
temperature.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.040
OK.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.970
So here's my fraction of
vacancies and we know that it

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:30.910
is going to be expressed as 1.1
times exponent minus the

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:36.280
formation energy, which is 1.03
eV, and then we'll put in

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.600
Boltzmann's constant, and then
let's pick a temperature.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.540
For the moment, let's just
take room temperature.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.480
So T, room temperature,
and room

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.760
temperature's about 300 K.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.010
So when we put in all these
numbers, it's just a matter of

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:50.840
calculating.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.960
This is on your sheet
of constants.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.960
This is the temperature which we
choose at room temperature.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:02.940
Let's actually write down T,
room temperature, is about 300

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:08.890
K, and we find a certain
number of vacancies.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:17.880
And the number of vacancies that
we find is 2.19 times 10

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:24.950
to the minus 18 vacancies.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.500
So this is the fraction
of vacant sites.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.840
Well, is that a lot?

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.640
Is that a little?

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.950
How can we determine whether
this is a lot or a little?

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.780
We compare it to the number of
atoms that there actually are,

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:42.190
and in the case of solid
materials, we expect there to

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.010
be something on the order--
this has to be compared to

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.460
something on the order of
Avogadro's number, but we can

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:52.680
actually calculate more
explicitly that this turns out

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.750
to be something like 10
to the 5th vacancies

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.840
per centimeter cubed.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.350
And if in a real material, a
solid material like silicon,

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:10.140
for instance, or boron or
whatever you're interested in,

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.250
your number of atoms is
something like 10 to the 23rd,

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:17.440
Avogadro's number, right,
then this is

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.640
actually a very tiny number.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.180
Compare 10 to the 5th
to 10 to the 23rd.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.610
The number of atoms that are
missing at room temperature is

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.130
very low in copper.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.250
We can compute that using
this expression.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.100
However, even though it's
low, it's not zero.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.440
And if we continue going down
in temperature, we'll find

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.110
that the number is lower and
lower and lower, but it never

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.680
really goes to zero because we
have this expression which

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.580
gives us the total number.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.240
So let's do another one and
this time, let's take a

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.070
different temperature.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.350
Let's take the melting
temperature of copper.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:56.000
The melting temperature of
copper is considerably higher.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.430
It's about 1085 degrees Celsius
and we can go through

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.300
exactly the same calculation.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:11.900
1.1 times all these quantities
here times melting

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.510
temperature, OK?

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:25.100
And when we do this, we get a
vacant site fraction which is

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:35.050
1.67 times 10 to the minus 4 and
that corresponds to 1.41

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.880
times 10 to the 19th vacancies
per centimeter cubed.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.160
So what do we know by--

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.510
what can we see now by
comparing these two

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:47.130
quantities?

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.630
Number of vacancies, add room
temperature, number of

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.440
vacancies at melting
temperature.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.540
How many orders of magnitude
do they differ by?

00:27:54.540 --> 00:28:02.130
Huge difference in the number
of vacancies that we find at

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.200
two different temperatures.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.430
And why do we see such
a huge difference?

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:10.040
Let's actually write down
what that difference is.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.292
Let's write down the ratio.

00:28:12.292 --> 00:28:18.630
The fraction of vacant sites at
melting temperature divided

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:24.170
by fraction of vacant sites at
room temperature is something

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:31.170
like 7.6 times 10 to the 13th.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.640
That's the difference in number
of vacancies you get

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.400
just by increasing the
temperature from room

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.020
temperature to melting
temperature.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.970
Why is that?

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.830
Well, one way to look at that
is just from the expression

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.590
that we have to calculate
the number.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.380
Here's where the temperatures
go.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.180
So any difference in temperature
if it's a factor

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.912
of two or if it's a factor of
three or if it's a factor of

00:28:52.912 --> 00:28:55.740
four, it's going to go
into the exponential.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.340
So that exponential is actually
making a huge

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.600
difference as a function of
temperature in terms of number

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.280
of defects that you get.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.570
The higher you go up
in temperature,

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:04.680
you don't get just--

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.420
you go up a factor of four in
temperature, you don't just

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.560
get a factor of four increase
in the number of defects.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.560
You get that in the
exponential.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.520
So the factor of four is
hugely magnified by the

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.830
exponential.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.490
So that means that at any given
temperature, even the

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.720
lowest temperatures, you expect
to see some defects,

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.310
but if you increase the
temperature, you see a hugely

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.940
larger number of defects.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.580
And you can use this
sort of expression

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.740
for any kind of defect.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.260
So I talked about vacancies
right now and vacancies have a

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.130
specific formation energy, but
interstitials also have

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.380
formation energies,
substitutionals also have

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.160
formation energies.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.940
So you can use this expression
to determine the fraction of

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:48.230
defects per lattice site for any
kind of defect so long as

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.700
you have the formation energy
of that defect.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:54.410
So just to show you how
difficult it is actually to

00:29:54.410 --> 00:30:01.420
remove defects, if you have a
crystalline material, defects

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.645
want to stay even at the
lowest temperatures.

00:30:03.645 --> 00:30:09.600
I have this interesting little
piece of art to show you.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.990
This particular piece of art
was actually discovered, I

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:20.040
guess, by some scientist at
the University of Toronto

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.855
where Dr. Sadoway went to
school, and this particular--

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:27.790
what do they call it?

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.040
They call it The Atomix.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.570
Let me write down the name of it
in case you want to look it

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:38.000
up because I think they sold a
lot more of these to material

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.940
scientists than they sold
to anybody else.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.460
And all this is two plastic
plates, two PMMA plates,

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.320
polymethyl methacrylates,
or plexiglass.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.290
And in between them, there's a
little hole that's cut, a gap,

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:03.330
and in that gap are a number
of ball bearings.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.730
And the ball bearings are kind
of like atom, right, so they

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.940
move around.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.020
And here we're going to the
document camera right now.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.970
So if you shake these things
around and the ball bearings

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:16.270
are moving around, that's like
introducing temperature.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.630
That's like taking a crystal,
melting it, all the atoms are

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.110
bouncing around.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.390
You will even see some vapor
atoms when these sort of leave

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:28.150
the surface and fly through the
air, but then if you stop,

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.850
that's like quenching.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.570
That's like suddenly I've taken
this crystal, which was

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.990
originally molten, and I've
dropped the temperature.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.040
Here's what I see.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.290
So can you see that?

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.910
How to use this thing--

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.600
there we go.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.100
So you can actually see a lot
of the defects that we were

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.680
talking about just
a moment ago.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:03.100
Here you can see areas of
perfect crystalline order.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.570
Here's another area of perfect
crystalline order.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.840
So you have many, many crystals
that are adjacent to

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.760
each other.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.880
They're oriented differently.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.780
So they're forming
misorientation defects between

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.330
themselves.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.960
So for example, here's
a grain boundary.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.830
This is a crystalline grain.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.180
And inside this crystal,
you see a vacancy.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.340
It's right there, So
here's another

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.090
instance of the vacancy.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.140
There's another vacancy.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.540
And what happens if I try to
remove some of the disorder?

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.640
By the way, interesting thing
is that some of the vapor is

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.720
also left here.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.050
So there's the vapor.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.210
If I then try to remove some of
these defects, I can just

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.270
tap on this.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.610
If I just continue to tap on
it, I'm removing defects.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:50.480
The whole thing is crystallizing
more and more

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.180
and more so now I put
it down again.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.730
OK.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.650
You still see the vapor phase.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.820
Now you see a big huge crystal
right here with some grain

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.680
boundaries around it.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.820
Here's another big
huge crystal.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.440
Here's another crystal.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.470
There's a smaller crystal.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.420
Each one of them is bounded by
grain boundaries, but what do

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.450
you see in each of
these crystals?

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.570
There's a vacancy.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:20.510
There's a vacancy.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:21.820
There's a vacancy.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.360
And you can actually
sit here--

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.240
well, not here.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.100
Maybe later, but if you want to
take a look at one of these

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.170
things, you can probably go to
Dr. Sadoway's office and pick

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.110
it up and he'll let you play
with it for a little while.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:36.990
You can try to get all
these vacancies out.

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.860
You can try to get all
the defects out.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.490
No matter how hard you try, if
you spent hours, you'll get

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:46.000
things to be more and more and
more perfect by tapping on it,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.610
but there's always going
to be a vacancy.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:49.090
Always.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:53.560
And even if you are extremely
patient, you get things down

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.850
to just one vacancy and you
think that all you have to do

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.410
now is just give it a little
bit more of a tap to remove

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:03.760
that one vacancy, well, more
often than not, you'll find

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.740
that with that tap you'll remove
the vacancy, but create

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.380
another vacancy somewhere
else.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.500
So you'll always find
these vacancies in

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.750
these crystalline materials.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.230
It's just a consequence of
the fact that when you're

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.630
agitating a material like you're
doing here-- you're

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.620
shaking it--

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.590
that's the same thing that
happens if you have some

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.670
finite temperatures, some
non-zero temperature in the

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.060
material, you're always going
to be creating some defect.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.659
So that's exactly what this
expression is giving you.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:32.770
It's telling you that there's
going to be defects at any

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:36.120
temperature, but their number
goes up dramatically as you

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.160
increase the temperature.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.710
So let's go back to the
slides real quick now.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.550
OK.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:47.620
So everything I've told you so
far is concerned with defects

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.880
in crystals that are of one
type, so that are made up of a

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.010
single element.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:35:01.670
But in the case of, for example,
things like ionic

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.410
crystals, and ionic crystals
are made up of multiple

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:09.730
elements with multiple charge
states, you can get new kinds

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.010
of point defects that
you can't see in a

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.110
single element material.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.250
So we'll talk a little bit about
those and when it comes

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:21.860
to those defects in ionic
materials, we have to expand

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.380
the taxonomy a little bit.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.090
The taxonomy is now going to
include defects called

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.390
Schottky imperfections, Frenkel

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.900
imperfections, and F-centers.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.880
So let's go to a visualization
of what these are.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.690
Here you see an ionic crystal.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.460
So you have alternating types
of atoms. You have these big

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.900
ones, which are presumably the
negatively charge ones, and

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.390
then you have the small
positively charged ones, and

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:53.970
here you have an example of
a Schottky imperfection.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:57.450
So a Schottky imperfection, it's
kind of like a vacancy.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:01.220
It's missing atoms. The main
difference between a Schottky

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:08.600
imperfection and a vacancy by
itself is the fact that in a

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.620
material that involves
charged atoms--

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.420
ions, right--

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.180
in an ionic crystal, when you
take atoms out, you have to

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.980
make sure to maintain
charge neutrality.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.780
So these materials are
charge neutral.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.640
They have equal numbers of
positive and negative ions,

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.290
but you want to make sure
that you take these

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.360
out in equal numbers.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.140
So in the Schottky defect, you
take out one negative and one

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:33.490
positive ion, or basically one
unit, one stoichiometric unit.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.120
If you add zirconium oxide,
which is ZrO2, you would have

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.590
to take out three atoms to
maintain charge neutrality.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.230
That would be the
Schottky defect.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.780
So here is another example,
another visualization of a

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.600
Schottky defect.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.120
So when you take these two atoms
out, nothing says that

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.750
they have to be taken out from
right next to each other.

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.270
You can take out one here.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.870
You can take out one there.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:59.590
It's good both ways because in
the end, it's just about

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:00.380
charge neutrality.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:05.200
It's about maintaining a charge
neutral material.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.350
So we can actually write down
reactions to describe the

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:12.650
formation of these
Schottky defects.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.320
So let's do that.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.260
When we write down reactions to
describe the formation of

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.360
Schottky defects, we first
recognize the fact that we're

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.780
dealing with empty sites.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.770
We're dealing with void.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.560
We want to see how this void,
or in scientific parlance,

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:38.750
null, is decomposed into two
vacant sites in the particular

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.640
ionic crystal that we're
dealing with.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.870
So let's-- to make
things specific,

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:44.650
deal with sodium chloride.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:46.770
So sodium chloride, we
have two type of

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:49.510
atoms. Sodium and chloride.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.880
And to maintain charge
neutrality, we have to remove

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.970
one of each.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:56.350
So this is actually-- this null
space is actually going

00:37:56.350 --> 00:38:00.950
to be composed of two vacancies:
a vacant site on a

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:04.350
sodium lattice where a sodium
atom would have been sitting

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.180
and a vacant site
where a chlorine

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.430
would have been sitting.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:11.570
And because this entire process
takes place in the

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:17.580
presence of materials that
are composed of ions--

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.120
so ionic solids--

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.220
these two vacancies, in fact,
have some charge them.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.900
So when we think about the
charge of these vacancies,

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.200
what we actually have to think
of, it's a little bit

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.070
counterintuitive.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.430
The sodium in a sodium chloride
crystal is charge

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:38.950
positive, but what does
that make the vacancy?

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.180
So if you have a lattice of
atoms that are charge positive

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.110
like the sodium atoms and you
remove one of them, what is

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.560
the effective charge
of that vacancy?

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.180
You have nothing, as Dr.
Sadoway would say,

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.150
in the land of plus.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.780
So the charge of this vacancy,
the effective charge of this

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.960
vacancy, is going
to be negative.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:04.490
And we mark that with this
little thing right there.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:15.695
So void or nothing in land
of plus is negative.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.160
We mark that with one of
these apostrophes.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.010
So what about this vacancy?

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.270
That vacancy is created on a
lattice of sites which are

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.030
usually charge negative.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.500
So if you have these chlorine
atoms that are charged

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.510
negative and you remove one of
them, now you have void in a

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.820
land of plus.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.720
So this is going to be
effectively charge positive

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:47.160
and so we have this void
in land of minus.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.835
It is positive.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:53.290
And we do it--

00:39:53.290 --> 00:40:00.800
we annotate it with
one of these dots.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.960
We can do the same thing for
other kinds of crystals.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.120
So I mentioned that in this
case, a Schottky defect would

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.970
just be composed of these two
atoms, because these two atoms

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.300
constitute the structural
unit for this crystal.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.590
But if we had some other, more
complicated crystal, like, for

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:19.110
examples, zirconium oxide, then
we would still write down

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.680
a similar reaction.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.745
So we could put a Schottky
defect into zirconium oxide.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:31.970
OK.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:34.010
And so now we have to
figure out how this

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:35.000
reaction plays out.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.970
We have to create vacancies.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.680
Here's our vacancy
on the zirconium.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.120
And because the structural unit
contains two oxygens, we

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.700
have to create two
oxygen vacancies.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.460
And now we have to think about
how do we maintain charge

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.570
neutralities?

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:56.960
What is the effective charge
on all of these atoms?

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.600
So the zirconium sites are
usually the positively charged

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.940
atoms, so when we remove one
of them, that's removing

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.820
something, that's putting
void basically

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.990
into the land of plus.

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:14.540
So we have now a negatively
charged vacancy, and this

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.025
negatively charged vacancy has
four negative charges, an

00:41:18.025 --> 00:41:20.250
effective minus 4
negative charge.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.980
And the oxygens are the
negatively charged ions, and

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.745
so when we create voids there,
these two vacancies have an

00:41:25.745 --> 00:41:28.260
effective positive charge, and
because the charges have to

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.700
balance, we know that this has
to be effectively two negative

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.030
charges and there are
two vacancies.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.700
So we have charge neutrality.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:41.230
So that's how the Schottky
defects work.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:42.480
OK.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.920
So let's move on to
Frenkel defects.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.010
In the case of Frenkel defects,
it's really not so

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:54.400
different from Schottky defects
in some sense, except

00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:09.660
now instead of dealing with a
situation where we maintain

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:14.230
charge neutrality by removing
two atoms, we actually

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:19.670
displace one atom from its
initial location to a

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.480
different part of the crystal.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.850
So we're creating actually a
vacancy right there, and this

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:27.800
atom, which was originally
sitting on a lattice site, is

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.730
now displaced to an interstitial
location.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.310
So that's an interstitial.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:34.620
So a Frenkel defect is a vacancy
and an interstitial.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.940
And here's another view
of a Frenkel defect.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:42.790
Here, I've removed an atom from
one of the lattice sites

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:44.810
and moved it over to here.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.230
So that's my Frenkel defect.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:57.020
And in the case of Frenkel
defects I can also write down

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.780
reactions for Frenkel defects.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.170
Let's do that.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.120
OK.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.840
So Frenkel defects usually occur
in crystals with widely

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:25.630
differing atomic radii, and in
ionic crystals, the radius of

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:32.060
whatever is positively charged
would have to be much, much

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.800
less than whatever the radius
of whatever's negatively

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:39.840
charged occasionally, or very
rarely, but I suppose it's

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:44.230
still possible, you would have
to have basically a very big

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.110
difference in radius between
these two cases.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.380
An example of one of these
situations is, for example,

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:54.990
silver bromide, where here the
silver's positively charged

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:59.470
and the bromide ion is
negatively charged.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:04.710
And we can write down a reaction
to describe the

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.390
Frenkel defect formation just
like we did in the case of the

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.980
Schottky defect formation.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.020
So in the case of a Frenkel
defect formation, how do we

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.490
actually go about this?

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:19.830
We have, for example, can start
out with a silver atom

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.760
site and we're going to displace
that silver atom away

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.470
from its original site so it
now sits in an interstitial

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:30.450
position and we're going to
leave behind a vacancy.

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:31.700
So let's do that.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:35.760
OK.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:47.400
So we're going to have silver
interstitial site and let's

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.070
just be clear--

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:52.450
say that this is on a
regular silver site.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:59.740
And then we have a vacancy left
over on the silver site

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.400
and this is the reaction
for the formation

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.850
of our Frenkel defect.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.300
Frenkel defects, just like
Schottky defects, preserve

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.600
charge neutrality.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.630
So how do we actually
mark down charge

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:10.600
neutrality in this case?

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:15.405
Well, there's no change in
charges in the original state

00:45:15.405 --> 00:45:17.550
so we'll just mark
that with an X.

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:22.390
And the vacancy is sitting in
a place that used to be

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.940
positive so it's a hole in the
land of positive so we know

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.960
that this one's going
to be negative.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:31.930
And this silver ion, which was
displaced from its original

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:35.360
lattice site, is now going to be
sitting in an interstitial

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.680
site which was originally
a land of zero.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.380
So this one's going to
be charged positive.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.530
And now we've balanced, once
again, this reaction.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:44.580
We have charge neutrality.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:48.500
We've created a defect and this
is defect, just like in

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.490
the case of vacancies, costs
us energy to make.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.000
So we can actually write
down a formation

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.200
energy for Frenkel defects.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.270
And this formation energy is
usually a little bit higher

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:12.030
than the formation energy of
vacancies so it's going to be

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:14.450
something more perhaps
on the order of 2 eV.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:19.800
OK.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.430
So we have gone through--

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:29.580
before I go to this one, let
me just mention one last

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.080
defect that you might run into
if you're working in ionically

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:34.990
bonded materials.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:38.900
An F-center is a situation where
you have a vacancy with

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.620
a bound electron inside of it.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:44.850
And F-centers have the property
that they give

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.340
ceramics a tint, a hue.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.970
They actually scatter light
in the visible range

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:53.320
so you can see them.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.330
So with a very short amount of
time left, I wanted to tell

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:59.125
you about a couple of the other
defects that you will

00:46:59.125 --> 00:47:01.380
encounter in crystals and one
of the most interesting ones

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:06.590
to me is the dislocation and
dislocations are line defects.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.640
They're 1D defects.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.280
So if you look in, for example,
a corn ear right

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.470
here, you can see dislocations
as the termination of a single

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:18.280
atomic plane.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.050
So here's a picture of
what a dislocation

00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:22.520
looks like in a crystal.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.620
You have these atomic planes
and here you have

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:25.990
one that just ends.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.320
That's a dislocation.

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.280
Some of you probably have
dislocations in your

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.460
fingerprints.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.210
So after the class is over, you
can look for dislocations

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:35.520
in your fingerprints.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.580
They're line defects.

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.280
So here's another
example of that.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:45.350
You see that there's an
extraatomic plane which ends.

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:47.370
That's a dislocation.

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:49.930
We mark it with one
of these Ts.

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.520
Here's a picture of
a dislocation.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.420
Dislocations actually help
materials to deform easily

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:01.670
without having to shear off.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.600
Here's a little picture of
mine which I really like.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.880
This is the only way that people
really had to study

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.030
dislocations before
computers existed.

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:13.630
So now we can study, for
example, dislocation by

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:15.760
simulating them in
real crystals.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.100
And this is a mid-20th
century computer.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.080
It's a raft of bubbles.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.350
It's just a bunch of bubbles
that somebody blew on the

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.590
surface, soap bubbles, and
you can deform them.

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:31.770
You can deform this raft of
bubbles by shearing it and

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.020
here you see--

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.090
what's wrong?

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.340
Why isn't it going?

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.370
There it is.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:56.320
There's your dislocation running
through and you see

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.070
lots of dislocations running
through this crystal.

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:03.840
This was, by the way, done by
Lawrence Bragg, who you heard

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.430
about in connection with
x-ray scattering.

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:09.990
You'll hear about Bragg again
when we get to DNA.

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:11.900
So keep him in mind.
