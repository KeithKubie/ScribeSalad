00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:01.506
- [Voiceover] So they're asking us to find

00:00:01.506 --> 00:00:03.107
the least common multiple

00:00:03.107 --> 00:00:06.106
of these two different polynomials.

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:07.488
So the first one's three z to the third

00:00:07.488 --> 00:00:09.850
minus six z squared minus nine z

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.592
and the second is seven z to the fourth

00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:16.276
plus 21 z to the third plus 14 z squared.

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:17.665
Now, if you're saying, "Well, what is a,"

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:19.177
you're familiar with least common multiple

00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:21.528
of two numbers.

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:22.466
One way to think about them

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.328
is if I were to find, say,
the least common multiple

00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:29.763
between, I don't know, four and six,

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.325
you literally could look
at all the multiples

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:33.876
and see which one is least.

00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:38.876
So you go four, eight,
12, 16, so on and forth.

00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:40.586
You're gonna do the same thing for six.

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:44.225
You'd go six, 12,

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:48.125
18, 24, so on and so forth.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:49.647
And you immediately see that they do have,

00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:52.562
they'll actually have
multiple common multiples,

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.018
but the least of the common multiples

00:00:55.018 --> 00:00:59.109
you immediately see is going to be 12.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.761
Now another way to think about it

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.603
is to actually factor these numbers out.

00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:05.152
We could view four,

00:01:05.152 --> 00:01:08.908
you could view four as being two times two

00:01:08.908 --> 00:01:10.912
if we look at its prime factorization.

00:01:10.912 --> 00:01:15.912
And six is two times three.

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:18.545
So you could say that the
least common multiple,

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:22.535
the LCM, of four and six

00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:24.545
is going to be,

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.357
well, it's gonna be equal to,

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:29.191
we're gonna have to have
the factors of both of them.

00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.665
So it's gonna have to have
two fours, two times two.

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:34.488
It's gonna have to have a two and a three.

00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:35.705
Well we already have a two.

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:36.896
In fact, we have to them.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.432
So in order to be divisible
by three, we have to be,

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.461
in order to be divisible by six,

00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.277
we have to have three
as one of the factors.

00:01:44.277 --> 00:01:45.319
And so when you look at it that way,

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.241
you say, "Hey look, we have to contain

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:48.672
"all of the factors of each,"

00:01:48.672 --> 00:01:50.684
we have to have at least two twos

00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:52.993
and we have to have at least one three

00:01:52.993 --> 00:01:54.685
because the two twos
take care of this one too

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:55.676
right over there.

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:58.888
And you see that this is
also going to be equal to 12.

00:01:58.888 --> 00:02:00.393
Now when we think about
it for polynomials,

00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:02.235
we're gonna think about
it a little bit more.

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:04.324
It's essentially the same idea,

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.596
but we're gonna think
about it a little bit more

00:02:05.596 --> 00:02:06.663
with the second lens.

00:02:06.663 --> 00:02:08.325
We're gonna think about the factors

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:10.007
and say, well the least common multiple

00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:12.159
needs to contain the factors of both

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.071
but it shouldn't contain more than that.

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.538
You can always find a
multiple of two polynomials

00:02:16.538 --> 00:02:18.029
by just multiplying them,

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.581
but we don't wanna find just any multiple.

00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:21.773
We wanna find the least common multiple.

00:02:21.773 --> 00:02:24.004
So let's factor each of them.

00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:27.546
So this first one, three z to the third

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:30.678
minus six z squared minus nine z.

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:32.180
Let's see. Immediately, let's see,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.568
all of these terms are
divisible by three z,

00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:36.459
so let's factor out of three z.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.361
So it's three z times z squared.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.363
We factor out of three z out of that.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:46.299
See, it's gonna be minus two z

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.425
if we factor out of three z out of that.

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:51.571
And then minus three.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.420
And notice, if you were to
distribute this three z back,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.843
you would get exactly
what we have up here.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.945
And so let's see, can
we factor this further?

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.287
Can we think of two numbers

00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:02.409
that if we multiply, we get negative three

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.831
and if we add them, we get negative two?

00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:06.636
And one's gonna be positive,
one's gonna be negative

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:08.368
since the product is negative.

00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:10.964
So let's see. It sounds
like negative three

00:03:10.964 --> 00:03:12.425
and positive one.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:15.181
So we can rewrite this as three z

00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:19.058
times z plus one

00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:22.192
times z minus three.

00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:25.525
I think I have factored
this first polynomial

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:27.704
about as much as I can.

00:03:27.704 --> 00:03:30.090
One times negative
three is negative three.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.480
One z minus three z is negative two z,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.644
so that looks good.

00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:36.386
So now let's factor,

00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:38.385
now let's factor this
other character over here,

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.201
this fourth degree polynomial.

00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.096
So, every one of those terms

00:03:43.096 --> 00:03:46.292
look like they're visible
by seven z squared,

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.975
so I could write this as seven z squared

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:51.594
times z squared.

00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:53.233
If we factor out of seven z squared here,

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.295
you're just left with z squared.

00:03:55.295 --> 00:03:57.784
And then plus,

00:03:57.784 --> 00:03:59.876
21 divided by seven is three,

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:03.439
z to the third divided by z squared is z.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.016
And then plus, 14 divided by seven is two.

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:08.258
z squared divided by z squared is one.

00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:10.140
So it's just gonna be a two there.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.256
And so this is gonna be the
same thing as seven z squared.

00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:16.699
And this can be factored into, let's see,

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.204
two times one is two,
two plus one is three.

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:22.585
So, z plus one

00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:25.845
times z plus two.

00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:27.757
Now let's think about the
least common multiple.

00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:30.303
We've factored each of
these just the way that we,

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:32.342
when we did the prime
factorization for regular numbers.

00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:33.743
Now we have factored this down

00:04:33.743 --> 00:04:38.743
to simpler expressions
as we will find useful.

00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:41.925
And so, the least common
multiple of these two things

00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:45.518
has to contain each of these factors.

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:49.928
So the least common multiples
got to contain a three z.

00:04:49.928 --> 00:04:52.492
It's got to contain,

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.064
and let me expand it out a little bit.

00:04:54.064 --> 00:04:55.565
It's got to contain a three.

00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:57.766
It's got to contain a z.

00:04:57.766 --> 00:05:01.508
It's gotta contain a z plus one,

00:05:01.508 --> 00:05:04.048
z plus one.

00:05:04.048 --> 00:05:06.320
I don't have to write
the little dot there.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.342
It's got to contain a z plus one.

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:13.084
It's gotta contain a z minus three.

00:05:13.084 --> 00:05:15.155
Let's see. It's gotta contain a seven.

00:05:15.155 --> 00:05:17.487
We do not have a seven here yet,

00:05:17.487 --> 00:05:21.240
so we have to include a seven,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.983
so I'll put the seven out
front with the numbers.

00:05:23.983 --> 00:05:25.474
It's gotta include a seven.

00:05:25.474 --> 00:05:28.618
It's gotta include a z squared.

00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:30.100
Well we only have a z right now,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.131
so let's throw in another z.

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:34.347
So I could throw in
another, I could write,

00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:35.405
I could put a z out front

00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:37.177
or I could just make this a squared.

00:05:37.177 --> 00:05:39.849
It still contains that z,
but now we contain another z,

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.796
or multiplying by another
z to have z squared.

00:05:42.796 --> 00:05:45.184
See, we already have a z plus one in here.

00:05:45.184 --> 00:05:47.346
We need a z plus two as well,

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:49.789
z plus two as well.

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:50.680
And there you have it.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.892
This is the least common multiple.

00:05:51.892 --> 00:05:53.614
If I were to write it all
out in a neutral color,

00:05:53.614 --> 00:05:57.356
it's gonna be 21 z squared

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:59.565
times z plus one

00:05:59.565 --> 00:06:02.334
times z minus three

00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:04.635
times z plus two

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:06.787
(chuckle) I say two and I write six.

00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:08.501
z plus two.

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:10.496
And we are all done.

00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:11.348
And I really want you to appreciate.

00:06:11.348 --> 00:06:12.880
This is the exact same thing we're doing

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.011
when we're doing,

00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:15.443
a very similar thing than what we're doing

00:06:15.443 --> 00:06:17.005
when we're finding these common multiples

00:06:17.005 --> 00:06:19.936
of regular numbers,
looking at their factors.

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:22.039
In the case of numbers, prime factors.

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.531
And then we say, "Okay.
The least common multiple

00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:27.790
"has to be a superset, has
to contain all of these,

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.078
"but we don't wanna contain,"

00:06:29.078 --> 00:06:32.545
you know, I could multiply
this times a hundred,

00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:34.574
it's still gonna be a common
multiple of these two,

00:06:34.574 --> 00:06:36.376
but it's no longer the
least common multiple.

00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:39.716
Likewise, 12 is the least
common multiple of four and six.

00:06:39.716 --> 00:06:40.658
If I just wanted a common multiple,

00:06:40.658 --> 00:06:41.920
I can multiply that times a hundred,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.042
1200 would also be a
multiple of four and six,

00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:46.824
but it wouldn't be the
least common multiple,

00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:49.308
so we don't wanna do that.

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.086
Hopefully you found that interesting.
