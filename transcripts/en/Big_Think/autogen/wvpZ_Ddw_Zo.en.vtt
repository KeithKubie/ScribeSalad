00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370
well one thing that occurred to me as I
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.220

wanted to do something fun with the
 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.170
wanted to do something fun with the
movie and the first thing I thought was

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
movie and the first thing I thought was
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.630
movie and the first thing I thought was
you know what I don't want to have to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640
you know what I don't want to have to
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.199
you know what I don't want to have to
deal with how he got into this situation

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209
deal with how he got into this situation
 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.179

I don't want to deal with a some kind of

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189
I don't want to deal with a some kind of
 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.360

supernatural reason that he was stuck in

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370
supernatural reason that he was stuck in

the same day because then the movie

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870

the same day because then the movie
becomes about the plot of his getting

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700
becomes about the plot of his getting
 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.500
becomes about the plot of his getting
out from under it instead of about the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510
out from under it instead of about the
 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.149
out from under it instead of about the
that existential quality of how does he

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159
that existential quality of how does he
 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.869
that existential quality of how does he
just deal with it and so I thought why

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.399
just deal with it and so I thought why
