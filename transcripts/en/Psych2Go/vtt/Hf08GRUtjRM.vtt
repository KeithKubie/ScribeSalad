00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.220
Lust has a reputation for being the flame we jump into!

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Think of Fifty Shades of Grey or your classic bad boy or bad girl, who's all games in danger with no strings attached.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.149
But according to leading love expert Dr. Helen Fisher-
lust is the essential first stage of love.

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.099
Without the desire of wanting someone first,
we cannot experience intimacy.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.600
So, how do we know if we're still stuck in the initial stage of attraction,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.049
Or ready to transition into something more 
meaningful and long-lasting?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.360
Here are

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.400
6 Key Differences Between 
Lust versus Love

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.000
One, lust is driven by physical connection, but love comes from emotional connection.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.899
It all comes down to our brain.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.249
Which areas are being activated
when you hang out with your partner?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.520
Research shows that lust lights of the regions associated with reward and motivation

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.120
Whereas love stimulates the areas that help you empathize.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.409
Lust happens when you and your partner don't
have much to talk about but have great sex.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.949
This is common for two people who haven't
been dating for too long.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.229
But love on the other hand happens when you appreciate your partner for more than just their looks, and can spend meaningful time with them.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.600
This is what ultimately forms the start
of a deep and serious relationship.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.960
Two, overtime love grows stronger, 
whereas lust becomes weaker.

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.468
Psychologist and sex therapist Shannon Chavez states that as attachment and bonding grow over time

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.240
So does love.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.529
But lust is more temporary and fades
when sexual desire fades away.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.889
If a relationship is based solely on lust, there is inevitably no foundation to fall in love with each other

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.769
Lust feels like an exciting roller coaster

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.700
But can only be sustained by physical pleasure.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.259
When the real work kicks in
 the dynamic either

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.000
transitions into love or 
the relationship begins to fall apart.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.580
Three, lust is based on fantasies.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.080
Love however operates on the ground of reality

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.220
Have you ever looked back on past relationships and wondered how on earth you two got together?

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.220
I don't know about you, but I sure do.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.320
Imagination can come in handy when life gets mundane, but more often than not it's like a double-edged sword.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.960
When you like the idea of someone
 more than who's actually in front of you

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.880
It can cause you to miss a lot of red flags.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.620
Relationship experts state that there
is only so much time before

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.320
Reality sets in it makes you realize that 
your partner has faults just like you

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.399
And that your expectations were unfair.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.649
Four, in lust, you are romantic partners, 
but in love, you're lifelong friends.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.120
Psychiatrist Judith Orloff discovered 
that people in lust are just lovers

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.640
But true love is built on the foundation 
of a strong friendship.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.760
Sure!

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.690
Two people can agree to be in a relationship,
 go on fun dates, and even meet each other's family,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.240
But if they lack compromise, communicate poorly, and fail to understand each other

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.080
The prospect of having a future together is very low.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.860
Five, lust is all about thrill seeking 
whereas love is the pursuit of stability.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.700
Researchers have looked at
MRI scans of people in lust

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.320
And found that their brains look similar when 
an addict gets a fix of cocaine.

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.090
Sounds intense, right?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.979
But that's why infatuation is not
likely to last as long as love.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.920
The drug effects wear off when you can no 
longer satiate your sexual desires.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.240
Whereas lust is about instant gratification,
 love is the relentless search for stability.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.070
Six, lust is selfish but love comes from a selfless place.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.349
When you love someone, you focus more on helping them reach their goals and care about their health and well-being.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.600
Lust, on the other hand, is all about your own wants-
like boosting your ego when you're next to your attractive partner

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.960
Or simply fulfilling your sexual desires.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.600
In order to move from the initial stage of lust to love, you must determine whether you could see yourself doing favors

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.480
Or making sacrifices for your partner.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.200
Do you think you're in lust or in love?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.840
We hope that this video helped you differentiate between the two.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.240
Remember that just because you might only be experiencing lust, doesn't mean that your feelings can't develop into love
