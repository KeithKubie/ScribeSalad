00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.410
So there's a fairly well established procedure for cleaning

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.650
data. Now, the specifics are going to very from one

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.370
situation to another, but the overall process remains the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.280
same. Here, we're going to go through this blueprint, or procedure.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.150
And then immediately following this discussion, we'll look at

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.080
a concrete example following this blueprint. So, the first step

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.800
is to audit your data. Now, in this step

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.200
what you'll be doing is programatically checking the data using

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.160
some validation rules you've written, and you'll create a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.810
report on the quality of the data. Now, you

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.670
might also want to run a statistical analysis in

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.620
order to, for example. check for outliers. Having run your

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.220
audit, then you use that information to create a

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.210
data cleaning plan. In our data cleaning plan, we

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.400
want to identify any causes of the dirty data

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.240
that we're seeing. Now, this is going to be very situation-specific.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.080
Then we're going to define a set of operations that

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.560
will correct our data, again, situation-specific. And finally what you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.220
want to do, is run a few tests to make sure

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.090
that your data cleaning plan is going to do what you need

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.090
it to do. Next we're going to execute the plan.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.100
Now just to be clear, this is essentially running a script

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.350
that will execute that set of operations you defined in

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.010
the data cleaning plan. Now it's possible, in fact it's likely,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.580
that we won't have been able to programatically clean our

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.620
data entirely. And if it's necessary for you to do

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.360
so, there maybe a manual correction step, where you go

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.680
through, or you hire someone to go through, and make

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.420
any changes that need a human eye in order to

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.260
correct the data. Now, again this is another process where

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.650
we have humans involved, so once we've gone through all

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.050
this, it makes a lot of sense, in my opinion,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.991
to iterate on this, possibly more than two

00:01:43.991 --> 00:01:46.570
iterations, until you have confidence in your data.
