[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.950
ED BACHER: Good afternoon.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.250
Thanks for coming,
and I'm just going

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.280
to give a very brief
introduction to this talk.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.680
We want to welcome Jet Lowe, who
has been a photographer for--

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.920
he's retired now, but has been
a photographer for the Historic

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.922
American Building--

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:26.854
JET LOWE: Survey.

00:00:26.854 --> 00:00:30.710
ED BACHER: --Survey and the
Historic American Engineering

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.750
Record for many years.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.600
I discovered his
work browsing around

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.440
online at the Library of
Congress and spent lots of time

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.140
and started corresponding with
him a few years ago and said,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.990
hey, if you're ever
out in California,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.900
come on over to Google
and show us your stuff.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.375
So without further ado, I
want to introduce Jet Lowe.

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.097
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.104 --> 00:00:56.770
JET LOWE: Hello.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.080
It's a great pleasure to be
here to give a talk to Google.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.330
I feel in some ways that
the program I work for

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.810
is part of an antecedent
to the kind of things

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.670
that Google does in making
information about things

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.120
free to everyone, because the
program I worked for was called

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.940
the Historic
American Engineering

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.620
Record and our mandate was
to document the technology

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.530
of the built environment.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.680
Historic technology,
as I like to say,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.130
from wind mills to steel mills
to even the shuttle discoverer.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.660
And this program has
all the documentation

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.820
that I did over a 35 year period
of time becomes public domain

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.210
and becomes a primary
resource for people

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.420
across the country researching
the American architecture

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.270
and engineering.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.490
And that program originated
in the Library of Congress,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.720
which was founded by Thomas
Jefferson in the interest

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.440
of making information as
accessible to the public

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.310
as much as possible.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.730
So what I would like to
do is go back a little bit

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.190
and talk about my
background as a photographer

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.630
and even the origins
of photography itself,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.160
because a lot of people think
of photography as started--

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.970
as a large format
five by seven--

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.480
five inches by seven
inch plate that I shot--

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.530
the information
that film can record

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.090
on a piece of film--
and they still

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.560
shoot film at the Historic
American Engineering Record.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.420
If you record that
information at the--

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.070
if you scan it, you have
information that you can--

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.010
the optical resolution--

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.860
it creates around a
two-gigabyte file for one image.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.270
So there's a lot of information
stored on a piece of film

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.190
and that's why we plan
on continuing using film

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.820
as our base of documentation
because it's a lot less

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.060
expensive to maintain than
if it were digital only

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.080
to begin with, with all the
redundancy that you need to--

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.970
as you all probably know--

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.020
to protect data.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.470
So if you've got a film origin
and you scan that, then you

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.360
use the digital scan to
access the information,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.420
you only need to go
to the film just maybe

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.600
a couple of times in a lifetime,
but the data on the film

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.790
can last 300 or 400 years
without any further ado.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.810
I like to talk about the
origins of photography.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.490
I mean, photography and
the optical ways of looking

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.270
at things goes back pretty much
to the Renaissance when ideas

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.360
of the classics-- the Greeks
about perspective and optics--

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.839
were being reawakened as that
information that were actually

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:24.130
saved by the Arabs and then it
was re-translated into Latin

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.920
in the 13th, 14th, 15th century.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.640
And the artist scientists
became very interested

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.610
in single-point
perspective because it

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.090
was thought of as
almost a virtual reality

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.670
way, that if you could
make events look more

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.880
realistic to the way our
eyes perceive things,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.190
then you could make a much
more convincing image.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.965
What I'm showing here is
a very famous experiment

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:02.260
that's been described
as sort of the patron

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.990
saint of modern engineering, a
guy named Filippo Brunelleschi,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.800
and it's a perspective
experiment.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.560
But what makes optical
perspective in photography work

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.540
is that you're looking at
things through a single lens

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.990
and that puts everything
into perspective.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.300
What he did is he did a very
realistic single point of view

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.850
painting on a mirrored surface,
which you can see here,

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.350
and then he would look at
it through this peephole

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.620
at the vanishing point
of the perspective

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.860
and then compare that
by dropping the mirror

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.210
and looking at the object
that he was trying to render.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.990
So this is the
baptistry that he was

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.990
trying to depict in a
realistic form of perspective.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.230
This is an image made by
a gentleman who studied

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.250
these experiments very closely.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.220
And then this is where
the point of view

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.620
was made of the
baptistery in Florence.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.880
And here's the significant
thing that he was trying to do--

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.000
if you can render images--

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.300
three-dimensional
images-- realistically

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.680
and proportionately on a
flat piece of surface--

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.690
on a two-dimensional surface--

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.490
you can make plans for
things in your mind's eye

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.910
that are much more efficient
and much more realistic.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.480
You can work out your ideas.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.610
So it was a form of thinking
that we worked on artistically

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.000
and scientifically
for 400 or 500 years,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.040
and they're still
doing to this day

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.830
when we do laser scanning
and that kind of thing.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.410
Basically, when
you're doing that,

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.760
you're pinpointing the
location of all these millions

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.600
of spots in a cloud when
you're scanning a building

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.240
or structure.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.850
I managed to get over
to Florence, Italy.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.080
I've been studying these
experiments and the history

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.450
of perspective, and
it interested me

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:34.170
quite a bit as it related to
photography because basically

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.200
viewing things
optically took place

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.960
several hundred years
before they figured out how

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.750
to actually fix these images.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.675
And this is the baptistry
as seen about at midnight

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:50.410
in Florence in 2011.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.830
It's so crowded there
in the springtime

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.750
that photographing
it in the daytime

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.250
is really actually
quite difficult.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.570
Now if you turn around
from this point of view,

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:06.460
you'll see the facade of the
cathedral, the Santa Maria del

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.860
Fiore, and you can
see the enormous scale

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.240
of this structure.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.200
And what Brunelleschi
was very famous for doing

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.920
is he built this enormous
dome without using

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.960
any internal scaffolding.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.240
He used false work
around the edge

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.420
and used a very complex kind
of weave of bricks and stone

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.851
to hold this thing
together as it went up.

00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:35.850
And here's another view.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:40.880
You can see the-- just notice
the people on the bottom here

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.830
and it gives you a sense of
the size of this structure.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.930
This is around 1450.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.900
So it's one of the most
significant buildings in Europe

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.460
in a way in terms of structural
engineering and the machines

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.530
and devices that he invented
to get things up and hoist

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:07.770
the material up to the dome to
continue with the construction.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.400
So basically what
I've been doing

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.980
as a documentary
photographer for these years

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.600
is, all of these
different structures

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.225
that I've photographed,
whether they're

00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:19.650
in Europe or in
the United States,

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.900
I like to think of
them as kind of portals

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.210
into history or memory.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.530
When you lose a structure,
when you scrape a building,

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:33.290
that kind of memory of that
structure is gone forever.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.810
And here is a young man who
had the same notion as me.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:42.400
He was kind of paying his
obeisance to the dome.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.060
That's called the Giotto tower.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.620
Giotto was an artist who
preceded Brunelleschi

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.610
by about 40 or 50 years
and in whose art you first

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.530
start seeing the beginnings
of a perspectival system

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:04.730
of rendering images.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.970
Not long after-- about
100 years after this--

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:13.340
you start getting camera
obscuras, where artists start

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.480
using the projection
created by a lens

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.350
onto a surface to
create drawings.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.020
And by the 16th
and 17th centuries,

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.300
you'll even notice
optical phenomenon

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.400
in paintings such as
like the art of Vermeer,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.520
where they recorded these
optical phenomena that you

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.980
would not see with your
own eyes necessarily

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.820
but are created by a certain
slight area of the image

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.050
being out of focus.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.730
So we have photography
for a number of centuries

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.080
before the chemists figure
out how to fix the image.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.300
They notice that light
hitting silver halide

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.660
causes it to darken, but they
couldn't quite figure out

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.820
how to stop that action.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.120
When they do that, that's
when you get the birth

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.120
of photography as we know it.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:13.280
I want to make some mention
about how these perspectives

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.900
and how these optical devices
gets to be systematized

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.790
and then artists
start learning how

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.790
to make many other
kinds of projections.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:29.690
And this is very soon after
the Brunelleschi experiments,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.910
but you will see often that
this kind of system of thinking

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:39.170
is often used in computer works
when they're trying to render

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.020
even like facial recognition--

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.735
looking for certain points
on the face and the eyes

00:11:44.735 --> 00:11:47.340
to measure distances
and things--

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.850
and it all goes back to this
particular period of time.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:57.470
This single point of
view enabled architects

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.250
and designers to figure out
the proportional relationships

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.640
of buildings as they would
fit together in a plan.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.730
And this is showing how all
these diagonals are converging

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.095
on a single point of view.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.820
As an architectural
photographer,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.010
with a view camera,
you learn how

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.680
to actually move that
vanishing point around,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.920
and that's one of the things
that gives a unique look

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.990
to a large format images.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.850
Again, with perspective,
with design, this

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.060
enables you to do handbooks--

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.990
show how parts are
related to each other.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.820
And that's the one thing that I
found the most difficult thing

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.330
to do photographically, because
photography sort of deals

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.230
with surface and
appearance that it's

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.430
very difficult to
accomplish that,

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:58.550
but when you mix photographs
with measured drawings,

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.120
such as done by the Historic
American Engineering Record,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.290
then you get a real mixture.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.630
One of the things that's
going on these days

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.030
that I find slightly
distressing is

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:16.790
that historic preservationists
are getting very adept at using

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.500
these laser scanners to record
very precise measurements

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.590
and shapes of things
and they can even

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:31.040
put a skin on these drawing
with photographs, but in a way,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.910
there's no interpretation
of them because of that.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.410
Maybe they will evolve some
kind of interpretation,

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.250
but I think-- as a black
and white photographer,

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.010
I think one of the things I
enjoyed so much over the years

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.850
was sort of try and
look at these things

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.636
and see what the
soul of them was.

00:13:51.636 --> 00:13:54.320
So one of my first
what I regarded

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.500
as kind of a successful
image, but you can see,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.500
here I am using that
vanishing point perspective.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.640
And this type of view is
very elemental to most

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.850
architectural
photography in that

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.790
almost all architectural
photographers start

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.860
with an elevation.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.670
Of any building
they're photographing,

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.836
they're going to photograph
the principal elevation.

00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:23.180
In a way, they're
searching for the views

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.570
that the architect is
intending to orient you as you

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.510
walk through the building.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.850
You can see in this
campus that we're on,

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.230
there's a lot of very
intentional design

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.090
in how the architects want you
to flow through the buildings

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.345
and experience the other spaces.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:50.050
I started my photography
rather unusually.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.120
I mean, I had not really--

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.620
I was not like an adolescent
photographer or anything,

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:02.470
but I was a freshman
in college and we

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.190
had these independent study
periods which have become very

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.750
common in a lot of colleges.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.450
I mean, they almost
all have January terms.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.380
The school I went to had two
independent study periods

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.750
a year of one month long.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.030
And in my freshman
year of college,

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.160
I got the opportunity
to go to Haiti.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.135
I mostly wanted to go there
to practice my French.

00:15:25.135 --> 00:15:31.940
And a professor said, take
my Pentax camera with you.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.000
And so I did.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.400
I rolled up 20 rolls
of black and white film

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.820
and 10 or 15 rolls of
Kodachrome and found myself

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.120
photographing the architecture
as much as anything.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.180
I did get some nice people
photographs but those certainly

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.725
weren't my strongest images, but
as I went over these images--

00:15:53.725 --> 00:15:56.590
and I came across
these negatives

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.730
in one of my shoe
boxes just last summer

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.230
and scanned just to
see what I had there,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.805
and I was surprised at how
architectural they were.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.050
But let me identify this.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:19.210
This is in Cap-Haitien,
the northern part of Haiti.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:24.682
This is a wonderful dome church.

00:16:24.682 --> 00:16:27.340
I forget what the
exact name of it

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:32.860
but it's in the-- it's
the Cathedral de Milao,

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.480
built in 1805--

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:40.090
just almost sort of at the
end of the Haitian revolution.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.460
And it's sort of interesting
these connections--

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.070
these disparate connections
between places--

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:50.200
but the French did
not sort of willingly

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.240
give up Haiti as a colony.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:58.045
It was their wealthiest
colony by far.

00:16:58.045 --> 00:17:05.050
But basically, malaria
beat the French soldiers,

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:14.619
and at the time, Jefferson was
very interested in achieving

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.859
sort of at least to guard
the Mississippi Valley

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:24.460
and they went to France to
negotiate for just New Orleans.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.520
They were interested in
that just to kind of protect

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.610
to keep the British from being
able to go up the Mississippi

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.600
River.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.320
And in the negotiations,
they said, well,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.400
how would you like
just sort of the rest

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.300
of the French territory?

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.080
And so basically half the
country was purchased,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.850
and we can thank the Haitians
for that in many ways.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.830
Going further into
Cap-Haitien, this

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:59.410
is a wonderful palace
that was heavily damaged.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.710
This was built by
King Christophe.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.680
It was called Sans-Souci.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.820
It's just south of Cap-Haitien.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.710
These shots were done
in 1966, by the way.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.500
This was under the
Papa Doc regime.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.680
I had a month to travel around.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.330
And I guess the thing
that really seduced me

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.000
to photography in some
ways is that I found myself

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.490
ending up in places I just
ordinarily wouldn't end up in.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:36.490
And I like to sort of
promote photography to people

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:41.290
as a way to slow down
your visitation to a place

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.990
rather than speeding it up.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.850
I'm sure you've been
to the national parks

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.540
where people jump out of the
car, photograph half dome,

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.030
jump back in the car,
go to the next site,

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.450
but photography can
also be sort of a more

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.410
meditative and a slowing
down process as a way

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.150
to explore areas as well.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.870
And that's the way I like
to think of it and maybe

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.860
that's why I've always liked
large format photography.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.070
And even though I am currently
shooting a lot digitally,

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:16.930
I try to use it in a
more meditative way.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.810
Going up the hill
from Sans-Souci

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:27.810
is the largest fortress in
North America, the Citadel de la

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.870
Ferriere, and it was built by
King Christophe out of fear

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.350
that the French might return
and try and take away,

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.100
but really, the
malaria did them in

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.655
and they were probably exhausted
from all of Napoleon's doings

00:19:42.655 --> 00:19:48.180
in Moscow and everywhere
else at that time.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.180
And here's further up.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.850
This structure has
been much stabilized

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:58.200
since I photographed it in '66.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.420
I think they've kind
of lined up the cannons

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.690
and probably pointed up
the mortar a little bit

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:08.890
but it was quite
a wonderful sight.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.560
And here's a little piece
of mortar just sitting

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:17.320
there waiting for the French to
come back, but they never did.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.370
The photographers that I sort
of look up to and think back

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.140
on the most are like
the French masters

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.820
who conducted major surveys.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.860
This is the French
photographer Baldus,

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.030
and there were the great
American William Henry Jackson

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.770
and numerous other
great photographers

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.380
that did surveys
of the West that

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.410
are credited with the founding
of the National Park Service

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.170
with the work that they did.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:58.280
And back when I was doing
research at the Library

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.810
of Congress back in the '60s--

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.160
the prints and
photographs division

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.390
is a great place to visit
if you love photography

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:12.800
because you used to have to
submit copyrights to them.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:17.120
They started amassing a
major photographic collection

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.390
in the early 20th century.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.460
So they've got the Arnold
Genthe of the San Francisco

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.200
earthquake and these
great photographs there,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.540
and those images are what
have always inspired me

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.300
in terms of image
quality and just

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.450
the substance of the
photographs that they take.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.290
This is a bridge that I
photographed in Cleveland,

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.770
Ohio, the Abbey Avenue Bridge.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:51.070
I pointed out to
you that since--

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.000
I don't think I was familiar
with that Baldus photograph

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.820
when I did it, but when
you're photographing bridges,

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.870
bridges are really great sort
of documents of engineering

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.660
thinking at any given time.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.430
You can even see
it around here when

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.630
you look at the
highway overpasses that

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.840
have been built since the
earthquake that you had

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.690
in the early '90s that
are much more beefed up

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.900
and things like that.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.926
And like this
bridge, you can see--

00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:28.140
and you'll notice
these lace channels

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.370
and these small details and
rivets and pin connections.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.010
I mean, the engineers
were jumping hoops

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.160
with the materials
and the things

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.590
that the steel
manufacturers could produce

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.080
at that particular time.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.670
As the steel mills were able
to put out bigger pieces,

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:54.100
you could make a similar bridge
with fewer pieces and faster.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.480
And so these are ways that
people that study bridges

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.095
will look at them.

00:22:59.095 --> 00:23:03.500
If you see a pin-connected
metal truss bridge,

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:10.000
that's probably going to be
built before 1900, for example.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.480
One of my other major
influences is Ansel Adams,

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.360
who definitely works
in the tradition

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.835
of the great 19th
century photographers.

00:23:20.835 --> 00:23:23.260
In this photograph
I made in Butte,

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.950
Montana in the
early '80s of the--

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.710
I would sit out
there in January.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:35.260
It sort of marks one of the
coldest assignments I ever had.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.140
But ARCO, which owned
most of the mine sites,

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.182
was tearing down
these head frames

00:23:42.182 --> 00:23:43.640
and they wanted me
to get out there

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.020
to document these head frames.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.470
The temperature was about
eight degrees below,

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.900
which is probably not
that cold for Butte,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:58.320
but it was about the most
cold that a camera shutter

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:03.390
would perform without sort of
removing all the lubricants.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.950
You have to take the lubricants
out of the camera shutter

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.050
if you're going to
work colder than that.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:13.170
But so it was my homage
to Ansel storm clearing

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.180
over Butte, Montana.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:23.900
And this is a bridge
in New Portland, Maine

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.910
that sort of illustrates
hybridization

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.810
between the covered bridge
technology where you're

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.470
covering the tower
structures to protect them

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.860
from the weather and
the winters there.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.050
The reason covered
bridges are covered

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:48.290
is because they make the
trusses last about 100% longer.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.950
And just to illustrate, this
is looking from the other side,

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.770
looking west.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:58.730
And here's a detail
of the anchorage.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.050
I mean, that's the most
important part of a suspension

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.640
bridge is that's
what's holding it up,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.540
where it's going
into the ground.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.100
It's probably some big
kind of literal anchor

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.160
that's buried in the
ground that's holding it.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.030
And just for
comparison, this is what

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.430
the anchorage to the
George Washington

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.600
Bridge crossing the Hudson River
in New York City looks like.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.570
And here, you can really see
how the suspension bridge is

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.260
made because it's done
over a year or so time

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:39.410
where each cable is made
from a single span of wire

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.680
going back and forth hundreds
and hundreds of times

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.580
until they assemble this
array of cables and ropes

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.940
and put it into one big cable.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.420
Climbing up through the
superstructure of the George

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.710
Washington Bridge--

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.950
probably my favorite bridge that
I've ever gotten to document--

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.490
this was before 9/11.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.510
I don't know whether
they would have permitted

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.390
me to photograph it since then.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.930
But we were trying at
that time to document

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.600
major civil and
mechanical engineering

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:18.890
landmarks for our collection
and they were very amenable.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.550
A lot of these folks that
work for the port authority

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:28.940
were headquartered in the World
Trade building at that time,

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:34.510
so I imagine we lost a number
of folks when that happened.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:39.270
And here's an aerial of the
George Washington Bridge.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:43.710
Apparently Ammann was very
influenced by erector sets,

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.620
a friend of mine has told
me, and it has this kind

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.840
of erector set look to it.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.840
But the other thing
that's going on here

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.610
is that it's a bit over-built
because it was designed

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:04.890
to be clad with stone to give
it that kind of New York-y kind

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.620
of solid look, but
the critics just

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.130
liked it so much showing
the structure itself

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.590
that they stuck with that.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:20.800
And here is a good profile
looking downstream.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.120
I'd finished shooting
the bridge that week.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.930
I was on the way home
across the bridge

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.400
and the Hudson was
just this mirror calm

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.500
and the light was just
this gorgeous light,

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.610
so we got down to
this little state park

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:44.000
where we could get this view
with a deceptively placid look

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.320
of New York City.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.170
I love that contrast of it.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.630
And here is the ancestor
to the George Washington

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:01.670
Bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge,
which we're all familiar with.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:07.190
The trademark of the bridge
is those diagonal stays.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:12.800
There was a big concern about
how the counteracting sway

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.410
and avoiding the cyclical
sinusoidal movements

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.660
of the bridge decks.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.870
As the 20th century
proceeded, the engineers

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:29.330
got a little more daring
with thinning the road deck

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:33.140
and over-relying on the
weight of the bridge

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.450
deck to keep that
from happening,

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.700
until Galloping Gertie
disaster took place

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.940
and then they sort of
went, eh, we went a little

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.740
too far in that direction.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:49.180
But you know, mistakes
do have to happen.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:55.440
And this was taken around
'83 during the centennial

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.100
of the Brooklyn Bridge opening,
which was almost 100 years

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.830
after its opening.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.540
You can still see
the World Trade

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.000
Center framed through it there.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.130
And to build a
suspension bridge,

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.910
you've got to make wire and
cable, so I'm putting in this--

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.160
this is where the
Roebling factory

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.690
in Trenton, New Jersey with
a little miniature series

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.960
of buildings trying to express
what they're doing there.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.880
They're making wire rope.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.850
And this is actually
in the same area.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.730
This is a rope-making machine--

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:38.600
quite an elaborate machine
with this clockwork mechanism

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.830
that was adjusted so that
you could do different winds

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:49.580
and lays of wire
around a single cable

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.590
depending on how
much flexibility you

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:55.370
wanted to design into the rope.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:59.300
This cable became very
important in the development

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.630
and the building
of the Panama Canal

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.890
in terms of its construction.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:11.390
Certainly one of the more
magnificent structures

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:15.492
I got to photograph
during my career.

00:30:15.492 --> 00:30:19.070
And it's a very
interesting structure

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.460
because the canals
and the railroads

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.450
were sort of made-- in a way,
the railroads eclipsed canals

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:30.140
as a way of moving stuff
around, but the thing

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:34.550
that makes the Panama
Canal work as a mechanism

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:38.630
is actually a lot of
railroad technology

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:45.510
to open these gates such as
this-- this enormous gate here,

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:50.290
which is what, about
10 stories tall,

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:55.080
they had to think of different
systems to control it with.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.160
They were not directly
connected to the control tower

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.427
there, which I'm going
to show you here.

00:31:00.427 --> 00:31:02.760
AUDIENCE: Was that prior
picture taken on top of a gate?

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.717
JET LOWE: What?

00:31:03.717 --> 00:31:05.300
AUDIENCE: Were you
out on top of gate?

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.071
JET LOWE: Yeah.

00:31:07.071 --> 00:31:07.570
Yes.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.790
There was a few--

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:18.260
you'll see back-- you know,
there were some walkways.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.010
I don't know that it's shown,
but there were some walkways

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:26.060
and there were some gates
that you could cross over to.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.110
But anyway, this was
the control room.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.950
The Smithsonian was just
fascinated with these control

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.190
tables, which are kind of
pretty remarkable things

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.280
because they kind of--

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.970
as I'll show you
in a second, they

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:52.310
kind of create a simul view--

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.850
a virtual view--
of what's going on

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.110
in the canal by these
indicators here.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.900
And you can see here
they're indicating

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.240
that these gates are closed.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.200
This sign here I think
might say that it's locked

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.100
and that people are
walking across it

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:12.220
as a way to warn the
operator that no,

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.100
you better not open
that one there.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:20.680
And you can see here that
that canal gate is open.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.380
So while these
photographs were being

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.070
made during this annual
overhaul that they do-- they

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.370
just kind of do it like they
repair roads around here.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:36.040
They close down one lane
and so all the ships

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.970
have to wait their turns to go
east or west while they repair

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:43.510
one set of chambers and then
they go onto the other side

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.730
and repair the other
side of chambers.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.890
That was really kind
of a unique opportunity

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:52.480
to get there to photograph
during this particular process,

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.670
and they took me all
around on the inside.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.150
Underneath these control
tables, for this thing

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:05.750
to work, the biggest fear of a
canal designer and an engineer,

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.260
if you don't open the
gates in the right order,

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.700
you have the danger
of draining the lake

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.400
in the middle of the peninsula.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.840
If the lake were to
start flowing out,

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.540
there's no way you could close
those gates if you don't do it

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.840
in the right order.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.930
It would take a year
or so to build up

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.170
enough water in the lake
to make the canal run.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:34.550
So they developed this
interlocking table

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.670
that sort of uses a
lot of early logic--

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:43.280
if, and, and-- so
that the operator

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.085
can only go into
certain sequence.

00:33:45.085 --> 00:33:48.020
It's called interlocks
and it's kind of

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:53.660
based on switching technology
that the railroad devised

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.550
in the 19th century.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:34:00.500
And so these are the
little electric motors

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:06.320
underneath the canal
gates that mimic what's

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.170
happening with the
real gates, and they're

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:14.449
little electric motors connected
to the actual canal gates that

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:16.620
send the signal back to this.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:21.170
So it's like a prototypical
fly-by wire system

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:24.335
if you know what that is as
far as airplane controls go.

00:34:24.335 --> 00:34:26.840
So rather than
directly controlling

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.860
the elevators of an airplane,
you have an electrical system,

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.590
or you have electric
steering in your Prius,

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:37.520
for example, rather than a
mechanical direct connection.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.280
And so then you have all
these interconnections

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.449
that prevent you from
opening it or closing it

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.719
in the wrong sequence.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.940
What this enabled--

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.280
I throw this image in.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:58.450
This train exists
here in Nome, Alaska.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:05.920
It was hauling gold out
of the sands out of Nome.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.030
But because the Panama
Canal was not completed,

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.060
it had to be brought all
the way around from New York

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.780
City around South America
and up to Nome Alaska

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.870
during the 1890s gold rush.

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:23.740
And I just find that a kind
of pretty remarkable story.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.550
It was part of the elevated
line in New York City,

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.310
and when they retired it, they
shipped it all the way around

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.406
to Nome for the gold rush.

00:35:34.406 --> 00:35:38.770
While we're up in Alaska,
as part of exploitation

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.080
of materials and
industrialization

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.790
that was taking place
in the 19th century,

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.040
this bridge was built
called the Million Dollar

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.120
Bridge-- the only
bridge in the world

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.210
that I know of that's actually
built between two glaciers.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.610
And when it was
built in 1912, they

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.560
did not know whether
the glaciers were

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.890
going to expand and
tear it away or not,

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:06.460
but it had to be built in
the depth of the winter

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.030
while the river was
completely frozen up so

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.070
that if it were
completed abutment

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:17.960
to abutment, before a breakup,
it would probably hold.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.880
But they had to get it--

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.240
if it were not
completed, it would just

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.330
get washed downstream with
the breakup of the ice.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.320
What you see also
here is the result

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.960
of the earthquake of 1963,
the Alaskan earthquake, which

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:41.150
I think is still the largest
recorded earthquake that's

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.910
occurred.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.710
That's since been repaired.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:50.540
But I think that's the
Miles Glacier to the south,

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:54.750
and then if you're on top of
the truss and look to the north,

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.630
this is the other glacier.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.440
Cordova Alaska is sort of
over there beyond the trees,

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.740
and people will drive
up to a road that's

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.380
just across the stream
from the glaciers

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.890
and honk at it to make it calve.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.140
And it sounds like a
little thunderstorm

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.900
off in the distance
as the glaciers

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.990
are falling off the end.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.270
It's this deep rumble.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:25.520
Back to another great bridge,
this is Bellows Falls, Vermont.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.830
This is a bridge that we
lost in the late '70s.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.890
I was just finishing up
this project and a young man

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:35.740
walked up to me and
said, how would you

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.030
like me to walk up to
the top of that bridge

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.620
there and get a picture of me?

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.750
And I said, well, sure.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:49.380
But engineering objects kind of
inspire those kind of things,

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.980
and I think really great
engineering, like such

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.310
as the Golden Gate
Bridge, can have

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:59.840
the capability of actually
enhancing putting focus

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.270
on a natural environment.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.930
And the details on
the bridge plates

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.730
often gives you information
about the politics

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.580
of what's going on--

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:15.480
who got the funding going.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.970
So my interest in
bridges has been--

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:22.950
since retirement in 2013, I've
continued to take pictures,

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:26.150
and I'm always sort
of on the lookout

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:29.190
for the great landmarks.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.500
And this was one of the great
landmarks of the 19th century,

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:37.470
was the Garabit Viaduct
in southern France.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:40.640
Really a quite wonderful,
elegant structure.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:46.860
You'll see it in most any
Art History 101 course.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.130
And then also worth a
trip across the pond

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:54.750
is a very recently built bridge.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.310
This is almost a British--

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:59.310
it's in southern France
not far from the Garabit.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:06.120
It's called the Millau Viaduct
and is by Richard Norman

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.570
Foster, the British architect.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:14.220
But the firm that built this
is basically a descendent

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.670
of the Eiffel firm.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:17.930
And these are the towers.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.210
This bridge is tall
enough that you could fit

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.640
the Eiffel Tower underneath it.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:28.360
So it's quite an
impressive structure.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.900
One of the things
that we've learned

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.840
in our technology in the
19th and 20th century

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.240
is handling heat.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.780
Maybe you all have gone
north to northern California

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.790
and crossed the
Carquinez Strait bridge

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.580
and looked at those
abandoned ships that

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.310
are gathered up off to the
right, called the Ghost

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.080
Fleet by some folks.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.380
I got to get out there as one of
the more stranger environments

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.720
I've gotten to get into.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:58.770
And we were photographing
oil tankers,

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:02.400
and this is the engine
room of an oil tanker,

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.100
showing the steam turbines
and the reduction gears.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.180
Now this is kind of
a hot rod oil tanker

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:14.390
because it had to be able
to keep up with the fleet,

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:19.950
because at the time, they
didn't have enough technology

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.560
to make the reduction gears.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.800
But for the oil tankers
that needed to keep up

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.320
with the fleet, they had those.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.350
And this is the boiler
room of the same.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:37.090
You know, pretty-- that's
a hot place to work.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.430
But this technology,
sort of often--

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.550
you know, after photographing
this stuff for the time,

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:45.010
it makes it seem
like, you know, it's

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:48.770
not that big of a leap to
the shuttle discoverer.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:52.610
This is the bridge to
the shuttle discoverer.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:55.630
I got down to Cape
Canaveral just before--

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.810
when they were sort
of fitting it up

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:04.120
for going to the Udvar-Hazy
Museum in Washington, DC.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:09.670
This is a stitched image
from two negatives,

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.220
showing the full control panel.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.500
The windshield is
completely blacked out

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.680
to protect it from
the work that they

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.060
were doing to get it
ready to go to the museum.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.820
If you were to turn it
around from the same spot,

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.930
you would look here and
see the control panel

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:34.540
to the Canadian arm, and
in dealing with things

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:39.760
in the cargo bay and also being
able to ingress and egress

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.840
out of the shuttle when
you're out of space.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.340
And this is a view
into the-- you

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:50.600
could fit a good-sized yellow
school bus in this cargo bay.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:56.440
So the shuttle discoverer
is a pretty large machine.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.890
NASA thought of it as the
most complicated machine

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:04.560
on the planet, which could
very well be with the systems

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.110
that it takes to make
that thing reusable

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:11.420
and controllable as it was.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:16.280
To be able to operate
the machine out in space

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.090
while in orbit, you need
to rehearse what you're

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.650
going to be doing,
and they would

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:27.800
time to the minute what the
extravehicular operators would

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.180
be doing.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.340
And they would do it in this--

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.840
what's called a neutral buoyancy
chamber in Huntsville, Alabama.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.890
And that's what
you're seeing here.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.400
This is an underwater
shot through one

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.510
of those portholes
of the Canadian arm.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.890
And here's Leslie
Wickman, an astronaut--

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.450
she was an
extravehicular specialist

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:55.160
astronaut that
specialized in operating

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.950
outside of the shuttle.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.350
At this particular
time, I don't think--

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.660
when I did this
shot, I don't think

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:10.960
they had gotten up and done the
repairs on the web telescope

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.780
yet, but I think they were
getting ready for that

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.140
at that particular time.

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.770
And so she's just kind of
completing her rehearsal.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:27.670
When they go in there, they
have to be weighted down.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:31.260
They have other scuba
divers to help them out,

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.360
but they do time it down to
the minute what exactly they'll

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.780
be doing.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.930
And here's the gloves.

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:42.400
To make an astronaut suit,
it's about a million dollars

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.030
for each suit that
an astronaut weighs.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.795
It's the cost of those things.

00:43:46.795 --> 00:43:49.420
I mean, you can imagine
what the suit has to do.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:55.420
You know, operate in a vacuum,
keep you warm on the cool side

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.660
and cool you down
on the hot side

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.040
and all that kind of stuff.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.010
And then have these gloves
so that you can actually

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:09.600
manipulate tools and
things like that.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:15.300
This is one of them more bizarre
kind of almost kludgy things

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.470
that NASA did.

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:21.000
I mean, scientists and engineers
are very pragmatic creatures,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.490
as I'm sure you all very
well know, but this transport

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:28.780
system of the shuttle--

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.880
that 747 that they use is
apparently just completely

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.417
empty on the inside.

00:44:34.417 --> 00:44:36.333
I mean, I think there
are like just a few sort

00:44:36.333 --> 00:44:44.190
of special seats behind where
the bridge is to run the thing,

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.700
and then I'm sure the shuttle
just has everything out of it

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.030
that they can get out of it.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:52.000
This is the underside
of the shuttle, which

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.340
is kind of neat
that you can really

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.490
sense what an aged
ship it was at the time

00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:59.770
going into the museum.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.980
And that it had gone
more than a million miles

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.260
around the planet.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:12.070
And you can even see the space
dirt on the shuttle tiles.

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:15.700
And just as an example
of how difficult it

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:20.800
was to prepare the shuttle for
re-entry and re-use, each one

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.310
of those tiles, they
have to kind of re-inject

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:27.820
some kind of substance
into them to protect them

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:34.810
against absorbing too much
moisture while they're on land.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:38.500
And each tile takes
a different quantity

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.320
and they're all
completely numbered.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:46.680
It's like this very
homemade kind of machine

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.940
and that's why
it's so expensive.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.820
Just to start on a whole
different pilgrimage

00:45:54.820 --> 00:46:00.050
from going into outer space,
since I've been retired,

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:07.270
I've always been interested
in architecture of all sorts,

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:11.710
and one of my favorite
places that we visited

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:17.350
in France was an area called
the Puy-en-Velay, which

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:20.140
is kind of a pilgrimage spot.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:26.950
And it's this French town in
the Massif Central of France

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:32.890
that basically occupies
a volcanic caldera.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:36.520
So these little churches
and stuff on tops

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.940
of remnants of
volcanoes and things,

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.080
so it's a major Christian
pilgrimage space,

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:50.350
and here, this stairway is
where a penitence might crawl up

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:55.690
to the church on their
knees in medieval times--

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.270
I don't think in the
20th century anymore--

00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:02.560
maybe to go visit
the Black Madonna.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.290
And the original--
there's a whole bunch

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:10.110
of interesting stuff about
these Black Madonnas,

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:14.200
but apparently one
of the originals

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.740
was captured during the
Crusades from Constantinople

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:21.070
or something like
that at that time.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:24.180
During the French Revolution,
a lot of these icons

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.060
were destroyed, and
so this is probably

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.780
one that was a reproduction that
was made in the 19th century

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:31.493
by the--

00:47:31.493 --> 00:47:36.810
I just found it an
extraordinarily droll--

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:39.640
sort of a wonderful thing.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.630
Icon for what it is.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:45.860
And so in my talk here
with this portal view,

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:49.910
this is still-- you're
up at the top of the hill

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:54.770
outside of this church, and
this would be one of the places

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:56.830
where you might
begin a new journey.

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.780
This was one of
the beginning spots

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.960
if you were going to do the
pilgrimage to Santiago de

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.590
Compostela, and no
telling what would happen

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:11.770
and no telling where
we'll go from there.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.890
And that's where
I'll end my talk.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:19.830
If there's any questions, I'll
be happy to entertain them.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.742
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:24.977 --> 00:48:26.060
ED BACHER: Thank you, Jet.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.476
If you have any
questions, there's

00:48:27.476 --> 00:48:29.380
a mic in the middle
of the room there.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.560
I'll start off with
a Dory question.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.130
Ryan in Sunnyvale
asks, what do you

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:40.210
think has been lost from
the conversion of film

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.320
to digital photography
and what advice

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.960
would you give to digital
photographers these days?

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.130
JET LOWE: Well, on
that particular issue,

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:53.620
I think of digital and film
as like two different beasts.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:58.300
And I'm sort of fairly
ecumenical on that,

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.480
although I would still
think that whether you're

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.210
digital or not, I'd
highly recommend

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:08.680
shooting film and trying to
deal with it because a lot

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.630
of the kind of language that
you see in Photoshop derives

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:17.170
from film--

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:18.550
usage of film.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:22.810
The things like the Dodge
and Burn tool, and even

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:27.850
the Unsharp tool in
Photoshop is a result

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:34.840
of graphic designers using
two images to create a greater

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.900
amount of edge around an
image to create the sharpness,

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:43.240
and that's probably what the
computer program is doing, too.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.040
But so I just
really think of them

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.110
as completely different
kinds of things.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:56.310
The thing that I like about film
is that you can capture things

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.510
in one moment.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:01.090
Like there's a thing--

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.760
to do some of the
things in digital

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.560
that you would do in film, you
have to take multiple images,

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.780
for example, to get the contrast
range, whereas with film, you

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.980
can overexpose and
underdevelop and compress

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:23.830
that range together to get
a different effect than you

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:26.890
can with digital.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:29.230
But they really are--

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:36.010
I am told that actually film--

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.410
I wouldn't say as so much
it's making a comeback,

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:45.250
but the companies are selling
more film with increasing time.

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:50.040
Film is more of a
tactile medium and maybe

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.130
it has also to do with--

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.950
there was debate back
in the '30s whether it's

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.710
light particles or is it waves.

00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:59.640
And I think of film
as particles and I

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.235
think of digital as waves.

00:51:05.005 --> 00:51:06.480
ED BACHER: Question.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.580
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the
talk and the pictures.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.610
So if someone is
going to use digital--

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:13.190
which, sorry to say
that, but are there

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:16.200
any digital cameras
that you would recommend

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.610
or that you yourself use?

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:18.832
JET LOWE: Oh gosh.

00:51:18.832 --> 00:51:20.790
I mean, you know, the
point and shoot cameras--

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:26.500
even though the iPhone
and the Android phones,

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.110
they do magnificent images.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:32.040
And there's whole groups
of fine art photographers

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.550
that are sort of using those
as their medium because

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:39.700
of the particular kind of
image quality that they use.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:44.660
And so I think that's--

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:49.224
you know, whatever works,
in a way, is what I would--

00:51:51.984 --> 00:51:53.650
AUDIENCE: What are
some things you think

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:57.110
about when composing a photo?

00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:59.880
Some things you think about
when you're composing a photo?

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.780
JET LOWE: When I
give workshops, I

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.060
tell people to think
a lot about what's

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:07.700
going on around the
edges, because whenever

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:12.520
you're taking the picture,
you're cutting things out.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.380
And so you're always
making a decision,

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:17.090
do I want this or
do I not want that?

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.630
So if you think a
lot around the edges,

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:21.680
that makes a big difference.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.560
Now if you're
photographing architecture,

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.040
I really like to encourage
people to try and sort of get

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.380
as high as possible so
that the camera back

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:36.610
is as parallel to parallel
vertical lines as possible.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.940
The architectural
photography is sort of

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:47.290
like a subdiscipline of
photography, and so in a way,

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:51.400
it's got stricter
rules, and in many ways,

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:56.440
it's harder to kind of make
a stylistic differentiation

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.540
between one's work
and another's work

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.710
because it's maybe like fugue
writing or something like that.

00:53:08.657 --> 00:53:10.240
AUDIENCE: Let me
piggyback on that one

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.760
just a little bit,
and maybe this

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:17.920
is sacrilege talking to you,
but for scale and context,

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.400
I find some architectural
photography includes

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:26.470
human subjects, like you had the
one on the Bellows Falls Bridge

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.800
there.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.430
Any advice on including
human subjects in?

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:36.030
JET LOWE: Personally, I like to
have people in my photographs.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.270
Another way I depart from a lot
of architectural photographers

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:42.180
is I like having automobiles
in my photographs,

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:46.080
because over time, those
automobiles will really

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.880
date the image.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.990
Because when you see
a photograph taken

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:55.890
in the '60s, for example, just
by looking at the automobiles,

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.050
you know when it was taken.

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:03.570
But sometimes people
and automobiles

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:06.720
can detract from
maybe the design

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.990
or whatever you're trying to
capture so there's no really

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.680
fixed rules on that or
not, but generally, I

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.160
like to have people in my
photographs for the scale

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:22.842
and the human use
of the structure.

00:54:22.842 --> 00:54:23.550
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:54:26.859 --> 00:54:28.150
ED BACHER: Any other questions?

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.870
I have one.

00:54:31.948 --> 00:54:35.700
You showed us a difficult
place to photograph,

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.230
at least from your
comfort, in Butte.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:42.360
Do you have a favorite
place that you photographed

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.140
or a favorite item
that you photographed?

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.120
JET LOWE: Well I didn't
show it in this sequence,

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.460
but I think one of the more
wondrous places I got to get to

00:54:53.460 --> 00:55:03.790
was the leper colony on
Moloka'I Island in Kalaupapa.

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:07.180
And because I work for the
Historic American Engineering

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:10.270
Record, what we were
documenting was the water supply

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:18.010
system to the leper colony,
and so it involved hiking up

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:23.620
these steep ginger
root streams to get

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.890
to these sedimentation
ponds and stuff

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:30.230
like that to kind of
clarify the water.

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:37.580
But it's a small peninsula that
sticks out on sort of the north

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:41.720
side of the island, I guess
created by a lava flow,

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.540
so it's really isolated from
the rest of the island by this

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:50.435
2,000-foot sea cliff, and
it's a pretty dramatic place.

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.130
Some people say, when
you're out in Hawaii,

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:57.960
you really can feel
like you're on a planet,

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.790
and so I guess Hawaii is
one of my favorite places

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:03.282
on the Earth.

00:56:03.282 --> 00:56:04.605
ED BACHER: Cool.

00:56:04.605 --> 00:56:06.610
Well thank you very much.

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:07.360
Great to have you.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.810
[APPLAUSE]
