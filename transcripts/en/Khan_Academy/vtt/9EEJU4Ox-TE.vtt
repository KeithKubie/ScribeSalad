00:00:01.655 --> 00:00:03.786
- [Tutor] The graph below
shows the relationship

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:07.279
between hours of exercise
and hours of screen time

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.153
for a group of five friends on Thursday.

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:12.494
So, if we look over here,

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:16.244
we can see that here on
this horizontal axis,

00:00:17.372 --> 00:00:19.366
when we're going from the left to right,

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.098
it says hours of exercise,

00:00:21.098 --> 00:00:22.727
so half an hour, one hour,

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:25.580
one and a half hours, two
hours, two and a half hours.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.152
And then, here it shows
hours of screen time.

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:31.614
So, for example, it looks like Liu Yang

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.941
did zero hours of exercise,

00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:38.287
did no exercise and spent seven
hours in front of a screen.

00:00:38.287 --> 00:00:40.551
Not something that I would recommend.

00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:43.808
And it looks like Kavitha
spent half an hour,

00:00:43.808 --> 00:00:47.291
had half an hour of exercise on Thursday.

00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:48.919
This is all describing
what happens on Thursday

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:52.879
and had five and a half
hours of screen time.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:53.891
You see that right over there,

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:57.235
and we could keep going with
all the other data points.

00:00:57.235 --> 00:00:58.480
But let's see what they're asking us.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.294
What is the meaning of
the point marked Maxime?

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:03.809
I think that's how I would pronounce that.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.478
So, Maxime is right over here,

00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:09.811
and it looks like this is the point one,

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.830
because our horizontal coordinate
right over here is one,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.320
and then our vertical coordinate is four,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.001
so point one comma four.

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.565
And this one is the hours of exercise.

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.330
So, Maxime exercises one hour,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.830
one hour exercise,

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:29.496
and they spend four hours

00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:32.125
in front of a screen on that Thursday,

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.042
four hours screen time.

00:01:38.158 --> 00:01:39.384
Alright, so let's see.

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:41.303
Which of these choices say that?

00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:42.136
Let's see.

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:45.219
It is Maxime had one hour of exercise

00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:48.918
and four hours of screen time.

00:01:48.918 --> 00:01:51.078
Yep, this looks exactly right.

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:52.736
And if you just wanted
to check the other ones,

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:55.403
Maxime had two hours of exercise

00:01:56.713 --> 00:01:58.048
and eight hours of screen time.

00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:00.120
That would put them way up here,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.905
and that's not where the point was,

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:02.828
so we'd rule that out.

00:02:02.828 --> 00:02:04.482
Maxime had four hours of exercise

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:06.328
and one hour of screen time.

00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:09.147
Four hours of exercise
is not even on this,

00:02:09.147 --> 00:02:10.343
we'd have to go off the screen,

00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:12.084
so we'd rule that one out.

00:02:12.084 --> 00:02:14.399
Maxime had five hours of exercise.

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:18.930
Once again, that's not
even on the screen here,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.558
so we can rule all of them out.

00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:22.780
This third choice, they're
actually trying to confuse you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.984
because they're swapping
the hours of exercise

00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:27.593
and the screen time.

00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:30.395
Maxime has one hour of exercise,
four hours of screen time,

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:34.562
not four hours of exercise
and one hour of screen time.
