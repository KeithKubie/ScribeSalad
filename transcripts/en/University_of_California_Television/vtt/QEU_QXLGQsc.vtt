00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.010
- We are the paradoxical ape, bipedal,
naked, large brained, long the master of

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:40.010
fire, tools, and language. But still
trying to understand ourselves. Aware that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.860
death is inevitable yet filled with
optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand down

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.150
knowledge. We empathize and deceive. We
shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.560
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.270
to exchange insights on who we are
and how we got here.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.010
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.570
- [Jeff Severinghaus] So I study ice cores
and I'm just an arm chair admirer of the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.650
people who study evolution of humans. So
I'm very pleased to be invited here and I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.350
hope I can contribute something. My
outline is that first I'll take a little

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.970
digression away from the topic of human
evolution just to give you some background

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.550
on what's happening right now and how, for
example, do we know that humans are

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.940
causing the current climate change. And
then I'll talk about the the observations

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.340
made by many other people, not myself,
that agriculture seems to have originated

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.420
precisely when we had the most recent of
these abrupt climate change events 11.7

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.350
thousand years ago. Some people call that
the end of the Younger Dryas Period. And

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.080
it's really quite a stunning coincidence
and it probably isn't a coincidence. Many

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.820
people now believe that the warming and
the wetting allowed humans to switch from

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:31.420
a hunting and gathering mode of existence
to an agricultural mode of existence.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.830
And then I'll go on to talk about abrupt
climate change itself and what causes it.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.630
I'll tell you the punchline which is that
we think it's the switching on and off of

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.010
ocean circulation. And I'll wrap up with a
question, will it happen again in the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.880
future? So my little digression, the
"smoking gun" of human causation, I love

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.880
this diagram and you don't see it in the
media very often.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.960
I think it's a shame that we don't
because it really is a very powerful form

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.680
of evidence and if someone asks you if you
believe in global warming you should say

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.830
"No" because it's not a matter of belief,
it's a matter of evidence. So this is from

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.100
the Ice Cores, I'm proud to say. This is
my field of Ice Cores science. We know the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.520
bubbles trapped in ice cores that CO2 in
the atmosphere was about 280 parts per

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.870
million for most of the last thousand
years and then right around the time of

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.780
major coal burning, around 1850, it
started to creep up. Here we are today at

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.140
400 parts per million. And at the same
time this rare isotope of carbon that

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:56.610
Peter deMenocal introduced, Carbon-13, in
the atmospheric CO2 changed from a very

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.500
stable value, don't worry about these
units, and it started taking a nose-dive

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.920
and that's the signature of fossil fuel
burning. If the CO2 was coming from the

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.450
ocean, which is the major natural source
of CO2, it would not have done this. It

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:20.530
would've been flat. This really is the
smoking gun. You can say that with great,

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.040
great confidence. And of course, there's a
lot of other lines of evidence but I like

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.550
this in particular. The other thing that
you can do if you're confronted by someone

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.170
who doesn't buy this argument, how do we
know that CO2 actually causes climate

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.710
change, you can look to our neighbor,
Venus, which has about three thousand

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:49.450
times more CO2 in its atmosphere than our
planet and it has a surface temperature of

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.860
450 centigrade which is hot enough to melt
lead. So it's basically a combination of

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.370
Venus, basic physics that tells us that
CO2 traps heat, and these undisputed

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.481
measurements of CO2 concentration
and it's isotopes.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.951
Those three three things taken together
pretty much sums it all up.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.481
Everything else is kind of details.

00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:15.920
We know that humans are
embarking on a dramatic future change of

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.300
climate. It doesn't really matter that
much what's happened up until now. I mean

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.780
asking whether the earth is warming or not
is kind of like driving towards a cliff

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:32.390
and asking "Are we dropping yet?" It's not
really that interesting a question,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:43.010
actually? And while I'm on the topic of
smoking guns, this is a very famous

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.670
picture that many people have seen. The
CO2 concentration from ice cores and here

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.750
we are here today at 400. So you see it is
quite unusual in the context of the last

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:58.370
800 thousand years which is the whole ice
core record. I'm working on trying to

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:04.020
extend this back to 1.5 million years. You
can ask me about that later if you want.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.750
But the important about this is that this
is not the smoking gun of human causation.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.670
There has been awful lot of confusion
about this. Al Gore, bless his heart, I

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.150
think kind of lead us down the wrong path
by implying that this was some kind of

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.500
evidence that CO2 causes climate change.
In fact, it's mostly the other way around.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.810
That Antarctic temperatures related to
the things that control natural variations

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.660
in CO2 and the current CO2 spike has
nothing to do with these variations. It's

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.260
not coming from the ocean as you saw from
the Carbon-13 evidence. It's coming from

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.350
fossil fuel. It's a completely different
chemical, in fact. So if somebody

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:50.130
gives you a hard time about the fact that
the CO2 changes slightly after the

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.180
temperature, you can tell them that's
expected because it's natural CO2 and it's

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.811
responding to climate.
It's not causing climate.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:04.210
A related myth is that the ice core
record that you've just seen shows that

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.730
carbon dioxide rose after temperature
began warming at the ends of ice ages,

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:13.970
which is true. That's why it's in black.
Ergo carbon dioxide does not cause

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:19.910
warming, which is false. The fact is that
ice ages are ended by the changes in the

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.750
earth's orbit as you heard earlier today.
So it's not surprising that the

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:30.650
temperature change is first. And you can
think of CO2 as a feedback that amplifies

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:37.280
the initial warming by about 30% probably.
It's actually not a huge increase. It's

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:44.820
maybe two degrees bigger of change than
you would've gotten otherwise. So humans

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.810
are adding CO2 directly to the atmosphere
and so ice ages are not a good analog.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.740
It's a red herring. I couldn't resist
showing this because it's such an nice

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.090
analogy. If you overspend your credit
card, you go into debt, then you have to

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:05.020
pay interest, right? And that makes more
debt. So interest lags debt. How do we

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.820
know that interest adds to debt? We can't
explain the total size of the debt without

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.940
taking into account interest and also
economics tells us. And climate of the

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:20.230
past now, we have the earth's orbit
causing warming, making CO2 rise as the

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.350
oceans warms and out gasses and CO2 and
that causes further warming as an

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:32.280
amplifier. That's the hole end of story
about human caused climate change.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:39.420
Now I"m going to move on to this idea that
the first evidence for agriculture was

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:46.040
seen during this abrupt warming. So this
is a fascinating topic and it's mostly, I

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.000
think, the work of Brian Baird, who used
to be here at UCSD, who discovered that

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.930
the very, very first domesticated plants,
I think they were barley seeds, would

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.860
occur within plus or minus 200 years of
this abrupt warming event right here.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.601
Seeing that this is actually
the Greenland

00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:07.741
temperature but it's a lot of the
Northern Hemisphere,

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:11.450
European temperature as well.
And then this is a methane, atmospheric

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.780
methane record from the ice core and it
seems to be a proxy for wetness.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.420
There's a great deal of increase in
northern hemisphere, low latitude rain

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.930
fall at this time. And this all happened
in about 30 years. These are very fast

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.840
events. There's about half of the
temperature change seems to have occurred

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.950
in one year. These are the kind of things
that could impose very large stresses on

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:43.590
humans potentially because there's not
enough time to adapt. And so what's

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:49.430
amazing about this that people seem to
have completely changed in a very short

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.510
time their mode of existence from a
hunting and gathering to farming right

00:10:54.510 --> 00:11:00.000
here. And it's probably because everything
got so much warmer and wetter. It just

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.030
really lush. Think of the Garden of Eden.
That's probably some time in here. We

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:14.160
don't know whether it was 8 thousand years
or 12 thousand years, whatever. That was

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.350
an example of an abrupt climate change
that greatly benefited our ancestors. Of

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.540
course, when it's cooling, it's drying as
well and that would be a period of intense

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.770
stress and there were probably population
bottle necks at the time. And those may be

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:35.870
very important for evolution because if
you kill off 97% of the humans and you

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:42.790
just leave 3%, those will have characters
that will then be able to spread widely

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:49.920
without having to exchange with a large
gene pool. So you can get very powerful

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.170
evolutionary change through these
bottlenecks and what's remarkable about

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:58.380
these abrupt events is that they happen
again and again. There's not just one of

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:04.090
them. There's 25 of them in the last 100
thousand years and probably something like

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.811
20 and the 100 thousand years before that.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:11.060
All told, our ancestors probably
went through a hundred of these

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:17.000
bottlenecks. So it's a repeated form of
boom and bust. William Calvin had a very

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.260
nice about this boom and bust evolutionary
pumping hypothesis. I'm going to switch

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.580
now to talk about the physical science
understand that we have about abrupt

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.370
climate change, what causes it in the
first place. And as I hinted at the

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.970
beginning is something to do with ocean
circulation, warm water at the surface in

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.920
the North Atlantic is carried by currents
to this place around Greenland where it

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:49.590
becomes cold and dense enough to sink and
then it travels southward along the bottom

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:55.070
of the ocean. And what this seems to do is
it actually displaces the earth's thermal

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.730
equator north of the geographic equator.
So the northern hemisphere today is quite

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:05.080
a bit warmer than the southern hemisphere.
And we believe that from theory and

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.810
evidence that this circulation is capable
of shutting off and so that's what a

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:16.000
cooling is and when it turns back on
that's what an abrupt warming is. This is

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.400
kind of what the paleo records look like
of this phenomenon of shutting on, turning

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.250
on and shutting off the North Atlantic
circulation. In northern records you see

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:31.620
abrupt warnings at the times when the
circulation goes on and in the southern

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.160
hemispheres, this is Antarctica, you
actually see a gradual warming during

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:43.580
times when the north is cold and then an
inflection point towards cooling, gradual

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:50.590
cooling in the south. And this is very
strong evidence that this really is the

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:56.250
ocean circulation. This is from a very
recent ice core that we drilled, just

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:01.011
finished, and we got published in Nature
few weeks ago.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:07.540
This is one of the main findings from
this ice core is that because we can now

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:14.040
date the two hemispheres relative to each
other to precision of about 50 years we

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:20.420
can show that the norther abrupt warming
leads the southern transition to cooling,

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:25.100
which is shown here, by about 200 years
and that's very interesting because that

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.970
really confirms that this is the ocean
circulation that is doing this. I think

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:36.140
it's the latest in a long line of pieces
of evidence that support the notion that

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.210
it is this ocean circulation, sort of
oscillating and flipping on and off, it

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:45.640
does this. Will it happen again in the
near future? Is an abrupt climate change

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.850
something we have to worry about? Well you
may have seen the movie "The Day After

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:57.560
Tomorrow". It's something that's permeated
into the public consciousness but I think

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.450
the answer is probably not. And the reason
I say that is that the Atlantic ocean is

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:08.110
getting saltier today. In the last 50
years it's increased its salinity

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:14.020
dramatically. You can sort of see that in
this cartoon. The Atlantic is all yellow

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.660
which is an increase in salinity. The
Pacific has a lot of blue and that means

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.990
sort of a decrease in salinity. So what's
going on right now? Is that the Atlantic

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.600
is getting saltier. The Pacific is getting
fresher and that's exactly what we expect

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.210
to happen in a warming world because warm
air holds more water vapor. And so it's

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:39.320
possible to transport more vapor out of
the Atlantic into the Pacific, across

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.390
Panama you see here. So basically,
whenever the world gets warmer, the

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:47.270
Atlantic gets saltier and the salt
actually densifies the water, makes it

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:52.570
easier to sink. And it actually protects
that circulation. While there was some

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:57.351
worry maybe 15 years ago that Atlantic
circulation would shut

00:15:57.351 --> 00:15:59.001
down due to global warming.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:04.990
I think we can say now we've learned
something. Science moves on. It is now

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:10.500
very unlikely that this will happen again.
And the other, of course, is that we don't

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:17.920
have the amplifying factor of sea ice. Sea
ice makes the ocean turn from dark to

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:24.120
light. So it greatly exasperates the
effects of the overturning circulation

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:30.830
shutting off. So my take-home messages.
Hope I have convinced you that abrupt

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:38.160
climate change did stimulate farming and
there's a very, very interesting story

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.850
that's only just beginning to be
understood. It's very probable that many,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:49.590
many abrupt climate changes prior to this
one, that stimulated farming, played a

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:57.830
roll by creating bottlenecks that made the
survivors of this event able to radiate

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:07.080
out into an empty niche after the event.
And very probably, I think also encouraged

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.400
people who could do things differently
than their parents were doing them. As I

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.100
have some kids who are becoming teenagers
I know a lot about this oppositional

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.860
"don't do what your parents were doing"
kind of stuff and I just wonder that maybe

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:31.240
that teenager kind of thing has its
origins in abrupt climate change. Because

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.210
if your parents are telling you to eat
fruit and the climate just crashed and you

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:40.481
say, "Oh, I do things differently than my
parents. I'm going to eat roots instead

00:17:40.481 --> 00:17:44.271
of fruits, you might be the one
who actually survives

00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:47.920
because you're a root eater. So I'm just
wondering if maybe these population

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:57.190
bottlenecks somehow encouraged contrarian
thinking. Atlantic Ocean overturning

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.860
circulation is the culprit, I think, we
can say now that causes abrupt climate

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.341
change. Will it happen again in the
future? Probably not. That's one thing we

00:18:06.341 --> 00:18:08.881
can breathe easier about.
Check that one off the list.

00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:12.601
More salt, less sea ice in our future.
Thank you.
