[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:14.020
LAURA LING: Kimberley Chambers
is one of only six people

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.080
to ever complete the Ocean's
Seven challenge, a grueling

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.170
collection of open water
swims around the world.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.115
What's surprising is that she
was not an experienced swimmer,

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:24.615
and before she began
this challenge,

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:29.294
she was told she wouldn't
even be able to walk.

00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:30.710
Can you tell me
what happened when

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.847
you got into your accident?

00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:34.680
KIMBERLEY CHAMBERS: I
was on my way to work,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.420
and I slipped down my staircase.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.940
And I hit my right
leg on a ceramic pot.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.790
An I hit it at just
the right point

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.860
where it started to swell.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.780
My next memory is waking
up post-surgery 30 minutes

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.760
from amputation
from the knee down.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.080
I remember the surgeon
telling me, we saved your leg,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.360
but we don't know what, if any,
functionality you'll ever have.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.110
And that really was I think
a really defining moment

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.760
in my life.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.170
I could have gone down a
really deep, dark hole.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.240
I could have accepted
that, but I told myself

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.779
I was going to prove them wrong.

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:14.570
And then once I was
doing physical therapy,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.660
I got into this routine.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.430
Being able to move
was pretty magical,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.290
and I wanted to do more.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.955
And that's how I
got into swimming.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.170
I knew how to swim, and I
knew that that would make

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170
me feel a little more free.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.910
So I started swimming at a
pool here in San Francisco.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.400
I got in, and I just loved it.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.640
I just felt really normal.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.460
I was like, yeah, I'm
just another swimmer.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.400
And it was the beginning
of this passion.

00:01:49.757 --> 00:01:51.590
LAURA LING: After years
of physical therapy,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.360
Kim not only learned
to walk again,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.040
but she put all of her energy
into accomplishing the Ocean's

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.480
Seven, which consists of
swims like the English

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.190
Channel and the Cook Strait.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.280
The swims are as
long as 26 miles

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.960
and in temperatures as low
as 53 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.720
Some swims took Kim just
four hours to complete,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.354
others nearly 20 hours.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.204
Tell me how swimming has
become a ritual for you.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:18.620
KIMBERLEY CHAMBERS:
It's something

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.380
that is really sacred to me.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.500
I can't imagine my
life without it.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.960
I start my day at
4:15 every morning.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.330
I train in a pool for
about an hour and a half.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.530
I then go for another
swim in the bay.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.910
LAURA LING: Tell me about one
of your more challenging swims.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.576
KIMBERLEY CHAMBERS:
The most challenging

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:49.924
swim so far for me has been from
Northern Ireland to Scotland.

00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:51.860
SPEAKER: Kim is in a
huge fight right now

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.525
against this nasty current.

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:55.950
KIMBERLEY CHAMBERS: I've
been in for five minutes,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.920
and first jellyfish.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.940
I was stung hundreds of
times, over 200 times,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.990
by these lion's mane jellyfish.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.310
I did make the swim.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.480
I did finish it.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.565
I don't really remember.

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:16.180
LAURA LING: And you're still
getting back in the water.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.420
KIMBERLEY CHAMBERS:
I feel so transformed

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.730
by these experiences.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.900
I don't think I ever
really appreciated

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.220
what my body could do for me.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.830
For these swims, you
don't get a gold medal.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.730
You don't get a cash prize.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.390
You're not competing
with anybody,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.290
and you're really
competing with your mind.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.650
LAURA LING: Do you think
that this ritual of swimming

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.320
saved your life in some sense?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.611
KIMBERLEY CHAMBERS: Absolutely.

00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:48.190
the ritual of swimming
is so important for me.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.150
Every day, my body gets
to be immersed in the bay.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.230
I see a variety of
birds out there.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.660
I see seals out there.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.730
You have these real amazing
interactions with nature

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.310
before most people are awake.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.215
And I can't imagine my
life without it now.

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:18.640
LAURA LING: In this next
episode of "Rituals," click here

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.425
to see how Jason Silva
creates his "Shots of Awe."

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:24.050
JASON SILVA: The
disconnection from distraction

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.940
gets your brain daydreaming.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.669
When you're in
daydreaming mode, you

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.710
start to do a little bit
of the lateral thinking.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.740
So you start connecting
this to that to this

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.749
and you start to go
through the a-ha moments.

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.290
