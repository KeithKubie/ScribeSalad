00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.870
I love laying in bed on a sunday as much as
the next guy, unless the next guy has to lay

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.580
in bed on sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday,
thursday, friday, saturday, sunday, monday…

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:18.810
Early to bed, early to rise makes space science

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.609
move forward. Except the rising part. Just
stay in the bed. That's the message NASA is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.250
putting out there in this new research they're
conducting. Back in 2014, Drew Iwanicki joined

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.660
a NASA-funded study excitingly titled Countermeasure
and Functional Testing in Head-Down Tilt Bed

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.690
Rest Study -- abbreviated to CFT70. Science
is the best with headlines. Iwanicki was famously

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.739
paid 18,000 dollars to lay in bed for 70 days.
He was monitored 24/7, and was only allowed

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.460
to sit up onto elbows for 30 minutes while
eating. No napping, no sitting up, no getting

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.399
out of bed for ANY reason, plus, constant
monitoring; for two and a half months… It

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.840
sounds torturous!

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.379
The study simulated long term inactivity in
space in these participants. NASA researchers

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.520
figured if participants lay in bed with their
feet slightly elevated their face will get

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.500
puffy, and their blood will move differently
-- not unlike in space travel. Doing that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.150
for 70 days should simulate how the body reacts
to long-term spacefaring. They have to be

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.800
careful though… because too much bedrest
might not be the best… rest.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.140
Even when bingeing on DNews, sleeping, or
reading a long book, your body is constantly

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.290
moving itself. You twitch, you change positions,
and you shift your weight all in an effort

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.800
to keep your tissue safe from developing pressure-ulcers.
Pressure-ulcers, also known as bedsores, are

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.030
caused when we don't shift our weight and
allow blood to flow throughout our skin. If

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.380
the skin is deprived of blood for too long,
it suffocates and dies. If the ulcers reach

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.750
Stage IV the tissue damage can reach bone.
Too much bed rest can seriously damage the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.630
human body and in extreme cases can kill;
pressure-ulcers kill 60,000 Americans every

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.660
year. Nurses are trained to move paralyzed
patients every 2 hours to minimize bedsores,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.710
but even if you ignore bedsores, bedrest itself
may be harmful to some. A 2004 study in the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.090
journal Joint, Bone, Spine, found patients
with lower back pain who were prescribed bedrest

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.180
ended up coming back with chronic pain 17
percent more often.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.250
AND, in a 2008 Journal of Applied Physiology
study, rats who were hindlimb-unloaded, sort

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.010
of like bedrest for rats, showed signs of
depression after only two weeks. Eventually,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.930
they developed higher cardiovascular stresses
on top of their psychological issues. Other

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.060
studies have found long periods of bedrest
can cause forgetfulness, confusion, anxiety,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.590
and respiratory problems or blood disorders.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.090
Even Hippocrates, considered the Father of
Western Medicine, who died in 370 BC, had

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.970
found bedridden patients could experience
muscle loss, bone loss and even tooth loss!

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.230
Now, to be clear, science isn't saying bedrest
is evil! Hippocrates would recommend it for

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.760
some minor illnesses, and that practice continues
today. A study done at the Boston Children's

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.980
Hospital found those who were treated for
concussions who took time to rest their brains

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.050
recovered more quickly than those who didn't
rest. A little sloth is good once in awhile!

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.600
The concussed kids weren't even allowed to
read, text, or play video games for several

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.319
days!

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.880
To bring it all back, NASA is studying bedrest
because of deep-space exploration. The CFT70

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.440
study is slated to be completed in December
2015, but they hope to "help understand which

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.819
mission tasks might be affected by changes
in physiology during space flight and design

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.630
countermeasures to prevent or minimize impairment
to these physiological systems" for extended

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.709
space flight... Like for going to Mars...
Or further. Hopefully, they'll learn just

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.080
how much "muscle, bone and cardiovascular
functions" will be affected thanks to all

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.850
that bed rest. Hippocrates would be proud.
if you like digging deep into science of space.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.220
Check out my new show, TestTube Plus. I recently
had astrophysicist Dr. Ian O'Neill on to talk

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.910
about black holes, white holes, wormholes,
and all sorts of other spacey crazy for a

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:16.470
whole WEEK 
of episodes. TestTube Plus is a deep dive
into science. You can subscribe here or in

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.209
the link in the description!! Also it's an
audio podcast on iTunes, which has gotten

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.940
pretty good reviews so far!
