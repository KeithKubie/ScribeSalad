00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.274
- [Voiceover] So we've got a writing

00:00:01.274 --> 00:00:02.940
and language passage here,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.538
it's called, "A Life in Traffic."

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:06.241
All right, let's just get into it.

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.983
A subway system is
expanded to provide service

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:10.588
to a growing suburb.

00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:12.844
A bike-sharing program is adopted

00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:15.932
to encourage non-motorized transportation.

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:18.431
Stoplight timing is
coordinated to alleviate

00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:21.925
rush hour traffic jams in
a congested downtown area.

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:26.522
When any one of these changes occur,

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:29.592
it is likely the result
of careful analysis

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:32.261
conducted by transportation planners.

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:33.878
So that felt a little
off, let's just read it

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:34.571
a little bit more carefully.

00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:36.704
When any one of these changes,

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:39.245
so they are talking about
the individual changes,

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:41.907
they're not talking all of
these changes at the same time.

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:45.482
So if you're saying any
one of these things,

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:48.896
you have a singular
subject right over here.

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:52.248
So the verb should match
that singular subject.

00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:56.474
But they have occur, if you
said all of these changes,

00:00:56.474 --> 00:00:57.368
then you would say occur.

00:00:57.368 --> 00:00:59.237
iIf you're talking about
the plural, many changes,

00:00:59.237 --> 00:00:59.867
what are they doing?

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:01.168
They occur.

00:01:01.168 --> 00:01:03.585
But if you're saying any one
change, it doesn't occur,

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:06.005
a single thing occurs.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.294
This needs to be the singular form.

00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:13.663
If that one change occurs, not occur.

00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:15.917
So this should be occurs.

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:17.543
So let's look at the choices.

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:21.667
So, both of these are
occurs, this one says

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:26.075
when any one of these
changes occurs, they are,

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:28.148
well we're talking about any one change,

00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:31.581
so you shouldn't refer to it
as they for any one change.

00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:34.141
Remember, if you said when
all of these changes occur

00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.214
then you could have said they are.

00:01:36.214 --> 00:01:38.428
But if you are saying any one, once again,

00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:39.972
you're only referring
to one of the changes,

00:01:39.972 --> 00:01:42.817
it occurs, then you
should refer to it as, it.

00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:43.954
So right there.

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:46.880
When any one of these changes occurs,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.598
it is likely the result of
careful analysis conducted

00:01:50.598 --> 00:01:54.418
by transportation planners.

00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:58.359
We're now in the second
paragraph of "A Life in Traffic."

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.575
The work of transportation
planners generally includes

00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:04.033
evaluating current transportation needs,

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:07.081
assessing the effectiveness
of existing facilities,

00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:12.081
and improving those facilities
or they design new ones.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.253
All right, that felt a little bit off,

00:02:14.253 --> 00:02:15.553
so let's think about
what's happening here.

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:16.549
They're listing a bunch of stuff,

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.698
they're listing what is
included in the work of

00:02:19.698 --> 00:02:22.298
transportation planners.

00:02:22.298 --> 00:02:25.183
So the work of transportation
planners generally includes,

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:27.581
and then the first thing is evaluating

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:29.795
current transportation needs.

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:34.590
Then assessing the effectiveness
of existing facilities.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.479
And improving those facilities,

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.177
or they design new ones.

00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:43.148
So right over here when we're
listing the different things,

00:02:43.148 --> 00:02:46.520
we see the first several
things in our list,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.791
we have evaluating, the fancy
term for something like this.

00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.498
This is a gerund, and this is a verb.

00:02:51.498 --> 00:02:54.545
You put an -ing at the end
of it, it becomes a noun.

00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:56.374
The verb, to evaluate, well
now we're talking about

00:02:56.374 --> 00:02:59.380
the action of evaluating.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.822
So that's a gerund.

00:03:00.822 --> 00:03:03.118
Then we have it again, assessing.

00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:06.206
And then we have improving.

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:09.053
And then, if you want this
sentence to be constructed

00:03:09.053 --> 00:03:11.976
in a natural way, instead of they design,

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:15.207
you would want the gerund form of design,

00:03:15.207 --> 00:03:17.157
which is designing.

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:18.661
Now let's see how that sounds.

00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:20.530
The work of transportation planners

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.615
generally include evaluating
current transportation needs,

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:27.580
assessing the effectiveness
of existing facilities,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.121
and improving those facilities,

00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:32.491
or designing new ones.

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:33.919
That sounds a lot better.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.419
If you wanted to be even
clearer, you can just

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.446
think about these gerunds themselves.

00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:42.128
The work of transportation
planners generally includes

00:03:42.128 --> 00:03:47.004
evaluating, assessing, and
improving or designing.

00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:50.397
You have a nice parallel
construction, it's called then.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.758
That all of the things that you're listing

00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:53.810
are in the same form.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.036
So this should definitely
be designing, designing.

00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:01.467
And if we look here, luckily
that is one of the choices.

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:06.236
We're now on question
three right over here.

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:09.791
And, if you're under
time pressure in the SAT,

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.823
you might want to think
about going straight

00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:15.347
to the sentence that includes
question three in it.

00:04:15.347 --> 00:04:17.440
And different people might
have one different style.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.121
Some people might want to
read all of the context

00:04:20.121 --> 00:04:21.950
to kind of keep up with the passage.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.961
It depends on how fast you might read.

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:25.465
But a lot of these you might be able

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:29.061
to jump straight and be able
to go straight to the question.

00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.757
So, let's do that first,
then we can go back

00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:33.221
and see if reading this
actually helped us.

00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:36.858
If analysis of the traffic
count indicates that there

00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:39.844
is more traffic than the current road

00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:42.445
as it is designed at this time,

00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:43.908
yeah that sounds a little strange,

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.838
can efficiently accommodate,

00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:47.971
the transportation planner might recommend

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:50.572
widening the road to add another lane.

00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:53.376
So they're really just saying if analysis

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.367
of the traffic count indicates
that there's more traffic

00:04:55.367 --> 00:04:57.805
than the current road can accommodate,

00:04:57.805 --> 00:05:00.263
that the current road can
efficiently accommodate.

00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:02.951
So really, maybe you don't need any

00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:04.050
of this stuff right over here.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.714
Let's look at the choices.

00:05:05.714 --> 00:05:07.990
So no change, no, I
definitely want to change it.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.290
The way it's written right now is

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.179
way more complicated
than it needs to sound.

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:12.857
It's very hard to understand.

00:05:12.857 --> 00:05:15.784
Current design of the road right now.

00:05:15.784 --> 00:05:17.815
If analysis of the traffic
count indicates that there is

00:05:17.815 --> 00:05:21.473
more traffic than the current
design of the road right now.

00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:25.332
Yeah, that right now feels unnecessary.

00:05:25.332 --> 00:05:28.847
If analysis of the traffic
count indicates that there is

00:05:28.847 --> 00:05:32.362
more traffic than the road as
it is now currently designed

00:05:32.362 --> 00:05:33.804
can efficiently accommodate.

00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:35.866
Yeah, that's a little bit wordy still.

00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:37.593
So, this one, this one actually,

00:05:37.593 --> 00:05:40.478
if analysis of of the traffic
count indicates that there is

00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:44.359
more traffic than the
current design of the road

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:47.223
can efficiently accommodate,
the transportation planner

00:05:47.223 --> 00:05:50.779
might recommend widening the
road to add another lane.

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.506
Yep, this is definitely the one.

00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:53.707
You know if I didn't look at the choices,

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:55.148
similarly you could say the current road

00:05:55.148 --> 00:05:56.204
can efficiently accommodate.

00:05:56.204 --> 00:05:58.296
But you could also say the
current design of the road

00:05:58.296 --> 00:06:00.775
can efficiently accommodate.

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:02.467
Makes this a much, much cleaner,

00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:03.657
easier to understand,

00:06:03.657 --> 00:06:06.158
easier to understand sentence.

00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:08.209
Now that we've done that,
let's just read the,

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:10.261
you obviously would not
have time to do this

00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:11.724
if you were taking the SAT.

00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:14.263
But let's just think about
what the rest of it said.

00:06:14.263 --> 00:06:17.778
Most transportation planners
work in or near cities,

00:06:17.778 --> 00:06:20.299
but some are employed in rural areas.

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:22.248
Say, for example, a large factory is built

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.280
on the outskirts of a small town.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.966
Traffic to and from that location

00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:28.568
would increase at the beginning
and end of work shifts.

00:06:28.568 --> 00:06:30.497
The transportation
planner's job might involve

00:06:30.497 --> 00:06:32.386
conducting a traffic count to determine

00:06:32.386 --> 00:06:34.032
the daily number of vehicles traveling

00:06:34.032 --> 00:06:36.368
on the road to the new factory.

00:06:36.368 --> 00:06:38.481
If analysis of the traffic
count indicates that there

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.833
is more traffic than the
current design of the road

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:43.540
can efficiently accommodate,

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.470
the transportation planner might recommend

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.766
widening the road to add another lane.

00:06:47.766 --> 00:06:50.163
So, all of this the sentences in between

00:06:50.163 --> 00:06:51.849
question two and question three,

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:53.251
it's nice, it gives you context

00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:54.796
for why some transportation planners

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:56.220
might have to deal with stuff that's in

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.184
more rural areas, which is
where there's a factory.

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:01.927
And that's actually the
context for having to analyze

00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:05.035
the traffic as people go to and from work.

00:07:05.035 --> 00:07:07.331
But, you actually didn't
need to read all of this

00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:12.069
in order to answer this
question right over here.

00:07:13.426 --> 00:07:16.008
So, we're now onto question four.

00:07:16.008 --> 00:07:18.202
Transportation planners work closely

00:07:18.202 --> 00:07:20.315
with a number of community stakeholders,

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.024
such as government officials and other

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:24.848
interested organizations and individuals.

00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:28.911
Next, representatives from
the local public health

00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:32.832
department might provide
input in designing a network

00:07:32.832 --> 00:07:37.180
of trails and sidewalks to
encourage people to walk more.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.817
So, next definitely feels like
a strange word to put there.

00:07:40.817 --> 00:07:43.438
In this first sentence, and
I do think it was necessary

00:07:43.438 --> 00:07:44.616
to read this first sentence here.

00:07:44.616 --> 00:07:47.115
Because this, whatever
we put here is, I think,

00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:50.569
going to connect that first
and the second sentence.

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:51.829
So, the first sentence is talking about

00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:53.556
transportation planners that work

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.892
with other stakeholders,
such as government officials,

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:59.265
and other interested
organizations and individuals.

00:07:59.265 --> 00:08:00.890
Now here, they talk about
representatives from

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.495
the local public health department.

00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:03.694
This looks like an example.

00:08:03.694 --> 00:08:04.567
So I would say something like,

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.371
For example, representatives
from the local public health

00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:09.342
department might provide
input in designing a network

00:08:09.342 --> 00:08:13.141
of trails and sidewalks to
encourage people to walk more.

00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:15.356
So, let's see what the choices give us.

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:17.225
We definitely don't want to say no change.

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:18.360
Well, for instance.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.026
This is like saying "for example".

00:08:20.026 --> 00:08:22.037
"For instance", it's
giving an actual instance,

00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:26.019
an actual example of transportation
planners working closely

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:28.010
with a community stakeholder.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.509
"Furthermore", this isn't
extending what was said

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:32.033
in the first sentence.

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:33.740
It's giving and example of it.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.320
Once again, "similarly",
it's not saying something

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.372
that is like what the first sentence said.

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:39.855
It's giving an actual example

00:08:39.855 --> 00:08:41.521
of what the first sentence said.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.081
So, it's definitely B, for instance.

00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:46.032
For instance, representatives
from the local

00:08:46.032 --> 00:08:48.652
public health department
might provide input

00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:50.969
in designing a network
of trails and sidewalks

00:08:50.969 --> 00:08:54.179
to encourage people to walk more.

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.921
Members of the Chamber of
Commerce might share suggestions

00:08:56.921 --> 00:08:59.563
about designing transportation
and parking facilities

00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:01.777
to support local businesses.

00:09:01.777 --> 00:09:05.089
So, that was another
example right over there.

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:07.527
All right, let's go on to question five.

00:09:09.634 --> 00:09:11.381
Now, on question five.

00:09:11.381 --> 00:09:14.794
People who pursue careers
in transportation planning

00:09:14.794 --> 00:09:18.533
have a wide variety of
educational backgrounds.

00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:20.625
That actually feels pretty good.

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:22.677
I don't know if I would
change that at all.

00:09:22.677 --> 00:09:25.237
But let's see what the other choices are.

00:09:25.237 --> 00:09:29.788
People, who pursue careers
in transportation planning,

00:09:29.788 --> 00:09:32.874
have a wide variety of
educational backgrounds.

00:09:32.874 --> 00:09:34.296
Well, when you put these commas around

00:09:34.296 --> 00:09:37.648
"who pursue careers in
transportation planning,"

00:09:37.648 --> 00:09:39.395
it makes it looks like hey, that's just,

00:09:39.395 --> 00:09:41.529
that's something that
doesn't have to be part

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:42.463
of the sentence.

00:09:42.463 --> 00:09:45.633
It's a, sometimes people say
it's a non-restrictive clause.

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:48.294
It's a clause that doesn't,
kind of tells you another way

00:09:48.294 --> 00:09:49.629
of thinking about people.

00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:51.052
It's an optional thing.

00:09:51.052 --> 00:09:53.916
But, for this sentence,
we couldn't just say

00:09:53.916 --> 00:09:57.797
people have a wide variety
of educational backgrounds.

00:09:57.797 --> 00:09:58.772
Even though that is true.

00:09:58.772 --> 00:10:01.596
People do have a wide variety
of educational backgrounds.

00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:04.115
That's not what the
meaning of the sentence is.

00:10:04.115 --> 00:10:06.553
It's very important that we
talk about what type of people.

00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:09.764
People who pursue careers
in transportation planning.

00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:12.181
So, I guess one way you could call it,

00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:14.619
is this is a very important
restrictive clause

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:15.899
for the sentence.

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:17.728
You need to know what type of people.

00:10:17.728 --> 00:10:20.044
That is key to the
meaning of the sentence.

00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:23.132
So, I wouldn't put commas around it,

00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:25.225
which makes you feel that
it's hey, this is optional.

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:27.155
It's another way of describing the people.

00:10:27.155 --> 00:10:27.968
And maybe you could just read,

00:10:27.968 --> 00:10:30.657
People have a wide variety
of educational backgrounds.

00:10:30.657 --> 00:10:31.571
So, I don't like this.

00:10:31.571 --> 00:10:34.741
I think for the meaning
that we are trying to give,

00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:36.021
the writer is trying to give,

00:10:36.021 --> 00:10:37.456
it is very important that you have

00:10:37.456 --> 00:10:39.739
"who pursue careers in
transportation planning,"

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:40.796
not have commas.

00:10:40.796 --> 00:10:42.720
Once again, that commas
make it sound like yeah,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.406
it's just another way
of describing people.

00:10:44.406 --> 00:10:47.758
Not essential necessarily to
the meaning of the sentence.

00:10:47.758 --> 00:10:50.095
But this is essential to
the meaning of the sentence.

00:10:50.095 --> 00:10:54.199
People who pursue careers,
in transportation planning,

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:56.698
have a wide variety of
educational backgrounds.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.262
Well, this is kind of
doing something similar.

00:10:58.262 --> 00:11:00.314
Now they're just putting
"in transportation planning"

00:11:00.314 --> 00:11:01.554
in commas.

00:11:01.554 --> 00:11:03.077
And one way to think about that is

00:11:03.077 --> 00:11:03.748
you could say,

00:11:03.748 --> 00:11:05.373
People who pursue careers have

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.385
a wide variety of educational backgrounds.

00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:08.360
Well that's a true statement,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.046
but this whole passage is about people

00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:13.094
who pursue careers in
transportation planning.

00:11:13.094 --> 00:11:15.694
You don't want to, just
like we said for B,

00:11:15.694 --> 00:11:17.198
you don't want to mark this off,

00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:19.981
you don't want to mark
this off with this clause

00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:22.765
making it seem like this
clause is kind of optional.

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.552
You need to say "in
transportation planning."

00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:26.645
So I wouldn't put commas around it.

00:11:26.645 --> 00:11:27.519
And then finally,

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:31.440
People who pursue careers in
transportation planning, comma,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.634
have a wide variety of
educational backgrounds.

00:11:33.634 --> 00:11:37.169
Well that just feels,
we just taking kind of

00:11:37.169 --> 00:11:39.079
the subject of the
sentence and separating it

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:40.583
from the predicate of
the sentence with a comma

00:11:40.583 --> 00:11:42.167
for some reason.

00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:43.589
So that doesn't make any sense.

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:45.073
So I would definitely go with no change

00:11:45.073 --> 00:11:46.434
with no commas in it.

00:11:46.434 --> 00:11:48.892
People who pursue careers
in transportation planning

00:11:48.892 --> 00:11:53.463
have a wide variety of
educational backgrounds.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.236
And then we can keep reading.

00:11:54.236 --> 00:11:56.145
But obviously if you're under
time pressure for the SAT

00:11:56.145 --> 00:11:58.157
you wouldn't necessarily
have to read all of this.

00:11:58.157 --> 00:11:59.457
But between answering
all of these questions,

00:11:59.457 --> 00:12:01.529
it's nice to be able to read all of this.

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:03.642
A two-year degree in
transportation technology

00:12:03.642 --> 00:12:05.633
may be sufficient for
some entry-level jobs

00:12:05.633 --> 00:12:06.365
in the field.

00:12:06.365 --> 00:12:09.148
Most jobs, however, require
at least a bachelor's degree;

00:12:09.148 --> 00:12:12.182
majors of transportation
planners are varied,

00:12:12.182 --> 00:12:14.588
majors of transportation
planners are varied,

00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:17.352
including fields such as urban
studies, civil engineering,

00:12:17.352 --> 00:12:20.420
geography, or transportation
and logistics management.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.350
For many positions in the field,

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.097
a master's degree is required.

00:12:24.097 --> 00:12:26.176
So once again, if you
were doing this passage

00:12:26.176 --> 00:12:28.289
you wouldn't really have
to read all of this.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.768
you could have just tackled
this sentence by itself.

00:12:30.768 --> 00:12:32.718
But if you have the
time it doesn't hurt to.

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.465
You might learn something about career

00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:36.645
of transportation planning.

00:12:37.512 --> 00:12:38.894
We're now on question six.

00:12:38.894 --> 00:12:39.666
And there's a little bug here.

00:12:39.666 --> 00:12:41.759
I'm using an early prototype
version of the software.

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:43.323
It' says question six of five.

00:12:43.323 --> 00:12:45.131
It should be six of six, but anyway

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.391
I think we get the point.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.951
Transportation planners
perform critical work

00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:51.836
within the broader field of
urban and regional planning.

00:12:51.836 --> 00:12:55.269
As of 2010, there were
approximately 40,300 urban

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:57.504
and regional planners
employed in the United States.

00:12:57.504 --> 00:13:00.694
The United States Bureau of
Labor Statistics forecasts

00:13:00.694 --> 00:13:02.685
steady job growth in this field,

00:13:02.685 --> 00:13:07.033
projecting that 16 percent of
new jobs in all occupations

00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:10.711
will be related to urban
and regional planning.

00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:12.601
So grammatically that looks correct.

00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:14.246
But then they have this chart down here,

00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:16.644
and it says, Urban and Regional Planners

00:13:16.644 --> 00:13:18.621
Predict Increase in Employment,

00:13:18.621 --> 00:13:21.547
Projected 2010 to 2020.

00:13:21.547 --> 00:13:24.026
And what they tell us about
urban and regional planners

00:13:24.026 --> 00:13:27.764
is that between 2010 and
2020 there's going to be

00:13:27.764 --> 00:13:31.401
a 16 percent increase in employment.

00:13:31.401 --> 00:13:33.290
And so I think what's
going on here is that

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.277
this isn't about grammatically
fixing the sentence,

00:13:36.277 --> 00:13:38.105
but actually seeing whether the meaning

00:13:38.105 --> 00:13:39.832
of the sentence is correct.

00:13:39.832 --> 00:13:42.027
So this says, projecting that 16 percent

00:13:42.027 --> 00:13:45.765
of all new jobs, of new
jobs in all occupations

00:13:45.765 --> 00:13:48.142
will be related to urban
and regional planning.

00:13:48.142 --> 00:13:49.463
Is that what this is saying?

00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:52.795
Is this 16 percent saying
the percent of all,

00:13:52.795 --> 00:13:56.045
of new jobs in all occupations
that will be related

00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:58.057
to urban and regional planning?

00:13:58.057 --> 00:14:00.718
No, this 16 percent says it's the growth

00:14:00.718 --> 00:14:04.944
in employment in urban
and regional planners.

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:07.539
It's not saying that
16 percent of all jobs

00:14:07.539 --> 00:14:09.977
in all occupations will
be related to urban

00:14:09.977 --> 00:14:11.765
and regional planning.

00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:13.228
In fact, when you just
look at the raw number,

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:16.438
40,300 urban and regional
planners employed

00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:18.348
in the United States,
that's way, way, way,

00:14:18.348 --> 00:14:21.619
way, way less than 16 percent,

00:14:21.619 --> 00:14:26.109
even if you have growth from 2010 to 2020.

00:14:26.109 --> 00:14:28.120
So this sentence is just not right

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.050
when you look at this data.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.651
They should be talking about
growth from 2010 to 2020.

00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:35.143
It shouldn't be talking
about 16 percent of all jobs

00:14:35.143 --> 00:14:39.105
are going to be related to urban planning.

00:14:39.105 --> 00:14:40.547
So, let's see which of
these choices we'd go.

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:41.705
We definitely don't want to say no change

00:14:41.705 --> 00:14:43.006
'cause we don't think that's right.

00:14:43.006 --> 00:14:44.753
So we could say, warning, however,

00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:46.805
that job growth in urban
and regional planning

00:14:46.805 --> 00:14:49.853
will slow to 14 percent by 2020.

00:14:49.853 --> 00:14:52.258
Well, I guess there's two issues here.

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:56.017
One, there's no data that
implies that the job growth

00:14:56.017 --> 00:14:59.979
will slow to 14 percent by 2020.

00:14:59.979 --> 00:15:03.148
And the other thing is the
idea of warning, however.

00:15:03.148 --> 00:15:04.652
Somehow that this clause would contradict

00:15:04.652 --> 00:15:06.014
what was just said.

00:15:06.014 --> 00:15:08.228
The United States Bureau of
Labor Statistics forecasts

00:15:08.228 --> 00:15:11.194
steady job growth in this
field, warning however,

00:15:11.194 --> 00:15:13.388
that job growth in urban
and regional planning

00:15:13.388 --> 00:15:15.725
will slow, I mean they
almost contradict each other.

00:15:15.725 --> 00:15:17.289
The first part says that there's going

00:15:17.289 --> 00:15:18.326
to be steady job growth.

00:15:18.326 --> 00:15:20.317
And the second one says, warning, however,

00:15:20.317 --> 00:15:21.556
that it's going to slow.

00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:23.689
And there's no data to back this up.

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:25.741
Predicting that employment of urban

00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:28.200
and regional planners
will increase 16 percent

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.577
between 2010 and 2020.

00:15:30.577 --> 00:15:33.482
Well I think that's what this thing is,

00:15:33.482 --> 00:15:34.513
this is what they're saying.

00:15:34.513 --> 00:15:38.182
That you're going to have 16
percent increase in employment

00:15:38.182 --> 00:15:42.042
between 2010 and 2020.

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:44.461
So that one looks very accurate.

00:15:44.461 --> 00:15:47.344
It's actually what's being
described by this chart.

00:15:47.344 --> 00:15:50.290
Indicating that 14 to 18 percent of urban

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.627
and regional planners, planning positions

00:15:52.627 --> 00:15:55.283
will remain unfilled.

00:15:55.283 --> 00:15:56.969
Well now, that's not what
this chart is telling us.

00:15:56.969 --> 00:15:59.041
We don't have any data saying what percent

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:00.992
is going to be unfilled.

00:16:00.992 --> 00:16:02.353
So I definitely wouldn't pick this.

00:16:02.353 --> 00:16:03.572
So, we would say,

00:16:03.572 --> 00:16:06.091
The United States Bureau
of Labor Statistics,

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:09.687
The United States Bureau of
Labor Statistics forecasts

00:16:09.687 --> 00:16:12.796
steady job growth in this field,
predicting that employment

00:16:12.796 --> 00:16:16.310
of urban and regional planners
will increase 16 percent

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.465
between 2010 and 2020.

00:16:18.465 --> 00:16:19.541
Once again we changed it,

00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:22.182
not because this sentence
was grammatically correct,

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.742
incorrect, but because this sentence...

00:16:24.742 --> 00:16:26.815
not because this sentence
was grammatically incorrect,

00:16:26.815 --> 00:16:29.069
but because it actually wasn't
consistent with the data.

00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:30.080
Just wasn't right.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.251
The meaning wasn't correct.

00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:34.569
This C here has the correct meaning.
