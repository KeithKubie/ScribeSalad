1
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.190
One of the most important ways to look at patients is as organisms that age and

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.570
all organisms that reproduce asymmetrically must age.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.830
We certainly do.

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.300
Why do we age must we age.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.070
These are both very important questions and the evolutionary theory of aging has

6
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:23.570
given us good answers to them.

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.900
Aging is the decrease with age in intrinsic ability to survive and reproduce,

8
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.290
and I'd like to emphasize these words in the sentence.

9
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:38.291
It's the decrease with age in the intrinsic ability to survive and reproduce.

10
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:42.650
So we're focusing on things that are happening inside the organism.

11
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.940
Is it ages that make it less able to survive and reproduce?

12
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.440
It is a byproduct of selection for reproductive performance.

13
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:56.330
It's not selected directly and it explains both our susceptibility to

14
00:00:56.331 --> 00:01:00.260
degenerative disease and why it is that we must die.

15
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.100
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.340
<v 0>all organisms with asymmetric reproduction must age.</v>

17
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.900
The first insight in the evolutionary theory of aging is that selection on each

18
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:18.560
specific rates of survival and reproduction decreases with age.

19
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.760
So selection is stronger on the young than it is on the old.

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.570
This was stated as follows by Peter Medawar,

21
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.380
the force of natural selection weekends with increasing age,

22
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.150
even in a theoretically immortal population provided only that it is exposed to

23
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:36.680
real hazards of mortality.

24
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.630
If a genetic disaster happens late enough in an in an individual life,

25
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.690
it's consequences may be completely unimportant.

26
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.810
So to see this,

27
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.740
visualize the distribution of ages of your ancestors at the time that they gave

28
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:55.310
birth to your lineage.

29
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.150
I think about how old was your mother when she gave birth to you?

30
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:02.270
How old was your grandmother when she gave birth to your mother?

31
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.220
Do that going back hundreds of generations into the past construction

32
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.450
constructive frequency histogram in your mind and you will see that it's

33
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:12.650
dominated by the young.

34
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.480
It is not dominated by the old evolution is a numbers game.

35
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.940
Things that happen frequently or important,

36
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.280
things that happen rarely are not important.

37
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.400
Reproduction and the young is important and reproduction in the oldest lesson

38
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.580
were less important and survival in the old becomes insignificant.

39
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.260
Metal wire saw that even if organisms do not age,

40
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.780
there were fewer old than young for.

41
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:42.680
There is some mortality often a lot that occurs for reasons that are unrelated

42
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:43.700
to age and aging.

43
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.650
So mortality just due to accidents can eliminate people even if they're in good

44
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:53.651
shape and therefore the number of people in a population that are old must be

45
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.700
less than the number that are young.

46
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.330
Evolution is a numbers game selection is stronger on events that happen

47
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.164
frequently.

48
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Reproduction in the young than on those that happen less frequently survival in

49
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:10.210
the old.
So that's the first insight.

50
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.300
The second insight comes from George Williams.

51
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:17.200
He added an important genetic effect that we call antagonistic pleiotropy.

52
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.460
We've already discussed it a bit with regard to reproduction and Framingham and

53
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:25.550
cancer risk
and antagonistic playa trophy.

54
00:03:25.551 --> 00:03:30.460
A gene has a positive effect on traits early in life in a negative effect late

55
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:35.200
in life.
The Playa tropey part means that the gene is having an effect on tour.

56
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:40.201
More traits in the antagonistic part means that it's plus in one set and

57
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:41.590
negative and the other set.

58
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.020
<v 0>Another idea is mutation accumulation.</v>

60
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:48.810
That would mean that the gene was neutral early in life,

61
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.690
but it was having a negative effect late in life.

62
00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:55.140
So it's not really being expressed early in life and when it is expressed late

63
00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:56.520
in life,
it's affected as negative.

64
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.470
There was a lot of evidence that it supports the existence of antagonistic

65
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.450
pleiotropy and there's very little evidence suggesting the importance of

66
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:08.580
mutation accumulation.
Although there is some,

67
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.350
one reason for this may be that there are very few genes that are only expressed

68
00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:18.000
in a narrow range of ages.
No.

69
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.780
How the selection work on lifespan from a life history perspective,

70
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.190
a change in selection that lengthens life is going to be one that increases the

71
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:32.610
relative contribution of fitness of adults and decreases that of juveniles.

72
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.390
So if you look at that basically is a change that makes adults worth more and

73
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:44.430
juveniles worth less than it makes sense that such a change in selection would

74
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.500
include lower out at mortality rates,

75
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.640
makes adults worth more and higher juvenile mortality rates,

76
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.390
makes juveniles worth less.
And in contrast,

77
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:59.100
if adult mortality rates increase than organisms should evolve more rapid aging.

78
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:04.101
And an easy way to conceptualize that is why should you invest in maintaining a

79
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:08.430
body that will be dead anyway for some other reason over which you have no

80
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:11.760
control,
better to invest in reproduction while you can.

81
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.050
So the extrinsic selection pressures are interacting with the internal tradeoffs

82
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.190
to shift organisms from having long lives in which they have delayed

83
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:29.370
reproduction and perhaps reproduce more slowly to having short lives where they

84
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.100
tried to pack reproduction in right at the beginning.

85
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.980
Now what are the causes of aging will go through this at several levels.

86
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.560
At one level,
aging is a byproduct of selection for reproductive performance.

87
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.900
It arises through the evolutionary accumulation of many genes that have positive

88
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.430
or neutral effects on fitness components early in life and negative effects on

89
00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:56.930
fitness components late in life.

90
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.090
So the old are paying for the beauty of the young

91
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.690
because organisms are bundles of genetically variable tradeoffs because aging is

92
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:12.470
a byproduct and because patients differ genetically and developmentally,

93
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.630
we expect aging to have many causes.
The differ among individuals.

94
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.640
Recall the last few lectures.
We know that patients are genetically different.

95
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:25.070
We know that they've had different developmental histories.

96
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.190
We know that they contain tradeoffs.

97
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.470
We know that the contributions to those trade offs are different between

98
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:38.390
individuals and we know that aging is the product of selection operating on a

99
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.333
tradeoff.

100
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.010
That means that individual patients are going to be dying for different reasons.

101
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.570
If we fix one problem,
another one would emerge.
This appears to be true.

102
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.970
First we re we reduced the mortality that's caused by infectious disease.

103
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.030
We did that with vaccines and antibiotics.

104
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.050
Then cardiovascular disease emerged as a major killer.

105
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.480
Then we improve the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and now

106
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:14.330
patients are dying more frequently of cancer and Alzheimer's.

107
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.740
This cycle appears to be endless.

108
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:23.570
It's not yet clear that the process has an end.
In other words,

109
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.930
built in to the bodies of people who were aging back before the demographic

110
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:31.694
transition.

111
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.650
There were susceptibilities that would have allowed them to die more frequently

112
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:39.500
of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's or cancer,

113
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:44.300
but they were being covered up by the high mortality rate of infectious disease,

114
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.670
eliminate the infectious disease.
These other processes emerge.

115
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.820
They are probably tied to selection for reproductive performance.

116
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.520
Tom Kirkwood extended George William's idea bit by relating repair explicitly to

117
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:07.790
fitness.
He called it the disposable Soma theory.

118
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.500
The idea is that investment in repair should evolve to a level that is lower

119
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.760
than what is needed for indefinite life.

120
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.260
So this is a picture of that central idea.

121
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.820
On the x axis,
we have investment in repair.
On the y axis,

122
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:30.821
we have fitness for all of the reasons that I've just discussed,

123
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.590
fitness is going to be very low when there's no repair,

124
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.510
it's going to increase with as repair increases.

125
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:43.160
So his survival increases.

126
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:46.700
This will allow organisms to survive until they reproduce,

127
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.700
but then once they start reproducing,

128
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.480
it is going to create a condition where the population can be by antagonistic

129
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.540
play trophic genes.

130
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.150
And what that means is that further investment in repairs going to be trading

131
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:07.830
off with reproduction.
So organisms can survive,

132
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.240
uh,
to a given age in this blue space.

133
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.160
If they could break through past this point,
they could have indefinite survival.

134
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.173
In other words,

135
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.660
the idea is that there's no intrinsic limit in biological materials and repair

136
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:29.460
processes on how long organisms can survive.

137
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
The reason that the age is that their optimal level of repair,

138
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.420
which is giving them their optimal contribution to future generations,

139
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.730
is set at a lower level than that which is required for indefinite life.

140
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.650
Now,
who should age?
Well,

141
00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:55.651
Gus device mind saw back in 1882 that ace asymmetrically reproducing organisms

142
00:09:56.771 --> 00:10:00.520
are the ones that should age,
but that was forgotten.

143
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.580
George Williams suggested that sexual organisms that had a separation of Soma,

144
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:11.080
which was mortal from germline,
which was immortal,
we're the ones that treat age.

145
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.740
John Maynard Smith extended that to plants by saying that sexual organisms that

146
00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:21.850
return to a single cell stage at some point in their life cycle should age,

147
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.630
which also happens in plants and plants do scenarios.

148
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.730
Then Linda Partridge and Nick Barton,
uh,

149
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.200
noted that any asymmetrically reproducing organism in which the mother,

150
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:38.290
which is older,
can be distinguished from the daughter,
which is younger,

151
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.670
should age.
So this is a rediscovery of Augusta Weissman's idea.

152
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.840
And they did it independently.
I think they were correct.

153
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.460
It is symmetrically reproducing organism that should not age.

154
00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:56.461
So here is a picture of symmetrically reproducing organism and when the division

155
00:10:56.711 --> 00:10:58.090
is perfectly symmetrical,

156
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.480
it's impossible for selection to distinguish between mother and daughter.

157
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.690
Both are equally intact or equally damaged.

158
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.010
And the reproductive payoff of improving the maintenance of both is equal.

159
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.580
An asymmetrically organism,
however,
does age.
Here's an example,

160
00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:16.510
column vector.

161
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.630
This is a stock bacterium and it has an interesting life cycle.

162
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.113
<v 1>The</v>

163
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.710
<v 0>adult sets down on the substrate</v>

164
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.523
<v 1>and</v>

165
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.940
<v 0>this is the swarm or sale sitting down as an adult.</v>

166
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.730
It then grows and it has an agent first reproduction when it divides and

167
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:42.660
produces a swarm cell.
This is the dispersing progeny going off.

168
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.380
It has an interval between reproductive events and it has an agent maturation.

169
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.730
Now when the payoff of maintaining the mother cell becomes smaller,

170
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.240
then maintaining the daughter cell.
So the mother is reproduced,

171
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:02.620
the daughter not yet started,

172
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.690
then aging will evolve and it will evolve as a cost of reproductive performance.

173
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.980
And when we measure reproductive output in Cabo bactor,

174
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.870
it does decline with age.
So this is reproductive output and cells per hour.

175
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.300
This is the age that the stock sells here.

176
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.620
The three lines are three different replicates and you can see that there's a

177
00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:27.770
very consistent decline in reproductive output with age.

178
00:12:27.771 --> 00:12:31.550
So this was the first observation that bacteria,
CNS,

179
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.040
<v 1>yeah.</v>

180
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.060
<v 0>What are the mechanisms that mediate aging?
Well,</v>

181
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:41.510
one of them is associated with energy flow.

182
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:45.770
So a byproduct of energy flow is protons.

183
00:12:45.771 --> 00:12:47.210
They leak out of Mitochondria,

184
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:52.510
they bind with water in the cytoplasm and they cause oxidative damage,

185
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.950
increases in growth in metabolic rate cause energy flow to increase.

186
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:03.020
So things that grow more rapidly and are eating more are also producing more

187
00:13:03.021 --> 00:13:06.170
proton leakage and causing more cellular damage.

188
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

189
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.930
<v 0>Some candidate genes that mediate,
grow,</v>

190
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.880
that mediate this kind of response or a growth hormone and the insulin like

191
00:13:13.881 --> 00:13:14.714
growth factor

192
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.160
and mutations in these pathways have been investigated in mice,

193
00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:26.531
flies and worms and some of those mutations increase lifespan in these model

194
00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:29.270
organisms up to 70%

195
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:31.010
<v 1>yeah.</v>

196
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.710
<v 0>Now humans are neither Meisner worms or flies.</v>

197
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.020
Similar mutations and homologous genes do not lengthen life except possibly in

198
00:13:39.021 --> 00:13:42.500
one cluster of dwarves who live on an island in Croatia.

199
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.760
And these people are effected in bad ways.

200
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.470
They remain prepubescent,

201
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.770
they remain the size of a seven year old and they are chronically cold and

202
00:13:51.771 --> 00:13:52.604
sleepy.

203
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.740
So this is not a candidate for gene therapy in humans,

204
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.800
at least not in any simple way because mutations in these genes have

205
00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:06.890
consequences for several traits that are quite negative.

206
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

207
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.340
<v 0>Now,
could we select ourselves to live longer?</v>

208
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.890
Is immortality plausible?

209
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:18.190
It's an interesting question and it's one in which people are investing.

210
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:19.901
Well,

211
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:24.901
the heritability of lifespan in humans is about a 0.25 which is not large but is

212
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:30.190
significant and it does permit a response to selection.

213
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.640
If there were strong selection,
the response could be fairly Rep.

214
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.230
<v 0>One could carry out that kind of selection simply by delaying age at first birth</v>

216
00:14:40.231 --> 00:14:42.840
progressively.
So everyone would agree,
okay,

217
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:46.860
we're not going to have any children until we're 25 and then after we had come

218
00:14:46.861 --> 00:14:50.400
into equilibrium,
at that point we could say,
oh,

219
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:54.680
now we're not going have any children until we're 30 and let that come into

220
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:58.880
equilibrium.
And then 35 and then 40 and so forth.

221
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.060
Just increasing the delay until the first child appears.

222
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.800
The survivors would then become healthier and they'd become more vigorous at

223
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:09.140
ages that are currently considered very old.

224
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.200
So 40 year olds would then start to develop the physiology of 18 year olds.

225
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:21.140
The upper limit on average lifespan would probably be reached at several hundred

226
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.690
years,
and that is the lifespan that could evolve.

227
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:27.320
If we could eliminate all intrinsic sources of mortality,

228
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.540
if everyone eventually died in accidents,
it's not immortality,

229
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:35.300
but it's considerably greater than what we currently have.

230
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.240
This is an absolute fantasy.

231
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.780
It could never be implemented because many people would cheat and they would

232
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:45.800
reproduce early.
So it might sound good,
but it won't work.

233
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.650
So to summarize,

234
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.330
aging evolves in any organism that reproduces asymmetrically,

235
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.060
and that appears to include all organisms.

236
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.900
It does still for two reasons.
First,

237
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.650
selection intensity declines with age when mothers can be distinguished from

238
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:08.540
daughters and genes that improve early performance at the cost of late survival

239
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.310
cannot be kept out of the population and accumulate over evolutionary time.

240
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.120
Plus,
aging is not directly selected.

241
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.260
It is a byproduct of selection for reproductive performance.

242
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.070
The evolutionary theory of aging has been repeatedly tested in several organisms

243
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.400
and frequently confirmed.
It appears to be pretty solid.
