00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:07.143
There are over 2 billion school-aged
individuals living in the world today.

00:00:07.143 --> 00:00:12.182
That's more young people than any
other time in human history.

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:14.344
And it's this generation's creativity,

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:16.163
their actions,

00:00:16.163 --> 00:00:17.414
their art,

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:18.653
their poetry,

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:19.945
their protests,

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:21.173
their questions,

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:22.434
their code,

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:24.324
their dreams.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:31.364
It's this generation's ideas that will
define the future of our world.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:38.805
One well articulated idea
can reach and inspire millions.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.525
That's why TED's youth 
and education initiative, TED-Ed,

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:45.695
has created a program 
that's dedicated to sparking

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:50.724
and celebrating the best ideas
of young people around the world.

00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:54.644
"The essence of TED-Ed was to create
more confident individuals."

00:00:54.644 --> 00:00:58.075
"It was our club; 
it was run by us and for us."

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:01.015
The program is called TED-Ed Clubs.

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:04.556
It supports students in identifying
their passions,

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:07.065
learning public speaking skills,

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:10.324
connecting with a global
network of classrooms,

00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:15.995
and sharing student ideas
in the form of short, TED-style talks.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:17.746
Here's how it works.

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:23.126
Participating students and teachers gain 
access to a free and flexible curriculum

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:27.977
they can use to start a TED-Ed Club
at their school.

00:01:27.977 --> 00:01:30.766
Each suggested meeting uses TED Talks

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:34.586
to help students engage 
in critical thinking exercises

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:38.106
and gain invaluable presentation skills.

00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:42.346
In the final meeting, students are invited
to give their own TED Talk,

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:44.186
and if they record their Talk,

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:47.557
they can upload it 
to TED-Ed's award-winning platform,

00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:49.766
where it can be referenced on a résumé,

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:51.166
a college application,

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:55.036
and shared with participating clubs
around the world.

00:01:55.036 --> 00:02:01.146
Over 2 billion young people empowered
and encouraged to share their ideas.

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:02.977
Imagine that future

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:06.736
and bring TED-Ed Clubs 
to your community today.
