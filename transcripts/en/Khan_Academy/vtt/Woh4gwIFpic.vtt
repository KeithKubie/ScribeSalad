00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.817
- On December 2, 1823,
U.S. President James Monroe

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:08.152
was giving his annual
State of the Union Address

00:00:08.152 --> 00:00:11.440
to Congress when he threw
in a couple of remarks

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.681
about the United States' relationship

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:15.614
with the powers of Europe.

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:18.121
He said, "The American continents,

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.412
"by the free and independent condition

00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:22.602
"which they have assumed and maintained,

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:25.730
"are henceforth not to
be considered as subjects

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.730
"for future colonization
by any European powers.

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:32.764
"In the wars of the European powers

00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:34.920
"in matters relating to themselves

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.012
"we have never taken any part,

00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:40.472
"nor does it comport
with our policy to do so.

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:42.822
"We owe it, therefore, to candor

00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:45.209
"and to the amicable relations existing

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:48.057
"between the United States
and those powers to declare

00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:50.949
"that we should consider
any attempt on their part

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.924
"to extend their system to
any portion of this hemisphere

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:58.160
"as dangerous to our peace and safety."

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.191
So, basically, in one fell swoop,

00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:05.280
James Monroe told the
crowned heads of Europe

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.613
to stay out of the Americas.

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:13.406
He said, "As far as I'm concerned,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.239
"the era of colonization is over."

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:23.022
Stop giving us the side-eye.

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:24.918
Stop looking at your
maps and trying to decide

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.589
where you might place
a little colony next.

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:31.503
No more European
colonization in the Americas.

00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:33.920
What's more, don't interfere.

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:43.177
The Americas are the
United States' concern

00:01:43.177 --> 00:01:45.550
so we don't want the powers of Europe

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.020
to meddle in any of the affairs

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.322
of Latin America or South America.

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:52.848
You can keep your system,

00:01:52.848 --> 00:01:55.931
and by system, Monroe meant monarchy,

00:01:58.643 --> 00:01:59.984
out of the Americas.

00:01:59.984 --> 00:02:02.984
This is the hemisphere of democracy.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:07.570
So, this is an incredibly bold statement.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.062
Let's not forget here
that the United States

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:13.759
is not exactly a world power in 1823.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.345
They could, at best, be
said to be a minor power,

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.250
even in the Americas.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.227
The United States is not a
major world military power,

00:02:22.227 --> 00:02:24.503
it's not a major world Navy power.

00:02:24.503 --> 00:02:27.098
Let's remember that in this era,

00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:30.146
having a strong Navy was
tantamount to being able

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:31.777
to take over the world.

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:35.402
They're kind of a second-rate nation

00:02:35.402 --> 00:02:38.140
in a second-rate part of the world.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.147
So, what was the response
when the United States

00:02:40.147 --> 00:02:43.717
made this incredibly bold assertion

00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:46.092
that they would not permit
any more colonization

00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:50.097
or interference in the
Americas from Europe?

00:02:50.097 --> 00:02:51.665
Mmm...

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:52.498
Crickets.

00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:55.349
Nobody really cared.

00:02:57.707 --> 00:02:59.579
To the established powers of Europe,

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.375
the United States was no
more than a little mosquito,

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.783
buzzing around, maybe
making a lot of noise,

00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:08.148
a bit annoying, but pretty easy to swat.

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:11.303
No matter how much noise
the United States made,

00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:13.668
the only thing that mattered to

00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:16.595
the great powers of the
world was whether or not

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:20.762
the United States could
enforce the Monroe Doctrine,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.571
which with such a weak military presence,

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.024
they certainly could not.

00:03:26.024 --> 00:03:29.357
Nevertheless, the Monroe Doctrine became

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:34.487
a key facet of American foreign policy

00:03:34.487 --> 00:03:38.378
throughout the 19th century
and into the 20th century.

00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:42.211
It became a justification
for Manifest Destiny

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.979
and would play a major role
in the foreign policies

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.969
of Teddy Roosevelt and
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:54.928
So, where did the Monroe
Doctrine come from?

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:56.835
Well, let's take a minute
to look at some of the

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:59.490
major world events of the time period

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.741
and the major players who brought
the Monroe Doctrine about.

00:04:03.741 --> 00:04:05.824
All right, dateline 1820.

00:04:07.703 --> 00:04:11.869
It has been a bad couple of
years for monarchy in Europe.

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:15.395
For one thing, the Napoleonic
Wars and the French Revolution

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:19.075
have been convulsing the powers of Europe

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:20.575
for several years.

00:04:21.537 --> 00:04:25.861
By 1815, the Revolution
has more or less finished

00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:30.028
and the monarchies of
Europe have been reinstated.

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:37.679
But, this revolutionary fervor

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:39.416
coming from the French Revolution,

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:41.511
coming also from the American Revolution,

00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:42.932
has started to spread.

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:46.417
So, movements for independence
are now taking hold

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:47.801
in South America.

00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:51.994
There's a Chilean
movement for independence,

00:04:51.994 --> 00:04:54.649
Argentinian movement for independence,

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:57.510
Venezuelan movement for independence.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.260
So, they've kind of
caught the democracy bug.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:06.746
The people in the United
States are cheering

00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:09.539
for their southern brethren, saying,

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.072
"Excellent work, picking up democracy,

00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:15.424
"breaking away from
old-fashioned, monarchical,

00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:16.864
"tyrannical Europe.

00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:18.313
"We're totally on your side."

00:05:18.313 --> 00:05:22.469
But it's easier to make an
independence movement happen

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.437
when the home country is
distracted with another war,

00:05:27.437 --> 00:05:29.214
aka the Napoleonic Wars.

00:05:29.214 --> 00:05:31.406
Once the Napoleonic Wars are over,

00:05:31.406 --> 00:05:33.755
the monarchies of Europe start saying,

00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:35.702
"Hmm, you know what?

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:39.369
"Since Spain is in
control of these nations,

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:43.666
"now Spain has the time and energy

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:47.833
"to consider maybe putting
down these revolutions."

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:53.842
So, they're no longer distracted by war,

00:05:53.842 --> 00:05:56.866
and they have the
manpower and the bandwidth

00:05:56.866 --> 00:06:01.657
to think about maybe trying
to reinstate, or secure,

00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:05.049
Spanish rule in South
America where nations

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:07.745
have been in the process of revolution.

00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:09.384
Now, we don't know the extent to which

00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:11.055
Spain was actually planning on

00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:12.780
putting these revolutions down,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.704
but we do know that the
United States and England

00:06:16.704 --> 00:06:19.288
were very concerned that the monarchies

00:06:19.288 --> 00:06:22.121
of the continent-- France and Spain--

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.375
might join together and try to put down

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:28.303
all of these revolutions.

00:06:28.303 --> 00:06:29.887
Now, wouldn't they want that?

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:33.748
Well, for the most part, it
kind of came down to markets.

00:06:33.748 --> 00:06:38.157
If you think back to early
American colonial society,

00:06:38.157 --> 00:06:41.990
the economic system was
known as mercantilism.

00:06:43.261 --> 00:06:45.844
Mercantilism is the practice of

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:50.195
colonies kind of existing to
enrich the mother country.

00:06:50.195 --> 00:06:53.862
So, all trade goes
through the home country.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:07:00.011
That means that the home country
is going to be making sure

00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:02.135
that the colonies are not trading

00:07:02.135 --> 00:07:03.962
with any other international partners

00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:06.634
because they want to be
the ones who are enriched

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:09.995
by the natural resources of the colonies.

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:13.970
So, when Chile and Argentina and Venezuela

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.310
revolt from Spain,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.060
it means that their
markets are now opened up

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
to the United States and to England.

00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:27.718
So, England and the United
States are not eager

00:07:27.718 --> 00:07:30.718
to see these new nations be returned

00:07:31.711 --> 00:07:33.691
to their colonial status because,

00:07:33.691 --> 00:07:35.815
thanks to mercantilism, they're not going

00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:37.438
to be able to trade with them anymore.

00:07:37.438 --> 00:07:39.355
With this idea in mind,

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.809
the British Foreign Secretary,

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:45.059
a man named George Canning,

00:07:46.894 --> 00:07:50.477
approached the American
Secretary of State,

00:07:51.798 --> 00:07:53.298
John Quincy Adams,

00:07:56.145 --> 00:07:57.145
and he said,

00:07:59.022 --> 00:08:02.697
"Why don't we make a joint proclamation

00:08:02.697 --> 00:08:05.963
"between the United
States and Great Britain

00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:08.619
"saying that the powers of Europe

00:08:08.619 --> 00:08:11.216
"should not interfere in the New World.?

00:08:11.216 --> 00:08:13.013
And John Quincy Adams thought,

00:08:13.013 --> 00:08:17.479
"Hmm, I'm not sure if I
like you British folks."

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:21.562
Remember that the War of
1812 had not taken place

00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:25.315
too long beforehand.

00:08:25.315 --> 00:08:26.762
The United States was not quite ready

00:08:26.762 --> 00:08:29.625
to be friends with the United Kingdom yet.

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:32.269
And they were a little bit afraid that

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:36.655
if the United States made a
joint declaration with England

00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:39.542
that it would seem a little bit like

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:41.919
a flea on the back of a rottweiler saying,

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.600
"Don't mess with us or we'll bite you!"

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.482
The United States didn't
have nearly the strength

00:08:46.482 --> 00:08:48.576
to actually make an equal partnership

00:08:48.576 --> 00:08:50.069
so it might have looked a little bit like

00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:53.383
they were hiding behind the
British in a joint declaration,

00:08:53.383 --> 00:08:57.486
but J.Q.A. thought this
actually still sounded

00:08:57.486 --> 00:09:02.146
like a pretty good plan
so he floated the idea

00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:04.313
to President James Monroe.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.325
Now, there's kind of a

00:09:10.325 --> 00:09:13.699
movement of nationalism
going on at this time

00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:14.888
in the United States.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.905
Even though the United States

00:09:16.905 --> 00:09:20.288
didn't technically win the War of 1812,

00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:22.764
they kind of felt like they had.

00:09:22.764 --> 00:09:25.827
So, they're busy kind of creating

00:09:25.827 --> 00:09:30.554
a new nationalist rhetoric
in the United States.

00:09:30.554 --> 00:09:32.893
They're feeling pretty
good about themselves.

00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:37.664
They stood up to their old
foe of Great Britain, and won.

00:09:37.664 --> 00:09:39.133
Or, at the very least, didn't lose,

00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:40.551
but to them it was kind of the same thing.

00:09:40.551 --> 00:09:44.172
So, John Quincy Adams
crafts for James Monroe

00:09:44.172 --> 00:09:46.695
what will become known
as the Monroe Doctrine.

00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:49.232
Now, Monroe is not only concerned about

00:09:49.232 --> 00:09:52.973
the possibility of European
powers coming down here

00:09:52.973 --> 00:09:55.102
and trying to start fights with each other

00:09:55.102 --> 00:09:57.647
over the fate of South America.

00:09:57.647 --> 00:10:00.423
Monroe was also worried about Russia,

00:10:00.423 --> 00:10:04.971
who had recently made some
territorial claims in Canada,

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:06.465
saying that their territory should come

00:10:06.465 --> 00:10:08.237
all the way down there.

00:10:08.237 --> 00:10:11.598
The Russians have started
putting some forts

00:10:11.598 --> 00:10:14.124
on the coast of California,

00:10:14.124 --> 00:10:16.107
close to modern day San Francisco.

00:10:16.107 --> 00:10:20.684
So, Monroe sees the old
monarchical powers of Europe

00:10:20.684 --> 00:10:24.672
sort of encroaching both from
the north and the south here.

00:10:24.672 --> 00:10:28.172
And so, in 1823, he makes the announcement

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.647
of the Monroe Doctrine.

00:10:30.647 --> 00:10:33.230
He says, "No more colonization.

00:10:34.374 --> 00:10:36.541
"Russia, get out of there.

00:10:38.334 --> 00:10:41.501
"And no more interference, in general.

00:10:45.036 --> 00:10:49.157
"So, don't try to turn these new republics

00:10:49.157 --> 00:10:53.240
"back into colonies under
the rule of monarchies.

00:10:54.217 --> 00:10:55.762
"In fact, just keep your monarchy

00:10:55.762 --> 00:10:59.108
"out of our hemisphere altogether."

00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:03.084
Monroe makes this statement
completely outside

00:11:03.084 --> 00:11:07.124
of the relationship
with the United Kingdom

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:10.996
so it doesn't have this kind
of riding on the coattails

00:11:10.996 --> 00:11:13.540
feeling of being allied with Britain.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.099
But nevertheless, the only
way that the United States

00:11:17.099 --> 00:11:21.468
can actually count on the
Monroe Doctrine being enforced

00:11:21.468 --> 00:11:25.635
is because the British Navy
is so incredibly powerful.

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.114
I'm going to draw a very bad boat here.

00:11:30.114 --> 00:11:33.363
Nobody who heard about the
Monroe Doctrine thought,

00:11:33.363 --> 00:11:36.184
"Ah, man, we better not make
the United States angry."

00:11:36.184 --> 00:11:37.204
What they thought was,

00:11:37.204 --> 00:11:40.664
"Ah, man, we better not make
the British Empire angry."

00:11:40.664 --> 00:11:43.501
Because they knew that the British Navy,

00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:45.630
which wanted neutrality of the seas,

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.976
which wanted to be able to continue

00:11:47.976 --> 00:11:49.758
to have these trade relationships

00:11:49.758 --> 00:11:52.058
with new nations in South America,

00:11:52.058 --> 00:11:56.292
would defend the neutrality
and the independence

00:11:56.292 --> 00:11:58.530
of South America by proxy,

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.213
and by doing so, kind of
enforce the Monroe Doctrine.

00:12:02.213 --> 00:12:03.092
So, this is interesting.

00:12:03.092 --> 00:12:05.826
You could think of this as
being a little bit weaselly

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:10.403
on the part of Monroe,
declaring that the Americas

00:12:10.403 --> 00:12:13.081
should remain free of
the influence of Europe,

00:12:13.081 --> 00:12:17.310
but counting on the United
Kingdom to enforce it.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.944
Or you could think of it as perhaps

00:12:18.944 --> 00:12:20.803
a brilliant policy maneuver.

00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:21.636
I don't know.

00:12:21.636 --> 00:12:25.862
Certainly, the nations of
South America and Latin America

00:12:25.862 --> 00:12:29.603
appreciated this
declaration of independence

00:12:29.603 --> 00:12:32.585
for the Americas coming
from the United States,

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.860
but they certainly knew
that it was more about

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.774
the United States making sure that

00:12:37.774 --> 00:12:40.696
they, themselves, were
protected than wanting

00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:44.604
to have a real equal
partnership with South America.

00:12:44.604 --> 00:12:48.148
So, the Monroe Doctrine
really didn't amount to much

00:12:48.148 --> 00:12:50.227
for most of the 19th century.

00:12:50.227 --> 00:12:52.908
It was certainly a justification

00:12:52.908 --> 00:12:56.572
as the United States
continued to push west

00:12:56.572 --> 00:12:58.835
in their quest of Manifest Destiny,

00:12:58.835 --> 00:13:00.985
but it will become increasingly important

00:13:00.985 --> 00:13:04.048
in the 20th century as the United States

00:13:04.048 --> 00:13:06.836
steps onto the world
stage with things like

00:13:06.836 --> 00:13:08.919
the Spanish American War,

00:13:11.218 --> 00:13:14.530
under the auspices of William McKinley,

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.436
and making famous Theodore
Roosevelt, saying that

00:13:19.436 --> 00:13:22.687
the Caribbean is the province
of the United States,

00:13:22.687 --> 00:13:25.926
and the nations of Latin
America and South America.

00:13:25.926 --> 00:13:29.547
They're only to be dealt with
through the United States.

00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:31.801
So, you can see the Monroe Doctrine as

00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:35.174
a very early expression
of the United States'

00:13:35.174 --> 00:13:38.045
intention to become a world power

00:13:38.045 --> 00:13:41.966
and to be the leading
and most powerful nation

00:13:41.966 --> 00:13:43.146
in the Americas.

00:13:43.146 --> 00:13:46.404
And you can also see it as an expression

00:13:46.404 --> 00:13:49.012
of American isolationism,

00:13:49.012 --> 00:13:51.164
which will really be

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:54.914
the leading aspect of
American foreign policy

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.820
up until the Spanish American War.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.169
As early as George
Washington's Farewell Address,

00:14:02.169 --> 00:14:05.299
Washington expressed the
view that the United States

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:08.754
should just not get involved
in the business of Europe.

00:14:08.754 --> 00:14:11.357
That that would only lead to heartbreak.

00:14:11.357 --> 00:14:13.850
While the Monroe Doctrine
is now kind of taking

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.759
not only that idea that the United States

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:19.652
should not become involved
in the affairs of Europe,

00:14:19.652 --> 00:14:22.576
but also turning it around and saying that

00:14:22.576 --> 00:14:24.520
Europe should not become involved

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.743
in the affairs of the Americas,

00:14:26.743 --> 00:14:29.432
drawing an even stronger barrier

00:14:29.432 --> 00:14:31.836
between the old world and the new.
