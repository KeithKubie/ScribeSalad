00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.580
We're on problem 30.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.890
Let's see, they've drawn
a circle there.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.850
If o is the center of the circle
above, what fraction of

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.360
the circle is shaded?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.270
Let me draw that.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.200
They draw a circle.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.930
And then they have two lines
that go through the center,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.815
essentially.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:20.310
And one line looks like that.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.155
Another line looks something
like that.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.040
So they tell us that this
is the center, o.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.980
They tell us this
is 150 degrees.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.950
So the question is, what
fraction of the circular

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.000
region is shaded?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.760
And the shaded region is this.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.840
This is the shaded region.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.570
So we just have to figure out
what percentage of the total

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.780
degrees of the circle
are shaded.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.030
So let's think about
it this way.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.570
If this is 150 degrees, what
is this angle right here?

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.980
Well, this angle and
150 degrees are

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.270
supplementary, right?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.780
So this angle plus this angle
is going to be equal to 180.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.720
So 30 plus 150 is
equal to 180.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.550
And then you could either say,
oh, these are opposite angles,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.160
so they're equal.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.260
Or you can make the same
argument here, that 150 plus

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.890
this angle has to be equal to
180, so this angle is also

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.360
equal to 30.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.570
So what is the total angle
measure of the shaded region?

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.680
You have 30 degrees here.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.750
And you have 30 degrees here.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.030
So a total of 60 degrees.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.720
And the whole circle is
how many degrees?

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.450
If you run it all the way around
the circle, how many

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.670
degrees is that?

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.220
Well, that's 360 degrees.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.920
So 60/360.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.600
That's 1/6 of the circle
is shaded.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.120
And that is choice C.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.190
Question 31.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.430
This was question 30.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.830
Question 31.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:58.400
If Juan takes 11 seconds to run
y yards-- so y yards for

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.020
every 11 seconds.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.560
Well, another way you could
think about it is, y/11 yards

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.600
per second.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.330
Fair enough.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.190
How many seconds will
it take him to run x

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.193
yards at the same rate?

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.740
So he is going at y
yards per second.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.690
So how long will it take
him to go x yards?

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.350
Well, if I said that I'm going
at 5 miles per hour, how long

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.510
will it take me to
go 10 miles?

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.390
Let's say I go 5
miles per hour.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.030
Or let's say 5 meters
per hour.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.020
How long will take me
to go 10 meters?

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.600
You would say 10 divided
by 5 is equal to 2.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.960
2 hours.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.710
So likewise, we have
his speed.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.930
That's his speed we're talking
about, how fast he runs.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.720
His speed is y/11 yards
per second.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.580
And we want to know how
long will it take

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.600
him to run x yards.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.990
So we could just take x divided
by the speed, divided

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.762
by y/11, and we'll get the
answer in seconds.

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:09.770
And you could work out the
units, but x divided by y/11,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.700
that's the same thing as x
times 11/y, equals 11x/y.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.030
Another way to view it is this
is equal to the rate.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.120
And we know, from probably the
first day in physics, that

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.220
distance is equal to
rate times time.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.840
This might be an easier way
for you to think about it.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.480
However it best forms
connections in your brain.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.060
Distance is equal to
rate times time.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.680
They tell us that the distance
is x, and that the rate is

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.750
y/11 yards per second.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.970
So y/11 times t is equal to x.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.870
So if you want to find t, you
do x divided by y/11.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.130
Anyway, and you get 11x/y,
which is choice A.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.960
Question 32.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.375
John has 10 pairs of
matched socks.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.060
If he loses 7 individual socks,
what is the greatest

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.140
number of pairs of matched
socks he can have left?

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.500
So he loses 7.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.649
He loses 7 socks.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:20.519
So think about it.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.590
If you wanted to optimize the
number of matched pairs,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.280
what's the worst
case scenario?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.510
The worst case scenario is if
every one of these socks came

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.360
out of a different pair.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.660
Because then he'd be left with 7
socks that had their brother

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.990
socks, or whatever you want
to call it, their

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.510
twin socks are gone.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.620
So that's the worst case.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.420
But we want to think of what
the best case-- what's the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.480
best case if you want to
preserve the number of pairs

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.680
you have left?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.580
If you want to preserve the
number of pairs you have left,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.590
the 7 should have as many
pairs as possible in it.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:01.160
So if 7 could be made of 3
pairs and 1 lone socks.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.970
This is kind of the best case
scenario if he wants to have

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.890
the greatest number of
matched socks left.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.020
So 7 could be 3 pairs and 1 lone
socks, in which case he'd

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.440
be left with what?

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.000
So these 3 pairs
would be gone.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.340
Remember, he has 10 pairs.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.330
Let's keep in mind, those
aren't 10 socks.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.910
He has 10 pairs.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.660
Let's say that he just
loses 3 pairs.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.030
Then he'll just have 7
pairs left, right?

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.410
But then if he loses 1 more
sock, then he's only going to

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.400
have 6 pairs left.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.530
He's going to have 6
pairs and one sock.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.080
So he's going to have 6 matched
pairs left, and

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.400
that's choice B.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.330
Question 33.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.560
The worst case, if the question
was the other way--

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.040
maybe I'm just overly
fascinated with this

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.170
question-- but if the question
was the other way, what's the

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.660
worst case if-- what's the
minimum number of pairs that

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.630
he has left?

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.340
You could say, well, each of
these socks exactly destroy 1

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.850
pair, so losing 7 socks
destroys 7 pairs.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.090
So at the worst case, if each of
these were a different sock

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.640
from a different pair, he
would have 3 pairs left.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.350
But anyway, that's not
what they ask, so I

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.090
shouldn't focus on it.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.990
23.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.300
What is the lowest positive
integer that is divisible by

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.280
each of the numbers 1 through
7, inclusive.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.620
1 through 7, including
1 and 7.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.580
So let's think of
a number that's

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.690
divisible by all of these.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.890
So it has to be divisible
by 7, right?

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.770
7's a prime number, so it has
to be divisible by 7.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.010
It has to be divisible by 6.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.910
And 7 and 6 share no common
factor, so the number is going

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.220
to be at least 7 times 6.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:48.600
It has to be divisible by 5,
because 5 is a prime number,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.230
and because that doesn't
share any factor with

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.300
any of these numbers.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.300
It has to be divisible
by 4, right?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.760
Think about it.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.360
6 is 2 times 3.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.890
So to make it divisible by 4,
you only have to multiply it

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.000
by another 2.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.630
So it has 2 times 2 in its
prime factorization.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.420
Maybe that's how I should
be writing it.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.585
It has to be divisible by 7.

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:12.870
It has to be divisible by 6,
which is the same way as

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.450
saying it has to be divisible
by 2 times 3.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.930
It has to be divisible by 5.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.906
It has to be divisible by 4.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:23.610
But we already have one
of 4's factors here?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.640
It's 2, so we just have to
multiply it by another 2.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.586
So this is to say it's
divisible by 4.

00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:30.440
It has to be divisible by 3.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.660
Well, it's already
divisible by 3.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.810
It has to be divisible by 2.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.470
It's already divisible by
2, actually, twice.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.100
It has to be divisible by 1, and
that's already the case.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.950
So this is the number.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.710
And notice, I was very
careful not to

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.070
have extra prime factors.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.290
If I just did 7 times 6, times
5, times 4, times 3, times 2,

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.100
times 1, I would have gotten a
number that is divisible by

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.700
all of them, but it wouldn't
have been the smallest one.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.130
So anyway, what is
this number?

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.750
Let's do the small numbers
first. Well, I'll do the big

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.510
number first. 7 times 5 is 35.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.600
2 times 3 is 6, times 2 is 12.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.540
So 35 times 12.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.580
35 times 2 is 70-- 0,
1 times 35-- is 350.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.360
And then I have 0.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.460
7 plus 5 is 12.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.900
420.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.010
That is choice A.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.580
And you can feel good about
it, because it's also the

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.350
lowest number on their list.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.140
Next question.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.809
34.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:38.710
What percentage of 30 is 12?

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.750
So 12 is equal to some
decimal times 30.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.420
And we could convert
that decimal,

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.940
eventually, to a percent.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.490
We just multiply it by 100.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:55.680
So x is equal to 30-- sorry,
is equal to 12/30, which is

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:04.970
the same thing as 4/10,
which equals 0.4.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.990
And if you wanted to write a
decimal as a percent, you just

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.930
multiply it by 100.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.040
That is equal to 40%.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.280
And that is choice D.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.500
And these can be confusing, so
it's very important to write

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.160
it that way.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.910
What percentage of 30 is 12?

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.380
So 12 is what percentage
of 30?

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.720
It's going to be a
smaller number.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.660
You can kind of think, 12
is what fraction of 30?

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.390
Or you could say 12/30 equals
what as a percentage?

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.870
It equals x percent.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.950
You could think of
it that way, too.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:32.860
It's all the same thing.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.440
The important thing is
to be able to parse

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.630
the language correctly.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.050
Anyway.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.720
35.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:53.430
If 1.5 over 0.2 plus x is equal
to 5, then x is equal

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.690
to-- let's just solve it.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.520
Multiply both sides of this
equation by 0.2 plus x.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.920
On the left-hand side,
it cancels out.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.230
We just have 1.5.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.950
On the right-hand side,
what's 5 times 0.2?

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:09.780
It's 1, right?

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.620
0.2 is the same thing
as 20% or 1/5.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.080
So it's 5 times 1/5.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.010
That's 1-- you can think of it
a bunch of ways-- plus 5x.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.490
Subtract 1 from both sides.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:24.810
You have 0.5-- 1.5 minus 1
is 0.5-- is equal to 5x.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.660
So x is equal to 0.5
divided by 5.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.170
Well, that's just
equal to 0.1.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.720
The answer is B.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.620
