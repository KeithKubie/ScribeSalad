00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.980
Hello, I’m Craig and this is Crash Course Government &amp; Politics and today we’re going to talk about social policy.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.600
I have a lot of social policies, which include
not staying out past 3AM on weeknights,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.780
and avoiding social gatherings where
velveeta sausage cheese dip is served.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.560
Both of these are pretty loosely enforced, though.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.890
Actually, we’re talking about government
social policy, which deals with things like

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.830
social security, education, and healthcare.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.550
And hopefully velveeta sausage cheese dip.
But… probably not.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.490
[Theme Music]

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.060
In talking about policy, it’s really hard
to separate social policy or foreign policy

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.490
from economic policy, primarily because they’re
all paid for with money. One way to distinguish

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.730
between them is to look at a policy’s goals.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.500
Social policy has a number of goals, none
of which is the outright promotion of social-ism.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.010
Glad that’s out of the way and no one is going to comment on it at all in the comments. Peace on Earth.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.910
In America, social policy consists of programs
that seek to do at least three things.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.110
Some social programs protect against risk and insecurity, like from job loss, health problems or disability.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.540
Other social programs seek to promote
equal opportunity.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.560
Finally, some social programs attempt to assist
the poor. Of these three goals, there’s

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.820
general agreement that promoting equal opportunity
is a good thing, less agreement on whether

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.940
the government should protect us from risk,
and widespread skepticism about helping the poor.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.140
Americans traditionally haven’t cared
much for social policy, and part of the reason

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.720
for this has to do with Americans’ strong faith in individualism that is suspicious of government action,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.560
and generally favors private charity and pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps self-reliance.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.920
I don’t think I’ve ever worn bootstraps,
Stan. Does that make me a true American?

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.890
As you might have guessed, the history of
the American government social policy pretty

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.970
much starts, as most government programs do,
with the New Deal.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.560
Prior to the 1930s there were some attempts
on the state level to protect workers and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.729
limit exploitation, but often these were struck
down by the courts, and the Federal government’s

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.610
role in protecting people from risk was minimal.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.210
The government did provide pensions to veterans’
widows, but except for a relatively brief

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.110
period after the Civil War, the numbers of
pension recipients were never very large.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.290
The Great Depression changed the way that
Americans came to view their government, and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.149
also modified how many of them felt about
poverty. The suffering caused by the Depression

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.769
was so great and so widespread that many
Americans came to feel that it was part of

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.509
the government’s job to do something about it.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.940
Private charities, which had been the primary
way that Americans had helped the poor before

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.730
the Depression, could not handle the numbers
of needy people. In addition, not all of these

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.200
people could be considered to have become
poor due to their own personal failings.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.620
The Great Depression helped solidify the idea
that people could sometimes be victims of

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.440
economic forces beyond their control, and
that it was the government’s duty to help them.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.620
Basically, the Great Depression changed
people’s question from “if the government

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.550
should help” to “how should the government
help?”

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.650
The answer to that question came in the form
of the New Deal. You’ve probably heard about

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.849
the New Deal; it’s a big deal. But we’ve
only got 12 minutes, so we’re going to focus

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.920
on two specific programs: Social Security and
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.960
And if you judge by public opinion polls -- and
who doesn’t -- then Social Security is one

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.690
of the most successful New Deal programs ever.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.580
Started in 1935, the Social Security Act was
a reaction to the fact that many elderly people

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.580
in the U.S. were poor, largely because they
had no work, little savings, and no pensions.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.500
Social Security provided monthly payments
to people over age 65, and while no one was

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.080
getting rich, it was enough money to prevent
people from falling into abject poverty.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.790
A couple of things about Social Security.
First, it’s not a savings program; you pay

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.930
into it when you are working but that money doesn’t go into an account for you to access when you retire.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.590
So how does it work? Well, when you are working
and on a payroll, taxes are deducted from

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.239
your wages and the amount is matched by your
employers. The total amount that gets taken

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:31.260
out is 7.65% with 6.2% going to Social Security
and the other 1.45% going to Medicare, which

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.440
provides health coverage for older people.
This money goes into a pot, which is then

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.320
paid out to people over the age of 65. In other words,
today’s workers are paying today’s older Americans.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.400
The benefits are indexed, which
means that they go up with inflation.

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.290
This program redistributes wealth from younger
working people to older retired people. Because

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.390
the more you make, the more you pay -- at
least up to a point because there’s a cap

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.700
on the amount of your salary that’s subject
to the payroll tax – Social Security also

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.209
redistributes wealth from richer people to
poorer ones.

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.010
In general, Americans are suspicious of programs
that redistribute wealth, but Social Security

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.950
is very popular with both liberals and conservatives.
Conservatives tend to like it because it is

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.530
funded by a regressive payroll tax that phases
out at higher incomes, rather than a more

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.810
progressive one that would hit high earners
harder. Liberals like it because it provides

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.569
automatic benefits for the elderly.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.360
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Whether Social Security
is in crisis depends a lot on what numbers

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.910
you look at and whether you believe that there
are political solutions to potential problems.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.650
The number of people receiving benefits is
rising – approximately 50 million Americans

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.430
receive Social Security and that number is
increasing as baby boomers get older – and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.420
the number of people paying into it is falling.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.640
Eventually, if these trends continue, there
will come a time when there might not be enough

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.919
money paid in to Social Security to pay out
benefits to those who qualify.

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.889
This shouldn’t be an issue since Social
Security spending is controlled by Congressional

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.169
legislation, and they can always raise the
payroll tax or raise the benefit age above 65.

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.160
Should be easy.
Uncontroversial.

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.180
Since older people tend to vote, there’s a strong incentive for Congress to fix any problems and

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.640
keep the benefits coming. Also, it would be a national embarrassment for Congress to let it go bankrupt.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.919
Medicare, which is also paid for by payroll
taxes, is probably in more trouble, partly

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.380
because of the same demographics that are
putting pressure on Social Security, but mainly

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.880
because of rising medical costs which Medicare
can only do so much to control.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.020
Medicare is a third party payer for its medical
benefits, it doesn’t actually provide doctors

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.580
or medicine or stuff that makes people healthy.
Since it does cover more than 45 million Americans,

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.240
Medicare has some leverage over costs, but, at least until recently, those costs have been rising rapdily.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.120
Social Security is generally popular, but I’ll tell you what was unpopular: Aid to Families with Dependent Children.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.700
In fact, it was so unpopular that we
don’t even have it anymore!

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.880
Like imagine this eagle as the AFDC
(punches eagle)... metaphor.

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.720
AFDC is what Americans tend to think of when
we talk about “welfare.” It was a system

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.840
that paid benefits to women with children
and the amount of the payments went up or

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.770
down depending on how many children you had.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.539
AFDC was what is called a non-contributory
program, which means what it sounds like:

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.810
you didn’t need to have contributed through
taxes to be eligible or to receive benefits.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.820
There are still some non-contributory social
welfare programs, most notably free school

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.840
lunches, federal housing assistance programs,
and supplemental nutrition assistance program,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.740
also known as SNAP or food stamps.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.630
Another is the successor to AFDC, Temporary
Aid to Needy Families, or T.A.N.F. or TANF.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.720
In the 1980’s, conservatives argued that
these AFDC checks created dependency or at

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.690
the very least an incentive to not work, and
increasing welfare payments were pointed to

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.759
as a criticism of liberalism in general.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.970
But conservatives weren’t able to reform
welfare in the 80’s, because even though

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.860
a majority of Americans didn’t like it, passing laws is difficult, especially when Congress is hostile to you.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.000
It took a Democratic president, Bill Clinton,
to push welfare reform through Congress, which

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.360
in 1996 passed the Personal Responsibility
and Opportunity Reconciliation Act,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.980
better known as the 1996 Welfare Reform Act.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.039
This law got rid of Aid to Families with Dependent
Children and replaced it with Temporary Aid

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.169
to Needy Families, which emphasized that any
aid to needy families was going to be TEMPORARY,

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.690
by putting that as the first word in its title.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.130
There are now work restriction that recipients
must meet in order to get benefits, and there

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.640
are time restrictions. You can only receive
benefits for two years in a row and five years total.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.220
All of this was supposed to encourage
people to get off welfare, and as the name

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.500
of the law tells us, exercise greater personal
responsibility.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.380
So did it work? It kind of worked. The number
of people receiving welfare did decrease and

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.250
more people did look for and find work.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.060
On the other hand, the law didn’t reduce
poverty, although to be fair that wasn’t

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.919
what it was supposed to do -- it was supposed
to reduce welfare.

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:13.610
Also, during economic downturns as in 2001
and 2009, welfare caseloads rose again, suggesting

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.160
that the work that people did find might not
be such a stable solution to relieving poverty.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.229
So this episode has focused mainly on the
more controversial aspects of social policy,

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:25.109
those that involve redistribution of wealth
from richer to poor Americans, and I’m sure

00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:26.980
all of you commenters are fine with that.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.760
Actually, probably not. For a lot of reasons,
some economic, but many cultural, Americans

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.819
have generally been suspicious of these redistributive
programs.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:38.239
Remember that I said one goal of social policy, one that is not very controversial, is increasing opportunity.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.420
And for most of us, the key to increasing opportunity is education. Which is what we’re doing right here!

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.120
Education is one social policy that almost
everyone agrees on, under the theory that

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.500
if everyone is educated they will be able
to find good, high paying jobs that will enable

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.180
them to achieve greater economic stability
and mitigate the risks in their own lives

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.020
without the government having to do it for
them.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.960
Whether it works or not, and just how much
the government should be involved, are questions

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.789
that you will have to think about and argue
over with your friends and families and teachers

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:07.729
and teacher’s teachers and teacher’s grandmas
and the guy at McDonalds…maybe the guy standing

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:10.550
next to you at the Velveeta sausage cheese
dip platter.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.440
But it’s important to remember that social
policy isn’t just redistribution of wealth

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.300
or income, it’s also education and programs
that help people who really can’t help themselves.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.080
