One category of validation rules are requirement requirements placed

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.260
by the value on one dimension on the values of another dimension. For example,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.780
if you've got event connectors that require delivery notification, then you

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.850
also need to be concerned with the cardinality rules, synchronization rules, and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.920
mode rules. Might be situations where it's not a strict rule, but

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.036
it's some kind of caution. Certain combinations may be unstable or unreliable.

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:29.970
That is they're dynamic, the dynamics of that particular situation may not work

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.570
in all circumstances having to do with concurrency and locality. There

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.740
may be restrictions. 'Kay, certain combinations may be invalid, for example,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.440
passing by name and transient can't be used together. And there might be

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.830
prohibitions. Total incompatibility of dimensions, such as streams and atomicity
