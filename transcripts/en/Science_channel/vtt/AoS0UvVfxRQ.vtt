00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:06.606
SO A STADIUM BEARS LOADS
JUST LIKE A REGULAR BUILDING,

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.241
BUT UNLIKE A REGULAR BUILDING,

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.544
YOU CAN'T HAVE A LOT OF BEAMS TO
SUPPORT THE ROOF IN THE MIDDLE,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.879
BECAUSE THAT WOULD
OBSTRUCT THE VIEW,

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.447
WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON
YOU GO TO A STADIUM.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.048
OTHER THAN THE HOT DOGS.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:19.385
YOU HAVE TO DESIGN SUCH THAT YOU
KNOW WHERE THE FORCES ARE GOING

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.753
AND HOW TO DIRECT THEM.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.722
THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX
STADIUM

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.457
ACTUALLY EMPLOYS BRUNEL TRUSSES.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.526 line:0%
THIS IS A KIND OF STRUCTURE

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.661 line:0%
THAT REALLY SUPPORTS
THE STADIUM'S ROOF

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.796
USING AN ARCH THAT'S FORMED
OF A LOT OF TRIANGLES

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.131
TO BEAR THE LOAD.

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.233
Narrator: LET'S EXAMINE
THE STRENGTH OF TRIANGLES.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.969
RECTANGLES,
WHEN SUBJECTED TO FORCE,

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.172
EASILY COLLAPSE INTO RHOMBUSES.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:41.741
BUT A TRIANGLE DISTRIBUTES FORCE
DOWN ITS SIDES

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.476
AND MAINTAINS ITS SHAPE.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.445
Man: SO TAKE THIS TRIANGLE

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.747
AND START TILTING IT
AND TRACE WHERE THE TIP IS,

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:49.749
AND WHAT SHAPE DOES IT MAKE?

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:50.950
AND ARCH.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.419
SO, THE STRONGEST POINT
OF AN ARCH

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:57.023
IS ALMOST EVERY POINT
ALONG ITS CURVE,

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.425
AND IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THAT,
JUST ADD MORE TRIANGLES.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:02.195
Narrator: YOUR TRUSSES WILL BE
MADE OF SOLID STEEL.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.731
EACH WILL MEASURE 700 FEET LONG,
87 FEET HIGH,

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.400
AND 17 FEET WIDE,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.136 line:0%
AND WEIGH 3.6 MILLION POUNDS.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.972
I CAN'T EVEN FATHOM THAT IS.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.473
EVERYTHING IS MEASURED,
TO ME, IN DONUTS,

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:15.675
SO THAT'S A LOT OF DONUTS.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:16.743
