00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.200
[dramatic music]

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:03.467
MORGAN FREEMAN (VOICEOVER):
I'm about to have

00:00:03.467 --> 00:00:05.166
an audience with a
living embodiment

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.800
of the Hindu god, Taleju.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.633
My hope is that their Kumari
remains expressionless.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:15.500
Even the hint of a smile is
said to bring misfortune.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.400
[mystical music]

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.500
MORGAN FREEMAN: She didn't--

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.834
she didn't smile.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:51.700
As a matter of fact, she didn't
have an expression at all.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.033
MAN: OK.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.333
So that's good for me, right?
MAN: That's a good thing.

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.132
That's a good thing.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.433
MORGAN FREEMAN: All right.

00:00:56.433 --> 00:01:00.166
And I also noticed that her
feet were up on a little--

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:00.900
a little platform.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.300
MAN: Pedestal, yes.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.800
So while she is the Kumari,
she should not touch the Earth.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.667
And so she will
be carried around.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.467
MORGAN FREEMAN: I see.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:09.700
OK.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.367
MAN: And so she gets carried
around in a palanquin--

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:12.467
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:14.233
MAN: --even when she
has to go to festivals

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.533
and to attend to other
rituals in the city.

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.133
MORGAN FREEMAN (VOICEOVER):
This royal treatment

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:22.265
isn't required merely out
of respect for the divine.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:26.166
It avoids her receiving
cuts to her feet.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:30.734
If she bleeds, she
ceases to be a goddess.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:34.967
Of course, that day can
only be put off so long.

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:37.000
With the onset of
puberty, this young girl

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.734
must return to a way of life
that may now be alien to her.

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:46.633
It seemed like this would be
kind of a rough deal for a kid.

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:48.734
It is a rough deal for a kid.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:50.866
But I think in this part
of the world, you know,

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:53.100
we are constantly
reminded about our duty.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.100
Yes.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.633
MAN: And so in the
years to come then

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.000
people take great
pride in the fact

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.900
that she was able to
serve our community

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.333
by taking on this duty.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.899
MORGAN FREEMAN: And
after she's no longer a--

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.700
MAN: Right.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.400
--goddess, what is she?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.000
You know, once
she reaches puberty,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.567
then the community begins to
search for a second child who

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:12.667
will replace her.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:14.533
She enters the regular
family and I think--

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:15.533
She becomes just a regular--

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.500
A regular girl.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.500
Got it.
