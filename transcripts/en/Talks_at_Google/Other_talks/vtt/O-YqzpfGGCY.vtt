CHRISANN BRENNAN:
I just wrote this.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.190
It wasn't a part of my talk.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.560
And I want to say that
I know a lot of people

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.885
have profound feelings
about Steve Jobs.

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:16.440
He was a gem and a rare one.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.510
And I want to ask
you to please only

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.240
take what's of value of my
talk today and let the rest go.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.410
This is such a new world to me.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.095
So many people have
so many thoughts.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.650
There's so many angles
of perception on him.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.860
But today, I'm simply
talking about my perceptions.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.167
And I hope you'll feel it's a
valuable contribution in total.

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:48.750
I also want to say
that I don't really

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.350
know the technical world
that you guys live in.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.670
I don't know what he created.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.480
So this is a new
experience for me.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.660
And please forgive me for my
naivete at certain points.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.260
So I'll begin.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.020
Today, I wanted to talk about
creativity and initiative,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.410
first mine in writing my book
and then Steve's in creativity

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.060
as I perceived it.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.430
And thirdly, about
Creativity, with a capital C,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.160
into the future.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.170
Because whether we're talking
about children, new technology,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.440
the arts, companies,
countries, or the whole world,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.980
now more than ever we need to be
more conscious in our creating.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.910
We're all so
creative that I think

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.540
we need a metalevel of
considerations, councils

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.945
even, to figure out
where we're going

00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:55.040
and what we want
our outcomes to be.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.665
Here I am at Google, and you
have the unofficial byline

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:01.730
of "don't be evil."

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.800
And this is what I'm talking
about, except more of it,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.026
a long list of
ethical considerations

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:11.430
that people can cross-check
because everything

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.770
is affected by our creating.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.820
Before I start
diving into my story,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.660
I want you to know that I'm
predominantly right brained.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.390
I wrote this book
cinemagraphically

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.400
because I'm first and
foremost an artist.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.850
And the practices of filming
help me bridge my experience

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.190
as a painter into writing.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.490
I think in a combination of
images, symbols, metaphors,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.680
and words.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.680
In fact, I don't
even think there's

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.980
a big difference between
symbols, images, metaphors,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.930
and words because they're
as much an energetic fact

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.500
as this podium is for me.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.150
Mainly, I think in
terms of energetics.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.292
And I see energy and I
have found visualization

00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:05.625
to be a force for actualisation.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.470
This is one of my
most recent paintings.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.630
It was commissioned.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.390
And yet when I paint for someone
else, I also paint for myself.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.650
The painting lay the
ground for my book.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.400
This was my version
of an outline.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.880
I didn't know what
it fully meant

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.760
until I was well
into the writing.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.350
In fact, I'm still
discovering what it means.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.580
I think the future is about
left and right brain integration

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.650
too.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.040
Its the evolutionary next
step for people everywhere.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.020
And it's, of course,
already started.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.930
If I have time, which
I don't think I will,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.870
I'll do a quick
decode on the painting

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.290
at the end of the talk.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.630
And if I don't, I'll post
the image and a decode

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.630
on my book's website,
thebiteintheapple.com,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.590
by the end of February.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.960
So there were
three things that I

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.959
decided I would never
do in this life.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.870
I had enough self-knowledge
by the time I was 35 years old

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.930
to know what I wasn't
interested or good at.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.170
One was study of history.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.990
I'd gotten crippling
migraines, at least

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.810
once a week, in my US history
classes when I was young.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.280
I wasn't interested in so much
focus on men's wars, politics,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.920
and treaties.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.550
Number two is that I
would never play the drums

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.380
because my sense of rhythm
was so reliably wonky.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.540
Number three is that
I'd never write a book,

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.860
since writing was
not my strength

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.450
and because I knew it was
way too much information

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.550
to organize and
be accountable to.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.960
Yet here I've written a
book, and it's own history,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.250
and it was in part due to
the rhythms in the language

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.700
that I became interested
in the craft of writing

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.990
for its own sake.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.420
I'd written a couple of
good papers in art college.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.260
But prior to writing
this book, that

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.470
was my only experience of
real concentrated writing.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.160
Writing is traumatic
and stressful for me.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.920
I love the ideas, but
they seem to bottleneck

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.920
if I have to sequence
them on a page.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.770
Yet I decided I had to
write this book myself

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.380
because the process
of writing was

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.960
the only way I could drop
down into a depth of memory

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.920
and manage my own message.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.290
I started in 2006.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.250
And it took me over six years
of full-time work to complete.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.830
Now I tell myself pay attention
to what I would never do,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.150
because writing
this book has been

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.530
one of the most important
things I've ever done.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.800
I also want to emphasize that
if I can write this book,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.120
I'm really sure almost
anybody can do anything.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.340
Over the years, a few people
had suggested I write my story.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.510
Yet many more
warned me off of it,

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.020
even going so far to suggest
that I didn't have the right

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.290
to speak about my
life or my history

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.990
since it involved Steve Jobs.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.705
And I think many people
were assuming the worst

00:06:30.705 --> 00:06:34.230
and implying that it
was bad form for a woman

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.150
to speak about the
personal life of a man who

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.940
was a public figure.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.130
But I did not write
this as a tell-all.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.360
Instead, I felt my story was
important, one, because I knew

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.470
Steve before it all happened
and also because we came

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.200
of age together
in a certain way.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.230
Two, because I witnessed
firsthand Steve's changes

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.410
as Apple began.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.960
And three, because we
co-parented the child

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.560
through all the years.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.520
Also four, I have
a universal message

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.140
and there's a universal
message in my book.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.260
Steve and I met when we were 17.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.460
And I was his first
love and I'm the mother

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.330
of his first child
and my only child.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.280
We knew, loved, and
admired each other.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.670
And when things got difficult
between us as Apple took off,

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.350
I witnessed his
incremental changes

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.870
from sweet, mystic, poet,
super-bright, goofy guy

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.800
into a ruthless, stunningly
successful business tycoon.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.830
In the end, it is precisely
because of my direct experience

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.120
with him that I feel I have
important contributions

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.060
to make on the body
of knowledge with him.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:57.990
And the other thing is I
never intended to pull him

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.180
from hero status.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.710
I know so many people love him.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.460
And it would've been
a balanced approach.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.080
I was always more interested
in the human side of him.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.300
Did I understand everything
that happened with Steve Jobs?

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.100
Absolutely not.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.910
But I still think I
have an unusual vantage

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.120
point of some
things that I think

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.560
are unique and will be valued,
may be valued, will be valued.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.260
So much seems to hang on
my memory, my integrity,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.080
and my insight.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.919
In 2006, I became sick
and it lasted for years.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.480
I had one of those
undiagnosable illnesses

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.790
that probably came from a
combination of exhaustion,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.040
mold in the apartment
I was living in,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.950
and too much exposure
to fumes from painting.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.220
With a compromised
immune system,

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.300
I got one terrible
illness after another

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.190
and had to spend a lot
of time doing nothing.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.160
Bored and languishing,
I slowed way, way down

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.520
and became willing
to consider and then

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.630
to decide to write my story.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.410
So with nothing else
to occupy my time

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.270
and in the most
tremulous, naive,

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.520
childish first
steps that I began

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.090
by writing a list of
chapters and some good ideas

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.690
in a cafe in
Tiburon, California.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.565
To say I was reluctant
to be public about Steve

00:09:29.565 --> 00:09:33.810
and my long history
is an understatement.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.250
It's nuanced and
a difficult story.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.720
And it was hard to sort through.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.400
Also I didn't want
to relive the pain.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.470
Of course, Steve didn't
want me to write it

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.430
and this was hard on me too,
mainly because it put pressure

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.280
on our daughter, who was going
back and forth between our two

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.800
households.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.910
Additionally, for years I
absolutely questioned daily

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.150
if I had what it took
to write this book.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.610
And I put it down
a couple of times,

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.360
only to return to it with
just greater commitment.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.990
One because the
ideas were so rich,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.950
that they just seem too
important, and also too

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.830
interesting to drop.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.770
And two, because there
was this exquisite sense

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.610
of the pause in the writing
process that I loved.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.910
The mounting silence of the
years coming up to the tipping

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:30.110
point and then their
remarkable fall into words.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.670
I worked on the first
100 pages for two years,

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.180
trying to figure out how
to weave all the complexity

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.840
into something readable.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.610
I worked seven days a week,
about two to three hours a day,

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.730
which took pretty much
all the energy I had.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.480
When I started to get
physically better,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.310
I committed to five hours
a day, seven days a week.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.970
A huge turning point
came for me three years

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.290
into the project when a
colleague took my first 70

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:59.120
pages and turned them into
discrete, coherent chapters.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.230
Once I understood how
to make a chapter,

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.000
I completed the next 19 chapters
in the second three years.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.070
My daily experience
was that I would

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.280
wake up early every morning
and begin with the inspiration,

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.250
working out all kinds of ideas.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.590
And yet no matter what,
by the end of every day

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.720
I was purely mortified
by what I had written.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.840
This is a strange
and strained history.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.510
The subject was
over the top and I

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.870
was deeply concerned
about how it

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.570
would affect our
daughter's life.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.720
Also I felt that
my story is, was

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.850
a part of the
collective unconscious

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.810
and I feared no one
wanted to hear from me.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.260
Add to this the fact that
I didn't know the writing

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.580
conventions for start talking
about such a dicey subject,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.050
the personal and impersonal.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.360
I don't read that much.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.770
I had little experience
in communicating

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.960
about such difficulty
in a balanced,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.800
truthful, and intelligent way.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.600
Five years into my project,
I was still fretting

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.480
and I told a friend I needed
a Ph.D. to write this book.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.170
And she said, well, Steve didn't
have a Ph.D. to do what he did.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.140
So get over it.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.760
Keep going.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.220
People have assumed
I kept a journal

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.770
because the detail in the book
is so clear and descriptive.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.360
But I didn't have a journal.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.280
I'm just extremely
observant and I

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.030
seem to track detail
through all my senses.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.750
Plus, this history
had somehow stayed

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.900
in something like a
morphic field around me

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.290
through the years
because I assume

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.550
it was waiting and pressing
on me to understand

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.980
what had happened.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.600
As I said, the process of
writing was interesting to me.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.940
And there were times that
things that seemed insignificant

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.000
buzzed at me to
explore more deeply.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.810
And when I followed them,
they opened up my awareness

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.020
into new connections
and new revelations.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.710
Other times after getting
the best sentences down

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.930
I could, I had to double and
triple check for the truth.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.540
In going back and forth between
the descriptions and the truth,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.910
further detail would emerge.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:26.470
I found I also found that
using word combinations

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.305
of opposite meaning
helped me grasp

00:13:29.305 --> 00:13:32.730
in language the
startling extremes that

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.800
were the hallmarks of Steve's
personality and charisma

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.370
after Apple started.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.490
All in all, the craft
of writing itself

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.010
distracted me from
the pain, even

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.040
as I granulated down into it.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.220
I have a type of dyslexia,
some kind of dyslexia.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.920
And being that
that was the case,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.150
I really could not
have written this book

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.560
with a pencil or
even a typewriter.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.450
I don't think sequentially.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.530
Much of the material
was so upsetting.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.950
And yet with a
computer, it was all

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.770
made easier, as I was
able to move clusters

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:16.150
of ideas around it big swaths
to work out right connection

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:22.410
points, that opened up
more insight and balance.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.770
The plasticity that the writing
with the computer provided me

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.580
was like painting and
it allowed for layering.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.710
And so it made it
possible for me

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.190
to handle the many
years, while still

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.800
having fun exploring
the intricacies of ideas

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.620
I was trying to access,
layer, and get across.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.590
Then after a while,
something unexpected

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.060
started happening, which
never would have occurred

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.030
if I had been so focused
on getting it right--

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.320
if I hadn't been so focused.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.660
As I relived the scenes
in order to write them,

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.540
I became more of a
witness to it all

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.910
and started picking up
new levels of detail

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.310
that I had missed
when I had been

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.610
so young, living through it.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.460
Plus the more attention
I brought to the history,

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.270
the more I saw and
the more I felt

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:19.330
that I was changing the
history inside myself.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.970
Consciousness
changes everything.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.160
For so long, I had met
Steve's ideas of things

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.200
define my reality.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:36.530
And he had become defensive,
and fast, and intelligent,

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.830
and somewhat disconnected
from his heart

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.830
as he grew into Apple.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:46.640
Out of this, he sometimes
projected the worst stuff

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.000
on me, faster than I
could process through it.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.700
Yet as I slowed down and
focused on my experience,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:01.280
I realize that things were not
as he had so deftly chalked

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.500
them up to be.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.470
In a certain way, I had been
buried by Steve, the Zen

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.390
master, and the Apple-- or
the machine behind Apple.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.730
But when I stepped
back into the history

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:19.265
to quietly tell myself my
story as I experienced it,

00:16:19.265 --> 00:16:23.350
the "her" story of it all,
it was like waking up.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.460
Spin is a powerful thing.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.670
Interpretation is
a powerful thing.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:34.540
But the truth is more powerful
within your own context.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.020
A single voice does
make a difference.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.850
We don't necessarily
hear ourselves

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.860
when others won't hear us.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.520
But in writing, I
finally heard myself.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.530
I also discovered
that forgiveness

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:52.470
is a process and a very
long haul, but a worthy one.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.980
A line from an
ancient Hindu text

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.430
had replayed in
my mind for years.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.870
It was a basic principle
of creativity, karmic law,

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.690
and life.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:07.720
And it said, one must rise
by that by which one falls.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.140
And here I found that by
doing the work of writing,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:16.310
I was able to climb up and
out of my tremendous self-loss

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.339
into a lighter, truer being.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.784
Throughout the writing,
as a discipline,

00:17:25.784 --> 00:17:29.490
I cross-checked some of the
more complicated memories

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.820
with people who were also
there at certain points

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.710
in the history and
I got confirmations.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:41.180
They had understood things as I
had, which was a great relief.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.520
This, in addition to 10
years of visionary painting,

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.770
the six years of writing, and
I not only recovered my story,

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.600
I used the whole experience
to understand the history

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.910
through a wisdom and
compassion trajectory.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.380
So that in essence,
the book provided me

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.540
the rare opportunity
to review my life

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.930
and take time to work
it out and update

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.180
it an ethical framework
for my 50-year-old self.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:16.120
In the second 2/3
of the book, as I

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.420
lived how bad things
had been, I found

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.660
that I was traversing
what was for me how

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.770
realms of such destitute
feelings, that the only way

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.670
I remember true loveliness
was the little birds

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.500
singing outside my
windows in the morning.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.970
The work was really
dramatic and extreme.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.200
But on the other hand, the
terribleness had an upside.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.620
It enlivened my sense
of determination.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.450
Diving into the
dark and surfacing

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.770
is the artistic process.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.830
And I'm no stranger to that.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:51.570
I just had never done it
in words before and never

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.900
on the same subject for so long.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.940
Long story short,
I dug my heels in

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.910
and decided I was going
to get my book written

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.650
or die doing it.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.230
It was a messy process getting
into the do or die part,

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.480
but eventually I realized
that what I was really saying

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.310
was the opposite.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.768
I was going to get
the book written

00:19:13.768 --> 00:19:16.240
and live more fully
as a result of it.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.360
Some people mistakenly think
I'm obsessed and fascinated

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.940
by Steve Jobs.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.960
But this is not accurate.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.950
I was obsessed by
getting at the truth

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.530
and fascinated by
my revelations.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.960
It felt wonderful to speak, and
be funny, and open my heart,

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.000
and tell the truth.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.980
It felt to me like I was
driving a little car over hill

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.180
and dale, looking
out the windows

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.410
and reflecting on the views.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.250
I wanted to know why he
had been so cruel after we

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.930
had been so deeply in love.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.930
I just kept staying
with the question

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.270
until I got the bigger answers.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.260
I also wanted to put it
in its place and move on.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.680
I did become more
interested and appreciative

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.480
of Steve's history,
but it was only

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.020
after I had renewed my
perceptions of myself.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.060
As I mentioned before, I'd
been concerned all along

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.540
that my writing book this
would be hard on our daughter.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.680
And the way that worked
is that the more I wrote,

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.530
the more I felt it was going
to be a bigger problem for her

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:31.070
and the world if the world
didn't have her mother's story

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.290
and if I didn't become strong
and clear enough to tell it.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.220
I think that what
failed in Steve Jobs is

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.780
as important as what succeeded.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.400
Both aspects should
be studied, partly

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.150
because he's so remarkable.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.140
Well, because he's
so remarkable.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:57.000
Also I know that a woman's
inner story may seem far less

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:05.420
exciting as a man's
worldly story.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:11.760
In fact, for women it may be
that the inner story of a woman

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.540
is more interesting than
a man's worldly story.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:18.960
But beyond all this, I want
my great-great-grandchildren,

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.350
should I be lucky
enough to have them,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.950
know what a bit of their
grandmother's life and times,

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.350
as well as your grandfather's.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.890
I think it will be
healthy and happy for them

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.950
because against all this dull
expectations, I feel Steve

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.960
and I were equals.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.440
He simply had more power because
the laws favor men and money

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.702
over women and
children at this time.

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:43.785
I hope you don't mind me
being a little political.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:54.900
The other thing that
truly inspired me to write

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.230
is that in many ways my story
is an all too familiar one.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.000
Many women have had their own
experience with brilliant men.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.650
And truthfully,
it's not just women

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.450
who are suffering
from the situation.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.980
Obviously, it's a destructive
context for all of us.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.120
The world is dealing with a huge
power imbalance, Wall Street,

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:22.190
corporate heads,
news corporations,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.630
that sort of confuse
and drain people

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.250
in their personal
power, at least

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.700
that's the apparent reality.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:36.310
So then I'd like to see
a genius bar working

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.450
to fix the brokenness
at this level.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:44.030
Maybe we could call
it the ethics bar.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.910
Eventually, I
started to figure out

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.020
that I could access the
highest integrity inside myself

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.400
by steering my writing
between truth and kindness.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.730
If I could not say what
had to be said is kindness,

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.480
then I kept working to
understand more deeply.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.720
If I could not tell the truth
because it was too terrible,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.400
then I kept looking
for ways to say things

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.650
with more breath and allowance.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.910
The extremes of negative
and positive relationship

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:18.850
in the adult Steve Jobs
and Chrisann Brennan

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.890
were and still are too
problematic to be public about.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.810
And sometimes I was
thinking all the way

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.620
through the book about
Jung's "Red Book,"

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.530
the one he locked
up for 70 years

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.610
because he didn't
think people were

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.840
ready to take in the contents.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.290
And I completely understand
his impulse to hold back.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:42.160
Steve expanded the
spectrum in ways

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.450
that went beyond the
range of humanness.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.380
And I mean that in both the
good and the difficult way.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.890
And I finally figured out
I could approach the story

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.910
if I stayed in the middle.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.260
Then I could
express enough truth

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.430
and that likely some
readers were even

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.710
going to be able to sense
the shapes of the things

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.920
I couldn't say.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.640
Another exercise I
put myself through

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.470
was to pose the question,
if everything is love,

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.630
if this whole universe
is love, which

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.605
is what the mystics
support, and I

00:24:23.605 --> 00:24:28.500
am willing to believe,
how do I understand love

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.590
in the context of what
happened between Steve and me?

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.540
Love is law and law
is based on love.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.120
What happened was lawless.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.060
Yet, I didn't want to make Steve
look like a spot monster that

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.260
was too big for me to handle.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.280
And I didn't want to make
myself into a tiny speck

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.470
of a victim that
couldn't deal with it.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.840
That would have
been way too easy.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.650
I wanted to transcend
the polarization

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.490
and the lawlessness.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.850
I wanted to find my power
in the center of it all.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:08.364
I wanted a kind of
equanimity, a true equanimity.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.890
I think that Steve was
a remarkable empath, who

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.870
became a colossal bully.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.850
I'm sorry for those
of you who love him.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.800
I think he was a liar, a
bully, a trickster, a thief.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.180
And I think he was a sociopath.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:35.060
Yet, he was also an honest,
remarkable, mystic, creator,

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.320
genius, visionary, who
wanted to see people freed up

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.840
through the tools he made.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.420
What a cluster.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.920
Another creative principle I
found in another Hindu text

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.050
says, divided into
two parts I create.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.850
At first, I felt
blimied and even

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:01.850
lazy to parse through the polar
opposites, his polar opposites.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.770
But then I became
very interested

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.250
in understanding the differences
between Steve's light and dark

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:13.060
sides because why else
should I write this book?

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.130
The independent
spirit in me always

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.320
got around to the
same conclusion.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.090
I choose to be bigger than the
cruelty and the indifference.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.910
I am going to tell
the truth and I'm

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.850
going to trust that I
have the tools to do it

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.570
without doing harm.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:32.620
Moreover, I may end
up having to trust

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.640
the pieces to fly
and fall as they may.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.840
But I'm willing to
wager that in the end,

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.680
the truth, told well
enough is a good thing.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.230
I call my book "The
Bite in the Apple"

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.850
and not "out of the
Apple" because I

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:52.750
wanted to recover wholeness of
all that had been shattered.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:58.370
There are two trees at the
beginning of the Bible.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.790
One is the tree of
knowledge of good and evil

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.160
and the other is
the tree of life.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.650
I wanted to put the
bite back in the apple

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.290
and become the tree of life.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.630
No more talking snakes,
no more blaming woman

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.460
for the fall of man.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.330
Writing this book was
my choice to return

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.090
to my original
spirit of wholeness

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.630
by way of my own work,
which was mine alone to do.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.570
So now-- what time is it?

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.746
OK.

00:27:30.746 --> 00:27:32.380
OK.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.070
So now I want to talk
about Steve's creativity.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.260
You all know more than I do,
as I said in the beginning,

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.740
about Steve Jobs'
accomplishments.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.960
But I have probably
thought more about

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.120
how his early years
shaped his creativity.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.107
I knew Steve was a genius
when I first met him.

00:27:51.107 --> 00:27:52.690
Though if you ask
our daughter, she'll

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:56.470
complain that I think
everyone is a genius.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.490
I hear her referring
to her mother's myths

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.890
and I think she worries
I've fed her pretty lies.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.140
She is like Steve.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.540
She likes to get
the facts straight.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.040
But I absolutely know
what I'm talking about.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.050
I do believe everyone
has genius in them.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.540
One difference between
Steve and most other people

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.190
is that he figured out what
the work of his unique genius

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.872
was and he didn't allow himself
to be distracted from it.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.760
He never gave up
and he never forgot

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.730
that there was
infinite potential

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.560
in a finite amount of time.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.780
At the same time, I do feel
he lost some sweetness--

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.305
the sweetness of life in the
pursuit of all he accomplished.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.080
The time in which
Steve and I came of age

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.200
was marked by disillusionment
with our parents' value system.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.460
The '50s were filled with
the Cold War mentality,

00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:00.860
superficial materialism as
the answer to a fulfilled life

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.710
and also the inauthenticity of
male and female role playing.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.070
And we found ourselves rebels.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.500
We were turning into rebels.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.450
But we weren't rebels
without a cause.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.730
In fact, we felt that we should
break the rules because they

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.000
were inadequate to
the sense that there

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.550
was something bigger to be had.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:23.670
In 1983, I talked a writer
from "Time Magazine,"

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.650
who told me that when he
interviewed Steve Wozniak's

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.260
and Steve Jobs'
teachers in high school

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.190
after Apple had
started to succeed,

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.610
he said that they all
reported those years were

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.430
a rare time at the school
in every area of study

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.930
because kids were so
uncommonly creative and full

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.150
of self-authority.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.080
That was that time.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.880
Later, I spoke with
an attorney who

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.740
went to a Catholic
school in Santa Clara

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.300
at the same time Steve
and I were at Homestead.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.720
And he told me that his
school was similarly

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.450
struck by some kind of fierce
originality, that came and went

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.830
within a period of something
like seven to 10 years.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:12.140
Now I think what a
crazy alchemy, LSD,

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:16.510
Eastern mysticism, the
burgeoning technology of IBM,

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:22.730
the brute power of Lockheed,
all coming up at the same time,

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.540
creating new combinations
for re-envisioning design,

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.780
the value of aesthetics
in technology,

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:34.476
planetary interconnectedness,
and flower power.

00:30:34.476 --> 00:30:37.945
I'm going to put this up.

00:30:37.945 --> 00:30:40.960
This is another painting I did.

00:30:45.014 --> 00:30:46.680
Now I'm going to tell
you a story that's

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.970
a part of Steve's past.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.760
At first, it may
not seem to connect

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.080
to the theme of this
talk, creativity.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.360
But you'll see why I
think it does shortly.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.670
But first, take a
trip back to 1972.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.920
The third time I met
Steve's mother Clara Jobs,

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.110
I was standing alone in the
living room waiting for Steve.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.720
She came in and in an
urgent way began telling me

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.090
that they had adopted Steve, but
that the birth mother had taken

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.010
them to court because
she didn't want

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.300
her son raised by the Jobs.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.090
In 1955, Joanne Schieble,
pregnant with Steve--

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.260
I actually don't know how
to pronounce her name.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:29.630
My apologies-- had chosen a
family that was well educated,

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.920
wealthy, and Catholic,
for her baby.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.680
But that couple decided
that they wanted a girl.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.550
So the adoption
agency gave Steve

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:44.350
to Clara and Paul Jobs, who
had none of those qualities.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.800
Clara told me that they
had to fight to keep him.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.340
And then confessed
that she had been

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:54.260
terrified to love Steve for the
first six months of his life

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.400
for fear that they were going
to take him away from her.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.010
At that, she just stared at me.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:06.970
And I saw in her face a
deep, matter-of-fact guilt.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.290
And then she told me
that even after they

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.410
had won the case, when
he was two years old

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.710
he was so difficult
a child to parent

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.130
that she wanted to give
him back to the agency.

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.040
And I think she may
have been trying

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.960
to indicate a root
cause to his cold side.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.030
But that day I was
totally clueless

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.260
and would be for some
time because Steve

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.940
was very good to me.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:35.720
Instead, I wondered why on
Earth my new boyfriend's mother

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.970
was telling me so much
personal information.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.910
I was concerned about
her and wondered

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.770
in a simple
17-year-old way if they

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.870
did come to love
and cherish him.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.830
Not long after that
conversation with his mother,

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.480
Steve started warning me too.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:59.190
He told me on a number occasions
and in a number of ways,

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.830
he knew he was going to lose his
humanity in the business world

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.302
when he grew up.

00:33:04.302 --> 00:33:07.710
I didn't know what
to think, starting

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:12.590
with was this something that
men knew and worried about?

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.950
I also wondered, how did he
know his future because I

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:20.120
had no sense for mine.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.090
Back then, we were
just young lovers.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.280
We moved in together
the summer before he

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.000
went to college,
an idyllic setting,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.230
where we fell more in love.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.370
Then he left for
Reed College and I

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:39.770
returned for my final
year of high school.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.390
Late that fall, Steve
called and told me

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.460
he'd dropped out
of Reed, but was

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:49.190
staying in Oregon
to audit classes.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.300
It's important to know here that
the crucial aspect in resolving

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.940
the court case with
Steve's birth mother

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:02.100
was that Paul and Clara
agreed to send him to college.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:07.800
In fact, it was the most crucial
factor, maybe even the only,

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.659
in getting his biological mother
to leave him in their home.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.670
But Steve was deeply
conflicted because he

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.699
was well aware of Paul's
anger and discomfort

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:22.489
about spending so much
money on his education.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:26.400
Higher education wasn't a
part of the Jobs' experience

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.620
or value system.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.659
Nor, apparently, was it to
keep their legal obligations

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:37.370
to the court and to the
birth mother of their son.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:42.340
At 17, Paul and Clara
let Steve decide.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.800
And he took things
into its own hands

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.900
and started auditing
courses that interested him.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.370
I think it's instructive
to look at what

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.290
happened when Steve
dropped out of school.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:58.410
Here we have a brilliant
prince of a genius integrating

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:02.280
the values of his
working class parents,

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.710
a guy who by any
standard should've

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.230
been given higher education.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.500
But instead rerouted himself for
a different kind of emergence

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.480
into adulthood, so
as not too impinge

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.460
or be a burden on these people
whose feelings he cared about.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.240
So there's three things I'm
getting from this-- that I've

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.800
thought about with this.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.570
One, it seems to me that
the breach in the contract

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:37.945
was the beginning of a spiraling
out of right order in the sense

00:35:37.945 --> 00:35:41.120
that it modeled the dropping
of right regard for Steve's

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.300
mother and the contract.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.750
One might think it doesn't
matter because it was so long

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.790
ago and they had
put so much time in.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.660
But dishonoring the mother and
the agreement in a court of law

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.870
set a pattern, or
it revealed one.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:03.240
Two, if Paul and Clara had
been paying for the classes,

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.620
they would have
likely interfered,

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.985
or Steve would have
interfered with himself,

00:36:08.985 --> 00:36:13.740
of Steve's being so playful
about his choices, dance,

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.150
calligraphy, and Shakespeare.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:20.920
Reed College was after all
known for its math and sciences,

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.690
which is why it was
a good fit for Steve.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.110
So the arts classes
would have seemed

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:32.090
anomalous to his obvious
intellectual talents.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:33.940
Strike that.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.530
I think-- anyway, strike that.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.360
Three, after dropping
out of school,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.690
Steve stumbled around
for a while and suffered.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:45.990
Though he remained
sweet and positive

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:49.300
in his nature during
that searching time,

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.690
hitchhiking between the
Bay Area and Portland,

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:55.170
he was like a bird on the wire.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.200
And there was a
deep rootlessness,

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.830
one might say
homelessness in him,

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.250
as he tried to
figure out what he

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.220
was going to do with his life.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.290
I want you to know how
hard that was for him.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:08.290
I was there.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:08.900
I saw it.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.060
It was painful.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.320
He was deeply worried
about his life.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.050
Also I was
disenchanted with him.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.800
So I was not of much help.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.960
But I don't think there
was anything anybody

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.820
could do for him.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.360
He had to find his own way.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.420
And yet he was
finding his own way

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.880
by looking at all
possible failure.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.550
He knew there was something
that was supposed to happen.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.060
Because just as he
had told me that he

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.270
was going to lose his humanity
in the business world,

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:46.280
he also told me that there was
something big that he was going

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.220
to do that would make
him famous and wealthy.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.420
He didn't know what it was.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.440
And I feel that it
was at that time

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.740
when he didn't know
what he was going to do

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.660
and feared he might
have missed it,

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.180
that I saw him become
mean spirited and stare

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:15.380
future down-- good Freudian
slip-- stare failure down.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.180
And I feel this was the
beginning of his leadership

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.900
development.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.500
Calamity, or rather the
flip side of calamity,

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.990
offers insight into
the creative process.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:31.690
There is something about
how everything that gets

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.600
missed, gets tilled
under, and then

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.550
grows up into something greater.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:43.260
This is a truism I think we
can all feel confidence in.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.360
Like things don't get missed.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.820
They go back under and find
other ways to come back up.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.760
The irony, which is not the
best word for what happened,

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.890
is that even though he
did not go to school,

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.310
the personal computer
is the tool that

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:05.800
in the not so distant future
will enable a truly class world

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:11.701
education for every child
on Earth, affordably so.

00:39:11.701 --> 00:39:17.200
The lesson, never underestimate
the power for failure.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:22.682
It's a resource of immense
untapped potential,

00:39:22.682 --> 00:39:26.650
because everybody keeps
trying to do things right.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.860
The trauma of early
childhood, the abandonment

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.000
by both mothers in
the first six months,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.350
probably had the most profound
effect on Steve's creativity.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:40.390
In fact, I don't think there's
anything that ever happened

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.360
to him that he
didn't end up using.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.690
So how might Steve's adoption
and the resulting attachment

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:51.490
disorder have affected his
extremely sensitive creator

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.570
self to make him a natural
part of the development

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:58.270
of a technology that
will connect the world?

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.460
In musing over this,
I leaped to the idea

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.560
that because Steve
did not know what

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.070
real connection
with a mother was

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:09.920
at such an important
developmental stage,

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.070
that he became a
part of inventing

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:14.890
a new kind of connection.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.950
Trauma can cut people down.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.590
But it could also
wake people up.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.620
Some part of Steve
woke up when you

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.500
he separated from his birth
mother-- I mean I think so--

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.860
and after that, because his
adoptive mother didn't embrace

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.870
him for six months,
I think he was stuck,

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:39.390
mobilized, wired, and focused
to look for connection,

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:43.360
at the same time not understand
what he was looking for.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.140
This is my personal
experience with him as well.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:52.490
And when we consider how
technology is more and more

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.920
replacing face-to-face,
intimate contact,

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.470
I wonder if there isn't
something of his attachment

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.430
disorder built right into
the technology itself.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:11.960
Before this amazing
techie world we exist in,

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:17.400
I was around to see how Woz and
Steve related to each other.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.220
The two geniuses, three
years apart in age,

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.580
met regularly as friends
do and talked over

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.360
their most recent
ideas and discoveries.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.230
I didn't know what
they were talking about

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.250
and I didn't care.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.120
Instead, I loved
watching the acceleration

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.700
of their exchanges,
the bright, happy flow,

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.470
the shock of the new.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:40.440
They seemed to be very
animated, jump up and down,

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.160
talk over and around each
other, in Paul's garage

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.900
and other places too.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.590
It was like a duet
of a great affection.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:51.170
Sometimes they could barely get
their words out fast enough,

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.340
finishing each other's
sentences and laughing

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.420
to acknowledge all
that did not need

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.460
to be said, because
as Steve might say,

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.870
insanely great
minds think alike.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.100
Yet as true as that
was, sometimes it

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.290
went over the edge
for me because there

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.140
was something else going on.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:13.050
I'd forgotten about this other
thing until I started writing.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:17.100
Their speech patterns could
be so rapid fire, their tones

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.840
so shrill, that it
was as disturbing

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.470
as fingernails on a blackboard.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.370
And I'm not exaggerating.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.020
It was awful.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.810
When the memory
of this weirdness

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.360
came back to me when
I was writing my book,

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.080
it occurred to me that something
about how they were relating

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.660
may well have been the
beginning of what would later

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.020
be coined the "reality
distortion field" because it

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:48.300
felt like something being
torn out of coherence.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.890
As I say, it wasn't always
this way, but just at those

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.300
times when the sounds
were so unbearable

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.690
that I'd get myself
out of hearing range.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:00.510
Often I'd sit in the living
room at the Jobs's and wait

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.930
for it to be over.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:07.920
And I did not ask myself why
or what it was, but I do now.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.890
I think the technology has a
double edge of both connecting

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:15.090
and disconnecting people to
and from each other, Steve

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.640
and Steve, with a
double edged sword that

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.890
connected and disconnected
things at the same time.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.700
Do we know what they were doing?

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.980
Do they know what
they were doing?

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.530
I think we need to be
more conscious and intense

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:31.750
about asking what the technology
is doing to us, biologically,

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:35.345
emotionally, intellectually,
and spiritually, creating

00:43:35.345 --> 00:43:37.970
a serious, serious business.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:46.230
Many people who came of age
before the personal computer

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:50.790
can remember such an
extraordinary sense of beauty

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.560
and potential in the
air in the '60s and '70s

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.030
and wonder what happened
to all that promise.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.210
Anybody, like over 50,
might remember this.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:01.030
You can ask them.

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:02.365
They may have this memory.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.950
Did something truly
over the top remarkable

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:10.370
open up and then fail
in some important way

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.170
to fulfill itself?

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.130
I live in Monterrey
County right now.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.996
In the romantic history of
Cannery Row and Steinbeck,

00:44:19.996 --> 00:44:21.370
there came a time
when there were

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.230
no more sardines in the sea.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.690
The industry was fished
out and had closed down.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:30.380
And all the people who
make their livelihoods off

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.880
that industry were
greatly alarmed

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.710
and asked where did
the sardines go?

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.010
It was as if they were looking
into the wine-dark sea,

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:41.610
unable to see the
bleeding obvious.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:46.580
The answer came by way of
one Ed Ricketts, a scientist,

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:52.530
a philosopher, a early
ecologist, and a friend

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:56.630
of Steinbeck, Henry Miller,
and Joseph Campbell.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.090
He was a remarkable
guy by all accounts.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:02.640
And he simply said,
"they're in the cans."

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.890
I believe the
extraordinary vision

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.030
that so many felt
in the '60s and '70s

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:13.690
got absorbed into the computer
age, a kind of can if you will,

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:17.860
so much mental, an
intricate kind of can.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:22.600
And now I know I'm
singing to the choir.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.540
I perceive I'm
singing to the choir.

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:27.020
So I'll just continue.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.100
I believe that we
need new visions now.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.710
We upped the game
with the computer.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:34.650
But I think it's taken up too
much space in our imaginations,

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.550
to the point of flattening them.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.850
There's too much focus
on screens, on function,

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.580
and on transaction.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.032
I feel we need to swing back
to free up our imaginations

00:45:45.032 --> 00:45:48.940
for new kinds of questions,
more balanced, with greater

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.460
attention to
integrity and nature

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.670
and value of face-to-face
intimacy of our humanness.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.790
I think a lot of people
are haunted by Steve.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.080
His creativity was
so over the top

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.670
that I hear many
question with anguish,

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.090
what would Steve Jobs have done?

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:12.320
What would he have gone on to
create had he lived longer.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.750
And I want to say, I don't think
this is the right question.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:21.730
His death is really sad.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:25.730
And he boggled the
imagination of so many

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.810
around the whole world.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:34.020
And yet if we want to show
appreciation for all he did,

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.530
why not take the
best of his example

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:43.870
as inspiration to ask new kinds
of questions of one's self,

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.450
for new kinds of frontiers?

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.430
He was a unique contributor.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.845
And he got a remarkable
ball up into the air.

00:46:51.845 --> 00:46:57.550
Yet I think we need other
kinds of balls in air now too.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.370
A good question is a
very powerful thing.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:03.320
Once it's been asked,
the genius inside,

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.590
the person who asked it of
themself, or heard it asked,

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.510
will work day and
night, through their

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:14.050
conscious and
unconscious, to answer it.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:17.920
I mean if Jesus said of
his own remarkable life,

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.460
"this and more
shall you do," then

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:25.440
I think we have a directive to
be mindful and imaginative--

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.250
why are we imaginative about
the truth of everyone's

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.570
creative capacity,
not just potential,

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.820
but a person's
individual imperative.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:41.690
I think people are
haunted by Steve Jobs

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:45.285
not quite because of
what he accomplished.

00:47:45.285 --> 00:47:52.600
But because he tapped into a
level of creativity in himself

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.190
in such a significant
way that it suggests

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.810
this too is possible.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:47:59.960
This is where it's haunted.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:16.670
I believe his
creativity is at least

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:20.530
as great as the
computer, at least.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:23.110
Steve Jobs was enlightened.

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:28.170
He was what enlightenment looks
like in a business context.

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.500
And yet because he never
received the love of a mother

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:35.560
when he was so young,
he was an example

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.220
of harnessing an awakened
state without being emotionally

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.790
integrated.

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:43.490
This is quite a combination.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:47.000
And though he
didn't do so badly,

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.900
it does give us a clue
into why he did not

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:55.056
spearhead a new
level of ecological

00:48:55.056 --> 00:48:59.660
and compassionate best business
practices around the world

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.680
when he, of all
people, was so inspired

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.140
and in a position to do so.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:08.940
One of the pillars of
enlightenment is self love.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.480
And I think that bereft of
the real heart connection

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.390
with both mothers
when it mattered,

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:18.250
that Steve just kept building
wealth to compensate.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.590
I'm not looking for blame.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:24.720
But I'm thinking more in
terms of an agreed upon course

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.810
correction into the
future of technology.

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.750
My impression is
that the technology

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:35.220
needs to be redesigned so that
it works more harmoniously

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.440
with the human energy system.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.030
I don't mean ergonomics.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:40.510
I'm talking about
the development

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.290
of the harmonics
of the technology

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:46.360
for the full dimension
of our humanness.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.000
We all know a day
spent on the computer

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.900
can give us a feeling
of a day lost,

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.780
or I think we feel that way--
I'm talking for everybody--

00:49:55.780 --> 00:50:01.350
somehow gone unlived,
even if we got a lot done.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:05.060
There's an emptiness and
an emotional flatness.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.130
It's as if we're making
new forms all the time

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.540
and the brilliance
is uncontestable.

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.740
But are we evolving
and enriching

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:17.360
our humanness and
human experience?

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.160
For example, here's an idea.

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.380
And I'm almost finished.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.160
Consider the cell phone
as the new cigarette.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.930
Its energy is gray and graying.

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:33.390
People go off by
themselves to use it.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:35.900
They reach for it
unthinkingly as a distraction,

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.610
with the same regularity.

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:41.350
It's addictive and it lights up.

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:43.800
So here we have an
example of wanting

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:49.630
to connect while the behavior
actually blocks connection.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:53.040
In my imagination, I think that
a company, one at the cutting

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:57.150
edge of the market into
the future of technology,

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.230
they'd hire an unusual
kind of workforce

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:03.200
to start figuring out how
to make the technology

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.290
work with our biological,
emotional, intellectual,

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:09.920
and spiritual constitutions.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.740
OK, two more paragraphs.

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:13.670
Our machines are cool.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:17.610
And thanks to Steve's exquisite
sensibility and insistence,

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.960
they are more
beautiful than ever.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.770
But I think we
are too impressed.

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:25.120
They're supposed to serve us.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.320
We should not be
serving them-- we

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.050
should not serve them,
nor pattern after them,

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.480
nor be entrained by them.

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.500
The technology is powerful.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.890
But the discernment
is that it's only

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.990
as good as the person
who uses it being

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:46.250
responsible to their
own unique heart vision.

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:54.140
And so I want to read something
from my Henry Miller days.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:00.250
a quote.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.990
And since he wasn't
just a little sexist,

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:05.140
I've changed a few pronouns.

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.210
We live in a different time now.

00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:11.960
He said, every day we
slaughter our finest impulses.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.750
That's why we get
a heartache when

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:18.460
we read those lines written
by the hand of a master

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:22.540
and recognize them as our own,
as the tender shoots which

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.560
we stifled because
we lacked the faith

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:29.560
to believe in our own powers
and our own criteria of truth

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.710
and beauty.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.630
Every man and woman,
when she gets quiet

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:37.070
and when she becomes
desperately honest with herself,

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:41.940
is capable of uttering
profound truths.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.640
We all derive from
the same source.

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:48.000
There's no mystery about
the origin of things.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.750
We are all part of creation,
all royalty, all poets,

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:54.380
all musicians.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:58.642
We have only to open up and
discover what's in here.

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:00.121
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:07.650
AUDIENCE: I want to revisit
some of what you shared,

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:12.465
both at the end and about your
process in writing this book.

00:53:12.465 --> 00:53:15.840
And in particular--
so within Google

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.600
we're a company
creating software

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.340
that people are using,
even in particular around

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.750
like authoring.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.487
So I'm curious, given
some of the things

00:53:25.487 --> 00:53:30.440
that you had highlighted about
sort a greater, like a greater

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:35.340
connection to our humanity in
terms of how we use computers

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:39.290
for expression, for authoring,
and some of the things that you

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:43.182
had mentioned early on
around approaching the book

00:53:43.182 --> 00:53:45.640
and writing cinematically, and
a lot of the reflection that

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.940
took place for you
around steering

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.500
this kind of middle course
between extremes, I'm curious,

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.520
do you see like ways
that tools could

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.030
be improved to support the kind
of authoring-- to support you

00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:00.100
in the processes
you went through

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.790
for like another
kind of expression?

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:05.505
CHRISANN BRENNAN: I
feel-- this is out there--

00:54:05.505 --> 00:54:10.795
but I feel it needs to be bumped
up to a whole other level.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:16.205
Now, is all this function.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:24.330
I mean that's another
good question.

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:26.371
And it's going to ring
through me because there's

00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:28.050
no way I can quite answer that.

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.980
And also I'm tremendously
grateful for the tools that

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:36.120
are because it was remarkable
what I was able to do.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:40.920
I don't have an idea--
my biggest idea is

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:44.550
that the energetics
of the computer

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:51.520
needs to be a higher frequency
so that it's not cutting off--

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.662
OK, so this is what I think.

00:54:54.662 --> 00:54:59.370
I think the computer is cutting
people off from their hearts.

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:02.440
I think it's cutting
them off from maybe

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.709
even the reason they came here.

00:55:05.709 --> 00:55:07.750
If it's cutting off their
hearts and their hearts

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:11.720
have the reasons they came
here, like their own destiny.

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:20.120
So what I would like to see
just a gifted workforce who

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:24.060
can come in and who
know multiple levels

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:30.500
of possibilities and can
design consciousness.

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.200
It's weird.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.290
Because I don't really want
computers to be babies,

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:36.130
like new life forms.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:39.290
But still, I would
like the computers--

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:43.940
I know that there are
people-- and some of you

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:50.550
could easily, probably
have that in you.

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:52.570
It's a calling.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:56:01.680
It's something that you're
not-- only by magic and accident

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.840
do you get trained for.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:14.460
So in terms of the functionality
of how the computer can help

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:19.120
remarkable people be more
creative, I have no comment.

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:29.070
I feel like the design of the
machine itself needs to be-- I

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:30.660
don't even know
what words-- redone.

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:31.280
AUDIENCE: Maybe transformed.

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.520
CHRISANN BRENNAN: Yeah.

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.992
AUDIENCE: To pick up on some
of the themes you mentioned--

00:56:34.992 --> 00:56:38.560
I mean I appreciated the analogy
you gave around like a cell

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.674
phone as the kind of
like modern cigarette.

00:56:40.674 --> 00:56:42.090
When you're standing
in line, it's

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:44.205
a way to sort of pass the time.

00:56:44.205 --> 00:56:45.580
CHRISANN BRENNAN:
Good, good one.

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.380
I should add that.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:46.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:49.440
And it's somewhat ironic because
it's a device for communication

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.900
and we use it for like
disconnection, a disconnection

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.699
from ourselves, a disconnection
from the people around us.

00:56:56.699 --> 00:56:58.240
In terms of some of
what you had just

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.582
been mentioning, the way that
computers and technology is

00:57:01.582 --> 00:57:03.040
conceptualized
right now, it's very

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.600
much around kind of
spectacle and sort

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.740
of what we see,
seeing new things.

00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:10.820
And it sounds like
I was hearing you

00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:14.250
get at how there may be
possibilities around supporting

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:18.750
a kind of reflection
or introspection,

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:20.930
like arriving at insights
kind of internally.

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:23.114
I'm curious if that's
something that you're also

00:57:23.114 --> 00:57:24.530
envisioning as a
possibility there

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:26.613
CHRISANN BRENNAN: Well,
it's an interesting thing.

00:57:26.613 --> 00:57:30.050
I mean the furthest I've gone
with it is that people need

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:33.550
time to be reflective with
the human energy system.

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:36.830
It's already so much-- it's
light years ahead of anything

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:38.930
we can do with the computer.

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:42.190
So in terms of
using the computer,

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:43.510
I think it's a problem.

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:52.190
That's exactly where
the problem is--

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:53.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.248
CHRISANN BRENNAN: --eclipsed.

00:57:54.248 --> 00:57:56.310
Yeah.

00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:57.624
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:57:57.624 --> 00:57:58.790
CHRISANN BRENNAN: Thank you.

00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:59.716
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:59.716 --> 00:58:01.496
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:58:01.496 --> 00:58:02.871
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming also.

00:58:02.871 --> 00:58:04.755
CHRISANN BRENNAN: Thank you.

00:58:04.755 --> 00:58:06.168
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:06.168 --> 00:58:21.405
