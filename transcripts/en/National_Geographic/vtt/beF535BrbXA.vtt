( audience applause )

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.885 line:0%
<i> Buenas tardes a los que
 hablan espaÃ±ol, mucho gusto.</i>

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:23.889 line:0%
Good afternoon, it's a pleasure
to be here with you all.

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.992
People say that our community

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:30.029
needs more scientists,
more writers,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.799
entrepreneurs,
and social leaders.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:36.903
But that's why society
should focus on childhood.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:41.407
Allowing them to be
entrepreneurs from childhood.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:44.110
Let's imagine
that you are a child

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.213
who wants to be
a baseball player.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.115
What should you do?

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.118
( audience )
Practice?

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:55.922
Of course, practice, and
go to the baseball school.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:59.959
If you want to be
a pianist or a violinist,

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.762
you should go to
the music school.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:06.565
If you as a child,
want to be a singer,

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:09.601
there are places
where you can be trained.

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:13.372
But if you want to be
an environmentalist

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:16.142
where can you receive training?

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.044
There are no place.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.180
There were no places to go.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.484 line:0%
In 1995 I was 10 when I decided

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:28.621 line:0%
to start doing something
to help Grandmother Earth.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.424 line:0%
I invited my friends
to meet after school

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.727 line:0%
and I told them about
environmental issues.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:39.098
We wanted to protect
animals, plants and humans.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:42.001
And dreamed about
spreading our movement

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.569
around the world.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.439
Our name was HUNAB,
and it stands for

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.143 line:0%
Humans Unite with
Nature in Harmony for

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.546 line:0%
Beauty, Welfare,
and Willingness.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:57.950
We discovered that the
worst environmental problem

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.419
that our society has to face

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:02.355
is not pollution,

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:06.792
nor extinction,
nor illegal trade,

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:09.128
neither global warming.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.498
The worst environmental problem

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:15.168
is the lack of education

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:20.039
because this is the root
for all those problems.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:24.543
But we, as a group, we have
faced our own challenge,

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:29.182
the lack of credibility
because of our age.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:32.751
Fortunately and after 19
years, we survived it.

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.620
( laughter )

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.756
And now we are
focused on education

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:41.961
as our main element
to solve and to eradicate

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.630
environmental problems.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:47.066
Education is
a continuous process

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:50.670
where a person acquires
knowledge, awareness,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.472
and the skills
to make decisions.

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:58.377
Education requires
continuous time and efforts.

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:02.348
And in fact, I am
still astonished about why,

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.150
in my country,
and in the world,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.387
environmental education
is not included

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:11.958
as a main subject in
the school's curriculum,

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.595
when Mexico is
one of the megadiverse countries

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:17.096
in the world.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:21.868
Natural resources are
the basis of our economy.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:26.472
And education is a tool
to eradicate poverty.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:30.443
If a country has problems with
the economy or development,

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.177
this country can survive.

00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:35.347
It will have more
time to solve it.

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.650
But if a country has problems

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.853
with its natural
resources or environment,

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:45.725
this country will not
have more time to solve it

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.227
because this is the basis

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.563
for their health,
development, and growth,

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.666
their heritage, and
their sovereignty.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.169
With my group,

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:02.808
I decided to found a
non-profit institution in 2006.

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:06.779
Now we are focused on
four different programs.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.248
Let's see each one of them.

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.051 line:0%
The first one is
Methodologies.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.986 line:0%
To teach in a fun way,

00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:17.323 line:0%
those topics that seem
complex to explain.

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:20.192 line:0%
Now, thanks to the
children's contribution,

00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:24.463 line:0%
we can approach them in
an easy and transcending way.

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:27.600
In fact, children
are very creative.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.468
Thanks to their ideas,

00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:34.907
we have generated books,
stories, hand crafts, and games.

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:40.346
Children show us everyday
the best language to teach.

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.448
This was a mournful march

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:46.051
to recognize the extinct
species in Mexico.

00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:48.655
The 41 extinct species.

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:52.225
When I say
environmental education,

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.626
I don't refer to
natural sciences,

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:57.296
I mean a comprehensive vision

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.231
of all the issues around.

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.166
Here you can see how we approach

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.270
water culture,
biodiversity, energy,

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.206
environment and ecology,
humanitarian culture,

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:09.308
and also laws.

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:11.743
In fact, we have
an educational plan,

00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:13.879
we call it<i> Mondambientes</i> .

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.549
<i> Mondambientes</i> in
Spanish stands for,

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.484
Changing Environment.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.988
It's like a career to
be an environmentalist

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.389
from childhood.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.592
During two years,
a child needs to learn

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:29.161
about these 17 main topics.

00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:32.765
But the information
is according to their age.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:35.434
Let's see only one,
the number 14.

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:38.971 line:0%
To organize fishing and
sustainable development,

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:42.107 line:0%
a child is going to learn
about close seasons,

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:45.311 line:0%
fishing techniques,
ecosystems for fishing,

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:47.980 line:0%
conservation,
native biodiversity,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.082 line:0%
and sustainable aquaculture,

00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:53.452 line:0%
and then they can take action.

00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:56.589 line:0%
Because now they have
a comprehensive idea

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:00.860
about how their actions
have a positive impact

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.962
on their communities.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:07.233 line:0%
The second program is about
courses with workshops

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.970 line:0%
where children are
teaching other children.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.540 line:0%
Yes, they are training their
peers during two years,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.877 line:0%
in order to train them as
environmental instructors.

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:22.748 line:0%
That's why I say that
they are the heroes

00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:25.651
of our Grandmother Earth.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:29.222
Because children's
hands may be small,

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:33.726
but their hearts are
immense to save our planet.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:37.596
In fact, children who have
participated in this program

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:39.932
have learned about
how to respect nature,

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:42.802
how to respect environment,

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:46.839
but also this program
has changed lifestyle.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.008
Due to the mentorship
activities,

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:52.311
there are children who've
started their own activities,

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:53.813
their own movements,

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:58.017
and they have been awarded
by the Mexican authorities.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:02.955
In fact, we have met with the
last four presidents of Mexico.

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.356 line:0%
The third program is

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:07.793 line:0%
sustainable aquaculture
production systems

00:07:07.793 --> 00:07:11.063 line:0%
where we are rescuing
native species

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:13.699 line:0%
like the Mayan Apple Snail

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.302
to the extent that
our communities

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:19.705
are now more aware of
their natural resources.

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.074
They will be able
to properly use

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:23.609
their native species,

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:26.779
and also to reactivate
their local economies.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:32.284 line:0%
And finally, the fourth
program is Ceiba Pentandra.

00:07:32.284 --> 00:07:36.188 line:0%
Ceiba Pentandra is the name
of the first high-level

00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:39.458 line:0%
environmental educational
training center

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:40.926 line:0%
in the world.

00:07:40.926 --> 00:07:45.397
In 2007 the city of Merida
donated us a land.

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:49.468
In 2012 we started
the construction.

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:51.770
Thanks to the Mexico
Initiative Award

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.806
and the Young Laureates
Rolex Award for Enterprise,

00:07:54.806 --> 00:07:59.111
there were $500,000 to invest.

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:03.181
It allowed us to build only 30
percent of the construction,

00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:07.886
but this year we
have a big challenge.

00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:10.021
We need to raise enough funds

00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:11.957
to complete the construction.

00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:13.526
Only two million dollars.

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:14.927
( audience laughs )

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:17.863
Yeah. And these are some
areas that we need to build.

00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:21.266
We need some museums,
we need an aquarium,

00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:25.504
a library, and an
experimental laboratory too.

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:29.441
But why is Ceiba
Pentandra so important?

00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:31.343
Why? There are other
Mexican states asking

00:08:31.343 --> 00:08:34.713 line:0%
for their own
environmental theme park.

00:08:34.713 --> 00:08:38.084
Because with a 100 percent
of the construction

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:43.088
we will be able to receive
64,000 children a year.

00:08:43.088 --> 00:08:45.257
With a successful methodology

00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:49.028
we can be an ally
for the educational system.

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:52.331
Also, a lot of space
for young people,

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:54.800
handicapped, and elderly.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.703
With our expertise,
we can train teachers,

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:02.240
and provide them methodologies
and materials too.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.478
And also, with our expertise,

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:09.314
we can contribute to
generate the free textbooks

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:12.151
for the educational
system, like this one

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.020
for the curriculum.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.225
This project can be
replicated in any place

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:22.060
of Mexico or in the world.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.998
Now, I brought a new project,

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:28.534
and you're going to
be the first ones

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:31.003
to know about this.

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:36.642
In Ceiba Pentandra we
reinvented the Noah's Ark.

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:38.711
Yes, the Noah's Ark.

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:39.545
( audience laughs )

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.947
We reinvented...

00:09:41.947 --> 00:09:46.118
In moments of crisis,
the Noah's Ark saved,

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:51.223
protected, and rescued
wildlife, all the living beings.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:53.925
But now our Grandmother Earth

00:09:53.925 --> 00:09:56.128
needs our support.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:58.564
Needs to protect
the living beings now.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:02.234
Here are some features
of the reinvented Ark

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:04.503
developed in Ceiba Pentandra.

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:05.871
The first one is that

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:10.342
this can cross
geographical borders.

00:10:10.342 --> 00:10:13.746
Another novel feature is that
it can adapt

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:17.149
to the urgent needs
of harmonizing

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:19.885
the humans coexistence.

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:23.221
Also the size was redesigned

00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:26.792
so that all the tools required

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:30.862
for sustainable management
can be transported,

00:10:30.862 --> 00:10:35.601
constructed, or
modified within the ark.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:40.573
This ark can improve
under adverse situations.

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:45.810
Some contributions
of this new ark

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.381
is that if we can activate it

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:52.117
and distribute this prototype
around the world,

00:10:52.117 --> 00:10:56.655
we will allow a stronger
human contributions.

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:59.959
Also, we will ensure
the protection

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:05.530
of living beings on
ground and oceans.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:10.536
We can harmonize the
coexistence of cultures.

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:13.239
And we can save
natural resources.

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:17.008
But thanks to children's
ideas in my organization,

00:11:17.008 --> 00:11:21.313
we discovered that with
this reinvented ark,

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:26.585 line:0%
we can save the most important
species in the world,

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:28.354
humans.

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:32.625
Also, we need your
contributions.

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.292
I don't mean money,

00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:36.328
although it is also necessary.

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:37.495
( audience laughs )

00:11:37.495 --> 00:11:40.732
I mean your ideas, perseverance,

00:11:40.732 --> 00:11:44.837
and participation
to consolidate it.

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:50.576
Well, I think that it's time to
discover this reinvented ark.

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:51.643
Are you ready?

00:11:51.643 --> 00:11:52.444
( audience )
Yeah!

00:11:52.444 --> 00:11:53.679
OK.

00:11:56.548 --> 00:11:59.484
This is the reinvented ark.

00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:01.453
( audience laughter )

00:12:01.453 --> 00:12:07.393
Yes, all this time I was
talking about human brains.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:11.597
Our brains are like arks.

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:14.533
Each time that we
make a decision

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:16.535
to protect a living being,

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:19.805
a plant, a human, an animal,

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:23.909
we are acting like an ark.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:28.813
And this ark has
always have been there.

00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:30.849
We only need to consolidate it

00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:32.984
and to reactivate it.

00:12:32.984 --> 00:12:36.388
We only need to
distribute these arks

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:40.359
around the world,
as much as we can.

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:44.196
That's why we need to
consolidate Ceiba Pentandra.

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:45.497
That's why we need more

00:12:45.497 --> 00:12:47.866
environmental educational
training centers

00:12:47.866 --> 00:12:49.635
around the world.

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:53.672
That's why we need
to train more heroes

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:55.807
of Grandmother Earth.

00:12:55.807 --> 00:12:58.243
But we need to work together.

00:12:58.243 --> 00:13:04.550
Decision makers, media,
companies, authorities,

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.818
we do need you.

00:13:06.818 --> 00:13:12.758
See, if we work united,
with these new arks,

00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:18.297
we will ensure a prosperous
and harmonious life

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:21.600
for our Grandmother Earth.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.734
Thank you.

00:13:22.734 --> 00:13:25.604
( audience applause )

00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:28.440
( outro music )
