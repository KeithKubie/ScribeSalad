00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; Recorder: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.570
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Jason Reynolds
was tricked into becoming a reader

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.700
and writer when his aunt gave him
many books that went unappreciated

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.860 position:56%
for years until he discovered poetry
and the pull of the written word.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.810
He is a graduate of the University
of Maryland with a BA in English

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.870
and a concentration in
writing and rhetoric.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.170
He moved to Brooklyn
after graduation

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.790
and he published his first book
in 2009, "My name is Jason.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.440
Mine too," co-written
with his friend

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.730
and artist Jason Douglas Griffin.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.240
Reynolds won the Coretta Scott
King award, the John Steptoe Award

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.560
for New Talent for his 2014
novel "When I was the Greatest."

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.640
And received the Coretta Scott King
honor for "Boy in the Black Suit"

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.080
and also "All-American Boys"
co-written with Brendan Kiely.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.840
That book was also the first Walter
Award given by the organization,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.670
We Need Diverse Books,
named for the Ambassador

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.560
for Young People's
Literature, Walter Dean Myers.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.460
He is a writer who practices
every day and strives

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.490
to improve his powerful stories
that never bore young readers.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.670
His stories are crazy and
all about and above all real.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:02.070
You can find his self described
ramblings at JasonWritesBooks.com.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.680
We know Jason well at
the Young Reader Center.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.200
We've been privileged to have him

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.570
and I know you will
enjoy his remarks.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.370
Thank you.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.480
[ Clapping ]

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.960
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Thanks Karen.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.260
Hey everybody.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.560
What's happening?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.860
You're good?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.160
&gt;&gt; Crowd: Yeah.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.460
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: All right.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.470
So, you know, it's funny I
don't have anything prepared

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.740
so we're just going to wing it.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.080
[laughs] and see what happens.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.340
And it's being taped, which
makes it even funnier.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.640
[laughs] Sorry.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.490
What I want to say though,
most importantly is I want

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.810
to give just a bit of background
about why it is I'm here today.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.160
How it is I came to all this stuff.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.460
And then I'm going
to touch on "Ghost."

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.760
The new book "Ghost."

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.060
Anybody had heard about it?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.360
No about it?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.660
All right.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.960
If you don't know about it
think about knowing about it.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.920
This is what it looks like.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.380
And then we'll take some
questions and then we out of here.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.310
Nothing major.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.170
All right.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.470
So this is poem.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.400
Right. It starts off "When my love
swears that she is made of truth.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.160
I do believe her, though
I know she lies.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.060
That she may see me as
some untutored youth.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.310
Unlearned in the world's
false subtleties."

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.330
That is William Shakespeare.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.360
That is not what I grew up on.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.760
Right. So, like, I know William
Shakespeare now and we can run,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.060
all the William Shakespeare's plays

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.970
and I can tell you all the
William Shakespeare's sonnets

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.830
and I can we recite all of the
characters and all this that

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.760
and a third, but when I was
15, 14, 13, 12, 11 years old,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.660
nobody checking for
William Shakespeare.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.260
All my teachers were like
"Yo, we got to get you

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.560
on this Shakespeare thing."

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.080
And I'm like "Shakespeare
don't sound nothing like me

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.950
and furthermore Shakespeare
ain't speaking English."

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.420
And my teachers are
like "No, no, no.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.720
This is English."

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.100
And I'm like "The word just
ain't spelled J-V-S-T."

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.330 position:56%
And my teachers are like, "No, no,
the B Shakespearean English is a U."

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.260
And I'm like "Well that
seems a little silly

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.440
because that spells jvst and jvst
ain't no word I've ever heard."

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.610
Right. Another poem.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.800
"Well, son, I'll tell you life for
me ain't been no crystal stair.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.130
There are tacks in it,
splinters, you know,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.430
places where there
is no carpet, bare."

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.040
Right. So we all know
that's "Mother to Son."

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.340
Some of us know.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.640
All of us should know.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.940
"Mother to Son," Langston Hughes.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.580
I ain't grew up on that either.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.760
Right. I'd like to
tell you that I did,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.700
but the truth of the
matter is I didn't.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.990
I love Langston Hughes
now, obviously.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.690 position:56%
But when I was young, when I was 10,
11, 12 years old I wasn't checking

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.990
for Langston Hughes either.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.740
What I was sort of into was, you
know, a poem that went like this

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.690
"Once upon a time not long ago.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.930
When people wore pajamas
and lived life slow.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.700
When laws were stern
and justice stood

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.540
and people were behaving
like they ought to good.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.100
There was a little boy that was
misled by another little boy

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.680
and this is what he said.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.980
'Me and you, Ty, we
going to make some cash

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.960
by robbing old folks
and making a dash."

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.030
Now, that was a poem that I loved.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.080
It was written by a
man named Slick Rick.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.070
And Slick Rick, for those
who don't know is a rapper.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.460
Hip-Hop saved my life.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.310
Hip-Hop saved the lives
of an entire generation.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.940
And all of our parents
during this time were saying

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.880
that hip-hop was the thing
that was going to ruin us.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.280
They were steamrolling our
cassette tapes on television,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.500
banding our music, telling us

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.690
that hip-hop was only
going to last five years.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.990
You couldn't win an award for it.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.290
There were no music videos.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.080
If you were on MTV, which
is a brand new thing,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.480
you were Michael Jackson
and/or Prince and that was it.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.900
Right. Eventually, of course, we
know the hip-hop became the thing

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.380
that is driving young youth
culture around the entire world.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.750
A thing that they said would last
five years is driving youth culture

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.050
around the world.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.800
The biggest play right now in,
arguably in Broadway history,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.540
we'll wait and see is Hamilton.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.610
A historic play driven by hip-hop.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.240
The biggest bio pic in history
is Straight Out Of Compton,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.840
which is the story of the most
controversial rap group in history.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.070
Right. It can no longer
be denied and fortunately

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.400
for me it was the thing that gave
me everything that I have today

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.260
because they were the YA
authors of my generation.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.670 position:56%
The rappers were telling the stories
of the kids who grew up like me.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.870
You think of the 1980s
and early 1990s

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.070
when all the three major
prongs of my generation.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.300
Specific if you were growing
up in a community of color

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.080
or a lower income community.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.440
You had drugs, specifically
crack cocaine,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.740
which I know we're all aware of.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.100
For the young folks in the room,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.080
I'm so glad that you were
born in this generation.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.780
The second thing was the beginning

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.660
of what we now know
was HIV and AIDS.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.260
And I'm sure, for the
old people in the room,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.770 position:56%
you remember how frightening it was.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.830
How they thought that
it was airborne.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.120
My next door neighbor passed
away from it and my father went

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.050
to go see him and had to
put on a quarantine suit

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.350
because they were afraid
you could get it

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.700
by touching anything
that he touched.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.000
Right. And the third thing

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.880
that happened during this
generation were the beginning

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.040
of what we now know as hip-hop
music, which was a direct answer

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.310
to the issues that were
happening in the community.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.270
Now for young Jason, a kid who's
growing up in this neighborhood

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.350
and in these communities,
when I would go to school

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.010
and the teacher says "You got
to read To Kill a Mockingbird."

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.330
A kid like me says "There are no
Atticus Finch's in my neighborhood.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.630
I'm not interested."

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.060
The teacher says "You
got to read Moby Dick."

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.260
And a guy like me says "Captain
Ahab does not exist in my world.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.120
I have never even seen a whale.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.740
I've never even seen a boat."

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.090
Right. "Why would I
want to read that?"

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.510
The teacher says "We want you
to read Lord of the Flies."

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.450
And I say, "Lord of the Flies?

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.640
I live Lord of the Flies.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.260
Ain't no point in me
reading that book."

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.460
The teacher say, "We want
you to read "Don Quixote."

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.800
I remember back in the day
the textbooks had excerpts.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.480
Right. "We want you
to read Don Quixote."

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.010
And I say "Oh, man, this is

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.470
about a knight who's imagining
a windmill is a dragon."

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.120
And I think to myself "But
I know dragons in real life.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.890
Real live people who
breathe fire on my block.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.740
Why would I want to read that?"

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.580
But what the rappers did was they
created imagery around my life.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.050
They created a framework for
us to deal with and interact

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.480
with to synthesize our realities.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.850
So what I did is I
went to this store.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.150
This is where my life changed.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.060
I went to this store.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.330
I bought a cassette tape, because
back in a day, for the young folks

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.660
in room, you had to go to
the store to buy music.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.700
Right. That - you had to
be active to buy music.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.580
And I walked in and I bought
Queen Latifah's, Black Reign.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.160
Right. I know many of us know Queen
Latifah as, like, a personality

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.290
or an actress or talk
show host, a model now.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.120
Right. But when I grew up
Queen Latifah was a rapper

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.510
and not only was she a rapper,
she was one of the best rappers

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.640
of all time, still is one of
the best rappers of all time.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.640
And so I go to the store and I buy
Queen's Latifah's, Black Reign.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.930
And I get home and I have an older
brother and for older siblings

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.960
in a room, you know how you
don't like your younger sibling

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.260
to touch any of your stuff.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.140
For the young kids who
have younger siblings,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.320
take it easy on your little
brother or your little sister.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.620
I had an older brother.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.020
He wasn't home.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.420
And I had my new cassette tape.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.740
My first one that I bought with my
own money, saved up my lunch money.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.980
And I walked into his room
and I took his Walkman.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.460
Now for the kids in the room, the
Walkman was basically the iPod Pre.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.640
Right. We're talking
about that before, before.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.290
When we had a little box,
you put it on your hip.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.590
It was like this.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.890
You put it on your hip.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.190
Put the tape in there.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.490
Put your headphones on.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.790
And I had my cassette
tape and I opened it up,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.090
there was a plastic on it.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.390
Ya'll remember, and it took, like,
45 minutes to get the plastic.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.130
You like, trying to get
the plastic off of it.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.720
It's like when you buy
scissors and you've got

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.080
to have scissors to
open up scissors.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.000
This is a strange, like
the strange sort of thing

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.040
that nobody really wants you
to have what you just bought.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.820
So I'm like trying to
get the plastic off

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.550
and I finally get the
plastic off and I open it

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.850
up and I'm like here it is.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.150
It's like the Holy Grail.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.450
There's light coming out of it.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.570
Right. And I'm like staring at
it and I pull out my liner notes,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.410
because the liner notes,
for the kids in the room,

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.980
the liner notes are a pamphlet
that came with every single album

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.710
that had the lyrics written
on it for every single song.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.850
So I pull it out and open
it up and it's this big

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.560
and you unfold it and
it's this long.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.980
And I sit down and I
push "play," and I listen

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.720
to Queen Latifah start rapping

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.070
and I start reading along
to every single lyric.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.850
And after the album was over
I read the lyrics again,

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.150
but this time without the music.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.510
And then I realize that Queen
Latifah was writing poetry,

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.770
that Tupac was writing poetry, that
Nas and Slick Rick and Public Enemy

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.440
and NWA were all writing poems.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.120 position:56%
And then I could figure out then how
to take the academic part of my life

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.560 position:56%
and the leisure part of my life to
connect them by saying Queen Latifah

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.770
and Maya Angelou are doing
the exact same thing.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.070
It just sounds a little different,

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.830
but the intention is
exactly the same.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.100
And that Tupac and Langston Hughes
are doing the exact same thing

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.340
for the exact same reason, it
just sounds a little difference.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.510
It's written for me and I decided,
then, perhaps I'll write poems.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.540
I ain't going to read these books
though, but I will write poems.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.330
I did not read a novel
until I was 17 years old.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.650
None. Not proud of it, but it
speaks to where, what was happening

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.070
in the industry from 1980 to 1999.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.370
There's a gap there.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.180
For the kids in my
community, there's a gap.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.940
We had Walter Dean
Myers, thankfully.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.140
But most of the books that we read
were about the 1970s and the 1960s.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.680
There were no books in
the '80s about the '80s.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.200 position:56%
No books in the '90s about the '90s.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.590 position:56%
Now kids today have an opportunity
to see themselves as they're living.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.430
See their lives as they're
living their lives today.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.730
That's all I want to do.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.030
That's all I've been trying to do.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.630
That's all my comrades
are trying to do.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.930
That's what I'm here for.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.230
That's it.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.520
Now, for this book, Ghost.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.330
Here's the thing, I wrote
it for a few reasons.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.590
Number one, kids all around
the world, specifically,

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.760
kids of color do more than play
basketball, first thing first.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.900
And that was important
for me to say.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.590
I wanted to write a sports book.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.280
The easy default was to say "I'm
going to write a basketball book."

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.690
But I figured Kwame got it covered.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.990
All right.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.460
[ Laughs ]

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.760
Shake it off, right.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.240
It's like, that box
has been checked.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.630
Kwame's holding that
down pretty good.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.600 position:56%
So I say well, look, let's figure
out a way to tell a different story,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.250
because I was on the track team.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.990
And I always found it
funny when I would talk

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.140
to all my athlete friends,
like the football players,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.170
the basketball players, my buddies
now who are in the gym every day,

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.680
because we're getting older
and they're feeling insecure,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.310
and so they get in
there pumping it up.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.670
Right. And I always tell them,
because you always see these cats

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.910
and he's like "Oh, you got like -
you got all these muscles up here

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.210 position:56%
and you got these little stick legs.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.510
Why you ain't working
out in your leg?

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.810
Why you ain't running?

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.110
Uh, yeah, how's your wind?"

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.410
And they say "Man, ain't
nobody trying to run us."

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.710
"And why you don't want to run?"

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.220
And they say "Man,
running is too hard.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.520
It's too hard to run."

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.040
And I say, what it really is,
is that running is basically

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.040
about you being comfortable
with the feeling of suffocation.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.060
[ Laughs ]

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.040
Like that's what running is about.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.020
Running is the most mental activity
of all the sports, because in order

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.910
for you to win or in order for
you to even complete a race,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.420
you have got to come to grips
with the fact that you are going

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.670
to feel like you are dying.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.470
You won't die, but you are
going to feel like you are.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.480
The reason that most of us
don't like to work out is

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.420 position:56%
because once you run, like the first
15 steps, it starts burning, right.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.530
And you're like "Lord, I
can't pass out here on this.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.830
I got kids.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.260
I got, like, can't
pass out on the track."

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.730
But the truth is the human body is
incredible, because what happens is

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.020
after a while the lungs
learn to expand.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.540
Your body adapts to the discomfort.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.100
And you can push through.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.900
And then you're all good.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.240
And so what I wanted to do is
tell a story about a young man

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.470
who had dealt with some
trauma in his life,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:20.170
a young man who had gotten used
to the feeling of suffocation.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:24.120
Right. Literally there are
kids in your communities,

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.130
all over the country no matter
where you are, where you're from

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.850
or where you live, whose
normalcy is trauma.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:36.360
Who have gotten used to it and
who don't know that it's trauma,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.970
because it's normative behavior.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.890
It's Tuesday.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.510
It's Wednesday.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.920
Right. I always talk
about police brutality,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.340
because I wrote a book
called All-American Boys.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.640
I hope you've heard of it.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.940
I hope you read it.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.970
But there's a story that
Brendan and I always tell

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.610
about when I experience
an issue with the police.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.620
And the end of that story I
always say the hardest part

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.880
about that experience is to
come to grips with the fact

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.280
that I never ever spoke about it.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.900
Never told my mother, never told
my siblings, never told my pops

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.080
until last year, 16
years after it happened.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.880
And the reason why is because
for us it was just Tuesday.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.750
Right. I had a 25 year
buddy recently tell me "Man,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.450
I just realized that
I've been living -

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.030
my entire life has been traumatic.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.330
Grew up in Brooklyn.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.510
My whole life has been traumatic
and I did not know that.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.770
And so the decisions that I make
and the things that I do are coming

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.570 position:56%
from a place of trauma, because I've
never had the opportunity to deal

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.120
with it or even know
that this wasn't normal,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.860
that this wasn't healthy."

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.740
And so what I wanted to do is
say "What if I took a character

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.550
who experiences trauma early,
who chalks it up to this life

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:41.230
and then finds himself
on a track team."

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.080
Now he has an opportunity
to run and there are kids

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.660
in your communities
where running is normal.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.600
And so how can I put this character
in a situation where a coach,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.520
his new friends, the people around
him can bump him to the left

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.110
and say "Look we can decide
what we're running for.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:04.430
We can be running from or
we can be running toward."

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.440
And now we have an
opportunity to make up our minds

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.440
about what that's going to be.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.100

first book of a four book series.

to each of them individually based

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.280
around their experiences in their
homes and in their communities.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.270
Right. Because that's
what they did to us.

him in the hip-hop category,

Let's address it.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.920 position:56%
So the question is "Is there going
to be a sequel to All-American Boys,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.390
because I left her
hanging at the end?"

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.630
Brendan and I left her
hanging at the end.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.080
So here's the answer "No."

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.380
And there's not.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.140
And the reason why is because the
sequel is not for us to write.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.620
The sequel is for you to write.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.440
Right. What happens
next is on everybody

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.440
in this room, which is the point.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.480
Right. It's like we led you
there, but whatever is happening

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.840
on the page after that is up to
the people in here and the people

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.290
out there and the people
in this country,

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.590

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.590
It's about all of us figuring
out what's going to happen,

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.910
what's the next page of that story.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.930
So we got to figure out
what that's going to be.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.910
We all got to write
that one together.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.210

Yes, sir.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.030
to as a hip-hop artist,
is that okay with you?

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.720
Do you feel that's
complex or do you just say

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.310
"Yeah I am a hip hop artist."?

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.570
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: I
think it's complex.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:07.870
&gt;&gt; Male: Okay.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.370
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: I think I
am of the hip-hop community.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.000
I am of the hip-hop generation.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.380
And I'm a hip-hop enthusiast,

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.470
and so hip-hop influences
every single thing that I do,

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.230
especially when it comes to my art.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:27.030 position:56%
But there are people who put in a
lot of work, specifically as emcees.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.210
So that - we - if this -
this is going to complicated.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.430
Right. So think we can sort
of stratify that as like,

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.380
are you a hip hop artist,
umbrella wise?

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.680
Are you an emcee?

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.980
Are you a breaker?

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.280
Are you this, that and a third?

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.580
So I guess for the umbrella
level I would say, yes.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.310 position:56%
I guess from the umbrella standpoint
I'd say I'm a hip-hop artist

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.380
in terms of I'm an artist that
came through the hip-hop vessel

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.680
and the hip-hop generation.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.800
I'm just not an emcee and
I would never claim that,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.580
because there are people who
work way too hard at that.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.760
The same way that I wouldn't
claim that I'm a poet anymore,

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.300
because there are people
who work very hard

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.370
who don't get the credit
they deserve, who are -

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.390
who had dedicate themselves to
poetry and I'm out of practice.

I might have missed some
of the introduction,

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.980
but I'm an English teacher in
middle school and I was wondering

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.650
if you give me advice on how
to reach some of these kids,

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.190
of maybe a background like yours
or not, but they're in my room

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.640
How can I help you
reach some of the kids?

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.410
So here's the thing, I,
first of all, I don't know.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.610
You know, I try to be
as honest as possible

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.910
about not having any answers.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.210
Right. But I will say this.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.490
And I was just talking about this
yesterday to a group of librarians.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.540
When I was growing up we
all hated Brussels sprouts.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.830
Like the worst thing in the world
were steamed Brussels sprouts.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.410
First of all they smell
like poop and second

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.120
of all they taste even worse.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.000
And then I got older and my mother
started putting Brussels sprouts

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.360
in grease, which is how you
get them at restaurants now.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.170 position:56%
Brussels sprouts is always a feature
item on every restaurant menu now.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.080 position:56%
There's a revolution of the Brussels
sprout and the reason why is

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.650
because people have
started to fry them.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.050
People put them in grease now
and fry them up, well, you know,

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.290
they put them - make
sauces for them.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.590
You know, they put bacon in it.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:21.890
Right. All this stuff.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.190
And I'm going to ask
my mother, like, "Well,

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.050
shoot after you done fried
up the Brussels sprouts,

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.920
all the nutritious
value of it is gone."

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.880
And my mother say, "Well maybe I'm
not trying to give you nutrition,

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.120
maybe I'm trying to change the way
you think about Brussels sprouts."

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.180
Right. And so what I would say
to you is our job sometimes is

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.430
to divorce ourselves from
the fact that I've got

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.740
to constantly be gifting young
people with tools and equip them

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.060

lessons upon them.

you got to pull back.

little grease in the pot.

issue, but it's also an issue

that we all take different
stances on.

And honestly, to be
completely honest with you

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.420
where I stand is I'm never going
to tell nobody what they can

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.770
and can't write, because
ain't nobody ever going

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.070
to tell me what I can
or can't write.

I refuse. So I'm very careful.

to write outside of your identity,

do not - you have to
understand that what that does is

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.620
that it opens you up for critique.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.710
Right. So just because you
decide to make that leap, do it.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.010
It is your art.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.310
It's your craft.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.610
Right. Do your work.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:33.910
Do your research.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.210
Show some respect to the identity
in which you are trying to portray.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.330
Right. I found that [inaudible]
human beings, especially writers,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.130
we'll sit down and we'll dig
through every single part of a -

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.860
if I'm trying to describe
a car from the 1930s,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.780
I will give you every
single detail and research,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.870
the detail about the
car from the 1930s,

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.060
but I won't research the culture
in which I'm writing about.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.180
Right. Which is a strange,
strange thing to me.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.580
So I think we have to do more work
in taking care and being careful

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.110
of what it is we're
trying to portray.

you will get it wrong

and when you do there's a way
for us to have healthy critique.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.630
And you have to be game
for healthy critique.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.930
Don't close up.

so that you don't make
the mistake twice.

But we all have to do what
we have to do as artists.

they can't do what they want to do.

what, okay, so here's the truth,

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:38.960 position:56%
the truth is my favorite books to
write - well okay, this is separate.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.980
My favorite book that I've written
is "The Boy in the Black Suit,"

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.220
which is a book that
most people haven't read.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.890
But it's my favorite of the lot,

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:51.540
because the whole book
is about a boy who feels.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.840
That's it.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.710
I think for me, if anyone's read
all of my books, which you -

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.010
the one true line you would see is

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.500
that it's always a
deconstruction of masculinity.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.360 position:56%
I'm constantly trying to poke and
prod at what it means what this sort

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.800
of image of masculinity in
our country and in our world.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.730
And so the books are
always about boys who, like,

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.710
or I'm chipping away
at some of that.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.250
I'm trying to chip away
at some of that stuff

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.550
in every single book that I write.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.330
And Boy in the Black Suit, I
think, was an opportunity for me

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.660
to just talk about a boy who's
in pain and who's hurting

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.180
and who doesn't know what to
do with the emotion of grief.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.990
And no one is around
him to help him.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:26.180
And so all he can do is
feel, constantly feeling,

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.840
300 pages of feeling around a boy,
which I think is just important.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.140
We need to see that.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.440

I wrote that book in six
weeks and printed it out.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.210
That was up there and Ghost
was really, really fun just

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.270
because it's different
than all the other books.

kind of story.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.460

I mean, come on, "As
Brave As You," is fun,

because it's about me
and my older brother.

that's all - most of that's true.

what, you know, I'm a old school.

So here's the thing, I believe
that writing and I believe

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.680
that everything that we do,

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.720
everything that we're
great at is about habit.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.020
If LeBron James was here.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.700
Right. If he'd walked in
the door, I'd be like, "Yo,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.160
so what you do this morning."

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.610
And it'd be rhetorical,
because the truth is

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.980
that I know what he
did this morning.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.820
Right. He was at the gym and
he's probably shooting thousands

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.120
of jumpers.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.880
And so for me I have,
I'm extremely habitual.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.110
So I get up at 6:30, 7:00
o'clock every single morning.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.460
I have the same cup of coffee.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.760
I have the same breakfast.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.060
I do all the same things.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.230
I sit there, I sit down
around 7:30, 8:00 o'clock.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.340
I work until about 2:00
o'clock, 2:30 every single day.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.320
And the reason why is
because I believe that, like,

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.710
if I'm LeBron James and
I'm shooting jump shots,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.490
around jump shot number 50 my
body is going to know what to do.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.770
It's going to adjust itself
to shooting a jump shot.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.920
Right. So, every time I miss,
my body will make an adjustment

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.060 position:56%
and eventually my body will activate
its muscle memory to do its job.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.360
The same goes for the brain.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.040
Right. If the brain is the muscle,
then my belief is that if I get up

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.220
and do the same thing every
single day, that I don't have

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.960 position:56%
to go searching for my creativity at
9:00 'o'clock in the morning, like,

For me it's like, no, I wake up.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.160
The brain knows what to do.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.170
The creative part of
myself turns itself on

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.670
and I get busy every single day.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.970
But it's about habit.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.340
It's about routine.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.810
And it's about discipline.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:08.820
And so inspiration need
not enter my space,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.800
because practicing
craft dwell there.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.470
And that's sort of how I do
it, which is also why there's

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:16.930
so many books coming out.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.290
Because there's so many
books being written.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.840
You know, so, got you.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.140
We got one more question.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.010
Listen, I got, in the back.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.310

&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Who am I listening to?

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.620
Travis Scott.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.690
I know everyone's like.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:35.990
Like it's funny, Right.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.290
Because whenever you're in a room

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.590
like this people are
like "Listening to?

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.890
Who are you reading?"

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.660
Right. I'm listening
to Travis Scott,

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.020
I'm listening to a
lot of reggae music.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.590
I listen to a bunches, like
'70s soul stuff and like funk.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:51.860
I really think that
the biggest disservice

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.060
in American music has been the
under-rated, the under-rating

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.110
of funk music, the history of
funk music in this country.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.430
Seriously, everybody should
go back and listen to all

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:03.420
of Parliament stuff, all
the George Clinton stuff,

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.040
really listen to what they were
doing, talking about geniuses.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.960
And so I listened to a lot of
like war and George Clinton.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.880
All the '70s funk music because
I think that they were tapping

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.570
into something that I think
we have all grossly overlooked

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:18.090
for a very, very long time.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.390
Good question.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.690
All right you all.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:21.990
I hope you had a good time.

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.290
