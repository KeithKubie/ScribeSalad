ELIZABETH GREEN: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.460
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Greene, and
I am an Assistant Professor.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.240
I've been about four years
almost out of my Ph.D.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.640
I'm Assistant Professor at
Western University, formerly

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.350
called the University
of Western Ontario,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.433
if anyone's heard of that.

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:16.031
We rebranded to
Western University,

00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:17.572
like a good company,
any good company

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:20.760
should-- rebrand here and there.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.270
I'm an Assistant Professor
in the Classics Department.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.180
So you probably, maybe
have not had too many arts

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.830
and humanities
coming along here.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400
But one of my favorite
things about what I do,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.840
which I'm an archaeologist,
I'm a Roman archaeologist,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.110
and one of my favorite
things is that it's

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.240
very, very collaborative.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.550
So though I'm in a very,
very traditional department

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.200
of classical studies
at a university

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.190
and that's what I
do during the year,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.340
during the-- definitely don't
do that-- during the summer

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.930
I spend in Northern England
up on a site called Vindolanda

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.760
on Hadrian's Wall.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.325
Let's hope that--
yay, it's working.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.200
And, in fact, I should
point out my colleague

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.908
that I work with is
here with me today as

00:01:02.908 --> 00:01:04.930
well in the back,
Alexander Meier.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.130
And we have been working on this
excavation since about 2002.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.150
We have slotted
into a project that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.110
has been going on for
a very, very long time.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.400
The site is called Vindolanda.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.950
It's a Roman fort up
on Hadrian's Wall.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.930
And right now the site is--
or has been for about 45 years

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.650
and even longer has
it had excavation,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.302
but it's been run,
directed under the heritage

00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:31.260
management of the site.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.600
It's been under the site
of this Vindolanda Trust.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.530
This really amazing
group of people

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.740
of scholars and
archaeologists who have taken

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.650
care that this site not
only is open for people

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.690
to come and visit
and look at, but also

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.290
for people to have an excavation
experience of their own.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.660
So for several
decades now people

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.022
have been coming to the site,
taking part in excavations

00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:55.230
and getting a little piece
of archaeology themselves.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.246
So the director of that
program is Dr. Andrew Birley.

00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.120
He's the Director of
Excavations on the site.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.744
And then there's a
whole slew of people

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:03.480
who have been taking
care of the site,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.020
and making it available to so
many people in so many ways.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.850
I started there with my
colleague Alex in the back,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.390
in 2002.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.940
And I've been there ever since.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.530
In the summers,
through my Ph.D.,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.570
and then now that
I'm a professor,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.100
I'm bringing my
own students there.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.558
So it's been a site
that has really

00:02:19.558 --> 00:02:21.765
been something amazing
for a lot of people.

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:23.890
Like I was saying though,
one of my favorite things

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.680
about being an
archaeologist is that I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.490
collaborate with tons of people.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.560
So we're running everything
from arts and humanities, which

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.750
is where I came from,
in fact, with a degree

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.890
in classical studies.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.887
Just really super interested
when I was 18 in the Romans.

00:02:36.887 --> 00:02:39.470
Wanted to learn more about the
Romans and the Greeks, and then

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.351
somehow made it all
the way to archaeology.

00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:43.350
But what I'm doing
consistently is collaborating

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.410
with scientists,
and tech people,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.527
and all sorts of
individuals in the field.

00:02:47.527 --> 00:02:49.360
And this is really one
of my favorite things

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.640
about being an archaeologist.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.950
Now, do we have any sort
of secret classic majors

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.560
or archaeology majors or
anthro majors in the room?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.740
Not a-- oh, we do.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.490
AUDIENCE: History.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.740
ELIZABETH GREENE: History, OK.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.500
Fantastic.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.116
What did you guys do?

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:05.490
AUDIENCE: I was a classic major.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.281
ELIZABETH GREENE: You
were a classic major?

00:03:07.281 --> 00:03:07.900
High five.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.950
Right on.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.010
That's fantastic.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.060
So was I. So I came
through it really

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.596
through the cultural
world, and just

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:16.720
interested in these people.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.428
And then came all the
way to archaeology.

00:03:18.428 --> 00:03:21.210
So now my world is opened up
to all these different people.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.042
OK, so for the people who
aren't classic majors in here,

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:26.500
let me just tell you a little
bit about the site, and about

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.160
Roman Britain.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.170
And then for where
we're talking about,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.340
I'll give you some context.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.420
The map that you're
looking at is, indeed,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.860
a map of the Roman Empire.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.526
And this is one of
the first things that

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:37.560
got me thoroughly interested
was wow, that's huge.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.380
The Roman Empire now
covers 42 modern countries.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.010
So this is really amazing,
as far as I was concerned.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.220
When you look at it now, where
you see our work taking place

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.190
is all the way up
on-- and I'll just

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.630
use this because I can't
point at all the screens-- all

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.140
the way up here, literally
on the Northwest.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.520
The furthest Northwest
corner of this Roman Empire

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.920
that you could possibly be.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.622
So really, really far
from the center of Rome.

00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:06.080
And you can imagine
with that comes

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.540
all sorts of interesting
things, like what

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.910
is it like to live
on a frontier?

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.630
What is it like to live
in a conquered zone?

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.380
There's all sorts of
questions we could ask.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.440
What I'm going to
tell you about today

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.982
though is a little
bit of how we come

00:04:14.982 --> 00:04:16.106
to some of those questions.

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:17.790
How we discover some
of those questions.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.290
So there we all the way up
in that Northwest corner.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.100
The site is really famous
for a couple of things.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.750
It has some really
unique preservation

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.910
called anaerobic preservation.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.050
You guys probably all
know what that is.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.920
It doesn't have any
oxygen in the soil.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.930
Therefore, we have finds
that we don't really

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.800
get in most archaeological
environments--

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.250
organic finds-- leather,
wood, things like that.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.120
The site actually
has-- this is something

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.161
that's close to my heart.

00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:43.260
It has over 4,000
Roman leather shoes.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.660
And people ask me
all the time, why?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.750
Is this a shoe production site?

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.400
No, not at all.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.972
It's just because we have
this anaerobic preservation.

00:04:51.972 --> 00:04:53.430
But you might not
have ever thought

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.971
we'd have shoes from
the Roman world.

00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:55.570
We do, indeed.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.278
But this site has
absolutely the largest.

00:04:57.278 --> 00:04:59.220
That's one thing it's
very well-known for.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.250
Has anybody ever been up
here to Hadrian's Wall,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.770
or been to Vindolanda?

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.470
All right.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.230
Fantastic.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.730
Good.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.890
So we have some people.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.700
If you go there now, the first
thing you see in the museum

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.130
is you stare at a wall of shoes.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.455
It's really quite amazing.

00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:13.081
And they're nearly
2,000 years old.

00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:15.580
The other thing the site is
very famous for are these things

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.550
called the Vindolanda
writing tablets.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.490
Ink on wood.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.620
Direct messages--
letters, personal letters,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.420
duty rosters from the Roman
Army who inhabited this site.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.160
What else?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.150
There's personals or postcard.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.830
What you're looking
at here is probably

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.110
the earliest female
handwriting from Europe.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.190
There's a little private
message in this letter.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.530
Most of it is a scribe.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.840
Right here.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.950
This little private
message right there.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.140
It's a letter between
two wives, and one wife

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.747
says to the other,
two military wives--

00:05:46.747 --> 00:05:48.080
they're wives of the commanders.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.960
And one wife says,
"Oh, please, please,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.310
come to my birthday party.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.002
This day would be so much
better if you were here."

00:05:54.002 --> 00:05:54.960
Really kind of amazing.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.100
Nearly 2,000 years
later you're think, oh.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.600
The first letter
they actually found

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.180
said, "I'm sending you
socks and underwear."

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.700
So you can imagine everything
from socks and underwear

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.820
to telling us exactly what these
individuals are doing on site.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.346
So this is another category
why this site is very famous.

00:06:10.346 --> 00:06:12.720
There's all sorts of really
unique and interesting things

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.220
there.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.450
Everybody should go visit
when you get to England.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.700
But what I want to do today,
rather than just take you

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.870
through some cool finds
from the site where I work,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.640
is to tell you about an
archaeological trench.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.714
And what happens to an
archaeological trench,

00:06:25.714 --> 00:06:26.630
from beginning to end.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.020
And how we are
collaborating with all

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.978
these different people.

00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:32.770
Because in the end, we're
looking for very small things,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.609
but it has to start
much, much, much bigger.

00:06:34.609 --> 00:06:36.650
Has anybody been on an
archaeological excavation?

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.830
Other than [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.650
Excellent.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.500
Three people.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.230
That's really cool.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.590
So I want to talk to you about
that life cycle of the trench.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.747
Yes, question?

00:06:45.747 --> 00:06:47.180
AUDIENCE: I would
expect at least

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.380
to be able to identify
the words here,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.220
but it looks like there's
no vowels or something?

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.990
ELIZABETH GREENE: Right, right.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.760
There are vowels.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.190
What you're looking
at is Latin cursive.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.090
So it is an early--
have you ever

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.880
seen a medieval manuscript?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.080
This is a very, very early
script from the Romans,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.830
from-- when did they
start using this?

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.240
Probably-- when's
our earliest, Alex,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.496
for cursive, Latin cursive?

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:07.912
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
didn't print

00:07:07.912 --> 00:07:09.410
in block capitals like
on an inscription.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.800
ELIZABETH GREENE: Yes.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.300
So on an inscription--
yeah, who's been in a museum

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.969
and seen an inscription?

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:14.760
Lots of you, right.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.060
And you see these nice block
capitals, and, in fact,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.180
we recognize that from
kindergarten as well.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.930
They're writing these
nice block capitals.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.910
This is something totally
different, but it is, in fact,

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.500
Latin.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.150
But it's an interesting story
when they first found these.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.220
The excavator, Robin Birley
who directed the site

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.640
for a very, very long time.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.290
He looked at it and thought
is this a different language?

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.060
What am I looking at?

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.100
But, in fact, when you start
looking at, it's Latin cursive.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.410
We have other media
that have this.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.020
A lot of large,
large kiln sites,

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.979
you'll see orders written out
on ceramics in this cursive.

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:48.520
So we have a lot of
cursive-- Papyri,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.320
we get Latin cursive as well.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.740
It is just difficult to
read, but once you understand

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.990
what it looks like,
it's just Latin.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.130
Cool, huh?

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.290
So I want to start
you understanding

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.410
how going through this site,
and how we start an excavation,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.590
and what we go through,
and then where we end up.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.860
How do we get this data?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.830
What kinds of questions
are we asking?

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.530
So we start-- one
of the other things

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.560
I love about Roman archaeology
or just archaeology in general

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.810
is that really it's big data
put together with small data.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.316
We're looking to
answer big questions,

00:08:18.316 --> 00:08:19.690
but we have to
put together a lot

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.657
of small stuff, a lot
of little bitty stuff.

00:08:21.657 --> 00:08:23.490
What you're looking at
here on Google Earth,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.080
obviously, is an image of
the landscape very, very

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.080
close to Vindolanda.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.312
It's just North of the site.

00:08:30.312 --> 00:08:32.020
The site is very close
to Hadrian's Wall.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.600
So what do you can see here are
a couple of different things.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.049
I think that the things
that are so prominent to me

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.630
are this right here.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.775
You've got something
right here, and you've

00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:44.900
got something-- I think
the most prominent thing is

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.610
this right here.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.950
What you can really see is
the late Carboniferous Period.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.660
You can see the Romans.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.740
And then you can see
the 20th century.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.420
So you can see three
different things.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.180
You're looking at what's called
the Whin Sill Crag right here.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.900
And Hadrian's Wall built
right on top of that.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.260
Hadrian's Wall is this
enormous wall, 15 feet high,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.550
89 feet long, that the emperor
Hadrian built in the 120s.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.690
He needed to consolidate.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.241
He wanted the empire to be sort
of closed off a little bit more

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:14.740
than it was.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.790
He wanted to protect
it from non-Roman land.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.560
So he took the opportunity
with this enormous, literally

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.270
from the Carboniferous
Period, geological formation

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.050
that runs almost across
the whole country,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.475
mostly in the center.

00:09:26.475 --> 00:09:28.600
And he built the great big
wall right on top of it.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.590
So you're seeing the
shadow of that right there.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.006
But, in fact, the other thing
that you see in this picture

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:35.270
is something that was
dug by the Romans.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.910
Now, when I ask
my students this,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.535
what do you think
this is, most of them

00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:41.020
think it's a rail line,
something like that.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.740
Indeed not.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.510
That is an enormous ditch that
was built, dug by the Romans

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.560
in order to protect
Hadrian's Wall,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.850
and in order to protect this
military zone that they created

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:53.940
with Hadrian's Wall.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.520
So when you look
at this, you can

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.640
see the only other most
prominent thing is this right

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.570
here, which is the
20th century quarry.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.830
And really you can only
see it because it's

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:02.710
filled in with water.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.730
But all through the landscape
you have the Romans.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.120
You have this, you have
Hadrian's Wall here,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.360
you have this giant
ditch called the vallum.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.160
And all of these
little bits down here

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.830
are also telling us things
about the Roman Period, in fact.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.440
Those are small marching
camps and little enclosures

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.440
and things like that that
actually, most of them

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.970
date to the Roman Period.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.020
So we take this big
data and we have

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.130
to combine it with these
questions and ask ourselves

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.160
how we're going to come
down onto something else,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.600
since they're final answers.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.308
And the other thing
to point out, though,

00:10:34.308 --> 00:10:37.820
is that we can't get rid
of some of our old data.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.530
We have much more refined stuff
sometimes, even from the 1970s.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.520
So what you're looking at
here is an aerial photograph

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.810
of Vindolanda from somewhere
in the mid '70s when

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.830
they had-- there's two
things that work really

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.390
well for aerial photography.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.020
That is a drought, one thing.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.645
And a little light dusting
of snow is the other thing.

00:10:58.645 --> 00:10:59.900
Because you get nice contrast.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.680
You either get dead
grass during a drought

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.670
where you have
things underneath.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.560
Or a light dusting of snow
gives you really great contrast.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.210
So if we go diving into
the Vindolanda archives,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.990
the archives of the
Vindolanda Trust,

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.940
we find things like
this, which is really

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.640
what I would kind of consider,
though it's showing us

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.270
something large,
sort of a small data.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.739
We don't want to forget about
these old pieces of information

00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:20.280
that we have.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.510
We want to bring this
all together in order

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.035
to decide where it is
that we want to excavate

00:11:25.035 --> 00:11:26.830
to answer some of our questions.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.510
So I'll draw your
attention on this.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.480
You're looking at the fort.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.950
So it's that same fort
as the aerial photography

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.860
that I showed you
before, the green one.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.940
And you've got this structure
right in the middle here.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.567
That was the only
thing excavated back

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:42.900
then, except for some of the
gates and things like that.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.220
I'll draw your attention
into two different areas,

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.560
and that is this right here
to the West of the fort.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.439
And then this area to
the sort of Northwest.

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:53.480
We call that the North
field, and that's actually

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.050
where I'm going to be
concentrating today to show you

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.670
what we've been doing recently
on the excavations there,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.560
and how we're answering
some of our questions.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.100
If you look at Vindolanda
today, what you see

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.520
is that extramural
settlement right there.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.131
That is, in fact, that first
square just to the West

00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:09.880
that I showed you.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.680
So I've shifted you again.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.160
We're facing a
different direction.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.000
We're sort of looking
Northeast now.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.190
But when you look at
all of those lumps

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.770
and bumps in that last image
there, and you say to yourself,

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.570
gee, we may have
something in there.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.680
There might be something
underneath the ground there.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.960
You then do an excavation, and
that is, indeed, what you find.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.720
You have buildings,
and those buildings

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.440
are populated with
all sorts of artifacts

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.273
that are going to tell
us a lot about what's

00:12:34.273 --> 00:12:36.404
happening on this
archaeological site.

00:12:36.404 --> 00:12:37.820
If you walk around
the site today,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.111
this is what it looks like now.

00:12:39.111 --> 00:12:41.530
This is the site
that you will see.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.280
And by the way, it's
a fantastic visit,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.530
if you're in Northern England.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.770
A great place to go.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.930
So I'll draw your attention
back to that field right there.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.470
We also identified in some
of these older pictures,

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.050
and then combining it with
things like Google Earth,

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.490
we've identified
that there might

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.500
be something happening
over there as well.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.930
We've got this large
line going across here.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.310
And in other photographs
we see a nice little corner

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:08.700
right there that we thought
might be the corner of a fort.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.080
OK, so what do we do next?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.420
Nowadays, we will do
some geophysical survey.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.070
Has anybody in the room
ever seen "Time Team?"

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.570
Yeah.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:18.069
Good.

00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:19.070
So a couple of people.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.884
The reason I ask
is because nobody

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.550
used to know what
geophysical survey is.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.470
You guys have
probably heard of it

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.580
in science classes
and things like this.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.600
But nobody used to know.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.141
But now that "Time
Team" is out there

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.310
and everybody can watch
shows about archaeology,

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.320
we have the tourists
that come up to the edge,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.030
and they're very, very educated,
and they say, excuse me,

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.770
have you done your geophysical
survey on this area yet?

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.667
And, of course,
yes, indeed we have.

00:13:39.667 --> 00:13:41.500
But it's really great
that people actually--

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.000
sort of regular
people on the street

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.980
are understanding a lot
of this more often now.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.240
We do geophysical
survey of some sort.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.877
What we have done on the site is
called the magnetometer survey.

00:13:51.877 --> 00:13:53.960
You could also do resistivity,
you could do ground

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.860
penetrating radar, which
all measure different things

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.080
in the subsoil.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.950
What the magnetometer
survey's doing

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.800
is measuring the magnetic field.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.350
It's basically giving you
anomalies, positive and

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.930
negative anomalies, based
on the magnetic field below.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.397
So it's not exactly
like 3D vision,

00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:11.980
but it's telling us
what's down there.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.720
It sometimes works very well.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.690
It sometimes doesn't
work very well.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.670
You're looking at a
grayscale plot, which

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.350
doesn't do very much
for us right now.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.130
What that needs to do is
be rendered and interpreted

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.220
into something more.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.770
So what you have is
negative anomalies--

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.310
all of these little
gray bits here.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.930
These are negative anomalies.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.154
And those are usually stone
buildings, things like this.

00:14:35.154 --> 00:14:36.570
And by the way, I
should point out

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.510
that this isn't something--
we don't pull out

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.450
our own magnetometer survey.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.110
This is one of those
collaborations.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.720
We have a team come
in, do the survey.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.760
We use right here TimeScape
archaeological surveys

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.890
in Northern England.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.940
They do the survey,
they put this together.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.130
So this is one of
those instances where

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.160
I get to talk to all sorts
of interesting people

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.200
and walk along the
field with them

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.460
and talk to them about
what they're doing.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.790
And then they send me
this material back.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.000
We also have positive anomalies,
just to get back to this.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.050
Those are those dark ones there.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.450
Some positive,
though, rather vague,

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.130
which are these
sort of dotted ones.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.504
And what I'll draw
your attention

00:15:11.504 --> 00:15:15.700
to is this right here, and some
of these very, very strong--

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.720
they're called
bipolar, or they're

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.300
very magnetic
reactions that we get.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.900
And this is, in
fact, something we

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.600
were interested in right here.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.370
And you can even really see
that well on the grayscale plot

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.590
as well.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.440
So what we've got
here is an idea

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.530
of what is underneath
the ground.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.690
We want to know if we're
looking at potentially ditches,

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.564
if we're looking
at stone buildings.

00:15:38.564 --> 00:15:41.230
It's worth pointing out, though,
that this does not always work,

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.010
because I have, myself,
excavated several stone

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.220
buildings in that field
that didn't turn up

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.330
on any of these plots.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.310
Now, ours is about 10
years old at this point.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.250
And this summer we're
going to do more GPR

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.650
or more geophysics of some sort.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.780
And this is the sort of thing
that is changing all the time

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.530
and becoming better
and better and better.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.680
So we will do more
of this later.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.782
I will also say,
though, so like I said,

00:16:05.782 --> 00:16:07.490
we can't forget about
the old techniques.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.790
We also will marry this
and get more information.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.160
We'll put all of this together
to get information off

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.990
of a classic earthwork survey.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.730
So this is in 2010, I
believe this one was done,

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.450
and that will be done
it with a total station.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.865
So they're out there, they're
surveying-- proper survey.

00:16:23.865 --> 00:16:25.490
You guys have seen
the road work crews.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.049
They were out there with
total stations and such.

00:16:28.049 --> 00:16:30.340
But I should say that this
is the same exact thing that

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.100
could have been done 50
years ago with a dumpy level,

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.695
and it's almost the
same exact thing.

00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:36.780
It wouldn't have been as
precise, by any means.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.124
It's almost the same exact
thing that William Roy

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:40.790
could have been out
there 200 years ago.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.180
He's the guy that started up
the idea of the Ordnance Survey

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.100
in England with a
theodolite-- that long ago.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.910
And it's worth noting that the
Romans were doing very, very

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.240
similar things with
a groma, a tool

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.326
called the groma where
they just-- that's

00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:55.700
how they got those
straight lines

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.825
and those straight ditches.

00:16:56.825 --> 00:16:58.480
And they knew how
to survey as well.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.030
So really, really interesting.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.870
But we have to remember
that these things, this kind

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.660
of information is giving
us really great data as

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.160
well, because it's
telling us what's

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.490
happening on the surface.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.339
Which could very
much have everything

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.480
to do with what's
happening down below.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.109
So kind of return yourself
to your fourth grade learning

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.220
how to read like a topo map.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.780
These are telling us that this
is a very-- these little arrow

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.359
things are telling us that
there's a very steep hill right

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:23.930
here.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.540
And what we came up with was
this really nice corner here

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.250
that looks like something
we're quite interested in.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.486
Back in 2010 we had dropped
a trench right here,

00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:34.110
and you can just see
the outline of it.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.760
And we got the very, very
corner of this red feature.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.190
These are fort ditches.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.872
They're defensive ditches.

00:17:40.872 --> 00:17:43.330
And we realized that if we have
defensive ditches out here,

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.540
then we probably also
have a fort out there.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.420
So what we're looking
at is potentially

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.150
some of the earliest buildings
on site, some of the earliest

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.100
occupation on this
site, which might really

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.820
change the way we
see the frontiers.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.530
Like you're kind
of wondering well,

00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.696
what's the big picture here?

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:00.790
What are we looking for?

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.730
This might change
the way we actually

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.520
view the frontier at
this point in time,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.481
because if we have occupation
here 10 or 15 years earlier,

00:18:07.481 --> 00:18:09.230
that might really make
a difference in how

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.910
we see the occupation
by the Romans

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.830
and the consolidation
of this frontier.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.840
So we use our classic
earthwork survey as well.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.850
Now, I threw this in here
because a lot of people ask us,

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.456
why do we not use
metal detectors?

00:18:22.456 --> 00:18:24.580
Why are we not just out
there with metal detectors?

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.700
And there's a couple
of reasons why

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.010
we don't use metal detectors.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.320
One, this is a UNESCO
World Heritage site.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.540
It is a scheduled, or I
should say scheduled monument

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.870
in England.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:39.517
And on sites like this, you
cannot have metal detectors.

00:18:39.517 --> 00:18:40.350
They're not allowed.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.130
They're illegal on site.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.252
Now, we could probably
put in a permit,

00:18:44.252 --> 00:18:46.460
we could ask for a permit
from English Heritage who's

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.290
the overseeing government,
overseeing body,

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.440
and we could use the metal
detector if we wanted.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.400
But what we like to
do with-- we want

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.200
to put out a vision
to the public

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.730
that metal detectors are
not necessary for us.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.330
And one of those reasons is
that when people go out there

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.080
with metal detectors
and they just do this

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.880
and then they find
something and they dig down,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.100
they pull something right out
of its archaeological context.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.340
Whether you go down a foot
or you go down three feet,

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.960
you pull it right out,
and we have no information

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.750
about what's behind this,
around, underneath, above.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.460
Nothing about the context,
the stratigraphic unit,

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.530
I should say, of this artifact.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.970
So that's a very big problem.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.174
But also, it is
prioritizing metal.

00:19:28.174 --> 00:19:30.590
Before we looked at some really
interesting leather shoes.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.940
They were telling
us about the kinds

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.640
of people that are
living here on site.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.604
We looked at wooden
writing tablets.

00:19:35.604 --> 00:19:38.020
They're telling us a lot of
information about what they're

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.395
doing on site, who they are,
what they're thinking about,

00:19:40.395 --> 00:19:42.160
what they're working on.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.380
None of those will be found
with a metal detector.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.580
So we really have to remember
that archaeology is bringing

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.760
lots of information
together, none

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.240
of which can be done with just
sort of one piece of equipment.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.970
And metal detectors really
just don't do anything for us

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:56.970
in that sense.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.120
So a lot of people
ask me that, so I

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.370
wanted to put in a little bit.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.206
So all right, how
do we pick our spot?

00:20:02.206 --> 00:20:03.580
We're going to go
in there, we're

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.880
going to excavate,
what do we do now?

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.030
I ask you to look at that area
right there on the magnetometer

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:10.730
survey.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.590
And, in fact, that is where
we decided to start digging,

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.820
because we had questions.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.630
There was a potential that this
might be a kiln, because this

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.910
is one of those bipolar,
one of those intensely

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.410
magnetic, as you can
see in the key there,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.670
one of those intensely
magnetic anomalies.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.930
And those are often
associated with kilns,

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.460
with a very high ferrous--
of burnt material that you

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.070
find around kilns.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.310
So we decided to go
right into that spot,

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.140
and as you can see there,
we started the trench.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:41.267
We peeled away the ground
surface, the plow zone we often

00:20:41.267 --> 00:20:43.100
call it, because this
area has been affected

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.300
by agricultural working
for hundreds of years.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.150
That was the trend in 2012.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.380
And we also dropped a trench
very nearby in 2013 and '14.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:57.790
We get in there pretty quickly,
peel off all of that top level,

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.310
and what are we looking for?

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.940
Basically, archaeology, when
you are just starting out,

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.822
you're looking for
changes in the soil.

00:21:05.822 --> 00:21:07.530
And some of you might
be able to make out

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:12.204
that right through here, we
have a sort of dark curve right

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:12.870
in through here.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:17.330
We have a dark kind of splat we
can call it maybe right here.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.010
We have a slightly
lighter area right here.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.900
And then also just
over a here we

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.436
have something
that's bright orange.

00:21:23.436 --> 00:21:24.810
I'll draw your
attention to that.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.393
And in case you can't see any
of that, I've circled it for you

00:21:27.393 --> 00:21:28.657
and made squares.

00:21:28.657 --> 00:21:31.115
Now one of the other problems
with the magnetometer survey,

00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:33.170
and again, how I'm
saying that we really

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.080
have to bring together
different techniques.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.200
We can't just use
sort of our science

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.865
and say, OK, let's just
peek under the ground

00:21:40.865 --> 00:21:41.990
and we'll see what's there.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.135
Because that's not telling
us the whole story.

00:21:44.135 --> 00:21:45.510
And in fact, it's
not even really

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.800
telling us 50% of the story.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.100
Because what is giving
us our readings?

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.670
And we have no idea if those
readings are from the Roman

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.260
Period, or I could
go all the way back

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.650
to the Bronze Age
for that matter,

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.941
whether they're from the Iron
Age, or the Roman Period,

00:21:59.941 --> 00:22:01.980
or the Medieval Period,
or the Victorian Period,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.920
or for that matter,
50 years ago.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.435
And indeed, this little--
actually quite large

00:22:07.435 --> 00:22:10.580
and quite an annoyance
inside of my trench-- this

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.060
is a very, very large
Victorian drain.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.400
So this field was used
in the 19th century

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.560
for grazing animals.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.320
Very wet, very mucky.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.439
And they did all sort of things
to attempt to drain that field.

00:22:24.439 --> 00:22:25.855
And that is, indeed,
with that is.

00:22:25.855 --> 00:22:29.390
That is a drain that I
will record, of course,

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.410
and take a look at.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.630
But we kind of want to go
through pretty quickly.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:34.610
It was very much in the way.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.776
It's still running, in fact.

00:22:35.776 --> 00:22:37.010
Still works quite well.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.960
This over here turned out to
be a pit, a Roman Period pit.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.640
So you can have things
of different time periods

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.920
right next to each other.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.600
This is also a Roman Period pit.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.110
But I'll draw your attention
into this red square right

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.860
here, and that orange little
kind of rectilinear feature

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.600
right there.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.020
Hopefully it's coming
up on the screen.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.527
In the interest
of time, I'm just

00:22:58.527 --> 00:23:00.193
going to show you
exactly what that was.

00:23:00.193 --> 00:23:00.693
Boom.

00:23:00.693 --> 00:23:02.730
That was a kiln.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.140
So once we excavated
from top down to bottom,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.980
we do this what we
call stratographically.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.060
We dig down in
stratigraphic units,

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.900
recording each one
as we go, so we

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.570
understand how the
archaeological site was built

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.970
up, and then, therefore,
how we're essentially

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.000
pulling it down.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.974
Because archaeology
ultimately is destructive.

00:23:20.974 --> 00:23:22.390
We have to record
it in such a way

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.014
because we're not
going to get it back,

00:23:24.014 --> 00:23:26.190
once we excavate everything.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.090
So you're looking at what
turned out to be a kiln.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:34.290
Now, one thing I'll point out
is that the very first inkling

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.530
of this kiln being here
was just that over there.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.030
That is that little
orange rectilinear area.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.820
And what we end up with,
once we excavate everything

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.320
from 2012-- well, actually,
this is the 2013, '14 trench.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.880
After two years we end up with
this enormous kiln foundation

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.020
right here, and a
secondary kiln over here.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.290
So this is a really
large complex

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.060
where they were
making brick, tile.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.561
The material that
came out suggested

00:24:02.561 --> 00:24:03.810
they're making brick and tile.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.360
But then we found
material suggesting

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.300
they're making
quite nicer things.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.002
There was a mold for
maybe a small figurine

00:24:10.002 --> 00:24:11.710
type of thing or
something that was maybe

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:16.450
put onto a vessel of some sort.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.450
And we also found pottery,
what we call pottery wasters.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.240
We found the
offshoots, basically,

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.905
the remnants of pottery that
misfired or something like that

00:24:26.905 --> 00:24:28.780
and they'd just chuck
it off into the ground.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.210
So really interesting
stuff coming out of here.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.510
But this leaves us with
a number of questions.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.080
When we find a
feature like this,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.020
we're wondering a
whole number of things.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.990
One, I'm always going back
to the magnetometer survey

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.300
and I'm saying, OK, that really
did not-- that whole thing is

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.910
there, but there's no
indication what any of that is.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.850
So just another
reminder that we still

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.680
need to always get out
there with our trowels,

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.650
with our spades, and excavate
these areas that we thought

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.032
looked interesting on
the magnetometer survey.

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:02.490
So some of the
questions that we're

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.810
asking once we find
a feature like this

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.580
is when was the complex
active, we'd like to know.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.960
We want to know what
was produced here.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.934
We want to know how it
was produced, what kind

00:25:11.934 --> 00:25:13.100
of production they're using.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.450
We want to know where these
final products were used.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.116
So one of the big
questions we're always

00:25:17.116 --> 00:25:19.520
asking in archaeology what
is the scope of this site?

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.480
Do we have this
material moving just

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.060
onto the main site
of Vindolanda?

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.550
it moving out onto the frontier?

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.310
Is it moving out
of Britain, even?

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.360
We want to know all
of these things.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:36.250
And then how much impact
did this site actually

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.526
have on its surroundings?

00:25:38.526 --> 00:25:40.150
So the first couple
of things are easy,

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.710
and you guys have probably all
heard of radiocarbon dating.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.430
We now combine radiocarbon with
accelerated mass spectrometry

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:47.980
dating, as well.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.670
And the great thing about that,
with traditional radiocarbon

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.820
dating you need quite a
large sample of carbon,

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.680
of some sort of burnt material.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.780
With AMS dating, you really
only need a very small amount,

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.040
maybe even one gram I think they
can get some information from.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.810
So that's really useful.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:08.930
However, there are problems
with any kind of C14.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.280
And that is that we get
these windows with Carbon-14

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.450
that could be as
large as mine was.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:20.110
80 AD to 230 AD.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.610
And, in fact, that
is-- Kate knows--

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.800
that is almost the
lifespan of the site.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.130
We know these Roman Periods.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.870
We know that the
place is occupied

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.810
well into the fifth
and sixth centuries.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.280
But in terms of sort of
intense Roman activity,

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.760
that, right now, we have
started at about 85.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.070
If we can push the
date of the site

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.799
back a little bit
or up a little bit,

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:43.590
really, into the '70s,
that would be handy.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.280
But 80 doesn't give me too
much great information,

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.950
and then all the way to 230.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.980
And the probabilities go down,
down, down, down, down, down,

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.610
down, if you want
to hem that in.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.901
So you can say, well, it
might have dated to about 160,

00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:58.420
but that's only with
a 60% probability.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.315
So that's a bit of a
shame with radiocarbon.

00:27:00.315 --> 00:27:02.360
That's why we don't
actually use it very much.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.740
Radiocarbon goes
back 50,000 years.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.832
It's good for things
that are 5,000

00:27:07.832 --> 00:27:10.070
and 10,000 and more years old.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.500
But when you're in a very
historical period where,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.410
in fact, you have the
potential to find things that

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:19.610
say this stone was carved in
113 AD in the month of October.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.150
It doesn't really help
you out quite as much.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.017
Now, we don't have any
precise dating like that yet.

00:27:25.017 --> 00:27:27.350
We don't have any inscriptions
from our little kiln area

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.180
out there.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.340
But we will at some point.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.860
So there are a few
problems there.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.240
There's some very cool
stuff, though, going on.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.260
There is this thing
called archeomagnetic

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.790
dating that you can do in
something like a kiln that

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.120
has been burnt, had been fired
over and over and over and over

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:43.740
again.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.840
And this takes the
magnetic direction

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.940
of the soil when
it was last fired.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.980
So it could actually tell us
not when it began to be used,

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.360
when it was first used,
but when it was last fired.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.940
You take these
samples of the soil.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.200
You have to mark the
true North on it.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.850
And then you send
it off to a lab--

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.330
so again, this is not
something that I personally

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.450
walk into the next room
and start looking at.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:10.460
You send it off to the lab that
works on archeomagnetic dating,

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.510
and they could give you a
fairly reasonable time span.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.480
Sometimes, if you're lucky,
same with dendochronological

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.390
dating-- do you guys know dendo
where you read the time rings,

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.470
or those tree rings rather?

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.290
You hope you have a
good sample, and it's

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.720
going to tell you
where magnetic,

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.380
where the Earth's magnetism
was at the time of last firing.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.880
Now, one problem for England.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.350
We don't actually have
the baseline data yet,

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.899
that you need to have
these curves where

00:28:37.899 --> 00:28:40.190
you have all the baseline
data and then you plug it in.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:41.890
So very much like
dendrochronological

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:43.750
dating where you are
plugging your tree ring

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.870
sequence into known sequences.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:49.424
We don't have the data yet
fully for Northern England,

00:28:49.424 --> 00:28:50.340
or for England at all.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.250
So they're building it
up, and actually we're

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.030
hoping to be a part of that
with this kind of dating.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.660
But the best ones,
the best baseline data

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.062
is for the Southwest
in the states,

00:29:00.062 --> 00:29:02.520
Southeast in the states, and
actually in the mid-continent.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.597
So all entirely
within the states.

00:29:04.597 --> 00:29:07.180
So it's getting there, though,
and that's one of those things,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.680
it was developed, I
think, in about 1992.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.050
Takes a couple of decades
to really get this going.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.200
So we're not quite
there yet for our kiln,

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.700
but hopefully we
can be a part of it

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.700
and we might be able to
get something off of it.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:22.340
We might be able to get a
fairly decent date off of that.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.210
So what and where?

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.380
The questions that we ask
that are really more, I'd say,

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.830
the cultural side
of me is saying,

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.430
oh, how are we going to
discover what and where?

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.686
What is being produced
there and where is it going?

00:29:33.686 --> 00:29:35.560
This is something that
I really want to know.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.570
So how do we analyze ceramics
from kiln production.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.250
We do a couple of
different things.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.070
Throughout the
excavation you find

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.360
any number of bits of ceramic.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.410
You're looking here at the mouth
of a large jug of some sort.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.160
You're looking at some
of the body shards,

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.618
but then also around
here there are

00:29:52.618 --> 00:29:55.040
bits of brick, tile, all sorts.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.250
And what we end up
with, really-- anyone

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.770
who's been on an excavation
will remember this-- you end up

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.360
with gobs and gobs
and gobs of pottery.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.540
Bag and bags and bags.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.012
And they're all labeled
with the right context,

00:30:06.012 --> 00:30:08.220
so you've got all these
different numbers everywhere.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.980
And you then take
all this and you

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.260
analyze what the
pottery is made out of.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.070
How many do you have of
this type and that type.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.760
And they all, if you've got
a nice sequence of styles,

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.950
then it's going to
tell you a rough date,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.997
a sort of seriated date
for that type of pottery.

00:30:24.997 --> 00:30:26.580
But what we can do
here with the kiln,

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.780
because what we
really want to know,

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.654
we want to create baseline
data with the kiln

00:30:29.654 --> 00:30:31.460
to know what is
being produced there.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:37.880
So we pull out what we know is
called a waster from this kiln.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.870
So like I said before,
you get all of these--

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.860
these are basically
factory seconds.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.650
So if you go to a
pottery today, you've

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:46.390
got a shelf that has all this
sort of junkie stuff that

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.044
was misfired or something
and you can buy it for $1.

00:30:49.044 --> 00:30:50.210
They don't have the shelves.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.918
They just chuck them
off into these pits.

00:30:51.918 --> 00:30:56.200
So around a kiln we find
a series of large pits.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.290
They're full of ash, full of the
refuse from ceramic production,

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.450
from the kiln.

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.970
And then also a whole
bunch of bad pots

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.680
and bad tiles, bad bricks.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.710
So what you get are
things that have,

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.665
let's say, an uneven
surface-- excuse me,

00:31:10.665 --> 00:31:13.290
an uneven surface that would not
have been good for walking on,

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.440
for actually using.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.380
Maybe a pot that was
misfired so it wasn't fired

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.190
to a high enough temperature,
so it's very friable.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.720
Or something that maybe sunk in.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.126
So you find these,
and we can use these

00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:25.500
for-- these are
really nice, too,

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.499
because we don't want to
put them in the museum.

00:31:27.499 --> 00:31:29.960
So if somebody wants to take
them and cut them up and put

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.594
them through mass
spec or do whatever,

00:31:31.594 --> 00:31:32.760
then that's quite all right.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.060
So we send these off
and we do something

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.266
called ceramic petrography.

00:31:36.266 --> 00:31:38.140
It's sometimes also
called ceramic petrology.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.079
Either one.

00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:40.370
And we get these thin sections.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.000
Now again, this is
a technique that's

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.640
been around for quite a while.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.134
Now, I don't have my thin
sections yet from 2014,

00:31:47.134 --> 00:31:48.550
so what you're
actually staring at

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.600
is a lunar thin section, just
so that I didn't confuse you

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.800
with any earthly stone.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.064
This is from the moon.

00:31:56.064 --> 00:31:57.230
Yeah, it's pretty, isn't it?

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:00.100
So what it's doing is once it
gets a very, very-- you get

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.500
a very thin section of
the stone or the ceramic

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.000
or whatever it is
you're looking at.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.770
It goes onto a slide.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.000
You look at it under
the microscope.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.850
And you can see exactly what is
making up that local geology,

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:14.930
that local clay.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.380
So we also will test
the local ground clay

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.040
and see if they're using
that local ground clay.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.600
And then you get
baseline data as to what

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.000
your local production
looks like.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.290
And then what we need to do is
convince everybody around us,

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.160
convince all these
other sites, OK,

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.580
what we'd really like is
for you to give us samples

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.119
so that we can understand
if our material's going over

00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:38.660
to your site, going
over to Corbridge

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.220
or down the road to the
other military forts.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.590
If we can convince a lot of
people, then we can say, great.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.470
Maybe we can see if our material
is going off of the island

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:48.840
or is it going down to London.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.673
Something like this.

00:32:49.673 --> 00:32:52.840
So it's really interesting
questions that could be asked.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.859
And we do all this through
sort of simple things

00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:55.900
like ceramic petrography.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.662
Yeah?

00:32:56.662 --> 00:32:58.495
AUDIENCE: It seems you
can do a little math,

00:32:58.495 --> 00:33:01.184
you'd probably know how many
bricks they produce an hour.

00:33:01.184 --> 00:33:02.100
ELIZABETH GREENE: Yes.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:02.600
Yes.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.150
Actually, in fact,
this afternoon I'm

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:07.200
meeting with a colleague in New
York who does a lot of that.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.310
She's over at the New York--
I think-- New York's-- anyway.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.990
I won't mess that up.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.490
Yes.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.406
So a lot of people do.

00:33:16.406 --> 00:33:19.790
You can count the-- you
look at the size of it,

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.816
you can figure out how
many fires have occurred.

00:33:22.816 --> 00:33:24.190
If it's been
excavated correctly,

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.110
so all these pits that
we're talking about.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.443
And then you can figure out
how many have been in there.

00:33:28.443 --> 00:33:30.530
Now, there's always a
variable because we're not

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.890
going to know exactly how
many times it was fired.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.290
But yeah, you can
do that for sure.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.820
If I were here
tomorrow after her,

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.830
I'd probably sound much
more intelligent on that.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.240
So we do this also in
conjunction with other things.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.750
We use mass
spectrometry as well.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.480
Mass spec, I will say,
is way more expensive.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.280
So an archaeological
budget is not huge,

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.480
unless you're a site like
Catal Huyuk or something

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.010
that has a lot of interest
from other people,

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.310
or sort of Herculaneum.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.350
The Villa of the Papyri.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.808
Hewlett Packard
gives tons of money

00:33:58.808 --> 00:34:00.130
to the Villa of the Papyri.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.770
That would be fantastic, but
mass spec costs a lot of money.

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:06.660
But if you use your
budget correctly

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.020
and you get a few key samples,
because, of course, what

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.770
mass spec is doing is giving you
the exact chemical composition.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.960
So that's just going to give you
a little bit more information.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.270
But again, bringing some
of these older techniques

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.190
in with the newer ones
is always something

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.929
that I really like
about archaeology.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:26.900
You can't forget about the older
stuff together with the newer.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.120
We also have obligations
to the future.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.199
So we need to record this site,
and what you're looking at here

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:36.570
is a really-- you might be
thinking, wow, paper and pen.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.920
But what we start with
out there in the field

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.855
is a piece of paper called
a context sheet that

00:34:42.855 --> 00:34:46.781
is going to tell us everything
about the stratigraphic unit

00:34:46.781 --> 00:34:47.739
that we just excavated.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.210
Tell us about that soil.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.159
Tell us about that area exactly.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:55.290
Everything from what
units are around it,

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.740
to what the soil
actually looked like.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.750
Was it clay?

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.295
Was it full of stone?

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.380
We even talk about what kind
of weather was out there.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.540
That top right corner.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.340
And that's because
we want to know

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.610
whether the excavator
would have been

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.650
able to see the soil correctly.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.630
If it was too wet, if it
was too dry, if the sun--

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.440
the most basic things can
throw you off in archaeology

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.010
sometimes.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.560
If it's very, very sunny and
hot, the soil just gets baked

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.480
and you can't actually
see the soil changes,

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.980
and you're really
hoping for rain.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.460
And then you do because
you're in Northern England.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.160
It rains, and you
get too much rain,

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.130
and then you've got
water everywhere.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:33.370
So there are really
basic things that

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.180
can throw you off a little bit.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.300
But what we're striving for is
a complete record of the site

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.750
so that when somebody looks at
this in 10 or 20 or 50 years,

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.040
they can understand exactly
what it was that we did.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.540
So we start with
this context sheet.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.030
We have just rough sketches
of what's happening.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.060
And what's really happening
behind the scenes,

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:54.350
so there's people running
around with various tools.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.900
What you've got here
is a total station,

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.249
and that's how we get the plan.

00:35:58.249 --> 00:36:00.290
So I'm sure many of you
have seen a total station

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:01.610
or used a total station.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.160
We get the plan of the site.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.240
So we need to leave these
basic records of what

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.390
the building looked like,
where exactly it was.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:13.610
This is going to be tied
in precisely with the site,

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.610
with the rest of the site,
with the trig points.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.401
And luckily enough,
since we're in England,

00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:20.377
we also know exactly where
we are meters above sea level

00:36:20.377 --> 00:36:22.460
because we've got the
Ordnance Survey trig points,

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.880
so that's really handy as well.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.338
And we can see one,
actually, right

00:36:25.338 --> 00:36:27.160
on top of this hill
that's quite nearby.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:32.750
So it's very handy to work
in a place like England.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.730
So we build plans.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.240
We have full plans of the site.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.402
We also draw sections.

00:36:37.402 --> 00:36:38.860
Now, what's really
cool, though, is

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.190
that this stuff is becoming
much, much easier now.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:47.340
Because we can do things
like just take a photograph

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.560
and put it into Illustrator, or
put it into any kind of program

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.580
now, and create our site
plans, and create our profiles.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.820
So what you're looking
at here is a record

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.170
of exactly what the
profile of the trench

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.157
looks like of what we excavated,
what kind of material.

00:37:03.157 --> 00:37:04.740
The one that would
go into publication

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.470
would have the contact
numbers on there

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:11.190
so we would know
exactly what you have.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.680
You see these little
dashed lines right here.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.290
Those are marking the
breaks in the context.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.640
So this just tells
us exactly where

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.960
each one of these
contexts lay and how

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.140
we removed it from the site.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.380
So these are the basic
records that we leave.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.130
Lately, we've been coming up
with a lot more interesting

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.090
things that we
can do with stuff.

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:34.000
One is this 3D photo
modeling, which

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.840
is becoming really,
really handy.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.980
And that's because it leaves
us with a vision of exactly

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.450
what these features look like,
exactly what the trench looked

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:43.950
like.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.790
Because one thing that a lot
of people don't think about

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.640
is that this trench
is located out

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.700
in the middle of
a farmer's field,

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.060
and we have to backfill that.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.226
So actually, I think that
it's backfilled right now.

00:37:55.226 --> 00:37:56.630
I think that last
week the farmer

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.410
came out and backfilled it.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.780
And one thing is that
you can't leave kind

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.780
of like a swimming pool.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.125
You can't leave a big
giant hole in the ground.

00:38:04.125 --> 00:38:05.464
They don't like that.

00:38:05.464 --> 00:38:06.380
It's actually illegal.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.430
It's an English heritage.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:09.430
It's a rule.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:12.134
It's a law that you have to
fill these things back in,

00:38:12.134 --> 00:38:13.800
unless you're going
to consolidate them.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.574
You can't leave these
large trench edges

00:38:15.574 --> 00:38:17.740
if people are going to be
walking through the field.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.198
And as you know in
England, there's

00:38:19.198 --> 00:38:23.310
lots of public right
of ways, access.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.650
What do they call
it, right to Rome.

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.884
Which is great, fantastic.

00:38:26.884 --> 00:38:29.050
But you can't leave these
giant holes in the ground.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.766
So it has to be recorded
to such a degree

00:38:31.766 --> 00:38:33.390
that you would be
able to return to it.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.380
So what's been really
great lately with 3D

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.630
photo modeling is that we
can take an image of this

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:44.140
exactly as it looked, and we
can manipulate-- it's also

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.330
really good for online
journals and things as well.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.650
And we can manipulate it
to be able to see anything,

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:52.596
even looking underneath to see
exactly how much soil we took

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:53.970
out, if we're
interested in that.

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:55.620
I'm not so interested in that.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.140
But it's really just a
fantastic way of seeing

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.280
exactly what the details.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.140
Now, what you're looking at here
is really a basic-- this is,

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.980
I believe we used
Agisoft to start with.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.680
This is actually a
pretty basic-- sorry,

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.770
let me come out again--
a pretty basic program.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.290
We haven't done our sort of
full scale program yet on here.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:18.340
But you can see how
useful this really

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.310
is to be able to get a
vision of exactly how we

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.300
left this feature.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.549
So we take a million
still photographs as well.

00:39:25.549 --> 00:39:27.090
But if we ever wanted
to return to it

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:28.673
and say, right, how
did we leave that,

00:39:28.673 --> 00:39:30.930
we have that right
here in front of us.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.550
It's also very handy
for the entire trench.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:36.590
So at the end now,
what we do is have

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.220
this guy called-- he's
from the Aerial-Cam

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.500
I think his company is called.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.550
And he comes along in
the middle of the season

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.580
and at the end of
every season and he

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.000
photographs the entire site.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
All of our trenches,
everything that we've done,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.860
and he will do now 3D
models for us as well.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.570
So we can see-- this doesn't
look like much right here,

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:57.760
but this is one of these
very important ditches that's

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.040
going to date
possibly-- we think

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.345
it dates to an earlier period.

00:40:02.345 --> 00:40:04.720
And we're hoping that the
evidence that comes out of here

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.010
will push the site
back a little bit

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.260
and be a part of
an earlier frontier

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.210
that we didn't know we
were a part of before.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.000
So that would be
really fantastic.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.997
But if there's any
question later on,

00:40:14.997 --> 00:40:17.330
if we're saying to ourselves,
OK, how did we leave that?

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:18.460
What did that look like?

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.990
Because you think on August
5 when you leave the site

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.980
you're going to
remember everything,

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:22.980
but of course you don't.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.720
And so we have these fantastic
records of it right now.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.970
And this is all
really just getting

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.360
better and better and better.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.910
We're not going to be out
there with a total station

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.390
at some point.

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:33.110
We're just going to
be out there with GPS

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:36.710
and we need it to be to the
centimeter is the issue.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.670
But these things are changing
and becoming far more

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.187
interesting over the
next couple of years,

00:40:42.187 --> 00:40:43.520
over the next couple of decades.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.050
I can't even imagine where
we're going to be in 20 years.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.730
So it's really fantastic.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:53.934
Also, what's really handy
for us is these quadcopters.

00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:55.350
I kind of want to
call it a drone,

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.400
but I'm not going to call it
a drone, little quadcopter.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.440
These can cruise around,
so archaeologists

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.960
are using this to really be
able to get up above the site.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.844
Now, the other thing though,
it's not that terrible

00:41:06.844 --> 00:41:09.260
if you've got a nice angled
photograph, because these days

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.317
we can just use angle
recognition software.

00:41:12.317 --> 00:41:14.150
Now, of course, the
problem with archaeology

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.191
is always affording this.

00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:17.330
But you can get a
angled image and then

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:19.919
you can always just rectify it
and be looking straight down.

00:41:19.919 --> 00:41:21.460
But you can also go
out there and get

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.670
a quadcopter and a GoPro, and
you can go right over your site

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:29.050
and you get beautiful
aerial shots of everything

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:32.210
that you've just excavated.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:36.119
Really great PR pictures
as well for marketing.

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:38.160
And what you get, when
you're down on the ground,

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.160
you really sometimes can't see
the forest through the trees.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.260
It's really difficult
down there to actually see

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.220
what's going on.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.790
When you hover up
above it, and this

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:48.290
is actually not
from the quadcopter.

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:49.748
This picture that
you're looking at

00:41:49.748 --> 00:41:51.670
is just simply
from a 40 foot pole

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:55.350
that our guy Adam Stanford
of Aerial-Cam uses.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.870
Goes up, takes the shot, and
this is what it looks like.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:01.120
But you really just get this
much, much greater sense

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.360
of what the whole
site looks like,

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.800
of the rectilinear structures,
of exactly what's going on

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.800
in this trench that we dug.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.130
This is one from
inside of the fort.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:14.240
A couple of years ago we
did that from about 2009

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.370
to '12, around there.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.120
So some really interesting
stuff going on.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.230
Now, at the same rate, though,
the guy who has the quadcopter,

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:24.575
he also has a kite that he sends
up there with his camera on it,

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:25.524
and he's got a remote.

00:42:25.524 --> 00:42:27.190
So there's all sorts
of ways, of course.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:29.730
It can get really
windy here on the site.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.260
There's not many
trees around, so it

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.580
can be really problematic.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.424
But the quadcopter's
really a cool thing

00:42:35.424 --> 00:42:36.840
that archaeologists
just generally

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.899
are using around various areas.

00:42:39.899 --> 00:42:41.690
But I'm just going to
leave you with saying

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.090
that these things are
all really interesting

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.220
and they give us so much
information, but none of that

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.870
is ever going to find a
Vindolanda writing tablet.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:53.540
So that's why I make this
real point that we really

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.820
do need to use
these new techniques

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.360
with our old proven ways.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.530
Excavating, I don't think is
going to be actually getting

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.460
out there with your
trowel and your spade.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.590
Never going to be
superseded I don't think.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:07.660
Plus, it's a lot of fun.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.640
You get to make mud
patties, wheelbarrows.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.490
There's nothing better than
that fresh air all day.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.440
So all of this is fantastic.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.260
We get so much information,
and really it's

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.960
just growing exponentially all
the time with archaeology now.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.550
But we still need
to get down there.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:25.925
We need to get
dirty, and we need

00:43:25.925 --> 00:43:28.470
to find more Vindolanda writing
tablets and similar things

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:29.490
like that.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:32.510
So that is, I think, where
I'm going to leave you.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:35.405
Yes.

00:43:35.405 --> 00:43:39.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.514
Thank you.

00:43:41.514 --> 00:43:42.680
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.135
When you were showing the--

00:43:44.135 --> 00:43:46.490
ELIZABETH GREENE: Oh, do you
want the-- is it up here?

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.556
Oh, right.

00:43:47.556 --> 00:43:49.972
AUDIENCE: When you were showing
the magneto scans earlier,

00:43:49.972 --> 00:43:56.350
you said that sometimes you
will find stone stuff that

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:57.555
didn't show up on the scan.

00:43:57.555 --> 00:43:58.596
ELIZABETH GREENE: Um-hmm.

00:43:58.596 --> 00:44:00.364
AUDIENCE: Does the
other way happen too?

00:44:00.364 --> 00:44:01.610
That some of you see
things on the scan

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:02.660
and there's nothing there?

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.201
ELIZABETH GREENE:
Well-- yeah, that's

00:44:04.201 --> 00:44:07.560
a really, really good
question, because yes, indeed.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.600
So like I said, we don't always
find the stone structures

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.390
that are there.

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:15.559
But that's also because
your ground soil matters.

00:44:15.559 --> 00:44:17.850
It's very important what's
happening in the ground soil

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:21.520
because-- and also, then,
what technique you choose.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.610
So what we're going
to do this summer,

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:25.610
we're still looking at
all of our possibilities.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.485
But we probably won't
maybe use magnetometer.

00:44:27.485 --> 00:44:29.990
We might use something
else just because it's

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:32.210
going to give you
different readings.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.590
What happens is not so much
that there's nothing there,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.480
but it's not quite
what you expected.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.970
So you might get
a massive anomaly.

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:40.670
There is-- iron does
just sort of cluster.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.556
It leaches and
clusters in the soil.

00:44:42.556 --> 00:44:43.930
It could just be
naturally there.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:48.120
And one time we did find
just this mass of-- you

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.220
can't get through it.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.900
This massive clump
of iron that was just

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.780
a natural occurrence
in the soil.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.560
Also, you'll notice-- see
all of these gray moving

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.310
along the edge here?

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.270
This is a road, right
here, the Stanegate.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.810
That's a modern road,
and a modern field wall.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:06.730
And all of those readings, you
get these really, really high

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.370
readings along the
edge, and that's simply

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:14.210
people throwing tin cans
and relieving themselves

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.410
over the wall for a good couple
of decades, modern road works

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:18.380
and things like that.

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.310
So often what it
is is that you find

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.350
something that you
didn't necessarily need

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.910
or a modern rubbish
heap of some sort.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:29.667
An old wheelbarrow--
that happened.

00:45:29.667 --> 00:45:30.500
Any other questions?

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.036
AUDIENCE: Can you briefly speak
about some of the research

00:45:37.036 --> 00:45:38.670
you've been doing on the shoes?

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:39.795
ELIZABETH GREENE: Oh, sure.

00:45:39.795 --> 00:45:40.390
Absolutely.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:42.630
So one of the things,
I said that those shoes

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.710
are very close to my heart.

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:47.770
That is something I
could have given you

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.220
an entire talk on shoes.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.430
OK, so we have over
4,000 shoes, and they

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:58.030
are being used in all
sorts of interesting ways.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.060
What I'm interested
in is looking

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.400
at who these shoes represent.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.650
Because if you can believe
it, for decades and decades

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:05.640
and decades and
centuries, really, nobody

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.260
was really thinking about who
lived in these military forts,

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.220
in these military communities,
other than the soldiers.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:16.000
It was a very sort of
misogynistic, very manly

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.985
environment, the Roman Army.

00:46:17.985 --> 00:46:20.110
And we never talked about
the women who were there,

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:20.730
the children.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:23.480
However, when these
Vindolanda shoes popped up,

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.490
a woman named Carol
van Driel-Murray back

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:28.060
in the early '90s,
she started looking

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:31.130
at certain contexts such
as barrack blocks, so

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.460
soldiers' barracks.

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:37.920
And realizing that there are
lots of children's and women's

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.210
shoes in these spaces.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:44.290
People always wanted this to be
prostitutes and their children,

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:44.790
I guess.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.780
And this is a real
problem with research.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.470
This is not the way
the world works.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.300
And so I started looking at
who these shoes represented.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.250
Really cool stuff.

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:54.130
There's children's and women's
shoes all over the place.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.120
And then one side is
bringing in other material

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.650
as well, such as the
documents that we mentioned--

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.650
the inscriptions,
other things like that,

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.720
realizing that women and
children and families,

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.540
in fact, are all over the
Roman military environment.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.500
I'm also hoping this
summer, and this

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.140
is another one of
my collaborations,

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.130
I'm hoping this
summer to start doing

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:13.920
DNA analysis on a
lot of the leather.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.020
And now you can't ask me any
more questions about that.

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.540
I'm still researching and
putting together my proposal.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.350
Because it's actually
highly questionable

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:24.150
what we'll be able to get
out of Roman leather because

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:28.102
of the tanning process,
because of how long

00:47:28.102 --> 00:47:29.560
they've been sitting
in the ground.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.330
So I'm still
developing that plan,

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.420
but I'm hoping to be
able to understand

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.731
where the leather
was coming from.

00:47:35.731 --> 00:47:37.480
So in other words, are
they importing that

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.637
from the continent?

00:47:38.637 --> 00:47:39.720
Are they very, very local?

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.886
Is it coming from the South?

00:47:40.886 --> 00:47:44.070
Kind of similar
questions of the ceramic.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:47.450
I am also looking at-- I'm
working and collaborating

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:50.490
with a physical anthropologist
in Anthropology Department

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:53.290
at Durham University in
the UK, Dr. Trudi Buck.

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.850
And we're looking at things
like-- this is mostly

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:57.600
her department, to be
honest-- but looking

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.295
at things such as deformities
in the population.

00:48:00.295 --> 00:48:01.670
So what are the
shoes showing us?

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.910
And in fact, when we look
closely at these shoes,

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:06.680
they are showing
us that the Romans

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.837
had a sense of individual gait.

00:48:08.837 --> 00:48:10.420
They had a sense of
the fact that they

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.240
needed to fix things like
high arches and pronation

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.030
and supination.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.970
So we have shoes
that have a metal

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.490
bar on either the inside or
the outer edge of a shoe.

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:22.240
Really cool stuff.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.232
I could come back sometime and
talk an hour just about shoes.

00:48:26.232 --> 00:48:28.440
So there's lots of really
interesting stuff going on.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.856
Maybe after I do
this summer, it's

00:48:29.856 --> 00:48:31.770
going to be really
interesting with testing,

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:35.194
if I can get
information out of this

00:48:35.194 --> 00:48:36.610
and get the right
people on board.

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:39.795
Somebody asked me if we
could get any human DNA off

00:48:39.795 --> 00:48:43.087
of the leather,
off of the shoes,

00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:44.670
just because people
were wearing them.

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:46.294
I guess maybe through
sweat and things.

00:48:46.294 --> 00:48:47.449
And you know, I don't know.

00:48:47.449 --> 00:48:49.490
So I'm going to try to
find out things like this.

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:51.130
And if we can, wow, awesome.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:52.540
That would be really cool.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.350
Anyone have any input on that?

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:56.880
Yes?

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.700
AUDIENCE: It seems to me that
the idea that the women were

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:09.060
prostitutes would be
fantastically easy to initiate,

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.040
to get going.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.125
You basically say it's troops.

00:49:12.125 --> 00:49:14.250
Women were there, probably
prostitutes [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:16.340
ELIZABETH GREENE: Naturally.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.500
AUDIENCE: But exceptionally
difficult to displace,

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:23.968
to get rid of that idea
once it's been established.

00:49:23.968 --> 00:49:27.300
I used to have this tremendous
argument in art history

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:31.190
when I was in college, the
Venus of Willendorf figures.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:32.956
I thought they were porn.

00:49:32.956 --> 00:49:35.340
The professors all said they
were like fertility figures

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.780
or something like that.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.600
Well, how do you know?

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.430
The difference between porn
and fertility [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:44.374
So in a situation like
this where everybody

00:49:44.374 --> 00:49:47.176
has made the easy
lead to, oh, they

00:49:47.176 --> 00:49:48.860
must have been prostitutes.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:53.050
How do you go about the process
of showing and demonstrating

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.312
that they weren't prostitutes?

00:49:54.312 --> 00:49:55.270
ELIZABETH GREENE: Yeah.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.061
Really interesting.

00:49:56.061 --> 00:49:59.330
Because one of things you're
bringing up is that surely,

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:00.572
there were prostitutes there.

00:50:00.572 --> 00:50:01.280
That's the thing.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.647
I mean almost every
human group, you

00:50:03.647 --> 00:50:04.980
have certain things that happen.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:05.950
You have women there.

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:08.330
When you women and men there,
you have children there.

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.310
And you also very
often have prostitutes.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.280
And we know of prostitutes
throughout the Roman world,

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.363
throughout the Greek world,
throughout pretty much

00:50:14.363 --> 00:50:16.440
any ancient society and modern.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.030
So that's an absolute
fact of life.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.670
So it's basically
what you're asking

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:23.100
is how do we pick apart
what sort of social class

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:26.250
or what type of people we're
talking about with these shoes.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:30.560
Now, one thing we can do is look
at the archaeological context,

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.820
or also tied into that is
looking at the type of shoe.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.780
One of the shoes that
I talk about a lot

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.900
is called the Lepidina slipper
because of where it's found.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.690
It's found in the house
of the commanding officer.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.270
It's a very high end shoe.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:46.360
It has the maker's
mark throughout.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.930
It's something
that we would like

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.890
to say probably a prostitute
wasn't able to afford

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:52.211
and wasn't able to buy.

00:50:52.211 --> 00:50:54.210
But one of the points,
though, about saying, OK,

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:58.190
whether this is the shoe
of a prostitute or not,

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:00.014
that's very difficult to say.

00:51:00.014 --> 00:51:01.430
You can point to
all these things,

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.263
this is very high end,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:51:03.263 --> 00:51:05.720
It's very difficult to say
exactly who wore that shoe.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.560
But the number now is so high
that all of those individuals

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.440
could not have been prostitutes.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.290
The other thing, what I do,
coming from that cultural side

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:16.140
that I said with this
classic background,

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.320
I spent years and
years and years

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.480
reading ancient Greek and Latin.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.604
I'm not going to forget it.

00:51:19.604 --> 00:51:20.990
I'm going to use it.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.840
Is that we can look
at the inscriptions,

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.020
we can look at the documents
that are left behind,

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.540
and we can see in
there that there

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.280
are families in
the Roman military.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.190
So I bring in the
social aspect by looking

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.970
at something particularly called
the military diplomas, which

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:37.410
are these bronze documents,
their discharge documents.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:41.340
And on those documents they
name the soldier at the bottom,

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:44.050
and if he chose, he named
his wife and his children,

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.910
and those children
got citizenship.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:47.360
And that's a family right there.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.559
That's not a prostitute.

00:51:48.559 --> 00:51:49.850
Those are families right there.

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:52.170
And therefore, we also
know that those families

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.880
were in the military
environment.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.240
They were in these communities
surrounding the army.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.740
I should have given
my talk on this.

00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.090
This is like my Ph.D. research.

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:00.440
Fantastic.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.444
So we know that those
people are there.

00:52:02.444 --> 00:52:04.110
And we just have to
then be able to-- we

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:06.330
can never in archaeology
say this shoe was

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.510
worn by this person.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:11.630
That's not going to happen.

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:13.440
I suppose if they
signed their name on it.

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.880
AUDIENCE: Every time I
read "National Geographic"

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.838
or anything about
archeology, people are always

00:52:16.838 --> 00:52:19.680
saying this was a prostitute,
this was a rich guy,

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.482
this was this
person [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:22.482 --> 00:52:23.440
ELIZABETH GREENE: Yeah.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.390
We make educated guesses from
the evidence that we have.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:30.630
And oftentimes, there are
better and worse cases.

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:32.879
There are things where you're
saying, yup, absolutely.

00:52:32.879 --> 00:52:35.235
That is definitely what looks
like is happening there.

00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:37.420
But I like to bring in
all of the evidence.

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.950
So bring in the documents,
bring in the archaeology,

00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:42.880
look at the context of the find,
look at the actual find itself.

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.530
there's a lot of
angles you can take

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:47.752
to be pretty sure
of what's happening.

00:52:47.752 --> 00:52:48.252
Yes.

00:52:48.252 --> 00:52:49.238
Another question.

00:52:49.238 --> 00:52:50.348
AUDIENCE: So since
you brought it up,

00:52:50.348 --> 00:52:52.970
do we know much about what's
happening-- so you're mentioned

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:54.960
about disability and injury.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.320
If you're not a senator or
an equestrian or something

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.674
and you get injured as
far as the Roman military,

00:53:00.674 --> 00:53:02.150
they have the
equivalent of the VA,

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:04.135
or [INAUDIBLE]
they're bigger now.

00:53:04.135 --> 00:53:05.010
ELIZABETH GREENE: No.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:07.900
We don't know of anything that
is, let's say, like the VA.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.300
What we do have, we
have military hospitals

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.040
inside of a lot of these forts.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.420
There are very large
ones, the legionary forts.

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:16.500
The fort you're looking
at here, Vindolanda,

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:17.680
is an auxiliary fort.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.770
So that's actually a much
smaller non-citizen unit

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.010
that's living in this fort.

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:24.210
Anywhere between about
500 and 1,000 men.

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.170
Nominally, how many
are actually there.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:27.210
It's around that.

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:30.132
You have cavalry units
that are attached to it,

00:53:30.132 --> 00:53:31.590
so the number
changes a little bit.

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:35.300
Whereas a legion is technically
5,000 and all sorts of people

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:35.830
attached.

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:38.910
So we have much larger
hospitals in a legionary fort.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:40.820
And there is also
evidence that soldiers

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:45.170
remained in the settlements that
were right next to the units,

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.740
right next to the military fort.

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.260
And to my mind, we don't
have any written document

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.130
that says this is
why I lived here.

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:53.470
But there are some soldiers
that appear to go home,

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:56.245
and we can kind of track their
movements through epigraphy,

00:53:56.245 --> 00:53:58.620
through these inscriptions
and things they'd left behind.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.880
And a lot of people that tend
to stay nearby, near the unit.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.120
And to my mind it
seems like you're

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:09.630
staying near a familiarity,
in one respect.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:11.380
But then also that
maybe you're still

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:18.080
utilizing those military
goods and services

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.070
that you had when
you were a soldier.

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:21.986
But we don't really have
anything written down

00:54:21.986 --> 00:54:24.268
that says exactly what
happened or why they did this.

00:54:26.815 --> 00:54:28.690
AUDIENCE: Those wives
you were talking about,

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:32.200
were their names Roman
or Celtic, usually?

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.950
ELIZABETH GREENE: Roman
for the most part.

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:36.460
So we don't really
have-- the soldiers,

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:39.100
though, this is a
really complicated--

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:40.350
do you guys have another hour?

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:42.140
We could go right
into something.

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:45.070
Those soldiers up in our
site and on almost all

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:48.220
of Hadrian's Wall are-- unless
you have vexilation unit.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.720
We do have evidence that we do
have legionary soldiers there

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.340
at some point.

00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.111
These are these
auxiliary units that

00:54:53.111 --> 00:54:55.110
are being recruited from
the conquered provinces

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:56.170
of the Roman Empire.

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:58.920
And then often being shipped
outside of their home areas.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.860
So the units we have are called
Tungrians for one, Batavians.

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:06.076
Tungrians are from
modern name Belgium.

00:55:06.076 --> 00:55:08.075
Batavians are right around
the area of Amsterdam

00:55:08.075 --> 00:55:09.900
in the Netherlands.

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.110
And so we have these
sort of culture units.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.587
But then those became
multiculture units

00:55:14.587 --> 00:55:16.170
in and of themselves
because then they

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.640
would be recruit
from areas local,

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.150
from areas that they were
traveling, from one place

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:23.130
to another.

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:25.630
So these became serious
multicultural groups.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:29.520
So the names that we have, that
we know of, in our environment,

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.070
you do get ones
that are non-Roman,

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.300
but you also have people
that are taking Roman names,

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.510
because when they
get Roman citizenship

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:36.840
they're taking Roman names.

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.111
So it's a bit of mixture.

00:55:39.111 --> 00:55:40.360
But you can never always tell.

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.000
Just a Roman name
doesn't always mean

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.220
that they weren't originally
from somewhere else.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.870
Thank you.
