I think the most important question Davos
has to address is how to handle extremism

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.790
in all its parts. And militant extremism in
order to bring peace to the world. And militant

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.110
extremism is found not only on the fingers
of religions but it is also on the fingers

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.580
of circular acknowledging. And until we address
these things, we will never be able to accomplish

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:34.890
what the United Nations says. Which is peace
for all of man.
