Freesoulja I completely agree with you.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.660
The most important thing we can do in 2008
and every other year is to make sure we invest

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.730
in our children.
Really we invest in all human beings, because

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.940
you are absolutely right.
When people are educated, when they have skills

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.679
and abilities, this world becomes a much better
place.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.869
We have a responsibility I think to do that
for our children. To --

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.060
As we in our US parliament say "leave no child
behind."

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.500
That means that every single kid of every
zip code, every race in every community has

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.430
to have the opportunities to be successful
in this world.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.580
The other thing I would say to young people
is make sure you invest in yourself, invest

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.120
in your own education.
Take responsibility for yourself.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.850
Get the opportunities at your local community
college and in your public schools so that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.250
you can be a true global participant.
And I would also say that every person needs

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.320
to know that they can make a difference.
They can contribute, they can give back, they

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.190
can save a life, they can teach a child, they
can be a good mom or dad.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.970
So Freesoulja, you go.
