[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.720
-Hello everyone.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.410
We are now going to start
our fourth and final panel.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.900
And to do that, I'm going to
do so our moderator, Adrienne

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.010
Keene.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.540
Adrienne is an assistant
professor of American Studies

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.830
at Brown University.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.900
She was previously a
Presidential Diversity

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.410
Post-doctoral Fellow
there affiliated

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.510
with the Department
of Anthropology

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.290
and the Center for the Study of
Race and Ethnicity in America.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.230
Her work focuses
on the experiences

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.230
of American Indian,
Alaskan Native

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.910
and Native Hawaiian students
in the college process.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.750
She is also the
author and editor

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.300
of Native Appropriations, a
very well-known blog exploring

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.460
representations of indigenous
peoples in popular culture.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.050
Adrienne.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.770
[CLAPPING]

00:01:02.492 --> 00:01:04.630
-[SPEAKING CHEROKEE]

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.770
Hi, everyone I'm Adrienne Keene.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.860
I'm a citizen of
the Cherokee Nation.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.800
And I am also an alumni
of the Harvard Graduate

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.770
School of Education.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.060
So I can't tell you how happy I
am that this event is happening

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.860
on our campus, and to
see all of you here,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.920
and to have these conversations
be a part of this community

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.250
is amazing.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.380
So thank you, so much,
to HUNAP and Radcliffe,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.340
and all of the organizers
who made this possible.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.110
It really means a lot to
me as an alum to be here.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.430
So in my work, I often start
with a basic phrase which

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.060
is representations matter.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.510
And we've heard, and seen,
today how vitally important

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.850
it is to have native peoples
and native voices in realms

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.800
from law to governance to
literature and art and, now,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.990
media.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.070
We live in a world
where the average person

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.300
spends 490 minutes a
day consuming media.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.610
That is over eight hours,
over half of our waking day,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.220
and that's set to rise to
506 minutes by next year.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.170
And we know the type of
images that the public

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.807
is receiving of native peoples.

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:18.390
I had a whole paragraph
going into it,

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.740
but I think Matika did a
wonderful job talking about it.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.690
And these stereotypes
still dominate.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.840
These images, also, often
place native peoples

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.670
in the historic past,
and we were never

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.670
pictured as contemporary
human beings,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.370
but always as something that
exists in stark contrast

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.770
to modernity.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.020
The process of placing us in the
historic past, and therefore,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.740
extinct, or as fantasy creatures
on the same level as mermaids

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.110
and wizards, obscures our
ongoing strengths, triumphs,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.150
and advances, but
it also obscures

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.180
the real and pressing challenges
in our communities, as well.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.970
If native people
are only situated

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.920
in the imaginations
of the public,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.010
we will never have the
support and understanding

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.850
we need to move our
communities forward.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.350
The other side of
misrepresentation,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.650
for native peoples,
is invisibility.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.460
Because representations is
not just about stereotypes,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.840
it's also about the
lack of representations,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.530
or the all encompassing
invisibility native peoples

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.980
experience in society.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.320
As an example, in an analysis
of prime time television shows

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.850
between 1989-2009, researchers
found that native characters

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.720
ranged between 0%-0.6%
of the overall numbers.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.890
So in raw numbers, that
translates to only three

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.370
native characters.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.060
So three native characters in 20
years of prime time television

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.970
data.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.760
And this invisibility
has real effects

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.620
on how native
peoples understand,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.210
in the words of
Stephanie Fryberg,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.870
and her colleague
Stephens, who they are

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.500
and what they see as
possible for themselves.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.050
Without counter narratives,
or positive representations,

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.980
of native peoples to
draw upon, our ability

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.400
to imagine ourselves in
the future is limited.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.120
In this environment
of invisibility,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.740
every representation takes
on increased importance.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.500
On this panel, we have those who
have fought hard both within,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.650
and outside of, the
film and media industry

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.340
to make change for native
peoples in these arenas,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.700
and to imagine what the future
of native film and media

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.150
can look like.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.540
While so much of
the conversation

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.019
is often about critique,
and while I believe

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.930
this is necessary
and very important--

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.170
as it is what I do
every day on my blog--

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.490
I am excited to be able to
share the stage with three

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.930
native advocates who've
been making space

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.550
for media by, and
for, native peoples,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.090
creating positive
counter narratives

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.664
and disrupting stereotypes.

00:04:31.664 --> 00:04:33.830
What does it look like when
native peoples are given

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.380
the power and control
to represent themselves

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.190
in media and film?

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.140
So on this panel we have Irene
Bedard, Migizi Pensoneau,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.950
and Loris Taylor.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.249
And I direct you to the
program to read their bios that

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.290
demonstrate the depth and
breadth of knowledge we

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.450
have on this stage.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.740
I'm really excited to
learn with you today.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.910
And without further
ado, I will turn it over

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.189
to our first panelist, so

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.980
[SPEAKING CHEROKEE]

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.554
Thank you.

00:04:56.554 --> 00:04:58.006
[CLAPPING]

00:05:04.298 --> 00:05:07.320
-[NON-ENGLISH] Thank you.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.790
Thank you to the people
of this land, Wampanoag.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.050
Thank you, honorable colleagues,
honorable human beings,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.390
distinguished mothers and
fathers, daughters and sons,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.250
but especially our ancestors
and the coming generations.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.710
I am humbled and honored
to be in your presence

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.430
at this critical juncture in
the arc of human existence.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.880
I'm Inupiaq, Yupik,
and Metis Cree.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.110
My name Irene means peace.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.120
My Yupik name Kautaurak
means one who dropped.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.950
[PTSEEW]

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.610
And my Cree name is Iron Woman
to the Core of the Earth.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.530
I was born and raised in Alaska.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.960
And I'm the daughter of
Bruce and Carol Bedard

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.170
and the granddaughter of
David and Irene [? Oten ?]

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.260
from the village
of Kodiak, which

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.880
thrives from the gifts
of the Bering Sea.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.980
Yes.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.670
I am indigenous.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.100
But I am a citizen of the world,
a tiny human being on the face

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.090
the planet called Mother Earth.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.670
On this day before
you, I could speak

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.170
of the villages
that have been moved

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.670
inland due to the melting
of the Arctic Ocean,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.190
and the many more that the
Army Corps of Engineers

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.580
plan to move in the near future.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.080
I could speak of the polar
bears or the cancer clusters

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.120
attributed to the burning
of random found materials

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.260
used to keep homes, in the long
winter, in the villages warm.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.500
But instead, as in the
tradition of my people,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.070
I am going to tell you a story.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.720
The story of us.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.410
I will begin with my
ancestor, my mother.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.070
She was born in the
village of Kodiak, Alaska

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.310
in 1948, Cold War America.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.990
The United States government
was conducting tests

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.010
on the effects of nuclear
radiation on human beings,

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.650
using the villagers of Point
Hope as their test subjects.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.000
But not so far away, in the
scheme of human history,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.320
my mother was born and in her
lifetime lived 10,000 years.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.430
She lived the way we always
lived, subsistence hunting,

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.170
fishing, and gathering.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.240
When she was still
a girl, an airplane

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.300
came, and took her to
the boarding school.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.620
From there she went to
the big city of Anchorage.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.180
And rode in a car,
though she never drove.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.830
On television, she saw
a man land on the moon.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.700
Then came computers
and cell phones

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.730
and the world wide web
was cast around the world.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.560
She got to hear Elvis
sing on the radio,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.140
and then see him in a movie.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.340
You see, we human beings
have the same story.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.730
We all came from tribes.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.270
We all hail from the
Earth with songs,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.640
and stories, drums, and
dances, and the deep abiding

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.030
relationship to our ancestors,
the coming generations,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.980
and our Mother Earth.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.410
Our mother taught
us well how to live

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.450
and from generation
to generation,

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.540
we pass the ancient
knowledge of our ecosystem,

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.780
the plants, the animals, the
creatures of the sky and sea.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.640
We were one with
our environment.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.190
And she was our
blessed relation.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.870
But we human beings wanted
a sense of autonomy,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.480
like any young person
leaving the nest.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.830
Our intelligence, an integral
tool of our survival,

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.370
became our wings.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.400
And we began our journey of
our eco-alienation, farming

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.310
and agriculture made way to
the Industrial Revolution.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.260
And only within
the last century,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.940
science became
our final answers.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.750
We cover our earth
with our compounds,

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.150
paving our way to the future.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.870
Separated lords over
our long history

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.630
as children of an ecosystem.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.070
But now, on this
auspicious occasion,

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.910
by the wisdom of humanity,
that science, our intelligence,

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.330
is finding its way back.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.610
It is imperative to the survival
of the coming generations

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.570
that we find ways to honor
and protect our relations,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:27.040
and bring us back to
balance with Mother Earth.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.360
That was my speech
that I had prepared

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.990
for the United Nations.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.610
You see how a story
brings us all together.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.750
Healing through the
power of storytelling

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.630
is what we do in
filmmaking and television.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.980
I only think of myself
as a storyteller.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.010
Yes, I'm just a
girl from Alaska,

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.540
but I think I might be the
storyteller of my tribe.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.420
We have this report here
that I wanted to just show

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.290
you, Inclusion or invisibility?

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.660
Comprehensive Annenberg Report
on Diversity in Entertainment.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.960
Let me just kind of push
through it really fast here.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.070
Gender, here we are speaking
of gender, and media platforms.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.865
Behind the camera
gender, as well.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.840
We move forward.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.020
And here we have
race and ethnicity.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.090
You see the
prevalence onscreen--

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:30.410
and thank you for bringing
up those numbers there.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.570
If you can see here,
forward, as we go forward,

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:40.900
we have the film, broadcast
cable, streaming, and number

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.910
of shows without any black
or Asian speaking characters

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.800
by media platform.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.160
Betrayal on screen white,
Latino, black, Asian, other.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.693
Other that what we get.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.670
When I was growing up, I
wanted to be invisible.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.720
I was one of very few
native girls, native people,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.840
in the high school
that I went to.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.410
And it was so much
easier to be invisible.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.180
It was so much safer
to be invisible.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.870
I read that book The Invisible
Man, and I understood.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.300
I felt a kinship to that.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.200
But we are the invisible people.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.930
Zero representation throughout
the last number of years,

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.970
throughout most of those years.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:51.170
Today, let's see, I'm on
a television series called

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.510
Longmire, which was on A&amp;E
and got moved to a streaming

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.614
network called Netflix.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.650
But it's the story of
a really great guy who

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.520
happens to be a cowboy Sheriff.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:15.530
We still continue to have these
conversations of invisibility,

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.310
these conversations
of our nature,

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.820
of where we belong in the fabric
of-- not just American society,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.640
but the society
throughout this world.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:33.300
It's been a difficult
place to come from.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.130
But if you see, in this
picture, this is me.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.510
That parka was given
to be my grandmother.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.500
The fox was caught
by my grandfather.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.130
That ring was
100-year-old Navajo ring.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.530
And I found out the turquoise in
it came all the way from Nepal.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.155
And it was given
to me by my father.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.833
We come to this place.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.820
Who controls the narrative?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.260
We go from building
bridges to the other

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.820
because that's what we're going
to have to do in this media

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.400
environment that we're in.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.680
I was on a plane, while I was
filming a series called Into

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.580
the West, which at
that time was a really

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.060
big deal in American Indian
country, especially those of us

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.330
in front of the camera.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.380
There were 500 speaking
roles, and many of those roles

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.810
were Native American people.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.900
This was an incredible story
that Steven Spielberg put

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.170
forth, and incredibly
enough, he had

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.300
to do the same thing
that the directors

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:45.440
and producers of the film
Roots did 30 years before.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.790
He had to go in
and tell the story

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.650
of a romance
between Lakota woman

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.930
and a Virginian
wheeler and their trek

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.470
across-- during
westward expansion.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.290
That was how that story
needed to be pitched.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:07.880
It couldn't be pitched as a
story about the deconstruction

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.660
of the American
Indian people, which

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.015
is what it was really about.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.340
The reason I have this
picture up here right now.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.880
We all belong to the same bird.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.400
It's important for us, all
of us, in this society,

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.570
to recognize that we are all
here, part of the same bird.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:36.490
We're all flying around the
universe on the same planet.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.970
And if we do not understand that
we are woven into the same rug,

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.030
and allow each
thread to be who they

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.020
are, to weave this
beautiful rug,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.570
then we are never going to
be whole under our feet.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.080
We are never going
to be able to fly,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.920
because we're not allowed
to be part of the same bird.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.940
And I was on this
plane, the Laker's jet,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.040
between Los Angeles
and New York when

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.280
we were going to the big
junkets for Into the West.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.560
And I'm sitting there
with the executives.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.390
And I'm talking to them
about some of the projects

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.180
that I've thought of,
or that should be made,

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.170
or that could be made.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.000
And he looked at me, and he
just basically, said, well,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.340
promoting in the middle of
promoting this major television

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:34.220
event, DreamWorks on
TNT, said, well you're

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.460
just not a demographic.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.200
There are 400 million
indigenous people

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.880
on this planet, let
alone the native people

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.040
of this continent.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.010
Let alone people who have
an interest in who we are,

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.300
and what we're about, and
the stories we have to tell,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.300
and what kinds of things we
have to offer to the planet,

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.040
including our ancient
technologies, including

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.390
the eyes and the ears and
voices of our grandmothers

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.940
and our grandfathers.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.720
Including the next generation,
and the next generation,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.500
and the next
generation, things they

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.030
should dream and see about
themselves on screen,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.440
and know that they are part of
the fabric of the story telling

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.870
of us, all of us human beings.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.990
That's my mom and
her twin sister.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.492
Just had to put that in there.

00:16:25.492 --> 00:16:26.356
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.180
My very first film
was a film called

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.810
Squanto a Warrior's Tale.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.230
Squanto, you may
remember, was there

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.470
at the first Thanksgiving.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:47.270
He was actually one of my
heroes before that because he

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.500
was someone I knew from the
history books that represented

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.690
who I am, or at least something
about what I understood

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.750
in this world, the
people I came from,

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.740
and that I was
represented in history.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.050
Woo hoo!

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.069
That was so cool, right?

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.859
And that we got this kind
of celebration once a year.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:13.140
Well I call these characters
the Manifest Destiny characters.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.180
I have, I feel very privileged,
to have had the chance to do

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.069
a lot of those characters.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:23.615
Squanto, in my understanding
of his story growing up,

00:17:23.615 --> 00:17:27.130
I was maybe told it a
little bit deeper than some.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.670
And then to be able
to be here on the set

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.770
and to be able to tell this
story about this person who

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:41.140
was plucked, kidnapped, sent
across this great big ocean,

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.840
plucked, dropped in the
middle of civilization,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.470
shown off like an
animal, a creature.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.300
He escaped and went
to a French monastery.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.610
Was there for decades
hoping to find passage home.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.070
Finally, found passage home.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.390
And when he got there
his entire people

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.600
were gone from
warfare and disease.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.930
So he found his way
to another village.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.560
And he could have very easily,
when those pilgrims came,

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.280
said Ah, sorry.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.750
You just go ahead and starve.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.890
But he didn't.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.930
He saw that they
were human beings.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.230
And he had empathy
and compassion.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:27.010
And he did what he
did, yes, and that

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.260
is why he ended out
in our history books.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.490
But at the same time,
would you have done that?

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.680
Would you have?

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.800
To me that is so
telling of the love that

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.950
was spoken of earlier, of
the love and the compassion

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:49.400
that we have for one another
as a tribe, as a people.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.420
My grandfather said Bunning,
what does Inupiaq mean?

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.650
And I said, I don't know.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.069
He said it just
means human being.

00:18:59.069 --> 00:19:01.610
When you go out into the world--
when I left to go to college

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.590
and I was going all the way to
the other side of the planet,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.890
as far as I knew-- I dropped in.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.200
It was 90 degrees
and 90% humidity

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.020
and I had no idea what that was.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.990
But his words kept me.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.780
You just look people in
the eyes and you will see

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.510
that they are a human being.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.990
It's all about the story.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.300
I look you in the eyes and
I want to know your story.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.304
There is a lot of healing in
the power of storytelling.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.230
Later on, actually my
second film that I did

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.970
was a film called Lakota
Woman Siege at Wounded Knee.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.060
It was about the siege at
Wounded Knee in 199-- 1993--

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:50.290
1973, we actually
filmed in 1993.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:56.860
And I had the chance to portray
Mary Crow Dog, Lakota woman.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.970
I had the chance to be
there with the people, many

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.680
of the people who
were there in 1973.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:09.440
I had a chance to
go to Wounded Knee.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:15.720
I had a chance to see, and
hear, and listen to the voices.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.280
I listened to the voice of Mary.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.800
And I had read the book
before, when I was in college.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.020
I had sent that book to my mom,
and my sister, and my aunties,

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.660
because I understood.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.180
I knew this story.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.250
And when I actually met
her, I had heard her voice,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.500
before I had ever even really
actually physically heard her.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.340
That's the connection
that media has.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.060
We connect ourselves
to each other.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.410
In physics, you know,
there's entanglement.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.120
Well, that's what
storytelling is.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.760
It's our entanglement.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.550
And it shows that we are not
so different from each other,

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.950
but it also shows that
another point of view.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.020
It gives us a chance
to see through the eyes

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.350
and walk through the
feet of someone else.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.950
Someone that we maybe
never got the chance

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.200
to meet or understand.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.846
It creates a bridge of
compassion and empathy.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.770
I show this one.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:30.630
This was a film where I got
to play a tough tribal cop.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.460
Right?

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:39.000
When I open up my little
phone here and I, see inbox.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.200
Oh, I have a meeting, or
a script has been sent,

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.600
I know that I'm
going to be looking

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.320
at a handful of characters.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:57.890
Is it going to be the angry,
tough political hates-all

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:02.400
[NON-ENGLISH] woman?

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.300
Is it going to be the
disenfranchised, poverty

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.830
stricken mother,
you know, victim?

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.580
Victim of something,
whether it's rape,

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.415
or-- I've been killed
in so many ways.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.780
It's true.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:27.890
I actually spent one on
two different locations,

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:32.090
on opposite sides of country,
set in two different centuries.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.440
And in that same week,
I spent two whole days

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.980
hanging in two different trees.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:46.520
Let's see, the wise
sage, medicine person

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:53.950
who lacks any sense of
humor or humanity, really.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.570
The alcoholic, drug
addicted crazy.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.140
That's it.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.490
That's what I think of when I'm
about ready to open a script,

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.340
which one is it?

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:12.490
I just know if you go out and
with Sleeping Lady Films Waking

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.800
Giants Productions, we
have too many stories.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.640
And good news from
Indian country.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.370
Good news from the
indigenous world.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.110
There are so many
positive, amazing stories

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.350
of perseverance, and
strength, and dignity.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.540
And even the stories that
are hard and difficult

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.190
and should be told because
these are the stories that so

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.060
many people just
don't even know,

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.280
we tell them with inspiration.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:47.780
We tell them with a heart of
all human kind, of all mothers,

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:53.430
of all grandmothers, and their
grandmothers before them,

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.370
and the child, and the
daughter, and the daughters down

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.950
seven generations from me.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:06.910
That connection that I
have with the projects

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:11.170
that I do, and I've had to
be a part of they're amazing.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.130
I'm so blessed and honored.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.450
I walk in beauty.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.620
I think it's-- I show these
pictures because this goes

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.930
back, this is the flapper era,
little bit before the flapper

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:26.630
era.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.150
And doesn't she look native?

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.050
She's not.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.650
But that depiction, the
kind of understanding,

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.860
of we as native
women and the beauty

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:43.710
that we hold, inherently,
it is a wanted--

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.360
there is something about it.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.210
There is something about the
beauty of a native woman.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.200
And about the fact that
we do walk in beauty

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.550
to the best of our abilities, in
the hardest and most difficult

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.550
circumstances.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.660
We continue to do so.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:10.540
Even if Barbie would look
like this, if she was really

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.907
a human-sized person.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:18.130
This was something that
very much came up--

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.610
and I'm trying to find
where that one is, actually.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:27.970
I think it's out of
sequence-- with the avatar,

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.514
with Pocahontas, which
of course, a lot of you

00:25:30.514 --> 00:25:32.180
know that I was the
voice of Pocahontas.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.710
And then I went on and did The
New World by Terrence Malick,

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.800
and I played
Pocahontas's mother.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.335
Keep on going on, don't we.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.900
There's that
sexualization, also,

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.750
that has happened to Native
American and indigenous women.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:56.340
And of course, that
includes sexual violence.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.520
John Smith, actually,
no matter where he went,

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:08.900
he had these grand, amazing
adventures, and generally

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:15.180
some beautiful, indigenous,
wild thing did something grand

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.740
and amazing in his life.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:22.010
And with Pocahontas,
though, the one thing

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:27.790
that really struck me
about the story in itself,

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.800
was she threw herself
upon John Smith

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.950
when she was only 11 years old.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.820
And she stopped a
war from happening.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:42.030
And so that's why we talk about
the peace of Pocahontas, right?

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:47.710
But I think that inherent story
within itself, whether it's

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:53.110
true or not, that story
that we cling to about it

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:58.800
is the story that-- I
think the reason we cling

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.010
to these stories is
that it is something

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.090
that we hope and wish for.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.680
We want the happy endings.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.990
We want that sense of dignity.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.100
And you know what?

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.110
As far as Disney
princesses go, she

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.190
wasn't waiting for her
prince to come and save her.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.170
She saved him.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.210
So moving on.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.945
My time is up.

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.946
Winona LaDuke, strong woman.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.990
Two Old Women is
a story that I'm

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.270
about to start telling with
Sleeping Lady Films Waking

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.870
Giants Productions.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:43.970
Sleeping Lady Films is
a story about waking

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:48.760
the giant of the indigenous
nature, and heart, and people.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.860
And it's a little bit
of a subversive thing.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.120
I'm really shooting
for peace on earth.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.620
[CLAPPING]

00:28:13.072 --> 00:28:14.280
-My name is Migizi Pensoneau.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:23.077
Or wait-- [NON-ENGLISH]

00:28:23.077 --> 00:28:24.910
--not that that's any
of your business, but.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.480
I just realized.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.470
We were laughing
earlier today that I

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:39.090
think that native things
always tend to go long.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.540
And there's that joke about
running on Indian time,

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.264
and everything, but
I think it's mostly

00:28:44.264 --> 00:28:46.430
because we spend so much
time introducing ourselves.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.929
[CLAPPING]

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.640
So you Dene, especially.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.940
Man, all I hear is
like these clicking

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.145
noises for like two minutes.

00:29:00.415 --> 00:29:02.040
I don't understand,
I'm going to learn.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.706
Just kidding, I know
what you're saying.

00:29:03.706 --> 00:29:04.830
I know all your clans.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.558
I've been there.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.760
So by the way, so I get
overwhelmed in like a really

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.600
big crowd.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.690
So if you find me just like
staring at you suddenly,

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.940
and if I'm like in a
really impassioned part,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.010
I'm not yelling
at you white man.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.850
It's just in the
middle of it, you know.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.820
So I focus to like,
so I'm not like,

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.730
oh my god, there's
so many of them.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:34.570
So I think it's a little
funny that everybody's

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:37.710
like I want to thank
the people that at

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:42.260
you know Wampanoag and
Nipmuc, I'm like yeah, thanks

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.760
for your land.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.020
So that's how my mind works.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.830
I go to these really,
really dark places.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.910
But no, thank you,
acknowledge you

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:56.000
and this is-- how many people
from here from Wampanoags

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.370
and Nipmuc are here?

00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.360
Ahoo.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.552
Quite a few, quite a few.

00:30:01.552 --> 00:30:02.480
-It's a prairie.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.530
-Oh it's a prairie,
that's right.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.596
How many Dene are here?

00:30:07.596 --> 00:30:10.260
[WHOO]

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:10.760
Christ.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.881
They outnumber us all.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.680
So anyway, sorry.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.450
I am Migizi Pensoneau.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.290
And I'm a part of a,
co-founder actually,

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.780
of a comedy group
called the 1491s.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.340
We are sketch comedy.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:27.840
[WHOO]

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.040
I know, I know.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.370
I'll take some more,
if you want to give it.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.020
So we do silly videos
and put them online.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.010
And that's really,
seriously, pretty much

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.423
the entire breadth of what I do.

00:30:42.423 --> 00:30:44.256
I could sit back down
now and you'd be like,

00:30:44.256 --> 00:30:46.860
oh I'll just go look those up.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.610
So again 1491s.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.890
And if one of you people
comes up after this

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.840
and asks me where we got that
name-- just figure it out.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:03.090
So we started off
with-- there are

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.130
five of us in the group,
myself, Sterlin Harjo's

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.540
the filmmaker, Bobby Wilson,
you guys might know him

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.680
with the tattoos
on his neck, Dallas

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.460
Goldtooth, my little
brother, and Ryan Red Corn,

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.500
who we affectionately call
the white guy, because he's

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.490
very pale.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.740
But we are all artists
in different rights.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.760
So I'm a screenwriter.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.468
Sterlin Harjo, as I
said, is a filmmaker.

00:31:24.468 --> 00:31:26.700
Bobby Wilson is a
fantastic artist.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.230
Ryan Red Corn is a
graphic designer.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.940
And my little brother, Dallas,
is like this powerhouse

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.740
of activism in any country.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:39.860
And so why do we get together
and put these videos online,

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.050
like which are really,
really self-deprecating?

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.460
I mean if you have
any desire, and you

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.370
shouldn't, to see what I
look like under this, you

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.470
could find it online.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.580
I'm just saying.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.570
All right.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.230
So but we put up a
video and, again,

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.180
I'm sorry I don't have anything
for you-- I mean that would

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.750
take up all of my
time-- our videos

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.207
generally they range from
2-10 minutes in length.

00:32:11.207 --> 00:32:13.790
If I were to show a few, then
it would just eat up everything.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.380
But you can look us up,
1491s, YouTube, Facebook,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.350
all that stuff.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.800
But we put a video up.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.730
And we didn't think
anything of it.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:23.650
We were, like oh,
yeah, this is just

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.900
for friends, family, whatever.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.600
Laugh at us, laugh at ourselves.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.790
But the next week, we're at
tens of thousands of views.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.830
And this is at the
advent of YouTube.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.950
It was just sort of
starting as a platform.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:40.090
And we're like oh,
there's something here.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.580
And like good Indian men, we
didn't do anything for a couple

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.400
years, we sat on it.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.050
But we just let you down.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.932
So we ended up, finally,
after a year or two,

00:32:55.932 --> 00:32:57.140
we finally got back together.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.000
And we're like, man,
let's do this again.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.190
And we made a bunch more videos.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.550
And they became just as popular.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:04.190
And we're like, oh, this isn't
just a fluke, one time thing.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.900
People like seeing us
joke about ourselves.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.600
And let's continue.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.650
And as we continued, we noticed
that the more places that we

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.130
got to go and get brought, and
the more places, we performed,

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.280
we noticed that
outside of us, there

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.700
was this sort of dearth,
this void of native humor.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.140
Which is funny
because you always

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.880
hear native people talking
about our humor is our medicine,

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.740
our humor is what
keeps us strong.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.560
And I'm like show
it to me in a movie.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.220
I mean outside of like
Smoke Signals or something

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:45.960
like that where, but even
that humor is it sort of a let

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.850
me explain this to the general
audience kind of humor as well.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.430
There are humorous bits in it
that are for native people,

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.480
and stuff, but a lot of it is
like that scene where they're

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.390
going backwards in the car-- the
two women are going backwards

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.000
in the car.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.390
That is a scene
that I really liked

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.889
and then I really
hated right afterwards.

00:34:05.889 --> 00:34:07.430
Because it was like,
oh that's great,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.584
just a quirky little thing.

00:34:08.584 --> 00:34:10.500
It's funny they're driving
this car backwards.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.330
It's awesome.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:12.913
But then it got into
this conversation

00:34:12.913 --> 00:34:14.880
about oh, you're going
to need your passports.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.860
And you're like OK.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.360
So let's explain that
natives are an other.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.570
We really seriously don't
need to explain that.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:25.330
Natives have been
portrayed as an other

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:30.070
for generations and
generations, since the founding.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:35.837
And so when I saw that
as a young guy, when

00:34:35.837 --> 00:34:37.670
Smoke Signals came out,
I was like holy shit

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.440
this is entirely like
me to produce thing.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.080
It's huge.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.270
It's amazing.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.960
What's the next
thing going to be?

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.520
And there were a lot of things
that were under the radar.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.570
You know Smoke
Signals was so big.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:51.429
And so the other thing
I started to notice

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.310
when we were doing
our 1491s and the more

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:58.680
that we produced-- and we have
over 100 now-- not all of them

00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.180
are funny.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.380
Some of them are from a
series we call Represent where

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.950
we go to different
places and we're like,

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:04.408
here you take the
cameras and we'll

00:35:04.408 --> 00:35:08.920
put them on our channel,
that kind of thing.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.250
But the more we did that,
the more that I personally

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:18.170
started to notice that
it's not just like humor,

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:23.560
we're not telling a lot
of different stories here.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.220
So if I were to tell
you-- and it's funny,

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.180
because Irene is in
Smoke Signals and so

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.554
I did this to her earlier.

00:35:29.554 --> 00:35:31.720
I was all hey, I'm going
to describe a movie to you.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.760
Young man, through some
tragic happenstance,

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.260
has to go on a
journey, young angry,

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.030
native man has to
go on a journey

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.000
and come to terms with himself
and his own Indianness,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.740
his identity, what
movie is that?

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.227
What movie am I describing?

00:35:43.227 --> 00:35:44.810
And so because I
just talked about it,

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:46.680
you could go like oh
that's Smoke Signals.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.320
Oh, wait, no, that's
Powwow Highway.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.130
Oh, wait, no, it's Four
Sheets to the Wind.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:51.463
Oh, no, it's Drunktown's Finest.

00:35:53.644 --> 00:35:54.810
There are different aspects.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.830
And I'm like, where all
of these are coming from?

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.410
And part of it is that native
people have not had a chance

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:02.660
to tell their stories yet.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.330
And so I feel like
native people definitely

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.899
want to throw in a
lot of explanation.

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:09.440
Like this is where
we come from, this

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.560
is what you missed, see
all this that you missed?

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.810
But the story-- it gets in
the way of the story moving.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:20.497
And so I was thinking
to myself like man,

00:36:20.497 --> 00:36:21.580
where does that come from?

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.390
Why is that so ingrained?

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.000
And who are these characters?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.473
As Irene was talking
about, there are a few

00:36:30.473 --> 00:36:35.270
that native women can
play, and they're not nice.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.500
My Auntie Casey Camp
is also an actor.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.320
And she want to do a
1491s video one day that

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.574
is her doing like an acting
camp for native women

00:36:44.574 --> 00:36:45.990
where she's just
like, this is how

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:50.174
you lay next to the tipi
that's on fire, dead.

00:36:50.174 --> 00:36:51.590
And she's really
excited about it.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.631
We want to do it someday.

00:36:52.631 --> 00:36:55.148
So it's really messed up.

00:36:58.084 --> 00:37:00.000
But we're like, OK, where
does that come from?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.090
And so I started thinking
and then I figured it out.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.250
The words were written up
there during Irene's thing,

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:11.000
and it's a loaded thing.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.400
We could talk forever about it.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.470
But it's this idea of
Manifest Destiny right?

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.460
God put this thing
here, put this land here

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.760
for it to be
conquered, taking over,

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.820
for good European
Americans to come in

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.490
and cultivate the wilderness,
make something out of it,

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.250
make something out of yourself.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:37.127
And that ideal is one of
the more detrimental things

00:37:37.127 --> 00:37:38.960
that happened to native
people, particularly

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.290
in terms of imagery.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:45.000
When you think about
the images that

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.250
have come out of just
that one concept, things

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:56.430
like the end of the trail, oh,
I'm on my horse and I'm tired.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:57.700
I'm defeated.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:01.090
Or you think about like
the Indian maiden thing,

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:05.210
this native woman that's there
for the white man to conquer.

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:09.330
And you think about that.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:12.820
And you think about the
idea that native people,

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.130
for a long time represented,
the wilderness of America,

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:19.020
the wild, the beast, the savage.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.230
And that is meant to be
tamed, meant to be conquered.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.710
What does that mean for a man?

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.130
It means you need to be beaten.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.588
You know American lives on this
idea that natives are dead.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.680
When you fuck with
that idea, it's

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.670
problematic for a lot of people.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:33.820
When you go, no, no, no.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:33.910
I'm alive.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:34.493
I got a voice.

00:38:34.493 --> 00:38:36.210
I'm going to say some shit.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.110
You're like, [GIBBERISH].

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.536
Then, what is America?

00:38:42.194 --> 00:38:43.360
Saw a couple of you in here.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.735
I'm like, no, I'm
talking to you.

00:38:44.735 --> 00:38:45.580
I'm swearing at you.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.062
My god.

00:38:47.062 --> 00:38:49.650
Just trying to duck arrows
and tomahawks and whatnot.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.900
Of words.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.150
Verbal tomahawks is what
I'm launching in your faces.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.570
Yeah, I just said that.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.940
All right.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.492
But no, man.

00:39:06.492 --> 00:39:07.950
Like when you mess
with that idea--

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.460
and America, when
you think about it,

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.830
is founded on a
lot of those ideas.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.900
Asian people are other.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.210
Black people are subservient.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.760
When you mess with
those ideas, man,

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.310
people do not like hearing it.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.460
And when you see
how that goes, man.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:30.730
You know, I saw-- I went
back home to Minnesota

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:33.780
and I saw a sign that said
"police lives matter."

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.210
And I'm like, you know what?

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.168
There aren't a lot of
black people around here.

00:39:37.168 --> 00:39:39.421
Who are you yelling back at?

00:39:39.421 --> 00:39:40.795
We're in like
Northern Minnesota.

00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:44.362
I'm like, what
are you afraid of?

00:39:44.362 --> 00:39:46.070
And then I realized
though, it's the idea

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.340
that they're yelling back at.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.714
The idea that somewhere black
lives might matter is like,

00:39:49.714 --> 00:39:50.745
what?

00:39:50.745 --> 00:39:51.370
No, they don't.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.160
Not as much as mine.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.920
And so like that, along with
like if you tell some people

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.779
that native people are alive.

00:39:57.779 --> 00:39:58.320
They're here.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.240
They're thriving.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.820
They're growing.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.786
Diana earlier today was talking
about how the population

00:40:04.786 --> 00:40:07.460
of Hopis has gone up.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.052
Why?

00:40:08.052 --> 00:40:10.260
Outside of that we like
doing what makes that happen.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.029
But it's gone up because we are.

00:40:13.029 --> 00:40:13.570
We're living.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:14.670
We're coming back.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.927
Our languages are coming back.

00:40:15.927 --> 00:40:17.510
The things that have
been talked about

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:21.280
are like-- they aren't outside
of the realm of possibility.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.440
What Matika said, people
can learn our languages.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.220
I saw on YouTube, a white
kid speaking Ojibwe.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.350
It blew my mind.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.030
He was a polyglot, and
he was just practicing.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.780
It was amazing.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.770
It's amazing to see.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.780
So when you put a bunch of
like silly men who are like no,

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.780
we're just laughing,
joking, having a good time.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.590
We're not defeated.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:39.790
We're not dead.

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:41.420
We're just like
cracking ourselves up

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.280
at our chubby, naked bodies.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:47.332
And when you do that,
and people go like,

00:40:47.332 --> 00:40:48.540
natives are not here, though.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.081
They're dead.

00:40:49.081 --> 00:40:50.060
You know, they're gone.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.070
And it really messes
with people's heads.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:56.084
And it creates this sort of like
needle that just keeps jabbing.

00:40:56.084 --> 00:40:57.750
And the more we do
that, the more people

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:59.850
are going to have
to pay attention.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.770
But we have to get
out of it ourselves.

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.400
As native filmmakers,
as native people,

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.147
we have to embrace not
only the same stories

00:41:07.147 --> 00:41:07.980
that have been told.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.240
And we can't just tell
people that we're here.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.770
But we got to reach across.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.335
There's something I call
the audacity of genre

00:41:13.335 --> 00:41:14.570
in native cinema.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:17.000
That means do like
a buddy cop movie.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.280
Do like a teen sex comedy,
like Porky's or American Pie.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.570
For native filmmakers
out there, I tell people.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.450
I'm like, do like
a sci-fi flick.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.420
A horror movie.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:26.974
Reach across.

00:41:26.974 --> 00:41:29.140
Because we don't have to
perpetuate the stereotypes,

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.654
but we can embrace
archetypes of other stories.

00:41:31.654 --> 00:41:32.320
And that's fine.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.249
And people can relate.

00:41:33.249 --> 00:41:35.290
Other people will actually
see what you're doing.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.580
They will see what
your places look like.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.840
They'll see your homes.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.970
And it will be on your terms.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:45.200
So that's why I do what I do.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.520
I found out recently that the
documentarian, Billy Luther,

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.640
who I have a lot of respect
for, did Miss Navajo.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.560
The documentary Miss Navajo.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.450
And I found out he did a
movie called Red Lake, which

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.340
one of the things
that I said when

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:07.562
I was jibbering at you in Ojibwe
was-- ojibberish as we say.

00:42:07.562 --> 00:42:09.020
One of the things
that I was saying

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.800
is that I'm from Red
Lake. [SPEAKING OJIBWE].

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.350
That means I'm from Red Lake.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.910
And so like when I saw that
he was doing documentary,

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.330
I was like, hell yeah, man.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:20.490
A native dude's
doing a documentary

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.090
about where I'm from.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:21.890
That's awesome.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.216
Because you know, Red Lake
has this complex issue

00:42:24.216 --> 00:42:24.840
of sovereignty.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.756
There are certain treaties
that we didn't sign

00:42:26.756 --> 00:42:28.220
and it gives us a
lot of autonomy.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.944
And I was like,
oh, that's great.

00:42:29.944 --> 00:42:31.110
What's it going to be about?

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.170
And I look it up and Red Lake
is about a school shooting,

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.730
and about how our people
are sad but still proud.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:39.120
And I was like, well, fuck.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.390
So that is the kind
of thing-- that's

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:46.330
the reason that we do
what we do, to change

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.413
that narrative completely.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:53.262
Because you know, I ain't
trying to burn down America.

00:42:53.262 --> 00:42:56.840
But I mean, I might be trying
to make it great again.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.886
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:00.886 --> 00:43:01.385
Thanks.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:14.612
-Oh my goodness.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:22.520
So I don't have any talent
like Irene and Migizi.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.310
True story.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.680
I took acting classes
in Los Angeles,

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.060
and the director kept saying,
you know, on Wednesday night

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.590
we have script writing.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.290
So needless to say,
I'm going to talk

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:40.870
about infrastructure today,
just bring you back to reality.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:42.815
I need the little
remote thing here.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.600
So I want to first start
off by a quick introduction.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.850
I come from the
village of Oraibi,

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:56.920
that Diane Judge Humetewa
mentioned this morning.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:02.120
It's a village that has no
running water, no telephone

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.440
service.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:09.290
And when I was younger,
we didn't even have radio.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:10.450
No television.

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:11.700
Of course, I mentioned that.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.500
And no broadband.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:18.030
And so years later, I've
now become an advocate

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:22.710
for the digital and media
divide in this country

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:24.660
that is so wide.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.510
And someone once said to
me, they said, dang, Loris.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.810
You're really over-qualified.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.720
You're like the poster child.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.110
So I want to take
you on this journey

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:41.880
and just remind you why media
matters in this country.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.300
Media access,
control, and ownership

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.005
is really, quite frankly,
about power and position.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.490
Seeking power and
position over others

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:57.770
is embedded in human cultures.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:01.920
We build institutions and
systems of administration

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.960
and we predicate
this on formulas

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.520
that have evolved from
cultural imbalances, which

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:14.320
includes hierarchy,
imperialism, and so forth.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.550
Whoever is in power
gets to tell their story

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.020
through their optics and lens.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.757
And they often do this to
justify their own power

00:45:24.757 --> 00:45:25.340
and existence.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.380
So I love this map.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.710
Media access,
control, and ownership

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:40.690
is also about ownership capital.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:45.930
There's a perpetual pursuit
of capital or the ownership

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.670
and competitive
acquisition of resources.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:55.620
We do this through titles, how
we acquire spaces and places.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.450
And this includes our
airwaves spectrum, including

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:04.570
radio and television
frequencies are no exception.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.310
It pretty much is
like land and water,

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:10.435
except that we got into
the fight much later.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:20.970
In most major markets, like
Phoenix or Minneapolis,

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:25.970
and in the commercial
broadcast environment,

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.320
radio and television
ownership is

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.670
held by major commercial
conglomerates.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:38.460
Consolidated media ownership is
a huge problem in this country.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.750
Native Public Media did a small
market study of Albuquerque

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:47.750
about, I would
say, six years ago.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:54.210
And out of 52 stations
that existed in that town,

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:59.780
only 1 station dedicated any
hours of native programming

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:03.840
to the communities that
surrounded them-- KUNM.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.280
Look it up.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:12.120
Very sad when New Mexico
has quite a large number

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.320
of Native American tribes
within its boundaries.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:23.110
Media access,
control, and ownership

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:27.370
is really important to
overcoming intolerance,

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:30.830
stereotypes that everyone
has mentioned today.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.490
And really, just
patronizing Native Americans

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:40.440
in this country, which
is still going on today.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:44.120
Without media access,
control, and ownership,

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:48.580
we cannot fully acknowledge
the injustices of the past

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.200
on our own terms.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.360
And so this is really
what drives my work.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.030
By having our own
broadcast facilities,

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:02.830
we begin to actively value
the rich cultural diversity

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.980
among tribes in the
context and structures

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:11.400
of our most exalted
institutions economically,

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.780
socially, culturally,
and educationally.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.850
A few years back,
Native Public Media

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:24.080
served as an advisor to a
major public service media

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.390
institution in the
Boston area, WGBH.

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:29.480
You may have heard of them.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.710
We helped to produce
four major films.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.470
And for the life of me, I
can only remember three.

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:39.525
They included Wounded Knee,
Geronimo, and The Mayflower.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:46.360
Now, I had to include
this because there's

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.750
a continuing romantic notion
about Native Americans.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.530
It's sort of that
Fabio effect that

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:58.390
continues to be present today.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.850
Media access, control,
and ownership,

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:04.130
it's about parity
and justice as well.

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:07.250
In modern America, the
revolution is not over.

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:11.330
And in fact, it's just
beginning for Indian country.

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:17.650
It strikes this closed-offness.

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:20.360
Or, I would say, the
censorship of voices

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.900
that ought to be heard,
really strikes to the heart

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.520
of the First Amendment.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.520
It strikes to the heart
of our freedom to speak,

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:34.840
the freedom of the press,
and the freedom to be heard.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.900
And let me just
give you an example.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:44.190
A few years back,
not too long ago,

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:51.990
the Arizona State legislature
passed Arizona House Bill 2281,

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:56.210
which was really to silence
and censor the ethnic voices

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.016
within the state of Arizona.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:06.140
And what it does is that
it prohibits ethnic studies

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:12.520
in schools that are funded by
the state and makes it illegal,

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.020
in fact.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.570
This is quite disturbing
because Arizona is home

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:22.790
to 22 tribal nations.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:26.780
One of the states that has
the largest native populations

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.570
in this country.

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:34.500
When we have the power to
access, control, and own

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.620
our own media facility,
we are actively

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:41.870
working towards the full
recognition of the impact

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:44.180
of our own history.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:48.700
We are able to assess our role
and place in the hierarchy

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.660
of power and control.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:56.780
And we can optimize our
personal and professional energy

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.640
to tell our own stories.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.505
And also, look out for our
own wellness and happiness.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.040
Media access,
control, and ownership

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.090
is about being our own
stewards and guardians

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:13.950
of our own freedom.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:19.870
Now, Sherman Alexie is a
record holder of banned books.

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:21.960
He held it in 2014.

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:27.090
And if you look it up today,
he's holding it in 2016.

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:33.160
And the reasons for banning
his books range from the fact

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:36.850
that he's like writing
about insidious stuff

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:40.120
that could harm
society, like murder

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.740
and violence and rude language.

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.154
And so I thought about that.

00:51:46.154 --> 00:51:48.310
I used to teach at a
little-known school

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:52.100
just a short distance from
here, Phillips Exeter Academy.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.040
You may have heard of it.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.750
And I remember that
one of our textbooks

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:01.530
was quite Shakespearean
in nature.

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:03.470
And I was thinking, like, wow.

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.840
All these elements.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.080
I think I remember
those stories.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.275
And I was thinking,
like Romeo and Juliet.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:16.710
So there's really no rhyme
or reason to the reasons

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:19.180
why he continues to
be on a banned book.

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:23.820
But it does drive me to go out
and buy copies of his books

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:24.675
for all my friends.

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:29.610
Media access,
control, and ownership

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:33.780
is understanding and
exercising our own power.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:38.960
Media is based on an unshakable
consciousness of superiority,

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.470
imperial conquest
and colonization,

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:46.930
and it's directly linked to
information, social structures,

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:52.490
media messages, and
educational curriculum.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:56.380
When I started my
work back in 2004,

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:00.070
I read about all
the 10 commissioned

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:04.380
studies by the Federal
Communications Commission.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:09.680
And what I learned was that the
commission saw Native Americans

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:14.290
through the optics of that
we were vulnerable, unserved,

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:19.470
under-served, and probably
the most fragile and invisible

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:20.706
in the United States.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:29.240
So I wanted to do
something about that

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.590
because media access,
control, and ownership

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.760
is really about
the power to speak

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.730
and the power to be heard.

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.760
It's about our affirmation
of our identity.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.730
It's about cultural survival.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:44.390
It's about native language
programming, cultural content,

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:46.530
history, and localism.

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:49.500
And it's an exercise of
our tribal sovereignty

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.020
and self-determination.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.670
One of the things that we
do from Native Public Media

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:57.900
is to host a one-week
high school boot

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.460
camp in communications
for young people.

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.220
And we immerse them in
television and radio

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:07.170
and different platforms
on the internet.

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:10.989
And what we want to do is build
capacity across Indian country.

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:22.040
Native Public Media since
2004 has helped tribes

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:25.720
to bring broadcast
facilities to Indian country.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.400
And our work is just beginning.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.390
We're not done.

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:33.410
In our network, we
have 58 radio stations,

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:36.260
3 terrestrial
television stations.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:40.350
We do everything from high-power
to low-power broadcast

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:45.070
facilities, AM/FM, public
service media, commercial,

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:46.186
and now digital.

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:55.210
Because if we want to
stand on our own two feet,

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:59.630
we need to work against
being silenced by rules

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.080
and regulations and laws.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:07.020
We need to make sure that there
is engagement, consultation,

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.430
and that we overcome
invisibility

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:13.280
and the "other" box.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:18.130
Freedom is part of
the process in terms

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:20.280
of media access and ownership.

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.360
It's a validation
of who you are.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.430
We can write our own history.

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:30.090
And the modern pen
are the channels

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:33.750
that we exercise
control over, which

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.458
includes broadcast facilities.

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:41.360
And one of the
fundamental questions

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.840
we have to ask ourselves
is, whose democracy is it?

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:55.210
To overcome and to in part
answer this question, in 2010

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:59.660
we worked for a tribal
priority for broadcasting.

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.090
Not because we were
minorities in this country,

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:06.390
but because we come from
sovereign governments,

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:10.590
and that flows into
our individualism

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:12.133
as tribal members.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:19.470
We also established in 2010,
the FCC Office of Native Affairs

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:20.640
and Policy.

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.450
And when we first
floated the idea,

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:26.140
we talked about a
native desk at the FCC.

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.340
And after it was vetted
by tribal leaders,

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:30.880
they basically said,
we don't want a desk.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:35.360
We want an office staffed
with economists, and analysts,

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:40.580
and lawyers, and
engineers to do this work.

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.960
We also submitted
recommendations

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:47.230
that were included in the
National Broadband Plan.

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:54.300
But having to work with 567
native nations in this country,

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.520
it's going to take a lot.

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.950
A lot more work.

00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:01.190
We've just barely
taken the first steps.

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:05.570
Last year, we included in
the Stafford Act of FEMA

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:08.850
the inclusion of
broadcast facilities

00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:12.980
for emergency recognition.

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:16.340
And technology has
changed the landscape,

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:19.670
broadband in particular.

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:23.020
But across Indian
country, back in 2004,

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.340
broadband penetration
was at 10%,

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:30.760
which meant that 90% of
Indian country was dark.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.850
Now we've worked really
hard to close that gap.

00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:37.570
And I think we've inched
up, but we don't really

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.240
have any hard data
to prove that.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.590
The FCC said perhaps
we're around 25%

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:45.560
penetration at this point.

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:54.640
And so it's a reminder of
the long road ahead of us,

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.760
but we have a lot to
celebrate as well.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:03.880
On April 20, we celebrated
Hiller River Broadcast

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:11.040
Corporation, the first
commercial low-power digital

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:15.110
television station serving
a tribal community.

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:17.740
And that was in Arizona.

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:23.720
On April 21st and 22nd,
we celebrated the National

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.250
Broadcast Summit, bringing
together about 70 broadcasters

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:30.580
from Indian country,
to share our stories

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:34.200
around emergency preparedness
communications, which

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.650
followed on the heels
of a one week training

00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:41.750
on the FEMA ground
in Anniston, Alabama.

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:46.060
And what I basically learned
is that communications

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:50.130
is a fundamental human right.

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:54.470
And that we have to work
to make sure that we

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:59.520
continue to have media access,
control, and ownership.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:03.420
We may be the fastest growing
network in the country,

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:07.020
but we still have
a long ways to go.

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.760
And I'm so happy to be here.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:14.480
I want to thank Dean Elizabeth
Cohen, Danielle Carpenter,

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.030
and Shelly Lowe,
and the organizers

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:19.670
of this fantastic conference.

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:21.520
I've learned a lot.

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.290
I hope to take it back
with me to my community.

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:28.600
And I look forward to a
long term partnership.

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:33.850
We need some academics in
native public media circle.

00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:37.190
We can use your help to
move this movement forward.

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:41.180
Someone once said, it's not
about talking to the choir,

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.980
it's about talking to
those individuals that

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.630
don't necessarily
disagree with you,

00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:50.440
but who may in some
instances, wholeheartedly,

00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.320
agree with your position.

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.280
But if you can move
them in your direction,

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.610
then that's the work
ahead of us. [NON-ENGLISH]

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:02.290
[CLAPPING]

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.220
-Thank you so much.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.160
You are amazing, panel.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.930
And we have brought
the microphone

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:18.840
to the center of
the room, if anyone

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.980
has questions for the panel.

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:26.050
If you don't, I have
a whole list, as well.

01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:29.830
-Hi.

01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:31.900
Thank you so much for
your presentations.

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.870
It's very inspiring
to be here today.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:38.170
I have a quick question
about the exoticism

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:40.620
that people of color,
or marginalized people,

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.070
still experience.

01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:43.570
I think a lot of
people in this room

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:46.170
can attest to the experience
of when someone meets you

01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:47.450
and they ask, what are you?

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:48.680
Where are you from?

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.130
And it's hard.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:52.120
We have such
complex genealogies.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.430
There's no fixed geography.

01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:56.910
We can trace our roots all over.

01:00:56.910 --> 01:01:00.290
So I just want to know
professionally, artistically,

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:06.950
personally, how do you
confront and continue

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:11.090
to deconstruct
the exoticism that

01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:16.670
is still placed
on people of color

01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:20.180
in the arts and entertainment?

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:26.200
And if so, if you
feel like it's still

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.392
kind of an uphill battle
for your work and when

01:01:29.392 --> 01:01:30.975
you're about to
attempt a new project?

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:34.800
-Sure.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.910
Go ahead.

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:41.315
-I have that story, too.

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:48.970
It got so when I left and
was in Philadelphia, where

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:54.365
I went to university, I started
just asking people to guess,

01:01:54.365 --> 01:01:58.308
for that what are you.

01:01:58.308 --> 01:02:00.540
It got to this point where
the sort of quip answer,

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:03.300
like I'm a human being.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.705
But then people
never would guess.

01:02:06.705 --> 01:02:08.080
They would guess
everything else.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.940
And then when they did find
out, their eyes lit up,

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.060
and it was, for me, one of
the first times of realizing

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:19.170
just how amazing we
are, our cultures are,

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:21.270
and how people want to know.

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:26.585
And so I always try to approach
things from being an ambassador

01:02:26.585 --> 01:02:29.050
or being a teacher.

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:33.850
But at the same time,
I think that it's

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:39.960
that other that we are
discussing that I think

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.700
causes this separation,
or this feeling

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:46.300
that you are not a human being.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:51.810
That there's a way to kind
of objectify you as a person.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.250
And so, it's really
just a matter

01:02:53.250 --> 01:03:00.280
of helping people to see the
complexities of us, of who

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.020
we are.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:06.390
And that first and foremost,
we're human beings.

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:08.820
-Yeah.

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.580
So yeah, I've gotten
the same question.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:16.570
And especially, because I'm
short haired, and whatever,

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:20.750
so I'm not obviously
native to a lot of folks.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:23.914
And I got to a
point, same thing,

01:03:23.914 --> 01:03:25.830
I went totally the
opposite direction, though.

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:27.760
She's talking about,
I'm a human being.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.220
And I think that I've
used up my swears, too,

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.730
so I'm not going
to say it, but I

01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:36.160
said I usually say like I'm
f-ing awesome, what are you?

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.680
Or whatever.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.260
I'm just too damn good looking.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.480
So like it opens a dialogue.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.320
I combat things with humor
as much as I can the way.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.310
I think when you
make somebody laugh,

01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:50.570
it builds a little bridge.

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:55.100
And you're like, all right,
well, let's talk as people now.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.890
I can't, obviously, I can't--
none of us can speak for all

01:03:57.890 --> 01:04:01.370
POCM, talking about much
of a battle is left.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:02.755
And it's forever, man.

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:04.380
And we're always
going to be struggling

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.009
to understand each other.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.550
But the best thing is, I think
just to be secure in yourself,

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:10.470
and hope that the
other person is, too

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:12.580
and you guys can
have a dialogue, so.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.036
-Perfectly done.

01:04:17.036 --> 01:04:17.952
-Thank you, very much.

01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:22.626
-Hello.

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:23.920
Kelly Dennis.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.495
I'm an attorney.

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:28.760
I'm a tribal member of the
Shinnecock nation, also

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.720
[INAUDIBLE] Nipmuc, from here.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.690
I was sent to Catholic
school for most

01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:39.360
of my-- up until eighth grade.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.790
And every year, they'd have
like these crazy plays.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:43.490
And we always play something.

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:45.680
And it'd be something the
nuns would put together.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:51.510
And there would be
this one time where

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:55.154
my mother, she would always
love to-- she's an artist,

01:04:55.154 --> 01:04:56.820
so she would love to
do the backgrounds.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.790
And she got so
excited this one year

01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:05.010
when we were going to
have, a portion of it

01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:09.530
would be to have the Native
Americans, I don't even know,

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:10.250
I was so young.

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:12.940
I must have been like
seven or eight years old.

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.760
Anyway, I remember having
like these like glow

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.380
in the dark like sprinkle things
that you like twirl around.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:22.360
And there would be like
tipis and things like that.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.470
And then I look back on it,
and I'm like what in the world

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:28.760
did we do?

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.290
And then, again,
it was in a way,

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:35.370
it was conflicting,
because I still

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:41.800
kind of felt a weird pride
in it, because at least they

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.800
were acknowledging
that there were natives

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.890
in this Catholic school, even
though they were portraying us

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:51.410
so wrongly and with the
tipi and these weird glow

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:53.230
in the dark things.

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:58.130
And then I remember that she,
a few years down the line,

01:05:58.130 --> 01:06:01.890
I think she wised
up and they tried

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:04.980
to put on a play of Peter Pan.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.900
And then, she was
like, wait a minute,

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.950
now they're just
going to be equating

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:15.030
the kids from the reservation as
basically the mermaids in Peter

01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:15.530
Pan.

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:17.270
And they're so fantastical.

01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:18.730
And I was just
wondering, I think

01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:22.140
that maybe one of the
latest things that I think

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:27.850
I've heard of was if
they do do Peter Pan,

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.860
kind of like the
Disney thing or not,

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.010
who would portray Tiger Lily?

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:35.510
Is it appropriate that they
cast a Native American woman

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:36.490
in that?

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:40.170
And I was just wondering
your thoughts on that.

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:41.170
-Thank you.

01:06:46.341 --> 01:06:48.340
-So I think we can even
take it a little broader

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.810
and think about
that role of casting

01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:54.350
of native peoples in
very stereotypical roles,

01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:56.320
and what your thoughts
are about that.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.080
Should we be embracing
that or should we

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.880
be moving away from it?

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.680
-If you think of that
Night at the Museum

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:14.600
or-- I mean I think that because
these are there-- and just

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:20.560
my own experience, I do know
that I would never understand

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.670
really, honestly when
people would meet me

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:29.340
and would burst into tears
until I met Buffy Sainte-Marie.

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.200
She had the Creative
Board Teaching Project

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.670
and she asked if I
would be a part of it.

01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:33.260
And I went.

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:38.190
And they screened some things
from Sesame Street beforehand.

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:40.820
And when I met her,
I burst into tears

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:45.070
because I realized
she was the only image

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:48.620
of a Native American
woman, positive image,

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.690
that I ever saw growing up.

01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:54.180
And I kind of went, oh, OK.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.620
I understand this
now a little more.

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:01.280
I think that we get so
starving, and starved,

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:07.890
for just anyone up there so
that you can look up, look out,

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:13.090
into this screen of the world
and feel like that's me,

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:19.359
or that's some reflection of
my experience, and who I am.

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:26.109
And you know so it's
such a difficult world

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:30.902
to be a part of as far as
on this side of the camera.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:36.670
I mean, I was lucky.

01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:42.890
I was able to make a living
at doing what I did-- do.

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:48.910
But at the same
time, you're handed

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:51.430
what I explained in your hand.

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:57.200
So I would never-- I
would always feel positive

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:02.830
about that native woman who
would take that role on, yet

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:07.979
at the same time I would work
diligently to create more three

01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:13.939
dimensional human women
characters, and men, too.

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:16.960
All of us, we just
don't get that chance,

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:23.350
so I would never feel
negatively toward that.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:26.810
-I have a slightly
different perspective.

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:30.000
I think in order to
change the narrative.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.319
And if we're serious about the
roles that are stereotypical,

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:38.000
or those that are
demeaning, or unflavorful

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.090
to Native Americans, we
have to draw the line.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.870
Otherwise, we're complicit.

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:48.010
One of the reasons why
Native Public Media sought

01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:51.220
to build facilities
across Indian country

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.740
was to provide a channel where
we could tell our own stories.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:03.870
And so, I've seen actors
stand up, walk off,

01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:07.940
movie sets because
they felt very strongly

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:11.480
that the depictions
of Native Americans

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:16.770
was not favorable
to Indian country.

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:21.840
And I think, just my
personal views on the matter,

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.270
to change the course
of history, you

01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:26.040
have to break the tie somewhere.

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:30.610
-No way.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:38.330
Tiger Lily would have to be
completely ripped apart, taken

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.770
down, deconstructed.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:44.770
A part one of the stereotypes
is the Indian maiden.

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:47.000
And the Indian maiden,
one of her main roles

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.660
is to, again, with the
cultivating the wilderness,

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.850
conquering the wilderness,
one of her main roles

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.391
is to be accessible
to the white guy.

01:10:56.391 --> 01:10:58.710
She's never accessible
to her own people.

01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:04.230
And so a lot of native women
roles, they do the same thing.

01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:07.680
They're don't have a
romantic involvement at all

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.370
with any of the characters.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:13.780
I'm not saying that they need to
have only romantic involvement.

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:17.290
But in that kind of narrative,
it only exists for that

01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:20.080
and I think unless she's like
sitting there, sword in hand,

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.590
and her only thing is to fight
side-by-side with Peter Pan

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:24.006
and conquer the
hell out of things

01:11:24.006 --> 01:11:25.450
and then go back to her people.

01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:29.437
That would be a better story,
but outside of that no, no.

01:11:29.437 --> 01:11:29.937
Sorry.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.750
-Hi.

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:35.630
My name is Sierra.

01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:39.770
I'm a second year student
at Brown University.

01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:45.140
And one of my questions that
I was thinking about-- oh,

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:49.850
first of all, thank you all for
speaking, it was really great.

01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:52.660
The question I had is
kind of piggybacking off

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.940
of the previous question.

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:58.550
And this is coming also
from me being an artist

01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:02.850
and having to think very
deeply about this, so.

01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:07.460
Do you think the native
art, native people in media,

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.570
do you think their
work is inherently

01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:13.140
political, or radical?

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.900
And also, how do
you deal with that

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.970
with like looking at
your own positionalities

01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:20.550
and where you come from?

01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:25.720
And how do you sort of grapple
with being complicit or being

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.900
or engaging in activism?

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:28.610
-Hell, yeah.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:29.630
Yeah.

01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:30.460
-That's my student.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.500
-Again, man, you're
supposed to be dead.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.510
Everything you do
as a native person

01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:42.990
is either ironic,
or revolutionary,

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:45.830
because nobody expects
you to even be there.

01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:47.550
So hell, yeah.

01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:50.880
Yeah You're doing something
big, just by existing, just

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.730
by going out and doing work.

01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:56.510
So.

01:12:56.510 --> 01:13:00.790
-I think even just
living in our villages

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:04.370
up in Alaska, where we've
lived our subsistence hunting

01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:07.790
and fishing lifestyles
since the beginning of time.

01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:10.930
And the fact that
that is something

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:15.170
that we've had to
continue to battle

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:21.640
and continue to work
against pipelines,

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.710
and do what we can for
environmental justice,

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:30.490
or social justice,
economic justice.

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:36.460
All these aspects
are just us being us.

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:43.810
And it's a strange thing
to think that, oh, well,

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:45.260
you don't understand.

01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:49.000
If you take away our
subsistence hunting and fishing,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.550
and it's $12 a gallon
for milk, that village

01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.650
is going to have to dismantle.

01:13:55.650 --> 01:14:01.260
They're going to leave their
lands and not live that way.

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:08.040
And out of that dismantling,
a genocide has occurred.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:14.380
So just the fact of wanting to
maintain the traditions in life

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:24.230
that we live and exist in is
in itself its own, as you said,

01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:31.400
it's a protest, or it's
irony or politicism

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.120
just by being who you are.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.470
-[NON-ENGLISH] Hello, welcome.

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:39.630
My name is Leah.

01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:41.740
I'm from the Narragansett
nation of Rhode Island,

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.310
just further south of here.

01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:44.690
Welcome to the East Coast.

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:47.660
And being an East Coast person,
the question I have for you

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:52.670
as media professionals
is every year,

01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:56.060
Thanksgiving time, we deal
with a Thanksgiving story.

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.840
My partner being Wampanoag,
me being an East Coast person.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.950
That is our time where
productions come out

01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:05.940
such as Saints and Strangers.

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.820
And quite a few
people in the room

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:11.400
are familiar with the disaster
of which that film was,

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.720
in which native people,
unfortunately, I

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:21.110
believe they were
misled into this film

01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:26.620
and portraying Wampanoag people
and people of the East Coast

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:29.890
in the slate that was
not accurate whatsoever.

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:35.660
And I was wondering how
you feel about the ethics

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.980
of native people, or what the
ethics are of native people

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:42.220
portraying other native
people from which they are not

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.530
familiar with?

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:47.890
And I know Irene has done
some great work in portraying

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:49.770
many different people.

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:54.280
And what are those ethics
that you follow as an actor?

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.920
And what would you suggest
for other people who are

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.310
going into that acting world?

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:06.340
-I've been on many projects
where, literally, it was just

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:10.600
assumed that I speak that
particular language, or subset

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:18.160
of songs, or know how to wear
a certain piece of regalia,

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.780
clothing.

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:28.660
And it's been a long while
from the very first film

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:34.950
that I worked on, when realizing
like I am not just an actor,

01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:37.670
I am an ambassador
and a teacher,

01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:40.500
and I have a whole lot of
other things on my shoulders

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:44.650
than just going out and
portraying this woman that I

01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:46.460
did all my history research on.

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:51.150
And I did all the things that
I would do from a point of view

01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:54.140
approaching any character.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:59.670
But it's gotten
better in the realms

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:05.680
of where there have been more
extensive casting directors who

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.500
do more extensive
work in finding people

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.180
from those traditions,
those tribes.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:16.850
But the thing that
I hold on to is

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:20.670
that I come from a
cultural perspective

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:23.370
of belonging to a tribe.

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:27.910
Strangely enough, I've never
spoken my own language, yet.

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:38.000
But so I have those abilities
to know what to ask for,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.530
and what to push
for, and who to ask,

01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:46.480
and who should be presented.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.849
And literally, on one
film, out of speaking

01:17:49.849 --> 01:17:51.390
with the producers
and the directors,

01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:57.340
they went and hired someone
to represent the tribe

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:02.530
that we were representing to
be there as a cultural advisor.

01:18:02.530 --> 01:18:07.200
And so that has that happens
more and more often, but still

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.390
not enough.

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:14.780
And to find that kind
of realm between someone

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:22.170
who has the financial power
to make this million dollar

01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:26.190
film be sold in some
form of distribution,

01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:30.360
yet at the same time
represents native people.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.850
Yet, you hear people say,
oh, well we looked for people

01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:34.600
but we couldn't find
them, because there's

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.400
nobody out there.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.160
And you go, what?

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.180
So it's been a long struggle.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:41.330
It is a long struggle.

01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:43.510
It will continue to be that way.

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:51.350
We just have to create
more of a group of people

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:54.120
from every community,
if that's the case, who

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.420
are both behind the camera,
in front of the camera.

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.860
That is something that our
production company is working

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:04.061
to do, and others are working
toward doing, is to create

01:19:04.061 --> 01:19:07.410
a workforce of us
in our communities

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:12.060
that understand and
know this business.

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.100
-[NON-ENGLISH]

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.780
-So will you all please
join me in thanking

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.280
our esteemed panelists?

01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:29.900
-That Was just an amazing panel.

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.880
Dr. Keene, everybody, thank
you, so much for everything

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.690
you've done today.

01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:38.862
And just one more round
of applause for the panel.

01:19:38.862 --> 01:19:40.312
Thank you.

01:19:40.312 --> 01:19:43.117
[CLAPPING]

01:19:43.117 --> 01:19:44.200
Go ahead, you guys can go.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:50.640
-Oh, any body that knows
April, she says hi.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.140
-All right.

01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:02.697
I'm going to say a few
concluding remarks here.

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.780
But I don't want to get
in the way of the picture,

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.540
so, make sure that's kosher.

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:14.839
What a day.

01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:24.470
Rob Porter told me that he would
win a bet if he said the term

01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:28.660
goat rodeo in his talk.

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:31.304
Rob, if I say it, do
you still win that bet?

01:20:31.304 --> 01:20:32.140
-No.

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:32.947
-OK.

01:20:32.947 --> 01:20:34.030
Do you want to say it now?

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:35.295
Because I didn't
hear you say it.

01:20:35.295 --> 01:20:35.794
-No.

01:20:35.794 --> 01:20:37.310
-OK.

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:39.390
He's willing to lose that bet.

01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:43.753
I'm absolving myself
of all responsibility.

01:20:43.753 --> 01:20:44.500
-I won it.

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:45.020
-Oh, OK.

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:45.520
You won.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:46.501
All right, so great.

01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:52.660
This is, in my 15
years at Harvard,

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.960
perhaps the most
meaningful, single day

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:56.760
that I've seen on this campus.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.150
It was just wonderful.

01:20:58.150 --> 01:20:58.650
[CLAPPING]

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.590
Thank you, every body here.

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:10.210
Just a couple
reflections to conclude.

01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:13.600
The diversity, we
kept on coming back

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.690
to stories and storytelling,
and the diversity of stories

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:20.260
that we've heard in, the
forms in which they were told.

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:25.190
Just this last panel, stories
being told through data.

01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:27.220
Adrienne's data.

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:31.460
Irene Bedard's data,
quantitative visual data.

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:35.170
Richard Guest's data on how
often people won or lost

01:21:35.170 --> 01:21:36.810
in front of the Supreme Court.

01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:41.600
Stories told with statistics,
a tool, of native politics.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.226
Stories through
visual representation.

01:21:44.226 --> 01:21:49.200
Matika Wilbur, obviously, but
also Kristiana Kahakauwila's

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.570
inversion or
resplicing, if you will,

01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:57.340
of the map of the Pacific,
of Oceana, I'm sorry.

01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:00.530
Stories told through
political battle tales

01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:05.630
won and lost, sometimes
funny, sometimes not funny.

01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:09.080
Stories through violence retold,
whether domestic violence,

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:13.950
sexual violence, symbolic
violence, military violence.

01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:18.590
Stories through song, not just
Frank Wong's beautiful hip hop,

01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:20.720
but also Jonathan
Perry this morning.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.360
Thank you, again.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.330
Story through comedy.

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:27.280
Story through tragedy.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.330
As I listened to
the third panel,

01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:34.300
with Kristiana Kahakauwila
repieced together the Pacific,

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:39.390
making whole again Oceana,
and as I wiped away two tears,

01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:42.360
I think there were
two, listening

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.490
to Frank Wong and
his song, and as I

01:22:45.490 --> 01:22:48.610
listen to Irene Bedard
talk about being

01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:52.130
whole on our feet, where the
left wing and the right wing

01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:54.820
are part of the same animal.

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:58.260
As I listened to
these storytellers,

01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:01.650
I realize that together,
everybody here today, we

01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:05.690
had, even if partially, been
made whole today ourselves.

01:23:05.690 --> 01:23:09.170
Maybe some of us had
even been healed.

01:23:09.170 --> 01:23:12.570
And for that I want to
thank the person who really

01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:15.050
is most responsible for
putting this all together,

01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:18.400
because she signed on to the
idea about a year and a half

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:18.900
ago, now.

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:20.860
A lot of planning goes
into this conference.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:25.240
And that's Dean Liz Cohen,
our fearless leader.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.550
And as of last
night, with the gift

01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:31.760
from Matika Wilbur, Chief Cohen.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.590
And I say that because
that was because that

01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:36.010
was Matika's thing.

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:39.280
Becky Wasserman, director of
academic ventures at Radcliffe.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.630
Paul Beran, this
amazing Radcliffe staff,

01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:44.830
that runs these
conferences like a machine

01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:47.050
that you can set your watch to.

01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:49.280
Right?

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:54.510
HUNAP and the amazing work
that you do, unbelievable work.

01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:57.120
Not to be forgotten,
Maggie McKinley who

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.910
has just done such amazing
planning work, and again

01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:03.680
my colleague.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.510
So today I hope we heard
native voices, native politics,

01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:11.370
native peoples
amplified at Harvard.

01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:15.230
And that by amplifying native
voices, Harvard and Radcliffe,

01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:19.430
again, to use the metaphor,
have been made more whole,

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:22.040
if just for a day.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.540
And as we move
forward, I'm reminded

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:27.090
of the daily work that
HUNAP, Shelly, and Dennis,

01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:30.930
and Jason, and Sam, and
others, and their students.

01:24:30.930 --> 01:24:33.960
The daily work that they
do in institutionalizing

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.730
that native voice at Harvard.

01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:38.820
And I'm reminded that,
in order, for Harvard

01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:43.550
to be made whole in the future,
today's conversation needs

01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:49.230
to happen again, and
again, and again.

01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:53.580
In order for Harvard
to be made whole,

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:58.000
the kinds of people you saw
today need to on our faculty.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:58.964
[CLAPPING]

01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:10.590
And in order for Harvard
to be made whole again,

01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:13.100
maybe some of the same
people you saw here today

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:17.800
need to be on our faculty,
Adrienne Keene, Maggie

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:22.920
McKinley, Kristiana
Kahakauwila, Alyssa Mt.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:28.210
Pleasant, Rob Porter, or
they, or others, and I

01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:31.010
apologize for anybody I
left out-- Matika, you, too,

01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:34.640
come teach here-- they
need to be on our faculty.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.120
And that's not all.

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.540
Harvard needs to recognize
the living reality

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:41.500
of Native American lives,
Native American languages,

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:44.010
Native American peoples.

01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:47.220
So today, native peoples did
native politics at Harvard.

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.250
Native peoples performed
native politics.

01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:52.460
And thank you to my native
sisters and brothers

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:53.850
for having done it.

01:25:53.850 --> 01:25:54.917
It was a beautiful.

01:25:54.917 --> 01:25:56.288
Thank you.

01:25:56.288 --> 01:25:57.659
[CLAPPING]

01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:05.970
-Well, it's been an amazing day.

01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:08.290
And I don't think
I need to say it,

01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:11.350
Dan, you said it so
beautifully, as has everyone.

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:15.770
I just want to thank the
organizers for this, Dan,

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:20.990
and Shelly, and Maggie,
Becky, Paul, the staff.

01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:23.880
This was a day when everybody
helped at the Radcliffe

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.020
Institute, as they do when
we have events like this,

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:29.800
and I want to thank
everybody for doing that.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.200
Our panelists were just,
one better than the other,

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.390
more moving than the
other, we are so grateful.

01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:38.900
People came from very
far away to be here.

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.610
And I also want to help to thank
the audience because I think

01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:47.690
you made this event as special
as it was by being so engaged,

01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:52.090
asking really honest questions,
putting yourselves out there,

01:26:52.090 --> 01:26:54.240
being part of the story.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.810
So now it's time to celebrate.

01:26:56.810 --> 01:27:01.420
We're just a door away
from food and drink.

01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:04.340
And it will be
wonderful to be together

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.780
in a more informal setting.

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:09.010
But please, join me once
again to thank everybody

01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:11.410
for making today possible.

01:27:11.410 --> 01:27:14.100
