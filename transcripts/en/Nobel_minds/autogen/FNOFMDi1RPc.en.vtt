00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 align:start position:0%
well that's it I mean it's quite
 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
well that's it I mean it's quite
mind-boggling<00:03:31.069><c> to</c><00:03:31.220><c> think</c><00:03:31.310><c> of</c><00:03:31.699><c> how</c><00:03:31.909><c> precise</c>

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 align:start position:0%

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 align:start position:0%
this piece of equipment is yeah that's

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 align:start position:0%
true and it took that's what took by the
 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.849 align:start position:0%
true and it took that's what took by the
way<00:03:37.699><c> I</c><00:03:37.970><c> think</c><00:03:38.569><c> the</c><00:03:38.780><c> easiest</c><00:03:39.079><c> way</c><00:03:39.230><c> to</c><00:03:39.260><c> say</c><00:03:39.530><c> it</c><00:03:39.709><c> is</c>

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 align:start position:0%
way I think the easiest way to say it is
 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.979 align:start position:0%
way I think the easiest way to say it is
that<00:03:39.889><c> the</c><00:03:40.519><c> concept</c><00:03:40.970><c> is</c><00:03:41.120><c> very</c><00:03:41.209><c> straightforward</c>

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 align:start position:0%
that the concept is very straightforward

that the concept is very straightforward
you<00:03:42.169><c> measure</c><00:03:42.979><c> the</c><00:03:43.159><c> time</c><00:03:43.370><c> it</c><00:03:43.400><c> takes</c><00:03:43.549><c> light</c><00:03:44.000><c> to</c>

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 align:start position:0%
you measure the time it takes light to
 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.539 align:start position:0%
you measure the time it takes light to

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 align:start position:0%
the gravitational wave and and you go
 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.270 align:start position:0%
the gravitational wave and and you go
and<00:03:49.579><c> you</c><00:03:49.639><c> measure</c><00:03:50.000><c> that</c><00:03:50.209><c> time</c><00:03:50.479><c> very</c><00:03:50.810><c> carefully</c>

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
and you measure that time very carefully

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 align:start position:0%
things are so small and I think the

things are so small and I think the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 align:start position:0%
easiest way to say it
 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.460 align:start position:0%
easiest way to say it
are<00:04:05.000><c> you</c><00:04:05.120><c> familiar</c><00:04:05.269><c> with</c><00:04:05.540><c> the</c><00:04:05.900><c> exponential</c>

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the exponential
 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.860 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the exponential
notation<00:04:06.620><c> can</c><00:04:07.159><c> I</c><00:04:07.250><c> use</c><00:04:07.400><c> that</c><00:04:07.430><c> you</c><00:04:07.819><c> can</c><00:04:08.030><c> yes</c><00:04:08.239><c> yeah</c>

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 align:start position:0%
notation can I use that you can yes yeah
 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.140 align:start position:0%
notation can I use that you can yes yeah
well<00:04:09.379><c> okay</c><00:04:09.709><c> I</c><00:04:09.919><c> think</c><00:04:10.310><c> the</c><00:04:10.519><c> best</c><00:04:10.669><c> way</c><00:04:10.819><c> of</c><00:04:10.940><c> saying</c>

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 align:start position:0%
well okay I think the best way of saying
 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.580 align:start position:0%
well okay I think the best way of saying
it<00:04:11.269><c> is</c><00:04:11.299><c> this</c><00:04:11.479><c> way</c><00:04:11.659><c> there</c><00:04:11.840><c> are</c><00:04:11.900><c> two</c><00:04:12.079><c> factors</c><00:04:12.379><c> of</c>

it is this way there are two factors of

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 align:start position:0%
of them was that the light wavelength
 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.129 align:start position:0%
of them was that the light wavelength
itself<00:04:19.489><c> is</c><00:04:19.639><c> ten</c><00:04:20.029><c> to</c><00:04:20.090><c> the</c><00:04:20.120><c> minus</c><00:04:20.180><c> six</c><00:04:20.690><c> meters</c>

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 align:start position:0%
itself is ten to the minus six meters
 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.490 align:start position:0%
itself is ten to the minus six meters
and<00:04:21.889><c> so</c><00:04:22.310><c> you</c><00:04:22.760><c> had</c><00:04:22.940><c> to</c><00:04:22.969><c> devise</c><00:04:23.450><c> a</c><00:04:23.479><c> way</c><00:04:24.020><c> to</c><00:04:24.080><c> make</c>

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 align:start position:0%
and so you had to devise a way to make
 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.540 align:start position:0%
and so you had to devise a way to make
light<00:04:24.800><c> which</c><00:04:25.099><c> has</c>

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 align:start position:0%

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 align:start position:0%
wavelength of 10 to minus 6 to go to be
 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.189 align:start position:0%
wavelength of 10 to minus 6 to go to be
good<00:04:29.060><c> enough</c><00:04:29.270><c> so</c><00:04:29.419><c> you</c><00:04:29.479><c> could</c><00:04:29.659><c> measure</c><00:04:29.810><c> 10</c><00:04:30.110><c> to</c>

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
good enough so you could measure 10 to
 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.490 align:start position:0%
good enough so you could measure 10 to

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 align:start position:0%
minus 18 meters and that is a factor of
 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.619 align:start position:0%
minus 18 meters and that is a factor of

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 align:start position:0%
took more effort and that was that you
 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.089 align:start position:0%
took more effort and that was that you
