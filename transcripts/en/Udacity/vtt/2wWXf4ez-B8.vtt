00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.230
In this practice session we'll
look back at the robot maze and

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.850
pirate fleet projects but
with the special focus on objects.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.820
You'll be making additions to each of
these projects using what you've learned

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.100
about structs and protocols.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.680
