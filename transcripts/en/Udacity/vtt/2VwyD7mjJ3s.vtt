00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.910
Okay, so Michael wanted to have a quiz here,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.550
'because Michael again, likes those sort of things and, and

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.450
I like to please Michael. So, we came up

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.810
with three possibilities, one of which we hope is right.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.210
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.620
&gt;&gt; And I've labeled them here in orange, A, B,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.800
and C and put little radio boxes next to 'em, so

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.050
you could select 'em. So which of those three hypotheses

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.530
are, is a good one to pick next? So, A is

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.380
a horizontal line that says everything above it should be a plus. B is a,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.930
another horizontal line that says everything above it should be a plus. And C is

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.290
a vertical line, like the last two

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.610
hypotheses that we found, that says everything to

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.090
the left should be a plus. So, which do you think is the right one? Go.
