00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.464
Now that you're familiar with graphing
horizontal and vertical lines,

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:05.374
I want you to practice
graphing your own.

00:00:05.374 --> 00:00:08.036
And now I can't have you draw
on your computer screen, so

00:00:08.036 --> 00:00:09.880
we're going to try something else.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.610
I want you to get a sheet of graph
paper, or you can print one out or

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.450
make your own, and I'm going to give
you the equation for four lines.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm going to ask you to graph them.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.620
Now let's say the four lines I gave you
wound up looking something like this.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.579
You can see that they enclose
this rectangle here, and

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.264
in that rectangle there are 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:37.770
11, 12 squares, these four lines enclose
a rectangle that has 12 squares.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.500
Now, I'm going to give you the equation
of four different lines and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.420
ask you to graph those yourself and

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.600
then count up the number of
squares inside those four lines.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.330
So what I want to know is how many
squares are inside the rectangle

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.610
formed by these four lines?

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.840
And the equations are here, and you can
enter the number of squares in this box.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.900
Now I really recommend you get a sheet
of graph paper, do this yourself, and

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.890
count up the squares.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.010
The practice is really useful.
