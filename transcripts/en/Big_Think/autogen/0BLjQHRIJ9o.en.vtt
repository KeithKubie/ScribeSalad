these things we actually strip away the
 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.070
these things we actually strip away the
name and we consider people's

applications we just look at how they

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390
applications we just look at how they
 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.780

we give them that really can try to test

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710
we give them that really can try to test
 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.080
we give them that really can try to test
their ability to be a data scientist and

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090
their ability to be a data scientist and
 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.370
their ability to be a data scientist and
test their understanding of these kind

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380
test their understanding of these kind
 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.650
test their understanding of these kind
of core fundamental mathematical and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660
of core fundamental mathematical and
 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.950
of core fundamental mathematical and
programming concepts and when we do that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960
programming concepts and when we do that
 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.200
programming concepts and when we do that
I think it actually becomes a much more

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210
I think it actually becomes a much more
 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.310
I think it actually becomes a much more
fair process and it actually can help

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320
fair process and it actually can help
 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.320
fair process and it actually can help
increase the number of women

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330
increase the number of women
 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.860
increase the number of women

break free from this and they were put
 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.430
break free from this and they were put
down a curtain between the performer

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440

to play for the new Orchestra and when
they did the results were night and day

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
they did the results were night and day

screening round shot up something like

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190
screening round shot up something like
 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.470
screening round shot up something like
seven fold between not having the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480
seven fold between not having the

curtain down and having a curtain down
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.280
curtain down and having a curtain down
and it just goes to sort of show that at

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290
and it just goes to sort of show that at
 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.380
and it just goes to sort of show that at
this time there was an implicit bias

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390
this time there was an implicit bias
 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.010
this time there was an implicit bias
that women weren't really the kind of

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020
that women weren't really the kind of
 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.199
that women weren't really the kind of
caliber of musician that you needed to

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209
caliber of musician that you needed to
 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.660
caliber of musician that you needed to
be able to perform at a Carnegie Hall

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670
be able to perform at a Carnegie Hall
 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.090
be able to perform at a Carnegie Hall
right at these kind of top that's kind

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100
right at these kind of top that's kind
 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.340
right at these kind of top that's kind
of top level symphonic performance and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350
of top level symphonic performance and
 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.110
of top level symphonic performance and
when you put down a curtain and you just

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120
when you put down a curtain and you just
 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.509
when you put down a curtain and you just
listened to them as opposed to being

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519
listened to them as opposed to being
 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.670
listened to them as opposed to being
able to see whether they were men a man

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680
able to see whether they were men a man
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.789
able to see whether they were men a man
or a woman you then without that kind of

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799
or a woman you then without that kind of
 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.560
or a woman you then without that kind of
knowledge you suddenly were forced to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
knowledge you suddenly were forced to
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.180
knowledge you suddenly were forced to
make judgments just based in the music

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190
make judgments just based in the music
 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.670
make judgments just based in the music
just based on their ability and you saw

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
just based on their ability and you saw
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.160
just based on their ability and you saw
that they the that you are much more

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170
that they the that you are much more
 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.180
that they the that you are much more
willing to let in women than before

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190
willing to let in women than before
 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.440
