carries much of the weight in terms of
 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.619
carries much of the weight in terms of
determining the answer so if we see

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629
determining the answer so if we see
 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.630
determining the answer so if we see
someone acting and behaving in a certain

avoid that what what the mind Sciences
suggest is that this basic model of the

of and around us so that if you go back
 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.890
of and around us so that if you go back
to that same person who is obese and you

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900
to that same person who is obese and you
 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.350
to that same person who is obese and you
look at their situation you begin to see

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360
look at their situation you begin to see

you reach that conclusion is really

00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779
you reach that conclusion is really
 

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:39.049
you reach that conclusion is really
nothing else the law shouldn't engage

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:39.059
nothing else the law shouldn't engage
 

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:43.279
nothing else the law shouldn't engage
with then the theory led to the

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:43.289
with then the theory led to the
 

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.319
with then the theory led to the
conclusion that we shouldn't do anything

00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:45.329
conclusion that we shouldn't do anything
 

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:48.259
conclusion that we shouldn't do anything
I was skeptical of that for some of the

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:48.269
I was skeptical of that for some of the
 

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:49.950
I was skeptical of that for some of the
same reasons that I had

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:49.960
same reasons that I had
 

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.380
same reasons that I had
I had grown skeptical of the sort of the

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:52.390
I had grown skeptical of the sort of the
 

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.300
I had grown skeptical of the sort of the

rational actor model in the healthcare
 

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.120
rational actor model in the healthcare
context generally and began studying

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.130
context generally and began studying
 

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.650
context generally and began studying
really what is the nature of the choice

00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:58.660
really what is the nature of the choice
 

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.500
really what is the nature of the choice
to smoke and in that process also began

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:03.510
to smoke and in that process also began
 

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.920
to smoke and in that process also began
studying the documents that the

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:06.930
studying the documents that the
 

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.820
studying the documents that the
manufacturers had and we're just

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:08.830
manufacturers had and we're just
 

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.130
manufacturers had and we're just
beginning to come out as whistleblowers

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.140
beginning to come out as whistleblowers
 

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.290
beginning to come out as whistleblowers
and others spirit of the spirit of them

away and sent them to lawyers lawyers

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:15.550
away and sent them to lawyers lawyers
 

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.060
away and sent them to lawyers lawyers
started sending them to me and I ended

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.070
started sending them to me and I ended
 

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.210
started sending them to me and I ended
up with a office full of tobacco

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.220
up with a office full of tobacco
 

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.550
up with a office full of tobacco
documents and spent the better part of a

year with with some research assistants

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.080
year with with some research assistants
 

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.110
year with with some research assistants
and future co-authors going through

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120
and future co-authors going through
 

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.820
and future co-authors going through
those documents and trying to understand

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:29.830
those documents and trying to understand
 

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.520
those documents and trying to understand
what the industry thought about the

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:32.530
what the industry thought about the
 

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.130
what the industry thought about the
smoker and the choice to smoke at the

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.140
smoker and the choice to smoke at the
 

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.370
smoker and the choice to smoke at the
end of that process I I came to the

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:38.380
end of that process I I came to the
 

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.100
end of that process I I came to the
conclusion that the industry was telling

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.110
conclusion that the industry was telling
 

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.140
conclusion that the industry was telling
us one thing telling us that we were

us one thing telling us that we were
 

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.770
us one thing telling us that we were
choosers and that and that we smoked

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:46.780
choosers and that and that we smoked
 

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.750
choosers and that and that we smoked
because we wanted to because it tasted

were saying the reasons that people
 

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.510
were saying the reasons that people
smoke are very different and they

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:57.520
smoke are very different and they
 

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.140

behavior of their consumers and
 

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.760
behavior of their consumers and
potential consumers with that knowledge

potential consumers with that knowledge
 

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.710
potential consumers with that knowledge
and some of the most important knowledge

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720
and some of the most important knowledge
 

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.730
and some of the most important knowledge
they used was psychology that that sort

area led me to more or less abandoned

cognition and other mind sciences so

that's a bit of the transition or what

that's a bit of the transition or what
