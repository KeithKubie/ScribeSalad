00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.250
Well, let's see.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.040
Hidden in these two
statements are two rates.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.080
The first compares 448
miles to seven hours, and

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.330
the other compares 496
miles to eight hours.

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:15.780
And we want to see which of these rates,
which of these speeds, is higher.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.290
So we're going to convert
them to a unit rate.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.030
So, let's see.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.880
For Rafael,
he went 448 miles in seven hours,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.910
448 is actually just seven times 64.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.340
So I have this, over this,
and notice the common factor.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.880
So we simplify, and this gives me
a unit rate of 64 miles over one hour.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.780
So again,
he was going 64 miles per hour.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.070
We can do the same thing for
Anastasia, and I notice that 496,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.400
is just eight times 62,
I see there's a common factor, and so

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.560
written as a unit rate,
Anastasia's speed is 62 miles per hour.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.950
64, once again, is bigger than 62,
so Raphael went faster.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.866
Even though Anastasia went farther,
496 versus 448 miles,

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.453
it took her an hour longer.

00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:09.210
To calculate their speeds,
I had to calculate a unit rate.
