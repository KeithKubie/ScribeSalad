00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that we want to evaluate

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.481
this indefinite integral right over here.

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:06.385
And you immediately say hey,
you've got the square root

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:09.217
of four mins X squared in the denominator,

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:10.982
you could try to use substitution,

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:13.094
but it really doesn't simplify this in any

00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:14.256
reasonable way.

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:15.974
How do you tackle this?

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.763
And an insight that you might have is well

00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:20.780
this thing, this square root
of four minus X squared,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.801
this looks like something that I might get

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.937
if I'm dealing with the
Pythagorean theorem,

00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:27.398
if I'm solving for non-hypotenuse sides

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:28.535
of the Pythagorean theorem,

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:31.044
especially if the length of the hypotenuse

00:00:31.044 --> 00:00:33.041
is two, this would be two squared

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.968
and then the other side is X,

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.454
then two squared minus X squared,

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:38.776
this would be the length
of the other side.

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:40.657
Well let's just run with that then.

00:00:40.657 --> 00:00:42.995
So, if we have,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.830
if we have a,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.546
and if any of you didn't
feel that inside immediately,

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:49.746
it's okay.

00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:52.673
Because to be honest, I
actually did not feel that

00:00:52.673 --> 00:00:55.754
inside probably the first
time I saw things like this.

00:00:56.593 --> 00:00:58.078
So let's say you have a right triangle.

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:01.307
So let's just visualize that
insight that we talked about.

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:04.991
So if the hypotenuse of the
right triangle is of length two,

00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:08.028
the hypotenuse is of length two,

00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:11.094
hypotenuse is of length two

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:14.183
and let's say this side, right over here.

00:01:14.183 --> 00:01:15.785
Actually, let me do this side.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:17.317
Let's say this side...

00:01:17.317 --> 00:01:18.432
Actually, I'm gonna go with this side.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:21.885
This side right over here is of length X.

00:01:22.723 --> 00:01:25.276
This side right over here is of length X.

00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:26.670
It's a little counter
intuitive, because normally

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.597
we associate this side over here with Y,

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:29.874
but let's just go with it.

00:01:29.874 --> 00:01:32.057
This side right over here is of length X.

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:33.983
Then what would this
side right over here be?

00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:37.668
What would this other
non-hypotenuse length be?

00:01:38.436 --> 00:01:41.362
Well, just if you solve for it
using the Pythagorean Theorem

00:01:41.362 --> 00:01:44.008
you get that it is going to be

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:48.073
the square root of the hypotenuse squared,

00:01:48.073 --> 00:01:50.202
two squared, which is just four,

00:01:51.156 --> 00:01:52.781
minus the other side squared.

00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:54.639
so minus X squared.

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.473
Well that's interesting,
that is this expression

00:01:56.473 --> 00:01:58.701
that insight, that intuition that we

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.815
may have had when we saw
this right over here,

00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:02.882
but still, how does that help us?

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:05.436
Well this is where the
trigonometry comes in.

00:02:05.436 --> 00:02:07.843
Because if we define,

00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:10.306
if this angle right over here,

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:12.303
we say this is theta,

00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:14.973
then what is sine and
cosine of theta going to be

00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:16.971
in terms of these sides?

00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:17.876
Well let's see,

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:19.432
the sine of theta,

00:02:19.432 --> 00:02:21.801
sine of theta is equal to the opposite

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:22.938
over the hypotenuse.

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:24.866
Is equal to X over two.

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:26.561
Or if you want to solve for X,

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:30.810
we get X is equal to two sine theta.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.229
Well that's interesting.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.017
What about the cosine of theta?

00:02:34.017 --> 00:02:37.522
Cosine of theta is equal
to the adjacent side,

00:02:37.522 --> 00:02:40.727
square root of four minus X squared

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.528
over the hypotenuse.

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.386
Or if you want to solve for this side,

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:46.011
it's going to be,

00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:48.401
we could say that the square root of four

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.330
minus X squared is going to be equal to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.044
the hypotenuse times the cosine of theta.

00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:55.155
So that's interesting.

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:57.406
If X is equal to two sine theta,

00:02:57.406 --> 00:02:59.612
then this other side, then
this entire expression

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:02.491
simplifies to two cosine theta.

00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:04.901
And that seems pretty interesting now.

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:06.736
So let's make the substitution.

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:11.736
Let's say that X is
equal to two sine theta.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.067
And if X is equal to two sine theta,

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:17.435
then DX is going to be equal to

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:21.956
two cosine theta D theta.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.924
And then if we have X as
equal to two sine theta,

00:03:24.924 --> 00:03:26.550
then what is this thing right over here?

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.526
Well we just figured out,

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:29.917
this thing is two cosine theta.

00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:32.007
This thing is equal to two,

00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:33.463
actually, let me do it
in that orange color.

00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:36.066
Two cosine theta.

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:39.432
This is equal to two cosine theta.

00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:40.988
And we were able to do this,

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:43.671
drawing this right triangle and using

00:03:43.671 --> 00:03:47.687
the sohcahtoa definition
of these trig functions,

00:03:47.687 --> 00:03:49.080
and obviously we could use units circle,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.543
that's kind of an extension of these.

00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:51.867
But you could also do it if you say

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:53.841
hey, look you know, if
this is two sine theta

00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:55.767
you could use the Pythagorean identity,

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:57.719
our trigonometric identities and you would

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.273
see that this entire expression,

00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:02.827
if you did it that way, would
simplify to two cosine theta.

00:04:02.827 --> 00:04:04.081
But now let's just run forward

00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:05.172
and let's see if we can evaluate it

00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:06.821
using this substitution.

00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:10.140
So this is going to be
the indefinite integral,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.067
so DX, so one times DX, that's going to be

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:15.017
DX is two cosine theta D theta.

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:16.619
So let me right that, that is

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:20.218
two cosine theta

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.285
D, I'll right the D theta out here,

00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:23.864
and then what's the denominator?

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:25.325
Square root of four minus X squared?

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:27.064
Well that's two cosine theta again.

00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:30.336
So that is two

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.334
cosine theta.

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:34.725
Well this seems to work out quite nicely.

00:04:34.725 --> 00:04:38.022
If you two cosine theta
over two cosine theta,

00:04:38.022 --> 00:04:39.601
that's just going to be one.

00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:41.296
This simplifies.

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:43.286
This simplifies to

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.841
D theta, which is, if
you just evaluate this,

00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:48.953
this is just going to be equal to

00:04:48.953 --> 00:04:51.648
theta plus C.

00:04:51.648 --> 00:04:55.013
Well, this is kind of nice,
but we're still not done.

00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:58.056
We want our indefinite integral

00:04:58.056 --> 00:05:00.657
in terms of X.

00:05:00.657 --> 00:05:02.723
So now let's just solve for X here.

00:05:02.723 --> 00:05:04.951
So if X is two cosine theta,

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:07.274
sorry, if X is two sine theta,

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:10.502
so X is equal to two sine,

00:05:10.502 --> 00:05:15.168
X is equal to two sine theta,

00:05:15.168 --> 00:05:17.072
then let's see, divide both sides by two.

00:05:17.072 --> 00:05:21.043
X over two is equal to sine theta.

00:05:21.043 --> 00:05:22.691
And then if you want to solve for theta,

00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.502
theta's the angle that if
you take the sine of it

00:05:24.502 --> 00:05:25.942
you get X over two.

00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:27.173
So we could say,

00:05:27.173 --> 00:05:29.216
let's give ourselves a
little bit more real estate,

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:30.369
that theta

00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:33.320
is equal to the inverse sine,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.175
the inverse sine of this thing,

00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:37.291
X over two.

00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:38.405
We could write it that way,

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:39.938
or we could write that theta

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:42.282
is equal to the arcsine.

00:05:42.282 --> 00:05:45.603
The arcsine of,

00:05:45.603 --> 00:05:48.506
the arcsine of X over two.

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:52.034
So this is going to be equal to the,

00:05:52.034 --> 00:05:53.938
theta is arcsine of X over two,

00:05:53.938 --> 00:05:55.215
so let's just do that.

00:05:55.215 --> 00:05:59.017
Arcsine of X over two

00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:01.085
plus C.

00:06:01.085 --> 00:06:01.898
And we're done.

00:06:01.898 --> 00:06:04.383
We've just evaluated
that indefinite integral.

00:06:04.383 --> 00:06:06.264
Now some of you might
have noticed something.

00:06:06.264 --> 00:06:08.841
I kind of brushed past it really fast

00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.744
just to give you the big,

00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:12.440
to see the forest for the trees,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.741
but there's some interesting details

00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:15.338
and it's, I think, worth digging

00:06:15.338 --> 00:06:17.265
into a little bit over here.

00:06:17.265 --> 00:06:19.262
So the first one is,
you might see that look

00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:21.467
the restriction on X here is,

00:06:21.467 --> 00:06:23.464
or the domain here on this expression

00:06:23.464 --> 00:06:24.626
is restricted.

00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:25.926
So let's just keep track of that

00:06:25.926 --> 00:06:27.551
to make sure that we
didn't do anything strange

00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:29.268
when we did that substitution.

00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:31.962
So the domain here, X has to be

00:06:32.678 --> 00:06:35.046
X has to be greater than negative two

00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:36.718
and less than two.

00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:38.878
If the absolute value
of X were equal to two,

00:06:38.878 --> 00:06:40.757
then you would have a
zero in the denominator.

00:06:40.757 --> 00:06:42.871
If the absolute value of
X is greater than two,

00:06:42.871 --> 00:06:45.262
then you're gonna have a
negative in the denominator

00:06:45.262 --> 00:06:46.726
and that's not defined.

00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:49.372
So this right over here is the domain.

00:06:49.372 --> 00:06:50.974
So let's make sure that our substitution

00:06:50.974 --> 00:06:52.948
didn't do anything weird with that.

00:06:52.948 --> 00:06:55.455
So if X has to be between
negative two and two,

00:06:55.455 --> 00:06:57.058
and we're saying X is two sine theta,

00:06:57.058 --> 00:06:58.475
that means two sine theta would have to be

00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:00.215
between negative two and two.

00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:03.583
So negative two would have to be less than

00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:05.092
two sine theta.

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:07.530
Two sine theta.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.710
Which would have to be less than two.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.191
We could divide all the
different parts of this

00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.652
compound inequality by two

00:07:15.652 --> 00:07:19.663
and you're gonna get negative
one is less than sine theta.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.635
Is less than sine theta,

00:07:22.635 --> 00:07:25.074
which is less than one.

00:07:25.074 --> 00:07:29.834
And the way we can do that is if theta

00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:33.085
is less than pi over two.

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:35.987
At pi over two, sine of
theta would be equal to one.

00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:39.098
And if theta is greater
than negative pi over two.

00:07:39.098 --> 00:07:40.562
So if we restrict it in this way,

00:07:40.562 --> 00:07:42.141
if we say theta is going to be

00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:44.438
in this range right over here,

00:07:44.438 --> 00:07:48.932
then we are restricting our
domain in a reasonable way.

00:07:49.762 --> 00:07:52.626
And this works out well
because this typically is

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:56.736
the range for the arcsine function.

00:07:56.736 --> 00:07:58.617
So we could feel good about that.

00:07:58.617 --> 00:08:00.033
Now another question that you might have

00:08:00.033 --> 00:08:01.518
is okay well look, you know we divided

00:08:01.518 --> 00:08:03.261
by cosine of theta here, but that's okay

00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:05.744
as long as cosine of
theta does not equal zero,

00:08:05.744 --> 00:08:07.626
'cause you don't want a
zero in the denominator.

00:08:07.626 --> 00:08:10.273
And the good thing about
this restriction on theta

00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:13.708
is as long as theta is greater than

00:08:13.708 --> 00:08:16.310
negative pi over two and
less than pi over two,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.330
cosine of theta is going to be,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.584
it's not going to be zero, and actually

00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:21.696
it's going to be positive.

00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:25.133
If negative pi over two or
pi over two were allowed,

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:26.804
then you would get a zero down here

00:08:26.804 --> 00:08:27.780
and we would have to think about

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.731
restricting things in some other ways.

00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:31.936
So it looks like everything is cool.

00:08:31.936 --> 00:08:33.514
We dug a little deeper.

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:34.839
We said, okay we haven't done anything

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:36.666
strange to the domain or to,

00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:40.336
unrestricted it some strange way,

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:41.729
and so we can feel,

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:44.120
we can feel good about,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.559
we can feel good about this,

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:47.823
about this,

00:08:48.805 --> 00:08:51.404
this answer that we've gotten.
