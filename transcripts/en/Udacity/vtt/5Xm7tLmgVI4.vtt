00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:10.667
with the compound inequality that it represents. These are definitely a little

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:14.247
bit tricky. And I know that or is kind of a new concept for us. But just give it

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:17.727
a try. Start with the ones that you're sure about. And then move onto the ones

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:19.596
that you're not totally positive about.
