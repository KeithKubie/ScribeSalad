the time nowadays but the kind of very
ancient kind that we have formed for

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690
ancient kind that we have formed for
 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.500
ancient kind that we have formed for
hundreds of thousands of years and I

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510
hundreds of thousands of years and I
 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.110
hundreds of thousands of years and I
study how we humans come to form these

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120
study how we humans come to form these
 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.600
study how we humans come to form these
very elaborate networks and what these

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610
very elaborate networks and what these
 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.990
very elaborate networks and what these
networks come to mean for our lives and

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000
networks come to mean for our lives and
 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.920
networks come to mean for our lives and
the sort of the field as it were of of

the medical sociology is concerned with

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629
the medical sociology is concerned with
 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.650
the medical sociology is concerned with
all sorts of phenomena social processes

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660
all sorts of phenomena social processes
 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.959
all sorts of phenomena social processes
and social phenomena that influence

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969
and social phenomena that influence
 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.860
and social phenomena that influence
health and healthcare so but I'm focused

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870
health and healthcare so but I'm focused
 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.479
health and healthcare so but I'm focused
primarily on a I would say a subset of

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489
primarily on a I would say a subset of
 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.310
primarily on a I would say a subset of
that or not a subset but a different

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320
that or not a subset but a different
 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.680
that or not a subset but a different
field let's say Network science

mathematical and biological roles that
 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.050
mathematical and biological roles that
govern how human beings come to form

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060
govern how human beings come to form
 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.760
govern how human beings come to form
social networks the structure of

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770
social networks the structure of
 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.100
social networks the structure of
networks and then we've also examined

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110
networks and then we've also examined
 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.760
networks and then we've also examined
the kind of social and psychological

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770
the kind of social and psychological
 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.120
the kind of social and psychological
rules or attributes of how social

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130
rules or attributes of how social
 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.570
rules or attributes of how social
networks function so how do we form

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580
networks function so how do we form
 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.310
networks function so how do we form
social networks and how do they affect

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320
social networks and how do they affect
 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.410
social networks and how do they affect
our lives and it's what we would

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420
our lives and it's what we would
 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.120
our lives and it's what we would
consider to be the anatomy and the

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130
consider to be the anatomy and the
 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.120
consider to be the anatomy and the
physiology of a kind of human super

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130
physiology of a kind of human super
 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.610
physiology of a kind of human super
organism in a very fundamental way we

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620
organism in a very fundamental way we
 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.070
organism in a very fundamental way we
are we're like ants or actually kind of

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080
are we're like ants or actually kind of
 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.590
are we're like ants or actually kind of
like fungi to where individual human

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600
like fungi to where individual human
 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600
like fungi to where individual human
beings assemble themselves into these

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610
beings assemble themselves into these
 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.660
beings assemble themselves into these
elaborate complex structures and we're

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
elaborate complex structures and we're
 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.610
elaborate complex structures and we're
James Fowler and I my co-author are

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620
James Fowler and I my co-author are
 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.950
James Fowler and I my co-author are
deeply concerned with how and why we

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960
deeply concerned with how and why we
 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.390
deeply concerned with how and why we
form these structures and what they mean

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400
form these structures and what they mean
 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.030
form these structures and what they mean
for our lives so in the book we we

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040
for our lives so in the book we we
 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.190
for our lives so in the book we we
present about we we talked a lot about

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200
present about we we talked a lot about
 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.530
present about we we talked a lot about
our own research but we also pull in the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540
our own research but we also pull in the
 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.600
our own research but we also pull in the
research of many other scientists who've

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
research of many other scientists who've
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.370
research of many other scientists who've
been looking at a variety of phenomena

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380
been looking at a variety of phenomena
 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.380
been looking at a variety of phenomena
and we we talk about the role of social

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390
and we we talk about the role of social
 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.380
and we we talk about the role of social
networks in in human emotions we talk

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390
networks in in human emotions we talk
 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.150
networks in in human emotions we talk
about the role of social networks in in

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160
about the role of social networks in in
 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.300
about the role of social networks in in
human romantic and sexual behavior in in

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310
human romantic and sexual behavior in in
 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.180
human romantic and sexual behavior in in
health in politics and in economics and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190
health in politics and in economics and
 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.280
health in politics and in economics and
then we also talk a little bit about the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290
then we also talk a little bit about the
 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.340
then we also talk a little bit about the
genetics of human social networks and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350
genetics of human social networks and
 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.920
genetics of human social networks and
the sort of modern online variety of

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930
the sort of modern online variety of
 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.660
the sort of modern online variety of
social interactions and then we close

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670
social interactions and then we close
 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.160
social interactions and then we close
with an argument in the book about why

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170
with an argument in the book about why
 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.990
with an argument in the book about why
why we form social networks and what in

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
why we form social networks and what in
 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.340
why we form social networks and what in
a very deep sense they mean for our

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350
a very deep sense they mean for our
 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.620
a very deep sense they mean for our
lives
