00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.730
&gt;&gt; Well from what we know and the ?? has forecast,
2009 is not going to be a good year for the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.490
world economy. Industrialized countries are
actually going to shrink. Developing countries

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.869
are going to grow, some more than others,
but I would think that from the existing projections,

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.390
for most countries, the restoration of growth
is going to take place a little towards the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:37.110
end of 2009. And hopefully, 2010 will be the
year when you can say growth is getting back

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.350
to normal, but it won't be as good as it was
a year or two ago.
