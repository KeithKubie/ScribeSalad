00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:02.889 align:start position:0%
 
perhaps<00:10:00.649><c> I</c><00:10:01.160><c> don't</c><00:10:01.310><c> feel</c><00:10:01.940><c> that</c><00:10:02.180><c> was</c><00:10:02.389><c> hinted</c><00:10:02.810><c> at</c>

00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:02.899 align:start position:0%
perhaps I don't feel that was hinted at
 

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:04.750 align:start position:0%
perhaps I don't feel that was hinted at
enough<00:10:03.230><c> I</c><00:10:03.410><c> that</c><00:10:03.800><c> would</c><00:10:03.889><c> be</c><00:10:04.040><c> a</c><00:10:04.070><c> little</c><00:10:04.310><c> jar</c><00:10:04.550><c> if</c>

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
enough I that would be a little jar if
 

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.699 align:start position:0%
enough I that would be a little jar if
there<00:10:04.940><c> is</c><00:10:05.060><c> more</c><00:10:05.300><c> of</c><00:10:05.449><c> the</c><00:10:05.600><c> dog</c><00:10:05.810><c> line</c><00:10:06.110><c> I'm</c><00:10:06.440><c> all</c>

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:06.709 align:start position:0%
there is more of the dog line I'm all
 

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
there is more of the dog line I'm all
about<00:10:06.949><c> I</c><00:10:07.010><c> mean</c><00:10:07.160><c> I'm</c><00:10:07.370><c> all</c><00:10:07.490><c> about</c><00:10:07.699><c> talk</c><00:10:08.000><c> but</c><00:10:08.300><c> I</c>

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:08.329 align:start position:0%
about I mean I'm all about talk but I
 

00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:09.970 align:start position:0%
about I mean I'm all about talk but I
feel<00:10:08.570><c> like</c><00:10:08.720><c> you</c><00:10:08.990><c> know</c><00:10:09.079><c> they</c><00:10:09.260><c> could</c><00:10:09.470><c> do</c><00:10:09.680><c> it</c><00:10:09.800><c> I</c>

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:09.980 align:start position:0%
feel like you know they could do it I
 

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
feel like you know they could do it I
would<00:10:10.100><c> be</c><00:10:10.220><c> like</c><00:10:10.399><c> that</c><00:10:10.550><c> would</c><00:10:10.790><c> be</c><00:10:10.940><c> weird</c><00:10:11.209><c> though</c>

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:11.329 align:start position:0%
would be like that would be weird though
 

00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:15.310 align:start position:0%
would be like that would be weird though
why<00:10:11.750><c> just</c><00:10:12.110><c> it</c><00:10:12.320><c> last</c><00:10:12.589><c> I</c><00:10:12.769><c> can</c><00:10:12.920><c> dump</c><00:10:13.279><c> in</c><00:10:14.079><c> like</c><00:10:15.079><c> just</c>

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
why just it last I can dump in like just
 

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.259 align:start position:0%
why just it last I can dump in like just
off<00:10:15.620><c> we</c><00:10:16.070><c> hinted</c><00:10:16.310><c> at</c><00:10:16.550><c> it</c><00:10:16.699><c> a</c><00:10:16.790><c> little</c><00:10:16.970><c> in</c><00:10:17.180><c> the</c>

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:17.269 align:start position:0%
off we hinted at it a little in the
 

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:19.449 align:start position:0%
off we hinted at it a little in the
middle<00:10:17.300><c> but</c><00:10:17.570><c> like</c><00:10:18.139><c> I</c><00:10:18.170><c> thought</c><00:10:18.589><c> if</c><00:10:19.190><c> there's</c><00:10:19.339><c> a</c>

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:19.459 align:start position:0%
middle but like I thought if there's a
 

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:21.250 align:start position:0%
middle but like I thought if there's a
maybe<00:10:19.639><c> it</c><00:10:19.970><c> depends</c><00:10:20.329><c> are</c><00:10:20.480><c> they</c><00:10:20.510><c> right</c><00:10:20.779><c> it</c><00:10:20.930><c> in</c>

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:21.260 align:start position:0%
maybe it depends are they right it in
 

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.769 align:start position:0%
maybe it depends are they right it in
yeah<00:10:21.470><c> but</c><00:10:21.829><c> I</c><00:10:22.040><c> mean</c><00:10:22.100><c> I'm</c><00:10:22.639><c> always</c><00:10:22.850><c> for</c><00:10:23.240><c> more</c><00:10:23.510><c> talk</c>

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:23.779 align:start position:0%
yeah but I mean I'm always for more talk
 

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
yeah but I mean I'm always for more talk
so<00:10:24.380><c> if</c><00:10:24.829><c> there's</c><00:10:25.100><c> more</c><00:10:25.160><c> focus</c><00:10:25.430><c> on</c><00:10:25.760><c> the</c><00:10:25.850><c> dogs</c>

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:26.209 align:start position:0%
so if there's more focus on the dogs
 

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.460 align:start position:0%
so if there's more focus on the dogs
because<00:10:26.360><c> they</c><00:10:26.480><c> certainly</c><00:10:26.660><c> have</c><00:10:26.990><c> that</c><00:10:27.199><c> that</c>

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:27.470 align:start position:0%
because they certainly have that that
 

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
because they certainly have that that
bit<00:10:27.649><c> in</c><00:10:27.769><c> the</c><00:10:27.800><c> middle</c><00:10:27.949><c> and</c><00:10:28.160><c> that</c><00:10:28.220><c> kind</c><00:10:28.459><c> of</c>

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:28.490 align:start position:0%
bit in the middle and that kind of
 

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.259 align:start position:0%
bit in the middle and that kind of
disappeared

00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:29.269 align:start position:0%
disappeared
 

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:32.170 align:start position:0%
disappeared
uh<00:10:29.560><c> if</c><00:10:30.560><c> I</c><00:10:30.860><c> can't</c><00:10:31.250><c> see</c><00:10:31.399><c> it</c><00:10:31.490><c> coming</c><00:10:31.610><c> back</c><00:10:31.880><c> back</c>

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:32.180 align:start position:0%
uh if I can't see it coming back back
 

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
uh if I can't see it coming back back
quickly<00:10:32.899><c> like</c><00:10:33.230><c> if</c><00:10:33.500><c> there</c><00:10:33.649><c> was</c><00:10:33.769><c> more</c><00:10:33.949><c> focus</c><00:10:34.250><c> I</c>

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.370 align:start position:0%
quickly like if there was more focus I
 

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.129 align:start position:0%
quickly like if there was more focus I
could<00:10:34.519><c> see</c><00:10:34.730><c> if</c><00:10:34.820><c> I</c><00:10:34.940><c> at</c><00:10:35.060><c> the</c><00:10:35.209><c> most</c><00:10:35.480><c> maybe</c><00:10:35.720><c> again</c><00:10:36.110><c> I</c>

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:36.139 align:start position:0%
could see if I at the most maybe again I
 

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:38.139 align:start position:0%
could see if I at the most maybe again I
could<00:10:36.350><c> see</c><00:10:36.500><c> like</c><00:10:36.680><c> a</c><00:10:36.920><c> quick</c><00:10:37.490><c> bit</c><00:10:37.699><c> at</c><00:10:37.850><c> the</c><00:10:38.029><c> end</c>

00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:38.149 align:start position:0%
could see like a quick bit at the end
 

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:41.019 align:start position:0%
could see like a quick bit at the end
like<00:10:38.360><c> leading</c><00:10:38.750><c> into</c><00:10:39.079><c> season</c><00:10:39.410><c> four</c><00:10:39.709><c> but</c><00:10:39.980><c> if</c><00:10:40.699><c> not</c>

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:41.029 align:start position:0%
like leading into season four but if not
 

00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:42.610 align:start position:0%
like leading into season four but if not
I<00:10:41.300><c> think</c><00:10:41.540><c> they</c><00:10:41.750><c> just</c><00:10:41.779><c> ever</c><00:10:42.170><c> come</c><00:10:42.380><c> back</c><00:10:42.500><c> in</c>

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:42.620 align:start position:0%
I think they just ever come back in
 

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.110 align:start position:0%
I think they just ever come back in
season<00:10:42.800><c> four</c><00:10:43.100><c> cuz</c><00:10:43.279><c> there's</c><00:10:43.459><c> really</c><00:10:43.639><c> no</c><00:10:43.910><c> reason</c>

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
season four cuz there's really no reason
 

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.610 align:start position:0%
season four cuz there's really no reason
