00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.330
Oxytocin is often mislabeled as the love hormone,
but it’s responsible for a wide range of

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:15.349
biological processes. So some researchers
are starting to use the hormone as medicine.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.279
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.850
Oxytocin is often cited as being responsible
for a crazy little thing called love. It’s

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.010
a hormone with this chemical structure. It’s
made in the brain, in the hypothalamus and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
is secreted by the pituitary gland and lots
of thing increase our body’s production

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.260
of it. Not just love.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.149
It’s more accurate to called it the social
hormone. Yes it’s released in both sexes

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.230
during climax, but it also performs a wide
variety of social functions. It bonds mothers

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.489
to their children. It’s released when women
breastfeed their babies. But it’s also released

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.950
when we look at our dogs. And it also plays
a role in fear and anxiety which we’ve talked

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.280
about in another episode. (Link down below)
So it does so much more than make us fall

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.280
in love.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.180
It can also be used as medicine. It’s been
used to induce labor and control bleeding

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.539
of childbirth for years. But it can help in
so many other ways.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.560
It MAY even help sober us up. Well it definitely
sobers rats up. In study published in the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.939
journal Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences researchers got rats drunk and

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.659
made them do a sobriety test which tested
their coordination. One group of rats was

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.509
given a dose of oxytocin along with their
alcohol while the other group had alcohol

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.759
alone. The researchers found that the rats
with oxytocin retained the full use of the

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.180
coordination skills even while drunk!

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.430
The oxytocin sobered up the rats by acting
on the same receptors in the brain as alcohol,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.869
the delta-subunit GABA-A receptors. When alcohol
acts on these receptors, it blocks the brain’s

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.619
ability to fine tune motor control. But oxytocin
doesn’t work on other receptors that alcohol

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.960
effects, so you would still feel inebriated.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.770
The researchers wondered whether or not oxytocin
would be a good mechanism for a new type of

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.079
drug that could work with alcohol related
disorders. But worried that drug that stopped

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.420
people from getting sloppy drunk would only
encourage more drinking.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.229
Oxytocin as medicine would be more than just
be as a drinking buddy. It could actually

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.799
help people make more buddies. Making friends
is hard for anyone, but many people who live

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.259
with psychiatric disorders especially struggle
with social situations. One small study published

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.840
in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences found that oxytocin could help.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.110
This study found that just one sniff of an
oxytocin nasal spray improved brain function

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.129
in some children with autism. While a deficiency
of oxytocin isn’t a specifically autism

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.030
related trait, levels of oxytocin vary naturally
from person to person. In this study researchers

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.050
gave participants a nasal spray filled with
oxytocin or a placebo. Those who got the oxytocin

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.590
spray showed greater brain activity in the
regions associated with rewards and emotion

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.150
recognition when performing a social task.
Basically their brains rewarded them more

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.450
when they participated in social tasks than
those who just had the placebo spray.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.879
Oxytocin can even help those who suffer from
phobias according to a study published in

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.860
the journal Biological Psychiatry. Most people
are afraid of something, like spiders or heights;

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.110
maybe you were bit by a dog when you were
a kid and now you’re terrified of them;

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.190
that’s what psychologists called conditioning.
But now your girlfriend has a dog and well…

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.720
you’d like to get over that fear. That’s
going to take a little reconditioning.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.959
The traditional approach is to expose a patient
to their fear gradually over time and in a

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.340
safe environment. That way the alarm system
in their brain can learn to calm down, it

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.440
can learn there’s no real threat around
that fear. This overwriting of the memory

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.860
is called extinction. But extinction is a
long and hard process. There’s the trauma

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.129
of being exposed to the fear and relapses.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.500
But oxytocin makes that overwriting process
go a little faster. In this study, researchers

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.720
created a fear response in participants by
giving them a little electric shock when they

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.890
looked at a certain picture. Brain scans revealed
that this created a fear response in their

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.069
brain every time they saw the picture. The
researchers then gave half the participants

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.069
a nasal spray of oxytocin and the other half
a placebo. And then the researchers overwrote

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.580
the fear memory by showing the picture without
the shock. They found that the fear center

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.239
of the brain the amygdala, showed less activity
in those who got oxytocin than those who got

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.299
the placebo.

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.340
But before you run off and try to fix your
fears with oxytocin, researchers from Concordia

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.000
University's Centre for Research in Human
Development caution to not use it off label,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.939
because it can cause less than desired other
effects.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.290
If you want a boost to your mood, there’s
no medicine like telling that special person

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.450
in your life how much they mean to you. Kay
Jewelers can help you do just that. Every

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.989
kiss begins with Kay.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.709
As for those less desired other effects, oxytocin
doesn’t just cause warm and fuzzy feelings.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.250
In one study researchers found it can lead
people to be overly sensitive to other people’s

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.150
emotions. Which isn’t always a good thing.
They give the example of your boss being uncomfortable

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.660
in their chair and making a face, and if you’re
overly sensitive thanks to oxytocin you might

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.660
think that was face about you.
Oxytocin can also increase the strength of

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.270
memories of negative social situations and
increase fear and anxiety. So if you have

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.440
questions about the dark side of the so called
love hormone, check out this video right here.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:03.039
So would you ever take oxytocin? or have you?

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:09.810
tell us about it?
