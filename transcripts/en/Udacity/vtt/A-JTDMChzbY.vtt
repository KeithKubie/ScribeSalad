The decision variant of vertex cover can be solved in 2.4^k&lt;i&gt;nÂ³ time and this is by far&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.730
not the best algorithm for vertex cover there is and I'm soon going to tell you a little bit about that.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.710
Even with this, think about what that means and I'm actually going to quiz you on this one.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.180
Does it mean that for any fixed k, vertex cover can be solved in polynomial time?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.950
Does it mean that the running time is independent of the size of the input graph?

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.240
Or have I been tricking you all along and it's actually the case that P=NP?

00:00:32.240 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check all of those that are correct.
