Vsauce!

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.220
Kevin here!

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.140
On planet sMars.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.510
Simulated Mars -- an eerie and otherworldly
corner of the world located on the barren

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.170
slopes of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.820
National Geographic's upcoming show "Mars"
details the realities of colonizing the Red

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.679
Planet, and I partnered with them to talk
about the future of living in a place like

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.119
this.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.579
After 12-months of seclusion, six scientists,
not quite astronauts but lavanauts, have emerged

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.330
from studying what life on an inhabited Mars
might be like.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.230
How do we keep our bodies functioning in a
place not meant for us?

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.670
More importantly, 140 million miles from Earth’s
oxygen, gravity and family -- how do we keep

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.140
our minds functioning?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.400
The Hawai’i Space Exploration and Analog
Simulation, or HI-SEAS, is a geodesic dome

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.830
with around 1,300 sq feet of livable space
designed for six scientists.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.680
A two-way software-imposed 20 minute time
delay on communication mimics the speed of

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.180
light message restriction between Mars and
Earth.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.750
Amenities includes a dining area, a kitchen,
a bathroom, an exercise area and six bedrooms.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.750
Leaving the habitat, or hab for short, requires
a Hazmat suit which simulates the encumbering

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.580
spacesuit needed for performing geology-related
tasks on Mars.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.310
On actual Mars, astronauts will need spacesuits
for warmth and oxygen, as well as pressure.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.560
The thin atmosphere on Mars would cause Earthling
eyeballs, lungs and skin to dry out.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.600
Like a lot.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.300
Since it costs $10,000 per pound to blast
things into space, survival items are kept

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.729
to a bare minimum.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.950
Everything needs to be recycled.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.360
Filtered urine waters plants, and lights of
optimal wavelength help them grow.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.220
A day’s worth of sun charges batteries for
a day and a half of power.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.409
There's composting toilet, a pedicycle charges
small devices like iPads, and the clean water

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.700
used for their 30-second showers becomes grey
water used to mop the floor.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.880
Primary funding for HI-SEAS IV came from the
NASA Behavioral Health and Performance Element

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.920
-- they want to find out how crews adapt to
each other under such stressful, confined

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.050
and isolated environments.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.370
Board games help bonding and mental stimulation.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.420
Musical instruments like Andrezj’s guitar
and Shey’s didgeridoo help the lavanauts

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.690
stay connected to culture.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.500
Plush animals like Raspberry and Trouble can
substitute for real pets and bring moments

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.120
of levity to a serious situation.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.230
They act as a social bridge, a comfort-object-conduit
for bringing people together.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.630
Every little way to boost morale is vital
because once humans leave the planet, even

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.890
things that bring joy can also bring sadness.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.030
Astronauts frequently cite being able to see
the Earth as one of their most rewarding,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.569
beautiful experiences, but seeing Earth as
a tiny, insignificant dot can increase sensations

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.349
of distance and loneliness… and this ‘Overview
Effect’ can also inspire crews to focus

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.090
on the importance of protecting their planet.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.480
&nbsp;Exploring is complicated -- we don’t know
what’s beyond the horizon, but like that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.879
one kid in kindergarten -- &nbsp;someone’s always
willing to taste the crayon.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.209
The word Pioneer comes from the Old French
‘paonier,’ meaning “foot soldier”

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.569
-- the first people to face danger.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.560
From pre-historic times to Paradise, Nevada
- humans have constantly pushed their boundaries.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.599
But while over 90% of the ocean remains unexplored,
we are enchanted by life among the stars.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.790
In 1865, Jules Verne’s “From the Earth
to the Moon” suggested we fire men out of

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.680
a huge cannon to launch them into space.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.019
We developed rocket propulsion instead -- and
the challenge now is to figure out how to

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.900
live beyond Earth’s atmosphere.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.790
That starts with finding the right people.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.709
The kind of person that on the day of being
the first human launched into space was calming

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.570
everyone else down.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.850
On the day of the launch, the head of the
Soviet space program said of space pioneer

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.530
Yuri Gagarin, “During the days of preparation
of the launch, when everyone had more than

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.459
his share of concerns, apprehensions, and
anxieties, he alone seemed to keep calm.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.240
More than that: he was full of good spirits
and beamed like the sun.”

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.430
Yuri was in space for an hour and forty eight
minutes.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.949
An unbelievable accomplishment at a time when
scientists weren’t sure whether eyeballs

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:36.729
would warp in zero gravity and make astronauts
blind -- but it’s not even enough time to

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.410
watch Star Wars.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.919
And 1969’s Space Race-winning manned moon-landing
mission Apollo 11 took just over eight days

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.360
total or 96 viewings of Star Wars Episode
IV A New Hope...the point is...

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.360
The current record for longest consecutive
time spent in space is held by Valeri Polyakov

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.880
aboard the space station Mir - clocking in
at 437.7 days.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.310
Mars could be a three year trip.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.370
It’s roughly nine months each way if we
launch when Earth and Mars are closest in

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.710
their respective orbits.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.740
Add in time spent on the surface and it’s
about three years living in the most unnatural

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.490
and isolated environment ever attempted by
humans.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.060
&nbsp;And we’re no stranger to making ourselves...strangers.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.610
Searching for new lands requires a fearless
portion of the species to venture out into

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.040
unknown territory -- to be curious and to
take action.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.970
Clara Ma, a 12 year old girl in Kansas, gave
the Mars rover “Curiosity” its name, saying

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.490
that, “curiosity is the passion that drives
us through our everyday lives."

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.340
&nbsp;And those of us who stay behind revel in
hearing the stories of the curious.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.180
Tales of great adventure date back to one
of humanity’s oldest stories - Homer’s

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.630
Odyssey, an 8th century BC epic poem documenting
Odysseus’s ten year journey home after the

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.720
Trojan War, which includes having a Cyclops
toss half a mountain at him, contending with

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.410
the lure of the Sirens, and fighting off the
six-headed monster Scylla.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.030
Despite all that - he made it home.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.030
And with Greek monsters behind us we look
forward to conquering a planet named for a

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.570
Roman God.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.990
Baby steps from leaving the atmosphere to
walking on the moon to entering Mars - informed

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.940
by what we've learned from the solitude of
pioneers and prisoners.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.249
The 1862 Homestead Act granted settlers 160
acres of land -- about twice the size of Disneyland

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:43.360
-- separated people from each other and long,
harsh winters seemed to erase all plant and

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.560
animal life.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.620
“Prairie madness”, caused depression,
increased violence, and even total mental

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.100
breakdown.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.039
Things got really lonely in the little house
on the prairie.

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.560
On sea, things get even lonelier.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.280
Calenture was a feverish delirium afflicting
sailors in the Tropics that could manifest

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.139
in picturing the water as a grassy meadows
and diving overboard.

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:12.600
Traveling to Earth’s most remote reaches
of Antarctica reveals solitude that hurts.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.900
Australian Meteorologist Morton Moyes, who
spent 10 weeks alone in Queen Mary Land wrote

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.940
in 1912, “The silence is so painful now
that I have a continual singing in my left

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:33.270
ear, much like a Barrel Organ, only it's the
same tune.”

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.800
If the sound of silence is painful -- what
happens when you’re cut off from your own

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800
senses?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.270
A 1951 study at McGill University, that would
never be approved today, looked at the effects

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.450
of solitary confinement - a method of punishing
prisoners.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.870
It was scheduled to last six weeks; it was
abandoned after one.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:59.300
In a room with only a bed, subjects wore goggles
and earphones to limit their senses.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:05.229
They reported being unable, &nbsp;“to think
clearly about anything for any length of time.”

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:10.699
Those who could think became mentally trapped,
hallucinating about things like eyeglasses

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:11.849
and dogs.

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:20.210
In a tiny room, in controlled conditions,
monitored by researchers - they were lost.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.880
In themselves.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.550
Seemingly simple tasks can go haywire in isolation.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.690
When French geologist Michel Siffre resurfaced
after 8 weeks under a glacier in the French

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:36.179
alps, it took him five minutes to count 120
seconds.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:41.380
And sociologist Maurizio Montalbini spent
a full year inside a cavern designed by NASA

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.089
to study isolation.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:46.800
He thought it was only 219 days.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.370
Somehow in that cave, 146 days were lost.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.699
Without social and environmental cues, time
begins to stretch and warp.

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:02.149
So for space travel we’re working on ways
to preserve the mind.

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:06.819
A dinner table was requested by Astronauts
on the International Space Station so they

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:10.230
could build camaraderie and be comforted by
eating together.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:17.129
Music is so important to combat cultural isolation
that since Apollo 15 in 1971, NASA has beamed

00:09:17.129 --> 00:09:19.709
songs into space as wake-up calls.

00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:26.300
We need to share jokes, songs, and struggles
with others to keep a connection to Earth

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.300
and to ourselves.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.959
Otherwise we could become like Mr. Bedford
in H.G. Wells’ 1901 book “The First Men

00:09:31.959 --> 00:09:35.579
In The Moon” whose journey into infinite
space included experiencing,

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:41.239
“... a sort of idea that really I was something
quite outside not only the world, but all

00:09:41.239 --> 00:09:47.089
worlds, and out of space and time, and that
this poor Bedford was just a peephole through

00:09:47.089 --> 00:09:49.739
which I looked at life”

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:57.329
The basic survival elements on Earth -- air,
food, shelter -- can be recreated in Space.

00:09:57.329 --> 00:10:04.309
We can science our way to life on Mars, but
only if our humanity arrives intact.

00:10:04.309 --> 00:10:10.360
The Break-off Effect, first documented in
a 1957 study of high-altitude pilots, is defined

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.350
by a profound dissociation from reality that
can occur high above Earth.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:21.509
18 of the 137 pilots freaked out with intense
feelings of fear and anxiety.

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:28.619
But the majority reacted with a previously
unknown sense of euphoria -- a newfound understanding

00:10:28.619 --> 00:10:35.240
of the oneness of the planet, humanity and
all creation.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.699
When Alexei Leonov returned to Earth after
being the first human to float freely in space

00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:46.449
during a 12 minute and 9 second spacewalk
in 1965, he responded to concerns for his

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:51.379
mental health by saying, “As for the so-called
psychological barrier that was supposed to

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:58.230
be insurmountable by man preparing to confront
the cosmic abyss alone, I not only did not

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:06.949
sense any barrier, but even forgot that there
could be one.”

00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:12.629
Conquering our mental space is crucial for
surviving in outer space.

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:18.079
The journey to Mars starts with the planet
behind your eyes.

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:33.230
