00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.880
Jupiter is the king of the solar system, the
king has a crown!

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.259
But, like, what’s it made of?

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:07.270
Jupiter, has auroras.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.929
We’ve known this for a while, Hubble spotted
them.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.820
But they’re not regular auroras, they are
the most powerful in the solar system.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.190
Earth could fit inside this loop.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.190
Yeah.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.190
CH-YEAH.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.190
It’s awesome.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.340
So, before you ask, yes, Jupiter’s aurora
is like ours, only larger, except that it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.300
is completely not like ours at all.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.320
On Earth, electrons in the magnetic field
in our atmosphere get excited by the sun’s

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.800
energy and bump into air particles lighting
up the skies.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.260
So, scientists thought they’d find something
similar on Jupiter.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.510
Turns out, nuh-uh.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.239
We don’t understand what is causing Jupiter’s
auroras, exactly.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.899
NASA’s ideas are “all wrong” Isn’t
that fantastic?

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.040
Using a detector called JEDI, (I love nerds)...The
Juno probe orbited our jovial planet repeatedly,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.280
taking measurements of its magnetic field.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.539
We knew Jupiter’s magnetic field is the
strongest of any planet in our solar system,

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.719
which should make big aurora, but it turns
out it’s smaller than expected.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.560
AND the aurora don’t behave like Earth’s
at all which may defy the laws of physics!

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.930
To say the least, it’s baffling.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.420
And a new study says the electrons that cause
the aurora might be propelled faster by waves

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.480
in the magnetic field itself…

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.520
To energies as high as 400,000 volts!

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.500
But sometimes the energies are way lower,
Or are firing in weird random directions.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.700
The researchers who are studying Juno’s
data think, the electrons are like tiny electrically

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.420
charged surfers… accelerating on a wave
of energy.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.020
But why the unstable random generation and
the weird waves?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.020
Shrug.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.860
That likely comes from deep within the planet...
and may have something to do with Jupe’s

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.940
radiation belts… we just don’t know enough
yet!

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.920
Pulsars, some exoplanets and other star types
(like white dwarfs) can spit lots of radiation

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.710
and have magnetic fields that can wreak havoc
on spacecraft.Learning how Jupiter works could

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.870
help us build future spacecraft, and keep
them safe as we explore space.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.820
It’s like learning how to build a boat that
can survive lightning strikes or the toughest

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.820
storms.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.560
But instead it’s for the nasty space weather
we know we’ll encounter.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.009
To paraphrase Captain Sparrow, “Bring me
that event horizon.”

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.150
Going to space is expensive, so if you want
to do it, you’d better learn to keep track

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.150
of your finances.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.000

Sweet Jumpin’ Jupiters, please take a second
and subscribe to our show.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.239
We actually visited the place that studies
our aurora from the arctic, it’s called

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.239
EISCAT.

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.239
Watch more here!

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.530
Before plunging into Jupiter on a death glide,
Juno learned about the planet’s origins,

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.870
looked for a solid core, mapped its magnetic
fields, measured compounds in the atmosphere

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.079
and observed auroras.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.089
RIP Juno.Thanks for watching.
