00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
I thought I would make a quick
video to clarify some points

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.610
on evolution and maybe clear up
some points of ambiguity in

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.000
some of my previous videos.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.730
So when you go to the natural
history museum and you see

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.390
these drawings where they start
with a primitive ape and

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.970
they show progressive species
that show some form of

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.430
progress, at least some form of
progress when it comes to

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.500
walking on two feet, it
culminates with Homo Sapiens--

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.940
us-- you imagine that evolution
is kind of this

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.570
process that creates better
and better things.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.050
You imagine that there's this
notion of progress that, as

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.970
time goes on, each successive
species is better than its

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.880
first.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.240
And I want to be very clear
that this notion of better

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.380
really makes no sense in an
evolutionary or natural

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.000
selection context.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.340
That all that matters is fitness
to your environment or

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.910
the frequency with which you're
able to reproduce in an

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.030
environment, which doesn't
really match to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.840
our notion of better.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.780
So some people kind of think of,
well, what's going to be

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.210
the next step in human
evolution?

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.890
And they imagine some human with
a big brain that can move

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.360
things with mental energy and
all of that and can see

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.680
through things or
whatever else.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.660
They imagine some kind of
progress, that, look, we're

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.440
more intelligent.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.620
We can do all of these things
that an ape couldn't do.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.160
Maybe the next stage in
evolution somehow will be some

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.630
type of superhuman.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.090
And I don't know what the next
stage of evolution, if there

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.150
is any next stage for-- I can't
go into that debate, but

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.380
the idea is that that's not
necessarily the case.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.950
Even if you take our current
human population, success in

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.340
evolutionary terms is very
different than success in our

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.210
kind of societal definition.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.620
For example, let's say that
you have two people.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.890
You know, this guy, some dude
here, he's got a Ph.D, he's

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.120
got an MD, he's got a lot of
money, I mean, just everything

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.920
that society says is a success,
but because he did

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.000
his MD, Ph.D, he's been in
school a long time, and he

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.790
decides not to have children,
or if he wants to be very

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.930
responsible, he looks at how
many people there are in the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.650
world and the overcrowding and
the environmental impact.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.010
So let's say him and his wife,
who is also an MD, Ph.D, and

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.750
has all this money and degrees
and have spent a lot of their

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.800
time in school, they decide
to have one child.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.750
Let me see, this is his wife,
who has kind of similarly--

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.470
she's similarly educated, and
from our point of view is a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.250
very successful, very
responsible couple.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.940
Now let's say that there's some
other guy over here, and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.750
he's just kind of-- for the
sake of it, let's say he's

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.050
just nuts, that from the
get-go he was very

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.160
irresponsible.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.260
He produced one child
after another.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.750
Let's say by the time he's 30
years old, he has 10 children,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.600
all with different mothers,
maybe some of the children had

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.160
to go up for adoption.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.640
Who knows the situation
with this guy's life?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.910
I don't want to be judgmental of
it, but the general idea is

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.040
that in society, we would say,
oh, this guy is less

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.080
successful.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.880
But from an evolutionary point
of view, this guy was far more

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.770
successful.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.390
In fact, people like this guy,
the frequency of their genes

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.620
is increasing much faster than
the frequency of these

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.930
people's genes.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.840
So when we talk about fitness
from an evolutionary point of

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.810
view, it's not necessarily
fitness from the point of view

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.590
that we like to think of it in
our regular kind of value

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.110
system that we have
in society.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.200
These people looked very fit,
intellectually and, who knows,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.730
maybe physically as well, but
they weren't reproducing.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.140
Their genes aren't being passed
on with the frequency

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.130
of these guys.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.170
I forgot the statistic, but
there's something like 80% of

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.790
people in Asia have genes from
either one man or some small

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.160
collection of men who date--
actually, I think it's from

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.180
one man-- from the 1200s.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.810
And it's either probably one
of the Mongol warriors,

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.520
whether it's Genghis or Kublai
Khan, but it just shows you

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.420
that there are some very-- and
I'm not going to make any

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.230
judgments here, but you could
have very kind of aggressive

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.899
people who may have raped and
pillaged whole societies, and

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.260
they were very successful from
an evolutionary point of view,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.870
even though we might think
that their actions are

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.790
despicable.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.470
So I want to give you the
sense that there's not

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.670
necessarily the sense
of progress.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.440
If this pattern I described
keeps happening, then this

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.630
type of person will become less
and less frequent in the

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.150
gene pool and this person will
become more and more frequent

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.000
in the gene pool.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.160
So we might end up with
eventually a more aggressive

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.220
human population or a less
quote-unquote responsible one.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.640
So I want to make that one
clarification that evolution,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.740
or natural selection, is not
just a series of progressive

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.050
steps where we'll slowly and
slowly become-- or any

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.740
organism becomes kind of a
better and more intelligent

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.730
and faster animal.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.890
It just depends on its
environment and what it's

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.460
being selected for.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.410
Now the other thing I want to
clarify is, really, some of

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.130
the points I made on the video
regarding intelligent design.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.360
In that video, my intention
was not to really make a

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.700
comparison between intelligent
design and evolution.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.360
So you have evolution on this
side and you have intelligent

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.720
design on this side.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.830
And I want to be clear, and I
didn't maybe make it clear

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.870
enough in that video,
that this debate is

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.170
an artificial one.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.800
Evolution really is the basis
of modern biology.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:43.600
If you want to understand how
the flu works, or if you

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.520
wanted to understand the human
genome, or if you wanted to

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.530
understand heredity, evolution
is the cornerstone of that.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.920
And it's not complete.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.490
Every day, every year, we're
discovering more and more

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.070
about how the process of natural
selection works.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.450
There are still open debates.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.460
People aren't sure the pace at
which evolution occurs, other

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.410
factors that might make it occur
faster or slower, but I

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.880
want to be clear.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.520
This does explain all
of our observations.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.180
Or let me put it this way: All
of our observations in modern

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.190
science are backing up

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.710
evolution and natural selection.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.990
And if anything, it is the
basis of modern biology.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.420
So if one were to deny natural
selection and evolution,

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.010
they're really denying our

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.590
understanding of modern biology.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.390
Intelligent design is a belief
system, and my whole point

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.540
behind making that is to try to
maybe reconcile the parties

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.480
that favor this with the idea
of evolution, so that they

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.840
could reconcile one's religious
beliefs while not

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.540
having to deny what is the
cornerstone of modern biology.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.480
And when I talk about design,
I make the point that, look,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.690
you know, rather than looking
at the particular design,

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.340
whether it's the eye or a
particular organism, and I

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.330
even make the point that there
is no particular design.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.850
Even if you were to point to the
human eye, there's not one

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.880
version of the human eye.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.140
There's an infinite variation in
the human eye, so it would

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.020
even have to be intelligent
designs,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.530
not intelligent design.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.040
But my whole point behind the
video was to say if you are

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.240
inclined to believe in a
designer, then the more

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.130
elegant design is at
the system level,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.190
which really is evolution.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.600
Now, I wasn't trying to say
there is a designer or there

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.510
isn't a designer.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.170
I was just saying if you are
inclined to believe in one,

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.850
this is more profound and gives
more justice to the

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.610
designer that you are inclined
to believe in.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.750
This is not science at all.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.900
Intelligent design is a denial
of what all of modern science

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.160
is telling us today.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.030
And it's not a theory, as some
proponents of it put it, and

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.750
they kind of surround it with
scientific-sounding terms, but

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.550
it's not a theory.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.670
You cannot test intelligent
design.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.410
There's no data point that will
confirm or deny whether

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.540
somehow something was
designed by some

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.580
type of sentient creator.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.950
This is just a belief
system that is

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.240
essentially rejecting this.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.200
But I don't want to be
disrespectful of those who

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.460
believe in this belief system,
because it comes out of

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.840
closely held beliefs.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.720
My goal really is to
reconcile that.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:30.520
And if you do want to give your
belief in a creator due

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.870
credit, you're better looking
at the system

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.700
rather than the design.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.110
So I just wanted to make
those two points, two

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.850
clarifications.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.390
One on the evolution/intelligent
design--

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.860
quote-unquote-- debate.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.010
But it's not really a debate.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.820
This is kind of the cornerstone
of modern biology.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.210
This is something that
just rejects that.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.710
It isn't a provable or
disprovable theory.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.640
And I wanted to make the point
that evolution doesn't

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.350
necessarily mean a
straightforward line of

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.250
progress in evermore
intelligent

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.890
and impressive creatures.
