I don't know if I like the word

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.090
I don't know if I like the word
 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.360
I don't know if I like the word
coordination to deal with it I think

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370
coordination to deal with it I think
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.090
coordination to deal with it I think
that will the for example one of the

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100
that will the for example one of the
 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.109
that will the for example one of the
things that the brain needs to do is

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119
things that the brain needs to do is
 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.990
things that the brain needs to do is
regulate a variety of aspects of our

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
regulate a variety of aspects of our
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.329
regulate a variety of aspects of our
metabolism so for example it's

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:23.339
metabolism so for example it's
 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:28.450
metabolism so for example it's
absolutely essential that the pH of our

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460
absolutely essential that the pH of our
 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.790
absolutely essential that the pH of our
internal miliar be maintained in the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
internal miliar be maintained in the
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.940
internal miliar be maintained in the
very tight borders above which and below

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
very tight borders above which and below
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.720
very tight borders above which and below
which it will not operate we simply die

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730
which it will not operate we simply die
 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.670
which it will not operate we simply die
there are certain levels of certain

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
there are certain levels of certain
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.530
there are certain levels of certain
molecules that have to be maintained

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
molecules that have to be maintained
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.270
molecules that have to be maintained
tightly within certain values and you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
tightly within certain values and you
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.870
tightly within certain values and you
have sensors in structures for example

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880
have sensors in structures for example
 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.850
have sensors in structures for example
like the hypothalamus that are

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
like the hypothalamus that are
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.320
like the hypothalamus that are
constantly measuring the level and if

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330
constantly measuring the level and if
 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.460
constantly measuring the level and if
the level that is currently occurring in

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470
the level that is currently occurring in
 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.579
the level that is currently occurring in
your internal me leah is getting

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
your internal me leah is getting
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.620
your internal me leah is getting
dangerously close to the limit then the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
dangerously close to the limit then the
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.920
dangerously close to the limit then the
brain immediately generates a response

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
brain immediately generates a response
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.530
brain immediately generates a response
that is going to be corrective take for

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
that is going to be corrective take for
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.240
that is going to be corrective take for
example what happens if what the the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
example what happens if what the the
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.950
example what happens if what the the
level of water is diminishing because

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
level of water is diminishing because
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.200
level of water is diminishing because
for example you took a meal that was

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
for example you took a meal that was
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.110
for example you took a meal that was
very salty you will very rapidly develop

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120
very salty you will very rapidly develop
 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.770
very salty you will very rapidly develop
a thing called thirst now thirst is a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
a thing called thirst now thirst is a
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.640
a thing called thirst now thirst is a
very conscious expression of the fact

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
very conscious expression of the fact
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.340
very conscious expression of the fact
that their sensor is going like crazy

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
that their sensor is going like crazy
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.149
that their sensor is going like crazy
saying water to low water to low water

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
saying water to low water to low water
 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.760
saying water to low water to low water
too low make a correction and then you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
too low make a correction and then you
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.840
too low make a correction and then you
go and drink and of course in go back to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
go and drink and of course in go back to
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.600

the squirrel the squirrel is not going

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
the squirrel the squirrel is not going
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.850
the squirrel the squirrel is not going
to have a very conscious notion of

to have a very conscious notion of
thirst I need water and let alone

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
thirst I need water and let alone
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.370
thirst I need water and let alone
expressing it in words the the squirrel

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
expressing it in words the the squirrel
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.520
expressing it in words the the squirrel
is going to have that feeling of thirst

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530
is going to have that feeling of thirst
 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.679
is going to have that feeling of thirst
and is going to make the correction by

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689
and is going to make the correction by
 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.750
and is going to make the correction by
it's starting to search for water even

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760
it's starting to search for water even
 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.910
it's starting to search for water even
if the squirrel doesn't do it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
if the squirrel doesn't do it
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.920
if the squirrel doesn't do it
liberally is not thinking now I'm going

to need to look for a river or a lake

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120
to need to look for a river or a lake
 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.050
to need to look for a river or a lake
that is unlikely to happen although I've

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
that is unlikely to happen although I've
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.900
that is unlikely to happen although I've
never been inside the squirrels mind but

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910
never been inside the squirrels mind but
 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.110
never been inside the squirrels mind but
that is there that there's the detection

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
that is there that there's the detection
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.770
that is there that there's the detection
of the wrong set point and the shooting

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
of the wrong set point and the shooting
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.559
of the wrong set point and the shooting
off of an order to generate a response

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569
off of an order to generate a response
 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.380
off of an order to generate a response
and the response is going to be in the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
and the response is going to be in the
 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.320
and the response is going to be in the
form of a yearning for water and in our

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330
form of a yearning for water and in our
 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.809
form of a yearning for water and in our
case not only do we feel it but then we

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819
case not only do we feel it but then we
 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.140
case not only do we feel it but then we
start translating all of that in very

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150
start translating all of that in very
 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.150
start translating all of that in very
complex concepts and words and we will

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160
complex concepts and words and we will
 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.070
complex concepts and words and we will
for example if you're in the middle of

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
for example if you're in the middle of
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.199
for example if you're in the middle of
the street and you start thinking where

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209
the street and you start thinking where
 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.300
the street and you start thinking where
am I going to get water am I going to

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310
am I going to get water am I going to
 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.940
am I going to get water am I going to
get into a restaurant is there water

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950
get into a restaurant is there water
 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.780
get into a restaurant is there water
fountain or whatever so that's a very

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790
fountain or whatever so that's a very
 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.660
fountain or whatever so that's a very
complex way of dealing with that but

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
complex way of dealing with that but
 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.140
complex way of dealing with that but
basically at the core the response is

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150
basically at the core the response is
 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.720
basically at the core the response is
all being operated you use the word

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730
all being operated you use the word
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.180
all being operated you use the word
coordinate that I don't think the word

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
coordinate that I don't think the word
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.160
coordinate that I don't think the word
coordinate is right there it's really a

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170
coordinate is right there it's really a
 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.650
coordinate is right there it's really a
way of creating a response for what is a

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660
way of creating a response for what is a
 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.120
way of creating a response for what is a
detected in balance is the detective in

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130
detected in balance is the detective in
 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.930
detected in balance is the detective in
balanced by the way of a function that

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940
balanced by the way of a function that
 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.590
balanced by the way of a function that
is called homeostasis so you need to

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600
is called homeostasis so you need to
 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.289
is called homeostasis so you need to
maintain on your stasis that's critical

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299
maintain on your stasis that's critical
 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.449
maintain on your stasis that's critical
