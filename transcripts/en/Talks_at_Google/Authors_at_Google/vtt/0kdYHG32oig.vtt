00:00:02.122 --> 00:00:04.080
ULFAR ERLINGSSON: My name
is Ulfar Earlingsson.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.320
I'm in Infrastructure
Security here at Google.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.060
And this is the second
"Authors at Google"

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.820
talk I host about banking.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.340
Now my interest there
is probably, primarily,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.079
that I'm from
Iceland originally.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.980
And three of the six largest
bankruptcies in history

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.160
are Icelandic banks.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.340
And that happened like in 2008
so it's relatively recent.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.010
Now it's my great
pleasure to introduce

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.950
Anat Admati from the
Stanford Business School

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.840
where she's a professor
of finance and economics.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.330
And she's going to tell
us about the main reason

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.200
why those Icelandic
banks failed.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.900
And the main reason
is still around.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.320
It hasn't been fixed in any way.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.710
And it's also explained
in her book, "The Bankers'

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.830
New Clothes," which Nadine
from Books Incorporated

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.750
is selling here for $5.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.920
So that's a pretty good price.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.674
Anyway with that, I'll
leave the floor to Anat.

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:01.632
ANAT ADMATI: Thank you.

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:09.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.810
Thank you.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.060
Thank you, everybody.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.070
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.710
I dropped "The Bankers' New
Clothes" from this title.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.140
This is the subtitle
of the book,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.150
"What's Wrong with Banking
and What to Do about It."

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.566
Because "The
Bankers' New Clothes"

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.470
is about exposing
all the nonsense.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.400
But if we started there,
we would never quite

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.760
finish because there
is a lot of it.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.900
And I'll hint at that
at some point later on.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.590
Why we're here.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.510
Why all this obvious stuff
I'm saying is not understood.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.905
Because people don't want you
to understand it, basically.

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:41.780
Or maybe they don't
understand it themselves.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.370
I can't quite ever tell.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.830
So anyway, let's
start with-- so this

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.200
is going to start very serious.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.880
We're hitting right
there, as opposed

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.830
to how I came to even
be here and explain

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.320
these things to anybody
who would listen.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.770
What's wrong with banking?

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.727
So let me start
with a diagnosis.

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:03.810
What's wrong with banking?

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.670
Well there's a whole
long list here.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.510
What's wrong with banking?

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.740
It's a very, very fragile
system, highly interconnected,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.150
lots of risks that's entirely
unnecessary in this system,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.610
and that's a distortion
to the whole economy.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.664
Meaning things just inefficient.

00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:22.830
Lots of governance problems.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.350
Governance problems
are basic problems

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.766
where somebody makes a decision
and the other person who's

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:28.540
impacted doesn't
have control over it.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.420
That's a basic
governance problem.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.570
And because this
is a system that

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.830
doesn't work if
you leave it alone,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.300
it requires good regulation.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.880
And part of the
problem with it is

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.300
it's not regulated
effectively to make

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.300
it better, to help it to
from itself, basically,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.350
or from the people in it.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.970
And as a result of that, it
doesn't support the economy.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.200
It's part of the
infrastructure, you could say,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.990
of the economy that's just
not working very well.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.600
What makes it so fragile?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.690
Well the first thing--
and the one of them

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.380
that I'm going to
talk about a lot--

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.000
is that there's just a lot of
reliance on dept in the system.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.960
Just a lot of borrowing.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.490
The way banks and
many, many institutions

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.320
fund what they do is
borrow money, make promises

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.080
to pay later.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.560
And not just any money.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.224
They promise to
depositors that they

00:03:15.224 --> 00:03:16.390
can get their money anytime.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.500
They promise overnight
creditors that they

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.130
can get their money tomorrow.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.720
They promise lots of people.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.570
And there is not enough
ability in the system

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.950
to absorb the losses
should they happen.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.590
So and then it's
all interconnected.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.460
In other words, I owe you,
and you owe somebody else,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.150
but then somebody
else might owe me,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.880
and so it's all
very interconnected.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.529
And the regulation has
enormous flaws in it.

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:41.070
The way it's
structured, the way it's

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.180
measured, the way they can get
around it, all of those things

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.920
make this regulation basically
incredibly ineffective.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.570
So here is sort of
a system for you.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.090
This system has this-- they'll
call it shadow banking.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.790
There are lots of
institutions outside,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.830
other institutions
inter-connected with it

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.680
in numerous ways.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.172
If you kind of
step back from it,

00:04:03.172 --> 00:04:05.630
and there's somebody putting
money in the bank and somebody

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.190
borrowing money somewhere,
and we have inter-mediation

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.409
in between them, somehow
there's numerous layers there.

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.200
And I think that in
the talk about Iceland,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.350
you saw how
interconnected systems can

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.730
get with self-dealing
and self-ownership

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.550
and lending to
yourself and all that.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.080
The question for society,
of course, is going to be

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.810
is there value generated in
every one of these places

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.550
that somehow has a reason
for existing in this world?

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.260
Somebody wanted to create this
institution outside the balance

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.310
sheet of this bank, or
outside somewhere else,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.770
and interacting in another layer
with the rest of the system.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.530
Are we sure that's
a good thing to have

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.850
such a complicated system?

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.990
So then when the system gets to
be like this-- very fragile--

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.520
you get these contagion
effects, these dominoes,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.660
and all of that.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.934
And so you touch something and
the whole system can crumble.

00:05:02.934 --> 00:05:04.100
What does it mean, touch it?

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.850
In 2008, what
touched it-- or 2007,

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.990
it started-- what
touched it was a decline.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.560
A bubble burst in
housing in the US.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.220
In the grand scheme of
things, not a big thing.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.370
There were a lot
of bad loans made.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.290
Some borrowers defaulted.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.700
It was not an
amount of money that

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.490
should take down
the global economy.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.710
And yet the system
was so fragile it

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.310
couldn't withstand that.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.110
A bankruptcy of one institution
like Lehman Brothers

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.780
just sent this whole
thing to implosion.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.360
Well, what are we
going to do about it?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.230
There are proposals
all over the place.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.130
One of them is
about the failure.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.010
So the bankruptcy
doesn't work, let's

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.150
find a better way to fail them.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.835
So if they can't
pay their debts,

00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:53.150
they'll fail like other people.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.820
The problem with
that is they're very

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.060
global-- I'll show
you an interconnected

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.920
map across the world-- and they
live globally but die locally.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.740
So to die, if you have 2,000
subsidiaries, each one of these

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.740
has to go into a
bankruptcy procedure,

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.409
depending on the law in that
country and that's a mess.

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:15.950
And that's what
happened with Lehman.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.410
This bankruptcy-- 80
different bankruptcy

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.650
processes or more
started over the world.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.950
And it took years, it's
still barely done since then.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.570
And meanwhile, it freezes
everything and all of that.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.040
Banks can't kind
of go through that.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.960
So no matter how I'm
involved in the effort,

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.940
it's part of the reform to have
the FDIC, the Federal Deposit

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.280
Insurance Corporation, take down
JP Morgan-- good luck to all

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.850
of us if that happens.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.890
These banks are much bigger than
Lehman was, and good luck to us

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.340
if we should go into that.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.580
So that's not a great solution.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.780
The other is, let's make
sure that we kind of

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.074
make them smaller and somehow
restrict what they can do.

00:07:01.074 --> 00:07:02.865
The problem with that--
so we have various,

00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:07.780
you might hear these words,
Volcker Rule, you can't do this

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.280
and you can do that
and all of that.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.330
And these are potentially--
you talk about Glass-Steagall,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.840
I can't go into all of that.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.810
I'd be happy to talk
a little bit about it.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.250
We used to have a separation
between investment banks

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.970
and commercial banks,
deposit-taking institutions.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.010
If you take deposits, you can
only do this and not that.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.490
That's a tough subject.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.610
The problem is it might help,
but if they remain fragile,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.260
and there's more layers and more
different little institutions,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.180
they can still be
failing at the same time

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.360
or causing each other
to fail together.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.670
So you might not get rid of
that fragility of this system

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.400
by some kind of structural
reform of who can do what.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.190
So you're not going to
the heart of the problem,

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.570
to the heart of that fragility.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.950
And you could say, I'm not
going to bail them out,

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.980
I hate bailouts.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:04.850
There were a lot of bailouts,
meaning creditors got paid when

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:13.340
the bank couldn't-- AIG, Citi,
Bear Stearns, many other banks.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.430
Or the government
just invested in them

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.970
so they could pay their debts.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.770
Troubled Asset Relief
Program, other things.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.460
The problem with trying
to say, I wrote in the law

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.140
that I won't bail you out
is that, if the time comes

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.080
and it's better to
bail them out than not,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.810
then you'll have
an emergency law.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.380
And it's hard for governments
to commit to that.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.990
They probably even
shouldn't commit.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.490
They should do what's best.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.330
But it's kind of a
hostage situation.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.820
In other words, you
can't quite commit

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.360
to what you'd like to commit.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.100
Here is a network for you.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.630
Just the width of the
line-- this is just,

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.080
I picked up
yesterday, so I don't

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.890
show you the same
diagram as Iceland--

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.520
but this is across
the globe for sure.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.949
20 countries and how the
flows of moneys between them.

00:08:58.949 --> 00:09:00.490
And these are
financial institutions.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.570
The thickness of the line
is just how much there is.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.620
In other words, the system
is knotted up together

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:14.660
in a big,
impossible-to-disentangle knot.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.060
So are we stuck
with this system?

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.420
Is it the best we can do?

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.130
If we want to have
a financial system--

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.710
a global financial system--
where we have a global trade

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.130
and banks all
over, are we stuck?

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:30.770
We're not.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.420
I want you to keep in
mind two analogies just

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.510
for understanding
what I'm about to say.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:43.580
One is that banks' behavior
displays a form of addiction

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.230
to certain harmful things.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.199
Harm to others in this case.

00:09:48.199 --> 00:09:49.740
So even to the banks
themselves, when

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.070
you look at their entire
set of investors, including

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.930
depositors.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.910
But they can't commitment
not to doing it,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.640
because it's too tempting to do.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.980
We have, inadvertently,
policies that

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.160
encourage them to do
those polluting things.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.710
And then they do.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.590
We have to push
back so they don't.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:21.030
Analogy number two
is a speeding truck.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.640
You could think of what I'm
about to describe to you,

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.510
for example, the
excessive amount

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.830
of borrowing by banks
as a way of speeding.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.750
It kind of gets you there
fast if you're lucky.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.810
But you're also taking a
lot of risk of blowing up.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.270
In this particular case, if
you embellish this narrative--

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:45.250
or this analogy-- the trucks
have subsidized insurance

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.220
and their drivers get
out before the implosion.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.570
They're OK.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.232
But the collateral
damage is made.

00:10:53.232 --> 00:10:55.190
But they will say, let
me get back in the truck

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.240
and drive again.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.920
That's my natural speed.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.290
That's the kind of
bankers' new clothes.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.310
The question will ask about
an ounce of prevention.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.030
Can we put a speed limit?

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.510
Can we just stop that speed?

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.340
So what am I talking about?

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.120
I'm talking about putting
more equity in place instead

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.380
of their finding themselves
with a lot of debt.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.890
So the bit concept-- it's
an accounting concept

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.910
so it's very scary
sometimes, but it's

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.780
a very simple concept-- is a
concept of a balance sheet.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.440
A balance sheet has two sides.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.950
One side is what
the investments are

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.800
and the other side is how
it's funded, basically.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.230
There's borrowed money,
debt, liabilities,

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.330
and there is the rest,
which is the down payment

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.750
on a house, shareholder
equity, owner's money, equity.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.070
Well magically, if you fund your
investments with more equity,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.560
you are more resilient
to downslide.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.730
Homeowner's saw that.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.870
Companies see this all the time.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.870
So should there be the
Pac-Man that comes and eats

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.930
some of your profits,
look at the bank

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.114
that people are
wondering if it's still

00:12:08.114 --> 00:12:09.530
going to be able
to pay it's debt.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.060
Is it solvent or not?

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.030
And look at the bank
with more equity.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.170
Still around because the
debt's still in place

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.600
and it's the equity
that absorbs the losses.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.340
And also that makes
the gain, that's

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.070
the fun part of it
when it works out.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.610
Because then they pay the
debt and take all the upside.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.860
That's the leverage.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.430
That's the effect of borrowing
that magnifies the upside.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.390
And the downside, should
there be another loss,

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.590
uh-oh, the bank could
become insolvent,

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.000
under water, like
homeowners whose

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.624
house is worth
less than they owe.

00:12:46.624 --> 00:12:49.040
And now, all kinds of terrible
things are going to happen.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.140
The government
can bail them out.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.920
But in the case of
banks, there will

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.720
be all kinds of
disruptions to the system,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.810
because people may have
run away from them when

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.070
they were afraid.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.190
All kinds of other things,
they stopped lending

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.010
because they had to
sell their assets.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.690
All kinds of the mechanisms
that we saw-- those of you

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.350
were paying attention in 2008,
or if you weren't, your parents

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.850
were.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.310
So anyway, the question
is, why wouldn't we

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.850
have a more resilient
banking system?

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.710
Let's look at our biggest
bank, JP Morgan Chase.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.580
If you look at the balance
sheet of JP Morgan Chase,

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.670
it has on one side
all kinds of assets.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.690
They want you to think
that there are lending.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.670
And that's their job.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.250
They're lending to
the real economy.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.880
God forbid, don't
touch their loans.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.410
But in fact, lending is
only a very small part

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.540
of what they do.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:48.450
Say JP Morgan Chase defines, in
their assets, the IOUs of all

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.330
their borrowers, their loans,
as part of their assets,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.220
$700 billion.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:59.090
The bank then has all kinds of
assets, derivatives in London,

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.890
all kinds of other things,
physical commodities,

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.890
you name it these days.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.320
You will be amazed
what they have.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.760
Lots and lots of things.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.660
And a little bit of cash.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.470
That the assets.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.560
And how are they funding this?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.670
$1.2 trillion of deposits.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.805
This is money they owe.

00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:22.190
They sometimes
forget it so easy.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.940
It's our money when
we give it to them.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.190
We don't give it to them
like normal creditors, that's

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.780
the beginning of what's wrong.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.230
They love that funding.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.140
Insure it and we just
trust that it's OK.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.380
Trust that the regulators
protect us or something.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.440
And then they borrow in any
number of very creative ways.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.060
Overnight, against all
kinds of collaterals,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.960
they call them repos,
we can go through that.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.210
They find ways to
promise, to get somebody

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:55.480
to give them money in exchange
for promise to pay back.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.930
And very little shareholders
money, equity, that also funds.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.000
OK?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.790
They have shareholder equity in
the area of under $200 billion

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.480
by shareholder's stock
price or whatever.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.030
In the market capitalization,
they're not very large.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.000
There are smaller than Apple.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.920
They are smaller than
many other companies.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.310
But by asset size,
they are the largest.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.790
And this is through
accounting systems

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.580
that ignore trillions of dollars
of derivatives, just net them

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.270
out.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.930
So they have ways to do the
accounting in such a way

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.722
that we won't even see
the actual exposures.

00:15:36.722 --> 00:15:38.430
And I don't have time
to go through that,

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.810
but the book explains what's
off their balance sheet that

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.300
has risk in it that affects
them and everybody around them.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.700
So they'll tell you-- if
you listen to Jamie Dimon,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:54.130
he'll tell you it's a fortress,
fortress balance sheet.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.400
Not the image you should have.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.220
Not a fortress.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.520
Extremely fragile and
extraordinarily systemic.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.490
Too big to fail.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.890
Incredibly messy.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.120
Nobody can understand
what's going on there.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.622
You can't read their financial
statements and understand.

00:16:09.622 --> 00:16:11.830
You won't understand even
the Well's Fargo accounting

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:12.330
statements.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.640
And people have tried.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:19.330
So these are very, very,
very complex as corporations.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.880
Almost impossible for
just about anybody

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.970
to understand, regulate,
control, all of that.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:29.560
And the scandals every day give
you a hint of that as well.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.710
So how much equity
should banks have?

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.180
Guess what.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:40.020
In the Regulation of
Basel, what's called.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.350
This is a city in
Switzerland where

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.750
they sit around and decide
on minimum requirements

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:50.080
that 27 countries are supposed
to impose on their banks.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.380
The previous regulation,
coming into the crisis,

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.440
was that they should have
2%-- but not 2% of the total

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.070
investment, but 2% of something
called risk-weighted assets.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.560
So this is where you
can ignore some things.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.490
Like, for example, if
a credit rating agency

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.710
says that its AAA,
then you can just

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.790
think of it as good as cash.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.869
Except until it's downgraded
and it's not so good as cash.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.599
Or if it's Greek
debt in the euro,

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.359
if you're a German
bank or a Cyprus bank,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.640
you can lend to Greece.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.710
Don't have any assumption
that it might go down.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.630
As good as cash, even if it's
paying 20% like junk bonds.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.850
The regulation views it
as safe, because it's

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.850
a promise by a government, even
though the government can't

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.360
really print those
euros like Greece.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.650
And Greece defaulted.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.140
So they know we tell
you that they tripled

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.230
these requirements,
tripled them from 2% to 7%.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:50.280
And you can go down to 4 and
1/2% of risk-weighted assets,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.450
which for the Swiss banks
is like-- the denominator

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.930
of that percentage is like a
sixth of their total assets.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.870
Because there's so
many assets that

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.254
get a very, very small weight.

00:18:04.254 --> 00:18:06.170
And of course, those are
the assets they love.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.890
If the regulation
thinks they're safe,

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.742
but they're actually risky
and pay a lot of return,

00:18:10.742 --> 00:18:11.700
that's the place to go.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.070
And they'll all go there and
get more concentration and more

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.110
interconnectedness and more
fragility in the system.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.250
So I mentioned before,
the risk weights,

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.680
one source of fragility.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.370
Bad regulation.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.420
And now, because they
saw that the banks were

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.681
gaming this regulation.

00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:31.180
This regulation, by the way--
Basel II-- was not implemented

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.820
in the US except, guess what,
for the investment banks,

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.850
the same investment banks that
got into the most trouble.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.090
It was the deposit institution
because Sheila Bair, who

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.840
was the head of the FDIC,
didn't like those risk weights.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.420
They basically kept them from
manipulating these risk weights

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.750
and playing with the models
of these risk weights

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:59.010
to get the equity as low as
they could get away with.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:05.200
So now they put in a stop
gap measure, 3% in Basal III.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:12.850
The big reform, 3% of total
asset has to be equity.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.850
It used to also be that they
accepted some other things that

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.570
might be equity, might absorb
losses under some conditions,

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:24.090
and no such capital--
what they called--

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.360
absorbed losses in the crisis.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.500
Everybody got paid.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.140
Even if you were promised except
in this case and that case,

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.050
you were paid.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.040
So when the banks
were bailed out,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.620
all the creditors got paid.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.710
Everybody who was promised.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.760
These requirements, when I
looked at them four years ago

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:46.070
when they came out,
were based on nonsense.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.010
Let me say the word.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.580
Bad analysis, OK,
of the trade-offs,

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.960
misunderstandings, whatever.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.410
Is it tough?

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.945
They'll tell you, oh, we tripled
the previous requirements.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:58.070
Tripling almost nothing
doesn't give you very much.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.700
So tripling this 2% to
risk-weighted assets

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.950
is still ridiculously low.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.150
And in a review of
our book, John Cochran

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.680
said-- because we don't come
out with precise numbers,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.520
because there's so
many issues around how

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.100
you count them, and how
you-- what's the denominator,

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.970
and how to deal with
risk, and all of that.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:16.810
How much?

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:22.140
The point is you want that
balance sheet to absorb most

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.350
of the losses under
normal conditions.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.770
You want them to remain safe
and to go get more equity when

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.780
they get down into distress.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.660
That's what would
keep them functioning

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.180
so they don't harm
others when they fail.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.910
Or they can have a more
orderly sort of intervention.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:48.730
So I can go on and on about
the benefits of forcing banks

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.370
to fund with more equity.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.170
Then we can ask
ourselves, why is it

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.290
that they hate it so much?

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:54.790
OK?

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.248
And there will be
reasons for that.

00:20:56.248 --> 00:20:57.760
From their perspective,
it won't be

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.780
that complicated, many
reasons, strong reasons.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.460
If you have more equity,
so many things are better.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.910
They're less likely to default.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.430
They're less likely to get
distressed, less likely

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.270
to have runs.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.900
The downside will be borne
by the same people who

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.600
have the upside and not
by the rest of society,

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.720
not the taxpayers.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.560
They won't need bailouts.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.851
When they need to sell assets
because they lost a little bit,

00:21:23.851 --> 00:21:26.350
they won't have to sell such a
big fraction of their assets.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:32.980
If you have equity at 2% and
you lose a tiny bit, to recover

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.140
and have back to 2%, you have
to sell an enormous amount

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.350
of assets because you lost
half of your equity suddenly.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:47.070
So your entire being, you're
not living on the edge as much.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.050
The subsidies that
are associated

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.590
with being too big
to fail-- which

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:54.200
means that those who
nobody believes will fail

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.310
get creditors to give them
money under cheaper terms, which

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.800
is completely established.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.790
And they still deny it,
but it's completely true.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.070
And don't write as many
conditions and all of that.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.570
So the ease with which a bank
like that can borrow-- just

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.210
like Fannie and Freddie
could-- with the backing

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.689
of the government
would be reduced.

00:22:13.689 --> 00:22:15.230
In other words, you
will prevent them

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:20.000
from increasing that subsidy
to the stratosphere, which

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.600
is basically the worst kind
of subsidies we can give.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.020
We want to reduce them.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.330
And everything that
the banks do is

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.290
distorted by being so
incredibly indebted,

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.870
because heavily indebted
borrowers are just not

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.310
making good decisions usually.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.660
They tend to love risk.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.839
They tend to under-invest.

00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:39.130
Homeowners that don't have
a lot of equity in the house

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.500
don't invest in maintenance.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.090
That's why the foreclosures
find houses that are wrecked.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.930
They won't give a
gift to the creditor

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.910
if they think they
might walk away.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.660
Similarly, companies
that are distressed

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.070
are going to under-invest.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.830
Countries that are
over-indebted under-invest

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.800
because there need
to be enough upside

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.460
to justify the investment.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.100
Otherwise it's a
gift to the creditor.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.360
And so, the dynamics of
overhangs is very intense

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.450
and risk is good.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.100
If you are under water, you're
gambling with other person's

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.530
money and it's gambling
for resurrection.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.150
The downside is just as bad.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.850
And the upside,
you might be alive.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.460
So there's reason
to take the company

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.122
and put it on the roulette
if there's nothing to lose.

00:23:22.122 --> 00:23:24.330
So the borrower is playing
with the creditors' money,

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.220
basically.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.010
And only can win from the upside
and otherwise the creditor

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.780
loses.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.820
So the history of
banking doesn't

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.920
have as much
indebtedness as banks

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.850
have today, which is
always in the single digit

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.100
amount of equity,
however you measure it.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.790
History of banking, if you
go back to the 19th century

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.070
before they had so much
support, so many safety nets,

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.930
is when there were
partnerships, the partners

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.190
had unlimited liability.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.540
They had to cover their losses.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.370
And they had 50% of the
investment of the bank funded

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.720
by equity and 50% by deposits.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.610
So depositors needed the
bank owners to be there

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.970
or they wouldn't trust the bank.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.740
Then as banks
became corporations

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.060
with limited liability,
meaning the owners

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.800
of the upside or the
share can walk away.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.680
They grew and as you
put in, central banks

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.120
would give them support
against collateral.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.700
And you put deposit
insurance in place,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.120
so depositors didn't worry
about anything anymore.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.620
The more safety nets you
put in place, the more they

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.109
loved and were able to
rely on borrowed money

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:39.150
to fund their investment.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.740
And the more they resisted
putting their own money

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.540
at risk.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.410
Why is that?

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:50.670
It was related to
that safety net

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.630
and to an effect that is
called a leverage ratchet.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.730
It's a addiction to borrowing
that is always there.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.240
A borrower always becomes a
bit addicted to borrowing,

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.010
will take my
another loan as long

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:06.640
as the creditor doesn't scream,
as long as it doesn't violate

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.530
the contract that they have.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.166
By industry, I'll just
summarize this figure for you.

00:25:12.166 --> 00:25:15.610
You'll find Google and Apple and
all these high-tech companies

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.980
at the place where they
just don't use any debt.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.020
This is debt-to-total.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.140
It basically depends
on the industry.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.029
And we won't go into that.

00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:26.570
I teach corporate
finance and we talk

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.194
about why you might
borrow more or less

00:25:28.194 --> 00:25:30.980
but we have theories about that.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:36.100
And no industry and no
borrowers in the economy

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.630
without any regulation
has as little equity

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.690
on a regular basis.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.900
No health industry
lives like that.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.910
And there is plenty of
equity to go around.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.830
Most companies use
their retained earnings

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.360
as a first source of funding.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.780
And retained earnings are
attributable to equity,

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.960
it's on-board money.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.520
So if you are Warren
Buffett, you never pay out.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.060
You just keep investing.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.957
If they wanted dividends,
they can sell some shares.

00:26:01.957 --> 00:26:04.540
If you have good investments to
do, you don't need to pay out.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.620
Here are the facts.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.260
Banks will tell you
they're so special.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.971
They make long-term,
risky investments.

00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:12.720
They're not special
in that, every company

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.830
makes liquid long-term
investments, very risky.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.360
Often riskier than
making a loan.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.060
Making a loan is not that risky.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.730
You diversify a little
bit over the credit risk.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.890
There is some risk
but it's not more

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.700
than other industries
or companies take.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.200
It's just the way it's funded
that makes it so dangerous.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.370
On average, by market
value, companies

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.760
have 70% equity,
at least ones that

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.340
have access to markets for sure.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.910
And most of the
corporations and non-banks,

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.292
without any regulation,
just don't borrow that much.

00:26:51.292 --> 00:26:53.250
If they did, they would
start having covenants.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.958
They'll start having
all kinds of things,

00:26:54.958 --> 00:26:57.480
even though they'll get a
tax advantage from borrowing.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.080
Everybody does, corporations.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.420
Yet, we don't see such levels
of borrowing with no regulation.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.770
But the banks love to borrow.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:06.520
Love to borrow.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.240
Even when they have
under 10% equity,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.120
they pay dividends,
borrow some more.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.780
That's banks.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.160
Why do they love
to borrow so much?

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.620
Well, the short answer
is, works for them.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.590
Works for them on their bonuses.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.350
Works for them on the ease
with which they can borrow.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:29.580
Works for them to get
the upside while putting

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.340
the downside on somebody else.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.300
Works for them.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.460
And they can.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.030
So why do they love to borrow?

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.380
Because it works for
them and they're able to.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:46.660
Which is not the same for the
people, at least not as much.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.540
So there is a leveraged
ratchet effect,

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.160
which affects all borrowing.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.230
Once that is in place, the
same reason or incentive

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.990
for a heavy borrower to
take a little bit more risk,

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.640
the downside of which is
shared by the creditor,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.260
at least if they can
walk away from the debt.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.050
Means that once you borrow,
you want to borrow more.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.320
So it becomes a bit addictive.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.240
Usually creditors will
know this and will

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.090
put in all kinds of terms in
the contract to prevent that.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.160
Because they know that
the borrower is playing

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.400
with their money
and will be tempted

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.570
to take another loan on top
of them or equal seniority.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.040
But even if they take
a second mortgage,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.700
they're more likely to default,
which harms the first lender.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.260
So the creditors
always have to worry.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:33.230
But banks are able to get people
to lend to them, for example,

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.310
depositors.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.430
Depositors come in, don't
worry about anything.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:39.040
We put money in the bank,
the bank goes and plays.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.490
Takes the upside and then--

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.240
Compensation in
banking often depends

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.700
on something called
return on equity.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.960
It's a whole culture thing.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.290
And they always say that this is
their job, to produce returns.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.600
Well basic corporate
finance says,

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.920
just taking risk
by itself, anybody

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.980
can do, why would I pay you
the big bucks just to do that?

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.450
Anybody can take risk and
get appropriate return

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:03.390
in these markets.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.080
So the notion that your job
is to produce returns, well,

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.076
do you produce more
returns than is

00:29:09.076 --> 00:29:10.450
reasonable for
the risk you take?

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.740
That's the question.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.230
So producing returns is
not even an objective,

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.800
let alone makes any
sense as an objective,

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.280
if you don't adjust for risk.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.040
The more leverage, the
more risk for the equity,

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.460
because it's leveraged.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:30.320
So all this kind of focus on
taking risk-- basically, being

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.680
paid to gamble-- gives
bankers an incentive to say,

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.790
I got to borrow this much.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.970
If you don't let me,
terrible things will happen.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.270
That kind of thing.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:47.290
So the scale is tipped for the
bankers in favor of borrowing.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.570
Put the deposits in place that
we all need for payment system.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.870
But now, the extra
dollar that they fund.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.450
Where will they want to take it?

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.250
From that.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:59.260
Never from retained earnings
or equity or not very much.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.880
But all these reasons why
they like to basically mean

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.430
that it's cheaper
for them on account

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:11.710
of somebody else
bearing the costs.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.280
They save but somebody
else is paying.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.070
There's nothing about it
that comes out of nowhere,

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.490
there's no magic to it.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:26.230
For society, what
would be much better

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.150
is if they fund with
much more equity.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:31.880
So here's another
visual for you.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.640
The bank can fund
loans-- suppose

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.770
we wanted the loans
that they fund.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.860
You could imagine a company
producing just about anything.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.700
And they need to get the money.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:45.700
Well, they can get the money
from debt or from equity.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.510
Now, the more debt
that they use,

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:53.320
the more they pollute
the rest of the economy.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.790
So think of excessive
indebtedness

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.270
as a pollutant for the system.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.050
Because it introduces all
these fragilities, few can pay,

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.680
then it cascades
through, and all of that.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.510
Now what do we do?

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.260
We have policies in place
that subsidize and encourage

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.650
and enable more and
make the debt more

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.940
attractive to the banks.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.730
They respond by
using a lot of debt

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.790
and just a little bit of equity.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.840
And therefore pollute more.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.920
So in other words,
we have a situation

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.701
in which we can get, maybe, some
cheap product if we subsidize

00:31:28.701 --> 00:31:29.200
it.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.800
Anything that you can subsidize,
you can get the price, maybe,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.940
the subsidies to pass on, maybe.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.240
But then, we've got
to clean up the river.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.080
So how did we get?

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.050
The bankers are happy.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:42.530
Do they pass these subsidies?

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.990
There's actually
a little evidence

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.490
that the more they
lever, the more

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.070
the rest of the economy wins.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.850
Basically what
happens to lending,

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:53.220
in short, is you get
too much and too little

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.830
of it sometimes
at the same time.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.060
Get them to love risky
loans, credit card loans,

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.740
they send everybody a
credit card, 20% interest.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.329
And at the same
time, they don't want

00:32:02.329 --> 00:32:03.870
to make the boring
business loan that

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.420
doesn't have enough upside.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.529
So people would complain they
don't get loans, but then

00:32:08.529 --> 00:32:10.070
some other people
get too many loans.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.360
And they'll price the loans.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.870
Making loans is an
investment anybody can make.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:20.050
We don't know if they
actually pass it on.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.610
What we do know is if you
look at it carefully--

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.140
and of course they have their
own industry-sponsored studies

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.720
that deny this--
there is no evidence

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.640
that economies are scaling
banking beyond $100 billion.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.316
If you correct for the fact
that the bigger you grow,

00:32:35.316 --> 00:32:37.940
the more subsidies you actually
have, so therefore your profits

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.780
are based on subsidized funding.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.870
Once you correct for
that, there is no evidence

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:46.210
that the largest the bank, the
more efficient the bank is,

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:50.020
in terms of getting
product out of the bank,

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.560
getting work out of the bank.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.290
There is evidence that the
subsidies-- which are enormous.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.480
This shows you,
essentially, what

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.210
the banks would have had to
pay if they wanted somebody

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.770
to insure their debt when they
were so close to the abyss.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:09.210
Of course, for insurance,
it's worth less in good times.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:14.960
And of course, when you need
it, if you had to buy it,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.870
you'd have pay a lot.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:18.310
So the value of the guarantees
that the banks were getting

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:20.120
was enormous around the crisis.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.440
They would have really gone
broke if they didn't have

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.560
them, many of them.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.000
So what do we have?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.680
We have a system where we
perversely subsidize pollution

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.770
even though there's sort of
a clean alternative funding.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.020
Once deposits are in place,
you can always add equity.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.460
You can buy anything with it but
it backs up your liabilities,

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.160
self-insurance.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.410
And so the more indebtedness,
the better their lives are.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.470
They produce more
average returns, maybe.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.230
They get better compensation.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:53.650
And we're drinking the
polluted water, basically.

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.221
So there's a large
cost to society

00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:56.470
for these implicit guarantees.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.928
The thing about
implicit guarantees

00:33:57.928 --> 00:33:59.980
is you don't see
them all the time.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.060
You think it's free to just say,
oh, I'll guarantee your debt.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.952
In the book, we have a chapter
in which our homeowner/borrower

00:34:06.952 --> 00:34:11.710
, Kate, has an aunt Claire.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.652
And Aunt Claire
says, buy a house.

00:34:13.652 --> 00:34:14.860
I'll guarantee your mortgage.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.370
She gets a great
loan from the bank.

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.600
The bank doesn't care if
she puts a down payment

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.300
because Aunt Claire is rich.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.710
But when Aunt Claire
tells Kate that she

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:27.770
can go build a corporation
and invest in anything

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:32.340
and she'll guarantee her
debt-- blank guarantees,

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.580
blanket guarantees-- she
can go to Las Vegas, too.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.710
She takes the upside.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.270
If it doesn't work out.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:40.850
I mean, she pays dividends
to herself on the upside.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.650
On the downside, she
just borrows more.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.250
Until she ruins her
aunt, of course.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.150
And we've seen countries
being harmed by this.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:50.909
Iceland being one of
them, Ireland another one,

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:52.350
Cyprus another one.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.469
That's how bad it can get.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:57.060
For the others, it's
still incredibly costly.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.110
So the big picture.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.150
We want to shuffle the claims.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.800
All investments can be done
if banks figuratively have

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800
more equity.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.840
I don't even care
that they grow,

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.300
as long as it's with equity.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.570
They won't grow.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.560
They will begin to respond
more to market signals.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.530
Conglomerates in the
'80s, broke from being

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.670
bloated and inefficient.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.560
And started being more
streamlined and more nimble.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.860
These banks are monstrous,
inefficiently monstrous.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.490
If they had to fund
in market prices

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.870
and not in subsidized way and
would have less incentives

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.760
to be so big and complicated,
in order to be too big to fail,

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.640
then we might begin to see more
efficient institutions being

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.190
formed for market forces.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.660
Right now, the markets are
failing to correct all of that.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.640
The incentives are all bad.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.710
How do you make it work?

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.900
Well, it's a
challenge but you've

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.010
got to focus on
what you need to do.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.400
First of all, they have
to increase their equity.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.470
And they have earnings.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.730
Just the other week,
the Fed, again,

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.170
allowed them to pay out because
the standards are so low.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:10.810
Even in the US, when
it's 5% instead of 3%,

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:11.790
it's still ridiculous.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.540
And it's by counting
numbers and all kinds

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.850
of weights and models
that you shouldn't trust

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:17.850
and all kinds of things.

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:19.550
I'll talk about stress
test in a second.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:23.320
They tell you that
everything's OK.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.740
If they are viable banks,
they can raise equity.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.420
Anybody can at
appropriate prices.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.691
They just don't want to.

00:36:28.691 --> 00:36:29.690
They just don't want to.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.190
They have to be
told, you know what?

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.239
Too bad.

00:36:32.239 --> 00:36:34.030
The only reason you
can even live like that

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.680
is because people
believe you can't fail.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.810
That's why people
give you money.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.830
Go to equity investors and
see what they'll give you.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:42.570
If you can't.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:47.190
If you tell me you can't at
all have anybody give you

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.630
$1 or a euro for
your shares, I've

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:53.360
got to worry you might
be a zombie bank.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.670
And Citi could be one of those.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:59.730
Citi was brought back
to life multiple times

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.200
over the last
however many years.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:08.701
There is it an institution
that's truly problematic.

00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:11.560
Some claim it and
Bank of America--

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.030
the ones that made the
stupidest acquisitions

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.960
and lost a lot of
money, became insolvent,

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.790
and are only alive today
because of all the supports.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:25.620
So Basel has lots of flaws.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.140
This regulation is
not a good regulation.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.860
They learned a few
lessons but not enough.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.960
And there is a lot of bad
policies around banking.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.680
They always kick the can down
the road, especially in Europe

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.360
right now.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.119
They'll say, oh, we
can't get any bank fail.

00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:44.160
We're just going to wait.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.760
We're going to support them this
way and support them that way

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.890
and hope they make a loan.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.640
But it's the weakness
of the banks that's

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.600
actually harming the economy.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.780
And it's delaying
the recognition

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.350
of losses that already happened.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.220
It's having too big a
blow to the system that

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.000
is filled with unhealthy banks.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.480
That's really what's harming.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:07.190
When they say, if you make me
a safe, lending will suffer,

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.910
they forget that
lending suffered

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.680
when they were unhealthy.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.220
That's when lending
really suffered.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.410
So all the narratives
are flawed.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:21.360
The confusions in this
space are mind boggling.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.022
If you were to start reading
about what's going on,

00:38:24.022 --> 00:38:25.480
about the things
I'm talking about,

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.860
you wouldn't even know that
this is under discussion.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.740
Because the word is not equity.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.380
They use the word capital.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.530
And then they attached
to it the word

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.950
hold capital, or set aside.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:39.630
And then, so they'll say the
banks have to hold 3% equity.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:42.900
Well, companies don't
hold their equity.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.520
Other investors give them
money and they use it.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.130
They hold assets.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:48.530
They invest in things.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.840
The whole set aside
makes it sound

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.730
as if the debate is about some
kind of rainy day fund, money

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.330
that you put in a reserve.

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:57.900
That's not what
we're talking about.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.390
That 3% and 5% is just
kind of equity funding

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.510
that's plentiful for
corporations out there.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.020
And that most corporations use.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.050
And no problem in
the Silicon Valley.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.530
Nobody borrows so much.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:12.150
And so, they confuse the debate
with incredible nonsense.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:15.000
Every dollar of
capital is a dollar no

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.250
put in the economy, set
in a vault somewhere.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.850
That's not down
payments in a house.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:21.800
That's not equity.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.090
It's in the assets.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.210
That's just nonsense.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.120
But people don't understand
the word capital.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.411
And so they think it's on
the other side of the balance

00:39:28.411 --> 00:39:29.650
sheet, on the cash reserves.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.275
So that's the beginning,
we're not even

00:39:31.275 --> 00:39:32.880
on the right side of the
balance sheet in the debate.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.430
And then other nonsense starts.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:37.220
So in the document that sort
of-- if people don't have time

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.050
to read the book, we give a
list of 23 nonsense claims

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:42.290
that are made in this space.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.740
There are many, many of them.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.150
So you start implying
false trade of people.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:51.420
And here's a classic
lobbyist claim.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.900
More equity might increase
the stability of banks.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:58.310
Might, admits Mr.
Ackerman, the CEO

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.590
of Deutsche Bank for a while.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.180
The Jamie Dimon of
Germany for a while.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.810
At the same time, it would
restrict their ability

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.260
to make the loans.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.040
He says that.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.060
That's just false.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.340
To the rest of the
economy, it reduces growth

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.370
and has negative impact for all.

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:20.290
This he says after a crisis in
which growth suffered the most

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.590
since the Great Depression.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.990
And not because they
had too much equity

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.323
but because they had too little.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.790
The corrected statement--
the edited statement--

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.850
is if you have a well-designed,
capital regulation that

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.770
requires much more equity, it
will increase the stability

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:39.600
of banks, and it would
enhance their ability

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.610
to provide credit to
lend appropriately.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.620
Not too much, not too little.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.330
Make good loans, not any loans.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.980
We have lots of bad
buildings in China and Spain

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.820
and Ireland, too much lending.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.310
May reduce the growth
of subsidizing bank.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.850
Maybe, but maybe it'll be
a better size for banks

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.210
and for the banking system
than what we have today.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.790
So just that's OK.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:09.110
And the effect on everybody,
except maybe for bankers,

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.870
would be good.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.490
Then they start with
other arguments.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.890
Some of these arguments,
other industries make.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.880
Oh, you can't regulate
me here, because I

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.490
can't compete with the other
bank in Germany where they

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:24.107
don't regulate them, or
with the UK, or with China.

00:41:24.107 --> 00:41:25.940
That's like saying, let
me pollute the river

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:29.440
because the other company's
polluting their river.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.070
Or your kid might
say, let me drink

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.890
and drive because the other kid
is allowed to drink and drive.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:41.170
I mean we don't volunteer to
be harmed so our banks can win

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.220
against some other reckless
bank somewhere else.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.310
The successful banks
in Ireland and Iceland

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:50.680
did not help their people.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.700
Then they'll say, oh, but
if you regulate us then

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.320
the banks will go to the
Shadow Banking system,

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.460
oh, into the shadows.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.190
That's like saying,
don't forbid robberies

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.540
because my policeman is
only in the lighted streets.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.880
But the robbers, alas,
go to the dark alleys.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.200
Do we accept that or do we give
the policemen the flashlight

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.190
to go and arrest the
robber in the dark alley?

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:20.140
The Shadow Banking
system is filled

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.970
with bright sunshine
institutions-- money market

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.680
funds, hedge funds.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.530
If we want to look there and
see what the bank guaranteed

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:33.930
to some special purpose
vehicle that came back

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:37.070
to haunt later on,
it's quite visible.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.900
It's not in any
kind of big shadow.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.970
You have to enforce
a regulation just

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.550
like you have to
enforce tax codes.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:46.160
If you say, oh, there'll
be a tax escape,

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.370
then we'll cancel taxes.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.970
I mean it's basically
an approach that said,

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:53.820
I have a Shadow Banking system
because I failed to regulate.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.440
Therefore, I shouldn't regulate
because I'm so bad at it.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.020
OK.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.079
We can suffer the
consequences of not

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:01.120
regulating this industry.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.245
And good luck to all of us.

00:43:02.245 --> 00:43:04.660
But if we're going to do
it, we might as well do it.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.160
So here are the
flawed narratives.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:09.370
They're going to tell you
that stuff just happens.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:10.750
It was unforeseen.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:11.979
It was 100-year flood.

00:43:11.979 --> 00:43:13.520
That's what they
want you to believe.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.055
When Ben Bernanke talks about
it, or other policymakers,

00:43:17.055 --> 00:43:18.430
you always hear
about how they're

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.660
helping the economy recover
and how they pulled out

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.190
all the stops to help
us when we needed it.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.380
Just as if there
was an earthquake.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:26.966
So that's where
they want to start.

00:43:26.966 --> 00:43:28.590
What they don't want
you to think about

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.830
is how they failed to
protect us before that.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.380
And how they failed to regulate
this industry before that.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.740
And so that part is a
little less convenient

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.870
for them, and certainly
for the banks.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:43.470
So if you drive at
90 miles an hour,

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:48.800
and then you can tell me that
it was just the fog somehow

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.730
and that's what speed
you have to drive,

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.920
then well, we've got
to deal with that,

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.110
we've got to suffer that.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:56.030
But that's an act of
a natural disaster.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:59.540
Or the narrative that there
was no problem of solvency,

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.750
of too little equity.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:02.140
It was just a plumbing problem.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.015
It was just some kind
of a liquidity problem.

00:44:04.015 --> 00:44:06.220
I have the money but I
just didn't go to the ATM.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.119
That's a liquidity problem.

00:44:08.119 --> 00:44:10.160
So they were all really
strong but there was just

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.790
some kind of a plumbing problem.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.930
They call it a
liquidity problem, OK?

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:18.910
That's again a way
to mask the weakness,

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:22.500
the structural weaknesses, is
to say, oh, the plumbing broke.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.260
Instead of saying my
building was really shoddy

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.980
and that's why
the earthquake, it

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:33.030
couldn't withstand
any little tremor.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.200
If you talk about
safety in banking,

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.440
the depressing thing is they're
going to be the stories,

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.590
and they'll keep
being the stories.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:46.480
When airplanes crash, we do
not accept unsafe flying.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.110
And there's only
so many narratives

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.310
that can be said about
an airplane crash,

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.430
except in Malaysia.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:57.760
The black box-- or
orange actually--

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.910
will constrain
all the narratives

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:01.840
that people can have
about whether it

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.980
was a bird in the engine
or the pilot fell asleep

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:08.390
or the flight control messed up.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:12.010
If you want to investigate why
something happened in banking,

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:15.080
they're going to say, well--
They'll tell you some story.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.460
They'll have some model.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.140
They'll have a narrative
which will just

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:24.600
allow them to not recognize
the shoddy construction

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.210
of the system and the
fragility of the system that's

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.770
entirely unnecessary.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:33.757
So that's sort of
what's going on.

00:45:33.757 --> 00:45:36.090
Now you'll read in the newspaper
that everything is fine

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.300
because they passed
some stress test.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.500
If you were to look
at that, you would

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.990
see what a charade this is.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:47.610
The benchmarks are
low, the whole approach

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.580
doesn't really take into account
all of the contagion mechanisms

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.120
that we know are there.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.170
It asks, if I tell
you that there'll

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:57.992
be some adverse scenario, give
me some model about what you'd

00:45:57.992 --> 00:46:00.450
lose and let's see what your
balance sheet would look like.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.033
Let's not talk about
what would really

00:46:02.033 --> 00:46:05.250
happen in a real
scenario and all of that.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.360
But in any case, what's
the cost of banks

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.964
retaining their earnings?

00:46:08.964 --> 00:46:10.630
Money still belongs
to the shareholders.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:12.136
If debt is paid, no problem.

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:13.760
What's the cost to
society that they'll

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.880
be stronger like
other companies?

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.430
Bottom line, we had a major,
major financial crisis.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.630
It's hard to know
what it would take

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:26.330
to cause more harm from
the financial system

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:28.330
to the real economy.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:32.490
And that somehow did not
produce effective reform,

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:33.490
despite all the talking.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.170
I obviously don't have
time to go over that.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:36.730
When I tell you the
banks are special.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:38.896
The specialness of banks
is what they get away with,

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:41.070
is really the bottom line here.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.570
And there's no accountability
in the whole system, including

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.610
the bankers and the regulators
and the politician who always

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.920
love banks for
campaign contribution

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.970
or for telling them what
to do with the money.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:54.510
And either are blind
or willfully blind

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.290
to what's going on.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.380
So we wrote this book
to explain these issues

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.440
that I tried to pack
into however long I took,

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.450
I never look at the clock.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.170
And since you're
still sitting here,

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:10.970
I'd be happy to take
questions or on the website,

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:12.670
bankersnewclothes.com.

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.810
There's lots of links to
excerpts and other things

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:17.090
but $5 for the
book, maybe you'll

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:20.300
want to become an
expert on banking, too.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.772
So you, too, can know that the
banking emperors are naked.

00:47:24.772 --> 00:47:32.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.450
AUDIENCE: So as I read
the book, the thing

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:38.680
I kept thinking to myself is why
do we put our money in the bank

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.840
anyway?

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.380
If you think about the things
they did when they first

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.960
were formed and you
think about today,

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.360
it seems like we're at
least close to having

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.730
an alternative for
store-of-value and payment

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:52.869
system, right?

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:54.160
So that kind of leaves lending.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.940
But the question
is, as a depositor,

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.910
if I said I'm going to put
all my money in Bitcoin,

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:03.680
if enough people did that,
what would the impact be?

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.430
ANAT ADMATI: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:07.530
So you always say, OK,
the system's not working.

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.030
Let's start another system.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:13.960
And I am not-- with
respect to Bitcoin, I mean,

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.790
I do think that the
payment system is

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:16.855
incredibly inefficient.

00:48:16.855 --> 00:48:18.730
So now when you just
talk about their product

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.396
and how they price
them and all of that,

00:48:20.396 --> 00:48:23.100
there's a whole
other set of issues.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.750
So is this an efficient
system of payment?

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.830
All the fraud, all of that.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:33.050
I think they are just too
comfortable with this system.

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:35.950
The problem with
starting a system

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:44.840
is that whenever you
have a corporation

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:49.400
or an intermediary taking
money, you need the regulation,

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.750
you need policing of that.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.700
So you saw even what happened
with an exchange of Bitcoin.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.450
In other words, you
can still have fraud.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.477
You can have a call-up
bank and there's still

00:48:57.477 --> 00:48:58.310
governance problems.

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.280
So anytime you grow
from just people

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:06.080
bartering you have
a control problem.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.760
And so the question is the
efficient way to organize it.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.970
So right now, we
learn the deposit--

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.270
runs by depositors
can be inefficient.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:16.622
Because depositors just get
too nervous and then they

00:49:16.622 --> 00:49:17.830
want to pull their money out.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.038
So we have deposit insurance.

00:49:19.038 --> 00:49:20.520
But now we didn't
at the same time

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:25.450
counter the more has all
the problems, incentives

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.350
that it can create.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:29.060
Or the ability to then borrow
more and more and more and more

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.780
and encumber the
balance sheet and that.

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:37.670
So my solution is sort of the
speed limit for the system.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.070
In other words, as opposed
to throw it out the window

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:41.350
and try to start
again, because we're

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.500
going to go through some
of the same growing pains

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.700
that got us here.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.550
It's just that we somehow
allowed the system

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:51.890
to get completely out of
control as it got more global

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:52.630
and all of that.

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.664
It was fragile in the past,
too, but for other reasons.

00:49:55.664 --> 00:49:57.330
AUDIENCE: I didn't
quite understand this

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.260
during the crisis
period, but I heard

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.070
that big banks
like Goldman-Sachs,

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.360
they insured some of
their debt and then

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.400
they bet against
their own debt to fail

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.860
so they can recover
these things.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:16.250
Many of these sounded extremely
counter intuitive to me,

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:17.800
in the sense that
they were betting

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.340
against their own
interest in many ways

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:23.260
to collect money back
from the insurers

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:29.680
because that somehow made sense
into their profits and so on.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.640
Is there some reason
why that was also

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.570
contributing to things like what
led to the the banking system

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:37.070
failure?

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.662
ANAT ADMATI: I'm not sure what
you're referring to, actually.

00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:42.120
I mean, if you're referring to
what's called credit default

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.910
swaps, what happened
with AIG was

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:48.360
basically that AIG Financial
Products, like a subsidiary

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.530
in London, was selling
hundreds of billions

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.090
of dollars of
insurance on credit,

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:58.290
on mortgage securities-- the
securities, pieces of paper,

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:01.420
that were backed
by mortgages that

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.260
suddenly were rated highly.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.990
But then, there was some
correlation assumption

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.890
that was false.

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:10.150
Because the all failed
at the same time.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.191
And all the things that
were supposed to be safe.

00:51:12.191 --> 00:51:14.110
The banks, Goldman
in particular,

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:16.320
structured those
contracts with AIG

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.050
so that, as soon
as some rating fell

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:24.960
or whatever, AIG had to
post cash collaterals ahead

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.816
of everything else AIG owed.

00:51:26.816 --> 00:51:28.190
And so the banks
were very clever

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:29.430
when they designed
these contracts.

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.610
Also with municipalities.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:32.360
Look at Detroit and all of that.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.300
So they always structure
it to protect themselves

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.850
as creditors.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:38.795
So they know very
well how to do that.

00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:40.170
And then, what
happened was, that

00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:42.970
ended up interfering
with AIG's function.

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:46.850
And even though the government
said they won't bail out AIG,

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:48.082
then they did.

00:51:48.082 --> 00:51:49.790
But the key thing to
understand about AIG

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:53.520
was that the bailout of AIG
was the bailout of the banks.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.840
So that's how Goldmam-Sachs
got paid in full.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.679
And everybody who took
credit risk with AIG.

00:51:58.679 --> 00:52:00.970
Because when you buy an
insurance company from somebody

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:02.511
who can't pay their
insurance, you're

00:52:02.511 --> 00:52:04.480
taking their credit
risk by that.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.640
But AIG sold
insurance-- essentially,

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.100
earthquake insurance, insurance
that they really could not pay.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.710
Assuming, you collect the fees
and everything looked great

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:15.060
until they had to pay.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.330
And then, the government
had to dig them out.

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
part of AGI?

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.530
ANAT ADMATI: I
mean, they all had

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:24.950
interest in doing all of that.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:31.570
And the remarkable thing is how
it worked for them in the end.

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:33.640
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
complexity a few times

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.910
during your presentation.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.630
There was the balance
sheet for JP Morgan

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:38.210
that apparently
nobody understands.

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:41.230
There was this diagram
of inner-relationships

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.010
between different
national banks,

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.710
or banks in different countries.

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:47.450
There was kind of a
complicated graph.

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:51.280
So if I understand it
correctly, this system

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.130
is so complicated inside
the entities like banks,

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.440
and also between
entities like banks

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.170
and other financial
institutions, that pretty much

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:01.810
nobody really understands
the whole system.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:03.730
So what's really
curious is that we're

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:07.020
trying to fix a system with
prescriptions of do this, not

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.680
do that, this kind of
regulation when we actually

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.390
don't understand the system.

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:14.030
So what are the
efforts right now

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:18.290
to simplify the system so we
can actually understand it?

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.260
And then we can
regulate it and come up

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.689
with prescriptions of
how to run it well.

00:53:22.689 --> 00:53:24.980
ANAT ADMATI: Yeah, I mean,
that's a very good question.

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:29.100
I think that it was
clear in the crisis

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.160
that we really did not
understand the system.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.380
And that's partly
why they said that we

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.710
need to bring derivative
trading into the light

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:40.070
because that's where a
lot of risk was hidden.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:41.940
So supposedly there
are regulations

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.200
to try to reduce the
capacity of those markets.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.540
But there is no way that
we really understand that.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.980
The reason we say, here
is an obvious thing to do.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:57.020
Hold their earnings
from being paid out

00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:01.580
because there's no reason
they need to pay them out.

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.900
Is that's kind of the
no-brainer thing to do.

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.700
The other thing about
simplifying them,

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.790
the question is how.

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:09.730
So they're sort
of shining a light

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:13.170
on the complexity of the system,
seeing it a little bit better,

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:17.000
which some attempts
are being made.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.910
I'm involved in the FDIC
Systemic Resolution Advisory

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:20.410
Commission.

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:21.951
These are the people
who are supposed

00:54:21.951 --> 00:54:24.480
to take a Lehman
Brother or a JP Morgan,

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:29.630
in theory, into sort
of failure mode.

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.329
Dodd-Frank told them
to do that, and I'm

00:54:31.329 --> 00:54:32.370
on an advisory committee.

00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:35.140
And they tried to do heat
maps and things like that

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:36.495
and see what's going to happen.

00:54:36.495 --> 00:54:38.120
And Paul Volcker sits
on this committee

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:42.232
and says it's going to
be a bailout next time.

00:54:42.232 --> 00:54:44.440
You know, they're going to
all fail at the same time.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.320
You can handle it.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.640
How are you going
to negotiate losses?

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.710
When there's a
default or failure,

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.030
everybody runs for cover.

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:53.640
And who's going to be left?

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.690
The attempt here, that
I'm proposing, of course,

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.970
is to make sure
there's buffers so we

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:00.250
are less likely to get there.

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:04.630
And so should we get
near there, they'll

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:08.600
be less debt to pay and more
people to absorb the losses.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.820
But I totally agree with
you that a big, big problem

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.405
with the system is
the great opacity

00:55:12.405 --> 00:55:13.950
and the great complexity.

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.240
And you might, if you
want to be radical,

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:20.430
step back and say maybe we
shouldn't have global banks

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:23.220
because we can't have
bankruptcy courts that jive.

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:23.990
We cant.

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:25.823
We don't have loss-sharing
across countries.

00:55:25.823 --> 00:55:28.490
Legal regimes are all different,
how they treat bankruptcy.

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.990
It's long and complicated
and convoluted.

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:36.830
And if you can't fail, maybe
you shouldn't be as you are,

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:37.470
legally.

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:39.420
But that's like a
whole can of worms.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.920
They'll have lots of
lobbying about that.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.690
Telling you that
big is beautiful

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.691
and we love them
just as they are.

00:55:47.691 --> 00:55:51.036
AUDIENCE: Understanding the
evidence that your [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:51.036 --> 00:55:55.292
prescription seems to be through
[INAUDIBLE] regulations, bank

00:55:55.292 --> 00:55:56.768
[INAUDIBLE] to
have more equity--

00:55:56.768 --> 00:55:58.736
or at least require them
to have more equity.

00:55:58.736 --> 00:56:03.410
But a lot of people [INAUDIBLE]
say that one of the other main

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:07.100
reasons was the key providence
of the [INAUDIBLE] which

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.080
separated western banking from--

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:15.988
So, my understanding
is that the [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:15.988 --> 00:56:18.154
because that's where people
have their depositories,

00:56:18.154 --> 00:56:22.480
for instnce. [INAUDIBLE] And
investment banks are actually

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.680
larger and we can
[INAUDIBLE] fail.

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.468
So with that [INAUDIBLE] what
is your opinion on that and how

00:56:28.468 --> 00:56:32.120
does that-- maybe that's easier
to bring back [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:35.220
ANAT ADMATI: No, well,
the answer is one line.

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:37.015
Lehman Brothers was
an investment bank.

00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:42.110
It wasn't fun to let it fail.

00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:43.100
That's the answer.

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:47.590
We now-- Goldman Sachs is
a bank holding company.

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:50.330
Investment banks
were the ones that

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:51.970
were the weakest
even though they

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:54.140
don't have standard deposits.

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:57.180
I alluded-- and you may
have come late-- to the fact

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.860
that these structural forms
are very, very difficult

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.350
because the way Glass-Steagall
died was sort of a slow death

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:09.570
through all kinds of ways
that they found around it.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.130
So Glass-Steagall originally
was not about risk.

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:14.640
It was more about consumer
protection, actually.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.590
So it was about having
access to depositors

00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:19.590
to sell them securities.

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:23.490
And it might have benefits,
if you would figure out

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:27.220
how to do a 21st century
Glass-Steagall, for governance

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:30.710
and for better
regulation of the pieces.

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:33.630
But it's still the
case that if you

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:36.201
were to do this, which
might be beneficial,

00:57:36.201 --> 00:57:38.700
you still have to worry about
the leverage of the investment

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:39.620
banks.

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:42.310
So in other words, it
could be a good thing,

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:45.410
but it's not the only
solution that's for sure.

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:48.250
Because systemic
can be a hedge fund,

00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:50.130
like LTCM can be
an investment bank,

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:51.590
can be an insurance company.

00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:54.570
In other words, who are you
going to end up bailing out.

00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:56.370
Doesn't come under
easy definition.

00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:58.460
AUDIENCE: So to
flip it around, you

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.825
are saying that what
you're proposing

00:58:00.825 --> 00:58:03.346
is a sufficient condition.

00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:05.720
ANAT ADMATI: It's necessary,
not matter what else you do.

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.070
AUDIENCE: Got is.

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:07.350
So you're not saying
it's sufficient,

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.170
but it will work better
with something like--

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:11.211
ANAT ADMATI: The governance
problem of the banks,

00:58:11.211 --> 00:58:13.920
in other words, is still a
problem in terms of the banker,

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.539
and the recklessness,
the fines they're paying,

00:58:16.539 --> 00:58:18.080
all of those things,
so I didn't even

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.630
go there, to LIBOR
or to other things.

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:26.360
AUDIENCE: OK, about the
executive compensations,

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:31.040
I'm always puzzled by
two understandings.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:36.850
One thing is, I think not fair
that they get tens of millions

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:38.550
in a CEO level, right?

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:40.810
Another thing, it's
my understanding

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:43.180
that it's a free market.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.450
The company has-- they
have the free will

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:48.740
to determine the compensations.

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:52.530
Are these two things
contradicting or maybe

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:53.790
both can be right?

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:57.870
Maybe a surge, you know,
invisible variables somewhere

00:58:57.870 --> 00:59:00.659
that I don't see how
they think about it.

00:59:00.659 --> 00:59:02.450
ANAT ADMATI: That's a
really good question.

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:07.690
I come to baking from-- I
was not a banking expert.

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:12.940
I was studying corporate
governance and contracting.

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.050
And in particular, I was
interested in how corporations

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.220
govern, in terms
of their equity.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:21.840
The problem in banking is
that much of the money--

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:25.330
so there is, sort of, how
do corporations govern.

00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:27.530
And so you have, every
corporation has this issue,

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.904
there's a compensation
committee,

00:59:28.904 --> 00:59:30.990
their CEO compensation
people talk about that.

00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:35.180
Who determines that, say on
pay, all of those things?

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:38.120
For banks, what
makes it very tricky

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.240
is that you've got a
lot of claim holders

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.250
whose money is invested.

00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:45.742
In other words,
corporations managers

00:59:45.742 --> 00:59:47.200
always invest other
people's money.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.920
The question is what does
these people have in return?

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.590
A debt contract or an
inequity claim or what.

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:55.664
Because banks have so much
debt, their shareholders

00:59:55.664 --> 00:59:57.830
become a little bit conflicted
with their creditors.

00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.330
Or the shareholders benefit
from government subsidies

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.590
because they get
to borrow cheaply.

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:06.920
So what ends up happening is
that at least the shareholders

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:12.360
who count or their friends the
institutional investors that

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:17.510
don't bother to really speak
up are benefiting from this.

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:22.540
In the end of the day, it works
for them at the ground level.

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.970
In other words,
the bottom line is

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:29.570
if they all do similar things
and if it doesn't work,

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:31.730
as they say, I'll be
gone, you'll be gone.

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:34.610
I mean, they come
back to the industry.

01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:37.730
Everybody who borrowed too
much or took too much risk

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:41.370
in this economy suffered
except for the bankers

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:44.930
who took the risk and those who
were supposed to keep us safe,

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:45.750
basically.

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:49.340
So somehow, accountability
at the ground level

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.120
is not really working.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.530
And if you work up
the governance chain,

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:56.380
you really see the conflicted
incentives everywhere,

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.600
on every level, including
even auditors, which

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.560
was sort of the Enron problem.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:09.400
So it's kind of a depressing
note about how governance works

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.370
and doesn't, but especially for
banks, it works very poorly.

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:13.920
[APPLAUSE]
