00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.990
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.840
My name is Steve Winick and I
am the writer and editor here

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.420
in the American Folklife Center
at the Library of Congress

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.810
and I'm here to welcome
you to the latest

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.150
in our homegrown concert series.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.340
And the homegrown concert series
was created to showcase the best

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.090
of music and dance that is
homegrown in communities

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.880
across the United States.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.360
And this is kind of an
unusual concert in the series

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.980
because usually we hold them at
noon in the Coolidge Auditorium.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.030
And we work with state
folk arts coordinators

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.460
to help us program the series

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.840
and this is a little
bit different.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.210
It's an evening concert,
of course,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.940
and it's a very special
presentation

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.920
of a multimedia event with
Jeff and Gerret Warner.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.680
And it's a program that's called
From the Mountains to Sea,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.160
the Anne and Frank
Warner Collection.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.330
The Anne and Frank
Warner Collection is one

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.630
of the great treasures

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.700
of the American Folklife
Center archive.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.510
We're really very pleased
to have this collection.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.470
And it's got beautiful
recordings of all kinds.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.950
The ones that are probably
the most famous are the ones

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.700
from North Carolina,
including the recording

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.470
from Frank Proffitt
singing Tom Dooley

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.950
which became a gigantic hit for
the Kingston Trio in the 1950's

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.110
and they will talk about
that in the presentation.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.370
So I should do some
housekeeping.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.390
I should say that one of
the reasons that we're able

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.400
to hold this evening
concert is co-sponsorship

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.060
by the Folklore Society
of Greater Washington,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.630
which is also known as FSGW.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.610
FSGW is a membership
organization dedicated

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.640
to preserving and
presenting folk arts

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.170
in the Washington D.C. region
and you can find out more

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.220
about them on the outside.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.110
And you can also find recordings

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.870
of the artists at
the table outside.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.030
And we're going to ask you if
you want to buy those recordings

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.990
and books and other
things from the artists,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.830
please do so at the
intermission because we do have

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.950
to clear the building pretty
quickly after the concert.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.340
So we'd like to make sure

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.100
that there's time to
get everybody out.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.070
So please try to do your
purchasing at the intermission

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.970
and we really hope that
you will want to take some

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.060
of this music home with you.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.770
One more piece of housekeeping,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.870
we love mobile phones,
we really do.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.950
In fact, the Veteran's
History Project even has an app

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.580
that you can use your mobile
phone to record oral histories.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.940
But we would like you to turn
your mobile phones off during

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.770
the concert because this is all
being documented for a webcast.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.290
And so there's a film crew
here and it's being documented

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.980
on audio as well and we don't
want our phones to ring.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.040
So please turn off
your cell phones.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.490
And so I mentioned that this is
a wonderful presentation called

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.230
From the Mountains
to Sea about the Anne

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.970
and Frank Warner Collection.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.480
And we are here to welcome
Jeff and Gerret Warner

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.540
and they are going to join
me on stage for just a moment

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.300
with a magical object
before they begin the music

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.420
and the presentation.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.980
And so Jeff Warner,
Gerret Warner.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.530
And I'm going to
invite up on the stage

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.600
as well, Betsy Peterson.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.040
She is the director of the
American Folklife Center

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.340
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.340
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Thank you,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.470
Steve and welcome
to everyone here.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.340
I'm up here to accept
a wonderful gift

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.050
from Jeff and Gerret Warner.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.000
They're going to give something
to the American Folklife Center

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.010
and so I just wondered if you
could tell us a little bit

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.610
about this beautiful instrument.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.710
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: This was
made by Nathan Hicks,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.700
who was a mountain
man in Watauga County.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.080
You're seeing his
picture as we speak.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.000
It was made for Frank
Warner in 1939.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.140
And it has a -- my
father was doing a program

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.380
in New York City singing
songs of the Hudson River.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.090
And he took his brand-new
banjo that he had with him.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.900
And was sitting, found
himself sitting right next

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.860
to the poet Carl Sandburg.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.190
And on a whim, he said to Carl,
"Would you sign the head?"

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.630
Carl Sandburg signed
the head, dated at 1939.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.930
And my father said,
"After that it was easy

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.610
to get other people to sign it."

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.780
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: So
there are 265 signatures

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.250
that were added beyond that,
including Woody Guthrie,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.350
Pete Seeger, Alan
and John Lomax.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.160
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Led Belly.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.460
Yeah, it's great.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.750
And we had a wonderful
time talking

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.480
about it with Steve today.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.030
So much so that my brother
and I said, "You know,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.330
we really love this banjo.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.210
Maybe we should keep
it, you know."

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.510
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: No, no.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.020
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: It looks
even more attractive now.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.320
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Right?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.170
But no. We decided in our
wisdom, this goes to the Library

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.830
of Congress and we're happy that
it goes to the American people

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.240
with all the names
from the folk revival

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.360
and folk [inaudible]
from 1939 to 1977.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.660
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Thank you, so much.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.960
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner: Thank you.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.180
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Thank you, so much.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.030
This is a wonderful gift and
to have a beautiful banjo made

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.410
by Nathan Hicks, played by
your father Frank Warner,

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.940
and on behalf of the Library of
Congress, and I know everyone

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.390
at the American Folklife Center.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.510
I'm pleased to accept this.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.980
We will cherish it, take care
of it, and I want to thank Jeff

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.050
and Gerret Warner for
this beautiful instrument.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.180
And also want to thank
Anne and Frank Warner

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.380
for their amazing collection,
which they have bestowed

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.240
to the American people and
given to us to take care of it.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.620
And we will do our
very, very best.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.250
Please come and see it.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.420
But now I'm going to turn
everything over to Jeff

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.360
and Gerret Warner for From
the Mountains to Sea, the Anne

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.270
and Frank Warner
Collection so please enjoy.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.510
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Thank
you, Betsy.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:08:19.570
[ Music ]

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.990
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Frank Warner
collected that song in 1952

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.320
at a conference in Cleveland,
Ohio but the story leading up to

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.900
that is long and full.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.200
So you go do your work.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.500
&gt;&gt; Gerret Warner:
I have to work now.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.800
All right.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:09:48.090
[ Music ]

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:53.690
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Friday
June 3rd, 1938.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:59.190
We left New York at 6:50 P.M and
drove over the Pulaski Skyway

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.200
with a wonderful
flaming Sunset overhead.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.580
Found ourselves in real
country in 20 minutes.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.260
Through Lambertville,
New Jersey just at dusk

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.370
and wished we could stay.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.740
Lovely old-fashioned village.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.970
So on through the Pennsylvania
Hills under the moon

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.480
on to some extra nice
cabins beyond Coatesville,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.910
Drake's Spanish Court.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.210
They were nice too.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.240
Even a good bed.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.390
That was from my mother,

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.210
Anne Warner's journal
on the first day.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.250
The first day of Anne and Frank
Warner's journey to a world

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.210
of old songs, old ways,
and new friendships.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.470
To their unexpected but gladly
accepted role as preserver

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.140
of song of American memory.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.850
Their journey to the
mountains from the sea.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:59.310
Alan Lomax said, "The Warners
mind the most pristine American

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.010
song terrain, the
Eastern seaboard,

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.330
where the old songs
still retain the flavor

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.310
of England, Scotland
and Ireland.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.320
And where the new
American songs grew

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.840
in very spring time
of the national saga.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.810
We have Anne's early young girl
diaries, her thoughts and poems.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.300
And her young woman
notebooks of news events

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.160
and spiritual seeking.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.820
And now she decided to keep
a journal as a couple set

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.610
out to meet Appalachian mountain
man Nathan Hicks, who had agreed

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.480
to make them a lap dulcimer.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.860
Saturday June 4th, 1938.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.410
"We seem destined to spend the
night in Pulaski, Virginia.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.970
Which we reached just
about 8 P.M. We what

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.370
about to see the sights,
it being Saturday night.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.200
Stopped to listen to an
exhortation by a young preacher

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.110
with a fanatical countenance

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.850
who was holding forth
at a tent revival.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.840
He didn't seem to
be doing so well

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.860
for we didn't see
anyone come forward.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.330
Though he came down and argued

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.150
with individuals in
the congregation."

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.060
Anne Locher was born in St.
Louis in 1905 and raised

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.870
in Saint Paul in Chicago.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.390
Frank Warner was born
into the deep south

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.600
of Selma, Alabama in 1903.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.540
And raised in Durham,
North Carolina.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.440
In the 30's because of work
and financial necessity,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.310
they found themselves in New
York City, met and married.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.580
But they didn't have
kids for a while.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.550
Anne had to leave
Northwestern University in 1925

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:46.410
after her sophomore year to help
support her parents in New York.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.800
But she was happy, despite the
hardships of the depression,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.420
to find herself a newly
married woman in 1938.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.890
Living in Greenwich
Village amidst literary

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.800
and artistic greats
and near greats

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.430
in an intellectually
stimulating community.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.340
From what she told my
brother Gerret and me,

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.680
Frank Warner was not one

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.160
of the intellectually
stimulating near-greats

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.170
but she grew to love
him nonetheless.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:23.240
Sunday June 5th, 1938, "We
started out about 7 A.M.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.960
on a beautiful morning and got

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.340
into the mountains
almost at once.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.320
We crossed the Carolina
state line in about 70 miles.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.960
Carolina in the morning.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.310
We reached Boone toward noon.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.740
To our amazement,
the town was crowded

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.940
with people the streets
lined with old cars

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.490
and trucks and wagons.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.980
How the gods smile on us.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.510
We had happened on
a county sing.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:14:29.070
[ Music ]

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.030
We worked our way up
to the courthouse.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.320
Its front yard and porch
were filled with people.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.010
By degrees, we got upstairs
and into the courtroom

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.150
where the sing was in process.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.900
A mixed group was
singing when we came in.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.020
About 12, old and young.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.360
And when they finished,
another group came up

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.390
but there was no applause.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.510
Hardly a change of expression."

00:14:50.510 --> 00:15:15.270
[ Music ]

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.580
"The next group was
a male quartet.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.960
The tenor who took the lead
sang entirely through a nose,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.710
hardly opening his mouth.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.890
A young girl in the audience
bent down to hide her face

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.020
and laugh and came up
again without even a smile.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.880
I don't think I've ever
been stared at as we were

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.690
in Boone that morning.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.970
We must have had an
obviously foreign look."

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.920
Frank Warner grew up in
the south as a hunter,

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:54.020
a football player, and
eventually a YMCA executive.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.560
He was also a singer.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.730
A talented ukulele player,
he was known in college

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.030
as the big man with
a little instrument.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.270
He organized an award-winning
quartet,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.950
led the Duke University
glee club and was one

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.400
of the students asked
to sing ballads

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.570
to illustrate classes
given by noted professor

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.750
and folk song collector,
Frank C Brown.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:26.790
It took Frank Warner six years
to get his degree from Duke,

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.100
but he used the time
wisely, being a campus

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.880
and assistant dean, an
adviser to underclassmen.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.110
After university he
moved to Greensboro,

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.330
North Carolina organizing
camps for the YMCA,

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.950
and singing on WBIG
in the evening.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.320
He sang folk songs,
minstrel songs,

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.810
ballads for the Brown
collection and popular songs

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.290
of the day Paul Whiteman's
Rhythm Boys with Bing Crosby.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:59.680
He was a big man with a warm
voice and a welcoming spirit.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.160
He was equally at home
with old country folk

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.640
or the wealthy members

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.910
of his Long Island YMCA
board of directors.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.790
I remembered being
backstage with him before one

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:16.850
of his more important concerts,
asking, "Aren't you nervous?"

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.320
He said, "Why should
I be nervous?

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.620
They are only people."

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:28.720
Sunday June 5th, 1938, "From
Boone we took a state road

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.450
to Vilas and Valle
Crucis and went up and up

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.960
and up for nearly 10 miles.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.500
And then the dirt road
Nathan Hicks spoke of,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.150
it was really nothing
but a wagon road.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.700
Just wide enough for one car.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.650
It wound up, straight
up sometimes,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.730
it took 45 minutes
to go 5 miles."

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.240
When seeking directions
once from a mountain local,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.480
our parents were told to keep
driving up until they went

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.910
around the bend where they could
see their own license plate.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.460
Then they'd be there.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.000
"At last we could see the Hicks'
house down in a little cove.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.940
And then we saw Nathan
in a shirt and tie.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.200
He said he was sure
pleased to see us.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.250
And we went down into
the house which seemed

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.510
to be overflowing with people."

00:18:24.510 --> 00:19:00.150
[ Music ]

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.270
There, Anne and Frank
met the Hicks family.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.760
Nathan, and Nelle, the
youngest of their 13 children.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.070
And much of the Hicks' extended
family and many neighbors.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.620
People who had come to see
these visitors from the beyond.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.890
The hardships were evident
with no running water,

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.700
or electricity, or money
to buy necessities.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.560
The Warners waked into the house
to see a couple of cots covered

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.820
by people sitting on them
with a few rickety chairs.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.140
Reena Hicks said, "I
couldn't hardly believe you'd

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.440
really come."

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.920
When the Warners were asked to
sit down, Reena said to Anne,

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.510
"Them chairs ain't very good."

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.500
Frank Warner said,
"I have to be careful

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.920
when I sit down in any chair."

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.500
Nathan asked him how
much he did weigh.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.840
Frank Warner said, "You guess."

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.400
And Nathan guessed exactly
to everyone's delight.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.970
Frank said, "I can see
you been weighing hogs."

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:19.480
As my mother told me the last
shreds of her strength vanished.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.860
The rest of the day and
evening were spent learning

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.510
about each other and in song.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:51.040
[ Music ]

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.550
Through friends in that
interesting 1938 Greenwich

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.890
Village community, the
Warners met Maurice Madison,

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.170
who had been collecting ballads
and songs on Beech Mountain,

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.970
North Carolina the year before.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.350
He showed the Warners
a lap dulcimer made

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.140
for him by Nathan Hicks.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.290
The Warners had never seen one,
few in New York had at the time.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.020
The Warners wanted one
and wrote to Nathan

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.940
if he would make a
dulcimer for them.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.380
Nathan wrote back, "Dear Mr.
Warner, I received your letter

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.510
that you wanted the
dulcimer like Mr. Madison.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.850
I can't send in unless
I get some money.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.810
As postage and glue and nails
cost me money and times is

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.020
so hard and my wife is
sick most of the time.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.890
And we have 10 children
and the times is so hard,

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.890
I can't get much money.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.190
Please send me the money

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.470
and I'll have the dulcimer
read time I hear from you.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.650
Your friend, Nathan Hicks."

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:56.630
fatefully, thankfully, Anne
and Frank decided to drive

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.990
down to Beech Mountain when
the dulcimer was ready instead

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.480
of waiting for the mail.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.260

songs here at the Library

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.250
of Congress, scores of
historic photographs and years

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.040
of expressive correspondence
from rural friends,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.430
we would have a single
mountain dulcimer

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.970
on the way, which
we have anyway.

[ Music ]

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.030
The people on Beech
Mountain lived

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.920
in 1938 not very much
differently form the Scotts

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.070
Irish settlers who moved
into those North Carolina,

Tennessee mountains
in the 18th century.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.150
And when the Warners drove
down to meet their new friends,

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.040
it was only 20 years
after Cecil Sharp

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.260
and Maud Karpeles had made
their momentous journeys

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.510
into these same Appalachian
Mountains.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:24:00.460
[ Music ]

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:05.260
There on the beach the
Warners met Buena Vista Hicks,

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.570
Aunt Bueny, who played
a fiddle handmade

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:15.300
by her husband Roby back inside
a single piece dug out of a log.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.740
Aunt Bueny, who saying in
that clear wild mountain style

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.570
on the edge of her voice.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.370
And who started to play at
local festivals in the 1960's

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.030
when she was in her late 70's.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:33.140
They met one of Nathan's
sons, Louis, who when told

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.750
that there were one million
people in New York City,

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.690
he said, "I reckon if
that many folks took

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.090
out after you they'd
sure catch you."

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:46.830
And Nathan and Reena's
young son, Ray Hicks,

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.200
who would later be recognized
as a master story teller.

And in 1983, given a
National Heritage Fellowship

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.970
by the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.550
And they met Nathan's young
son-in-law, a carpenter

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:09.510
and tobacco farmer,
Frank Proffitt.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:26:29.330
[ Music ]

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:34.930
Frank Proffitt was born in 1913.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.630
After 6th grade at a
mountain school he left school

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.980
to work on his father's farm.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.380
Then in the 1930's, left
home for the first time

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.190
to join the Works Progress
Administration, the WPA,

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.820
one of the many programs
designed during the depression

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.200
by the Roosevelt administration
to get America working again.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.950
When the Warners met Frank, he
had been away from the beach.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.380
Some had heard radio and was

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.880
under the thrall
of Jimmie Rodgers.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.380
And why not?

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.280
But he always valued the
older songs he'd learned

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.810
from his father Wiley, from
his Aunt Nancy Prather,

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.590
and from his grandfather
John Proffitt,

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.840
who crossed enemy lines
to fight for the Union

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.160
with the 13th Tennessee
Cavalry during the Civil War.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.950
Frank Proffitt sang
the Warners three songs

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.090
on that first day they met.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:34.560
Dan Doo, Moonshine,
and Tom Dooley.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.880
Later on in 1941, when the
Warners stayed with Frank

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.930
and his wife Bessy
for several days,

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.360
the Warners had a portable
recording machine made

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.210
for them by Filco Electronics.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:49.010
There at the house
that Frank built,

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.450
the Warners recorded Tom
Dooley and the beginnings

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:56.030
of 100 song repertoire from
Proffitt's mountain past.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.790
Frank Warner was moved
by the song Tom Dooley.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.970
He took it back to New
York where he sang it

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.020
for collector Alan Lomax,
who included the song

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.280
in his 1947 book folks on USA.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.820
The song and the book made
its way around America.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.380
And in 1958 was recorded by
a west coast singing group,

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.590
the Kingston Trio, who sold
three million copies of the song

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.550
and in doing so helped to
generate the folk song revival

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.180
which continues on a
half century later.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.750
The story of the
Dooley recording is long

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.460
and for another time.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:36.200
But Lomax's publisher and the
Kingston Trio's capital records

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.250
settled a suit out
of court in 1962.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.830
And from that settlement,
Frank Proffitt made enough

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.450
to build a new house
there in Watauga County.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:29:17.040
[ Music ]

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.770
Tom Dooley was the story of
a real murder that took place

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:26.680
in 1868 where Tom Dula,
D-U-L-A, pronounced Dooley

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.950
in the mountains, came back from
the Civil War, got himself more

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.040
than one girlfriend, and
then handled it badly.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:40.030
He was hanged for the
murder of Laura Foster.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.320
Over the years, Frank Proffitt
changed the way he changed

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.620
the song.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.300
We don't know if it was the
influence of Frank Warner,

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.510
the Kingston Trio, or
just his personal choice.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:30:39.310
[ Music ]

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.790
Tom Dooley did something
else for Frank Proffitt.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.600
It allowed him to travel
far form his mountain top

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:52.350
and meet thousands of people
interested in him and his music.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:56.740
World War II interrupted the
Warners' collecting trips.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.790
When they finally got a car
and the time, they went back

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.290
to the mountains in 1951.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:08.240
And this time with
two small children.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.810
I stand amazed how
they did that.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.880
Dragging an 8 and a 5 year old

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.260
into the 19th century
mountain life.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.130
When they got to the beach,

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.110
they found Frank
Proffitt was not there.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.170
Hard times had caused him
to sell his instruments

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.360
and go off to find work.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.910
He had stopped singing.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:33.620
The 1951 sessions, Gerret's
and my first in the mountains,

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.360
yielded much important material

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.870
because now the Warners
had a tape recorder.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.640
There were long interviews
with Roby and Bueny Hicks

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.830
and a Jack Tale from
Rey and an afternoon

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.130
with the preacher [inaudible].

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:50.470
But Frank Proffitt was missed.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:32:48.750

The Warners raising two sons
and holding down their jobs

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:05.080
on Long Island in New York but
planted seeds were growing.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.690
When Frank Proffitt saw the
Kingston Trio sing Tom Dooley

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.730
on television sometime
in the late '50s,

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:16.490
he thought they were making
fun of him and his music.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.330
Frank Warner had to go down
to North Carolina to meet

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:25.210
with Proffitt and assure him
that he was not being mocked.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.860
Reluctantly, Proffitt
agreed to go with Warner

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.390
to the 1961 Chicago
folk festival.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.330
Frank Warner said that
Proffitt was so nervous,

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.290
he couldn't go on stage.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:39.160
So Warner had the crew turn
on all the stage lights

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.990
so Proffitt couldn't
see the audience.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.930
And then he went out on
stage with Frank Proffitt

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.280
to ease him into singing.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.080
It worked.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.140
Reviewer Studd Sterkle said,
"Frank Proffitt, the farmer

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.420
and carpenter from North
Carolina told us more

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.490
than we have accustomed
to expect.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:00.420
Since a great many of us have
come to equate folk music

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.820
with cuteness, cleverness,
pretty sounds.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.360
But often folk song --
folk singing is not pretty

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.990
and sometimes it is harsh
as life itself is hard.

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:14.210
Always it is true."

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.130
There was a singular reaction
at the three-day festival.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.010
The audience, consisting
primarily of college students,

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:25.970
acclaimed the Appalachian man
rather than the slick pros.

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:29.480
In 1964, Proffitt
accompanied Warner

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.050
to the new for folk festival.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:33.920
And then he represented
the state of North Carolina

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.530
at the World's Fair
in New York City.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:40.770
Frank Proffitt recorded
three albums of his music

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:45.120
for folk legacy and folk
wave Smithsonian and began

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.160
to get orders for his handmade
banjos from around the world.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.020
I have one of those banjos,

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:55.270
made for me by Frank shortly
before he died suddenly

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.830
at the age of 52.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.680
I'll show it to you sometime.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.360
I played another of Frank's
banjos in Peter Kennedy's parlor

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.460
in Gloucester, England in 2004.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.790
Frank's music got around and now
I'm glad to say that banjo is

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.430
in the reading room right here
at the Library of Congress.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:18.570
That same one that Frank made
for Douglas Kennedy back in '61.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:23.520
At age 16, Frank Proffitt
walked barefoot across the hills

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.930
to his first town,
Mountain City, Tennessee.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.830
In his short life, Frank moved

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:36.370
from 18th century subsistence
farming to deserved recognition

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:39.270
of sophistication
of the 20th century.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:42.240
Playing at festivals, making
commercial recordings,

taking orders for sought
after handmade banjos,

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.790
and corresponding with
people from around the world.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:52.770
My mother said, "Frank Proffitt
was a generous, sensitive,

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:57.130
uncommonly intelligent stubborn
and often full of humor man.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.270
I love Frank's sense of humor.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.680
Speaking of farming his
North Carolina mountains,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.490
he said he was plowing
a hill so steep

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.340
that he kept getting
dirt down his collar."

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.680
He met a man once, said Frank,

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.940
sitting by the side
of the road crying.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.600
Frank asked him,
"What was the matter?"

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.680
He said, "That's the
fourth time today I fell

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.980
out of my cornfield."

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:33.170
During that first trip
to the mountains in 1938,

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:37.570
Frank and the Hicks' and the
Warners' had climbed the behind

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.360
Hicks' house to get a
grand look, take pictures,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.400
and show everyone
binoculars for the first time.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.630
Frank Proffitt said he
could see his cornfield

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.250
through the glasses.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.090
And then with one of
his rare smiles said,

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.510
"I don't see nobody
hoeing in it though."

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.550

Frank's humor

at the Newport Folk
Festival in 1964,

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.710
he saw Earl Scruggs
playing banjo.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:11.290
Fast. Frank Proffitt said,
"I'd like to be able to play

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:13.510
that way and then not."

[ Laughter ]

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.940
In 1959, Frank wrote
to the Warners,

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.240
"My earliest recollection is of
waking on a cold winter morning

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.300
in a log cabin on
the old beaver dam.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.050
And hearing the sad
haunting tune of Tom Dooley,

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.780
picked by my father along
with the frying of meat

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.640
on the little step
stove, and the noise

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.650
of the little coffee mill
grinding the arbuckle.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:53.030
What better world could there be
for a small boy who was hungry

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:56.880
for the fried meat and biscuit
and hungry also to make sounds

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.290
like a grown up on a
curly walnut banjo.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:04.420
I started soon to
trying to pick the banjo.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.320
And soon the happy day
came when dad said,

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.020
"I declare you are just about
got Tom Dooley a going."

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.710
I married into another
singing family of Nathan Hicks

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.560
and with his dulcimer I went

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.630
on to the kind of
life that I loved.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.040
Then Frank Warner
came to the mountains

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.110
and in him I saw
an educated person

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.920
who made me feel like somebody.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.920
I open my heart to him and
gave him all the old songs

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.830
of my people.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.130
His eyes sparkled as I sing
Tom Dooley to him and told him

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:41.720
of my grandma Proffitt
knowing Tom and Laura.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.140
I've told him of people and he
and Anne didn't seem to notice

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:49.050
that we was poor and
didn't know any big words.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:54.160
They bragged on our new calf,
on our little two room cabin.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.160
Brought us store stuff to eat.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.810
I walked on airs for day --

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.970
I walked on air for
days after they left.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:04.830
I got a television
set for the kids

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:08.090
and one night I was a set
looking at some foolishness

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.350
when three fellers stepped
out with a guitar and a banjo

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.170
and went to singing Tom Dooley.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.930
And they clowed and
they hip swinged.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.730
I began to feel sort of sick.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.640
Like I'd lost a loved one.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:26.040
I went out and I
balled on the ridge.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.520
Looking towards old Wilkes
County, land of Tom Dooley.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.110
I looked up across the
mountains and I said, "Lord,

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.580
couldn't they leave
me the good memories?"

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:42.820
But then Frank Warner wrote,

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.830
he tells me that someway
our song got picked up.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:49.850
The shock was over,
I went back to work.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.000
I begin to see the
world was bigger

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.380
than our mountains
or Wilkes or Watauga.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.960
Folks was brothers.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:03.750
I began to pit them that hadn't
dozed by the hearthstone.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:07.730
Life was sharing the different
thinking, the different ways.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:10.730
I looked in the mirror
of my heart.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:13.290
You ain't a boy no longer.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.770
Give folks like Frank
Warner all you got.

Quit thinking ridge to ridge.

Think ocean to ocean."

[ Music ]

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:44.420
That's a perfect
place to take a break.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.290
But we couldn't make it
that way so you're going

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:48.590
to have to deal with it.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.520
Soon. Soon we will.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:59.840
A note about the times in which
Anne and Frank Warner lived.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.820
Mike Seager said to me once,
"Up until 100 years ago,

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.250
if you ever heard music
it was played by someone

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.550
in the same room as you.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:13.780
Then in the 20's came
radio and with the flick

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.610
of a switch it ended loneliness.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.370
We never thought to ask our
parents what it must have been

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:22.900
like to live in a
time without radio.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.100
Then see it become universal.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.430
But in the late 1930's as
they were soon to find out,

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.670
there were pockets of the
country where electricity

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.000
and radios had yet to come.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.230
And it was the depression.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.740
Artists and writers were
affected by the plight

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.180
of the common man and
had been put to work

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.810
by the Roosevelt Administration.

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:47.480
The Federal Writers' Project
hired more than 6,000 people

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.240
to write state guidebooks

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.280

Now Praise Famous Men,

his book length essay about
three families of tenant farmers

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.590
in Alabama, used photographs

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:04.820
by the farm security
administration's Walker Evans.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:09.210
Virgil Thompson composed scores
for government documentaries.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.700
And WPA painters created
murals celebrating pioneers

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.810
and working people.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:19.310
Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath
grew out of the reporting he did

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:24.250
for the FSA on hunger and health
in California migrant camps.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:29.790
In 1939, Aaron Copland wrote
film scores for Our Town

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:33.920
and the Academy Award
nominated Of Mice and Men.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.830
And he was working on his
fanfare for the common man.

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:41.070
In New York, the Warners'
friends were writing

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.080
about heartland America

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.860
and portraying country
people and their lives.

wrote Western Star,

the Pulitzer Prize
winning book length poem

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.790
about the pioneers of America.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:59.650
Carl Carmer, historian,
author and upstairs neighbor,

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:04.030
wrote the best-selling Stars
Fell on Alabama in 1934.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:08.580
Created nonfiction about the
people on folklore of Alabama.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:16.750
Two people, Anne, a born
historian and writer.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:20.010
Frank, a natural singer
and engaging southerner,

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.570
setting out while the
old song still lingered.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:26.960
Encouraged by their literary
friends to find American

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.270
and setting out when
recorded sound away

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.130
from a studio had
become possible.

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:37.360
First, the publishers Farrar
&amp; Rinehart then Filco,

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.040
pioneers in radio and television
manufacture, became interested

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.090
in the Warners collecting trips.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:47.910
They developed disc makers that
could be taken into the field.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.860
Those machines and the tape
recorder that followed in 1951,

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:55.100
made possible the thousand
songs found by the Warners

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.310
that now reside at the
Library of Congress.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:55.150
[ Music ]

00:46:55.150 --> 00:47:00.750
In the late 1930s, Carl
Carmer, their upstairs neighbor,

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:04.370
was working on a history of
the Hudson River and its lore.

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:08.930
In its research he came across
a long-retired Adirondack logger

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:13.120
named John Galusha
of Minerva, New York.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.400
Carl decided the Warners should
go visit John, so they did,

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.140
one week in the summer of 1939.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.040
That began an ongoing
relationship with John

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:31.270
that lasted until he died
in 1950 at the age of 91.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:35.320
He was a reluctant
singer at first.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.790
Another collector had found
John some years before,

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:41.570
noted down a raft of
songs, and then left

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.440
without further communication.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.000
But John became sure quickly

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.670
that would not be the
case with the Warners.

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:56.970
John Galusha was of Irish
descent born in 1859.

00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:00.030
his grandfather fought
in the war of 1812.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:07.110
He started working in
the North woods in 1875.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:10.350
The need for wood was enormous
in the late 19th century

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:14.590
to build and heat houses for
the ties of limitless miles

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.350
of railroad track, and
the Adirondacks were,

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:21.960
as one commentator put it,
the Saudi Arabia of Wood.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.630
Chopping, hauling,
stacking timber all winter.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:29.260
Then in the spring, driving
the logs down the Hudson River

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.540
to mills at Glens Falls.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.510
That's the way John lived.

[ Music ]

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.630
John's singing style was
decided northern and reflective

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:50.220
of his Irish heritage and the
many Irish Americans who worked

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.480
in the lumber camps with him.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.490
He was not the highly
decorated Irish Shaun O style,

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:59.470
but an open, declarative
northern Irish storytelling

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.420
style that delivered
both text and emotion.

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.110
I think of Irish singer Joe
Heaney, long living in America,

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:12.060
who used to say, "You tell the
story and you say the song.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:19.510
And a song should have
a pulse but not a beat."

00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:00.770
John's older brother died of
wounds he received at the battle

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:04.150
of Battle of Cold Harbor
in Virginia in 1864.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:09.170
The Civil War was
most real to him.

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.680
Frank Warner did not talk much

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.030
about his own upbringing
in the south.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:17.600
John Galusha said, "I
knew a rebel colonel,

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.610
I guided him fishing.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:21.970
Every time I looked at him,
I thought of my brother lying

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:26.090
on his bed groaning and
I wanted to kill him.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:27.390
I didn't like him.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:30.920
But he was an all right fellow.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.290
The southern people are
a generous race of people

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.510
if you can believe what you read
and what other people tell you."

in New Hampshire,

Born Fish, Grammy Fish.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.360
She was born in 1873
into a logging family

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.810
in the Black Brook section
of Northern Adirondacks.

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:40.170
Moving to New Hampshire in
her early '20s to take a job

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:42.550
as a housekeeper for a midwife.

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:46.010
Then she married her
employer's son, John Fish,

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:47.910
and raised a large family

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:51.360
in the temple Jeffrey
section of the state.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.770
When the Warners first knocked
in her door of the summer

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:57.480
of 1940 saying, "We
heard you were interested

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.390
in old time songs."

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:01.220
She said, "Come right in."

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.450
My folks said she chased the
grand kids out of the house

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.750
and was soon singing and
was not to be stopped.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:15.230
Her off spring cared little
for her homely old songs

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.200
and sentimental poems.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.150
She was so happy to have
someone visit her who cared.

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:24.620
In two long weekends
in 1940 and '41

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:28.840
and sang almost 100
songs to the Warners.

Helen Hartness Flanders
a Vermont collector

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.450
in the 40's also
visited Mrs. Fish.

00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:45.360
She too got 100 songs from
Fish of which 50 are different.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:49.970
I visit Lina's granddaughter,
Ruth Quin, whenever I'm

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:51.270
out in Temple, New Hampshire.

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:54.270
As a matter of fact, two
years ago I got to go

00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:57.230
to her 90th birthday party.

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:58.530
She said the Warners'

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:01.690
and Flanders' visits did
wonders for her grandmother.

00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:04.960
She took a new interest in
life, collected more stories

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.520
about local history, and started
distributing a little mimeograph

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.420
newsletter about her songs.

few written by Lina.

She even began to sing
out for local societies

00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:18.800
and civic organizations.

There are many members of
the extended Fish family

Every five years or so they have
a big gathering, a Fish fry.

A few years ago, they -- I got
voted on as an honorary Fish

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:38.900

to sing some of Lina's songs

of folk song collection as
enthusiastic untutored amateurs.

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.340
They both had full time
jobs and were lucky

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:59.070
to have a few weeks each summer
to be out looking for songs.

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:02.550
They had none of the training,
grants, or university support

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:05.720
that was to come later
to some folklorists.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.810

they'd asked Grammy Fish

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:11.300
where she learned her songs.

But they didn't know
enough to ask at the time.

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:18.300
The Warners developed their
own style of collecting.

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:23.650
Befriend, share stories, offer
a list of motifs that are

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:26.650
in old songs designed
to spur memory.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.210
If that didn't work, just
keep singing songs at them

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:39.970
until they couldn't take it
anymore and they'd sing back.

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:46.760
Then record a verse and chorus
while Anne took down the balance

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.830
of words in shorthand.

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:52.260
That worked for them until they
started lecturing and writing

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.440
about these remarkable
singers and their songs.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.930

learned more about provenance

00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:02.510

tradition bearers.

Well let me guarantee that the
second half is a lot shorter

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:49.930
than the first.

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:51.740
That's the way we
had to make it work.

We could tell you why

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.140
but it would be even more
boring if we told you why.

got another little section.

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:56.230
or Come Love Come,
a charming meld

01:25:56.230 --> 01:25:59.170
of two 19th century
minstrel songs.

01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:01.110
&gt;&gt; Anne Warner: If
you can just sing us

01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:03.510
that much you sang,
we'd love it.

01:26:03.510 --> 01:28:45.620
[ Music ]

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:48.360
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: There were
other places, other singers,

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.500
other important songs.

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:54.000
Found in living rooms or
in hotel dining rooms.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.300
From interested professors,
or Jamaican women who looked

01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:01.490
after Gerret and me in New
York City when we were babies.

01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:05.600
Or songs from barefoot
country children.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.340
But [inaudible] journey
together where we began it

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:11.850
on Beech Mountain
of North Carolina.

01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:16.100
Take a second here to
thank a bunch of people.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:20.350
And we can hold applause
until we get

01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:22.480
through because there's
so many to recognize.

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:25.660
My brother Gerret who put
together the visual thing here.

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.570
It's just beautiful
from all the Frank

01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:29.380
and Anne Warner photographs.

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.330
And my sister-in-law Mimi Gretty
who's been running the sound

01:29:32.330 --> 01:29:35.450
tonight for the sound
of the recordings.

01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:36.750
Chris Romaine.

01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:38.450
The inevitable and
wonderful Chris Romaine

01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:44.180
who loaned me his banjo so I
didn't have to fly with one.

01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.990
Folklore Society of
greater Washington

01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:49.190
who co-sponsored
tonight, thank you.

01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:53.180
Todd Harvey of the American
Folklife Center who made

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:57.350
so easy the donation of this
banjo one we decided to do it.

01:29:57.350 --> 01:30:04.080
And who I'll talk to
if we want it back.

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:08.750
Steve Winick, writer editor
for the Folklife Center,

01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:12.250
for arranging and moderating the
interview we did this afternoon

01:30:12.250 --> 01:30:15.180
and helping with the
organizing of this event.

01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:18.940
And Thia Austin who was our
point person and worked with me

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:21.050
for months to get us here.

01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:25.220
She's the public events
Folklife Center coordinator.

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:31.250
And she and I have worked
together before in 1993.

01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:33.990
I was singing in
England and Bob Copper

01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:37.960
of the famous singing Copper
family said to me, "You're going

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.250
to fix our first
tour in America."

01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:42.870
And I said, "Okay."

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:44.170
And I did.

01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:49.160
So in 1995, the Copper family
in their first trip over,

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:54.070
stood on this very stage in this
very room and sang the songs

01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:58.990
from their generations of
their Sussex farmer background.

01:30:58.990 --> 01:31:02.170
It was so funny that that first
day they came on stage here,

01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:03.880
they looked out at the audience

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.970
and Bob Copper said,
"Where's the beer."

01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:19.440
We end this -- in 1959,

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.150
the first mountain trip
Gerret and I -- oh.

01:31:22.150 --> 01:31:23.950
Applause.

01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:34.680
[ Applause ]

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.000
'59, the first mountain
trip Gerret

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.680
and I really remember,
we met Homer Cornet.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.450
A cousin of Frank Proffitt.

01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:46.140
He was a shy man who
sang only two songs

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:48.430
in the one visit
we had with him.

01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:52.000
One was an older gospel song
he had reworked as a gift

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.670
to the Church when he joined.

01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:57.390
It's called the Wild
Stormy Deep.

01:31:57.390 --> 01:32:02.160
Let's listen to Homer sings
and then let's end together

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:05.510
by singing it together.

01:32:05.510 --> 01:35:41.610
[ Music ]

01:35:41.610 --> 01:35:43.910
&gt;&gt; Jeff Warner: Thank you.

01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:51.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Please,
another round of applause

01:35:51.160 --> 01:36:01.800
for Jeff Warner, for Gerret
Warner, and for the whole team.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.100
Thank you all so much.

01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.220

of the Library of Congress.
