00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.520
Critic: AAAH!!  Aah! Aah! AAAAH!!

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.520
Ugh... ugh, ugh!

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.560
Kermit Devil: Nostalgia Critic!!

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.060
Critic: Fuck!

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.120
Kermit Devil: You will lead my army of Hell!  Yaaaaayyyy!!

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.600
Critic: Me?  Wh...why me?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.080
Kermit Devil: Oh, I don't know... your lack of leadership skills,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.440
your disinterest in working with other people,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.260
and most importantly, the fact that you went out in such an embarrassingly easy way.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.540
This makes you the Devil's ultimate weapon!  Yaaaaayyyy!!

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.400
Critic: Dude, you're not the Devil.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.800
Kermit Devil: I.. wh... I am so the Devil!

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.000
Critic: Buddy, I served with the Devil.  I knew the Devil.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.340
The Devil is a friend of mine.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.640
You, sir, aren't no Devil.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.260
Kermit Devil: *sigh*

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.760
Devil: Sorry... I knew that didn't feel right.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.120
Critic: Mr. Zebub, what is this?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.280
What's with this crazy plan and that fake dollar store Muppet?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.060
Devil: I just feel like I'm not as popular as I used to be,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.260
what with people thinking I spend all of my time in elevators and such.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.800
So, I looked up what people consider to be a "cool" Devil,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.900
and everyone pointed to "Spawn."

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.620
Critic: Wait..

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.160
Did you look up the comic book or the movie?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.980
Devil: ....movie.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.600
Critic: D'oh! Ya, doofus, you picked the wrong one!!

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.940
That represents the original source material like Mario Bros. the movie represents the game!

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.400
In fact, there's a petition to get an apology to John Leguizamo for both films!

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
Devil: Well, how was I supposed to know?!

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.480
Critic: *scoff* You can tell just by looking at it!

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.660
Based on the popular comic book series by Todd McFarlane,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.840
"Spawn" was made at the exact WORST time it could've been made.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.260
Where the internet would castrate this film for all the inaccuracies to the source material,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.760
this was at a time when comic book movies weren't taken as seriously as they are now.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.700
How do I know this?

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.160
Because it came out the exact same year as Batman and Robin

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.120
Yeah... that's the kind of dark age we're looking at, people!

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.420
Prepare for 9 circles of suck!

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.360
Devil: So, this is what NOT to do...

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360
...to be a cool Devil.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.160
Critic: YES!!

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.480
Devil: I'd better take notes.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.720
DON'T JUDGE ME!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.000
Critic: The film opens...

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.140
Cogliostro: The battle between the darkness and the light has waged eternal...

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.140
Critic: Hold on, what was that?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.960
Huh.. who was THAT guy?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.020
Waitaminute... go back!

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.060
What's going on?

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.300
C... can't you just g...

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.200
Stop! Stop!

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.160
Wh... What was goin' on with... with...

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.220
Cogliostro: Someone to lead his...

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.820
Critic: Okay!

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.200
Is this just.. drive-by cinema?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.160
They tell you the backstory in the length it takes to pass a stop light?

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.700
"This was a movie named 'Spawn,' I hope you enjoyed it. Later!"

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.760
"Buy the toys!"

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.420
Oh, good.  It looks like things are finally calming down...

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.520
...like dynamite in your ass.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.620
This is our main character Al Simmons, played by Michael Jai White,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.380
who is an assassin who really can't wait for drones to be made

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.740
but is still doing a pretty good job with his implausible 90s technology.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.560
Cogliostro: Like him, I killed in the name of good.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.440
Critic: ...and I've been in better films.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.780
Cogliostro: Now I watch for others like me....

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.720
Critic: So after they roll out the seizure credits–

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.820
hey, if I worked on this, I'd want my name to be impossible to see–

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.160
we cut to one of our villains, played by Martin Sheen,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.620
who reportedly always wanted to do a comic book movie.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.440
And for his sins, they gave him one.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.820
Wynn: All you have to do is keep certain agencies off my back.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.620
Clown: And when the big piñata breaks...

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.000
...you'll get it all.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.000
Critic: The other villain they're keeping in shadows–

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.720
even though you...

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.840
QUITE CLEARLY SHOWED HIM A MINUTE AGO...

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.800
hur hur!!–

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.740
is called The Violator, played by John Leguizamo.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.820
Think an evil Sam Kinison if he was possessed by Krusty the Clown.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.720
Clown: This 5-year plan of yours just chaps my buttocks!

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.260
Krusty: Anybody here have herpes?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.640
Huh? Huh?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.420
Critic: This is a character so evil

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.600
that apparently, they put him on air fresheners!

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.920
Wh.. wh... what?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.700
Blake: Make sure he's back for dinner tomorrow night.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.640
Fitzgerald: I'll do my best.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.000
Blake: Make sure he's back for dinner tomorrow night, Terry.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.540
Critic: You're not gonna address that, huh?

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.020
No tie-ins, no explanation, just...

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.440
the villain's face is on an... air freshener.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.820
That... th... v... y... okay.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.760
I mean, why should I be bothered by that?

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.300
It's like if... Wolverine was reading a magazine with Magneto on the cover.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.960
Who needs an explanation?!

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.760
Heck! I just assumed Hell had a successful side business of dashboard accessories!

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.380
Devil: So...

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.480
DON'T do that.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.580
Critic: Don't do that!

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.220
So Simmons seems happy with his wife and kid

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.320
while literally slaughtering the competition,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.900
but little does he know he's being watched...

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.140
...by a... Listerine commercial.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.860
"I glow when I kill up to 97% plaque buildup."

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.680
Wynn: You will follow orders and do your job!

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.600
Simmons: And I want out.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.800
Critic: Simmons says he's done being an assassin, though,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.060
so Sheen gives him one last job and promises that he'll let him out safe.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.240
I mean... come on!  You can trust a guy who has scorpions in his ashtray,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.860
an assistant who carries tarantulas,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.180
and literally pictures of EXPLOSIONS on his wall!

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.920
Who does this?!

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.580
Who goes THAT far out of their way for this kind of crap?

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.200
Even Skeletor–who lives in a giant skull–is like...

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.280
"Okay, you need to take it down a notch there, buddy."

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.160
But Simmons is sabotaged by Sheen and his assistant,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.540
and they cover him in flammable Nickelodeon slime.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.700
Priest: Looks like I'm up for a promotion!

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.060
Critic: He wakes up, confusingly, in an alleyway looking like a salami with Salieri's face–

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.440
A... "salameri"–

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.040
as he comes across the man who was watching him before.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.800
"I'm still minty fresh."

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.400
Simmons: What are you looking at, old man?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.980
Critic: This is a dead knight played by Nicol Williamson,

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.320
and even though he's every clichéd mentor character known to man,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.100
he still manages to be a million flavors of awesome

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.520
because he has the world's coolest voice!

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.440
Cogliostro: A new Spawn has emerged from the darkness

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.880
while things on Earth... changed...

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.620
in ways that will only feed his anger and desire for revenge.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.500
Critic: This guy could read the script to Beavis and Butthead, and it'd still sound amazing!

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.460
"And Beavis smacked Butthead for getting a better view of the woman's cleavage,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.880
to which he replied in vengeful anger,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.700
'Cut it out, butthole, I'm trying to score!'"

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.720
But he must have been a heavy sleeper, as–apparently–it's five years later,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.240
and he doesn't realize that his family has moved on.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.000
Clown: Bad Crispy! Clown not like!

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.820
He's harmless! He's safe as milk!

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.100
Fitzgerald: Alright, that's it. Just get your stuff, get outta here, and take him with you!

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.620
Critic: "That's the last time we use the John Wayne Gacy Clown Registry!"

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.580
So, Violator is nice enough to bring Simmons up to speed...

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.080
*fart*

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.000
...in the most annoying way possible, of course.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.880
Clown: I guess 5 years feedin' earthworms has eaten what little brain there was in there.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.760
Simmons: Rrrr!

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.360
Critic: Maa-ha-haan, this is great.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.180
We already know he hates clowns.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.940
Clown: Well, allow me to kickstart your memory.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.140
Critic: So, he's told that when he died 5 years ago,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.660
he was sent straight to Hell, and...

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.760
ohh, I'm sorry... that's...

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.060
that's a lotta lame.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.660
The Devil Malebolgia: If you lead my army

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.200
you can see Wanda again.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.140
Simmons: Yes, I will lead your army!

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.200
The Devil Malebolgia: Avenge your murder!

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.740
Kill Jason Wynn!

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.340
Devil: So this is...

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.120
...NOT a good Hell.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.280
Critic: That was really just asked?!

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.900
That was really just asked?!

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.180
This is one of the lamest Hells ever designed!

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.780
Not only does it look BEYOND fake for a big-budget movie,

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.460
not only is it some of the laziest layout work for something that can be creative in its sleep,

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.860
but this is the shittiest Devil ever!

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.520
Literally!

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.320
He looks like a giant piece of shit!

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.100
If somebody sculpted a turd to look like a hyena with sea turtle dicks for ears

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.800
covered in Ron Weasley's pubes and the voice of Dr. Claw parading as the Lord of Darkness,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.020
I'd say, "What are you smoking? Give me some, and you're fired!"

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:13.200
I'd call it a cheap CGI puppet, except it's not even a functioning puppet!

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.480
The lips don't even move when he talks!

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.220
The Devil Malebolgia: I put you on Earth to make sure Spawn keeps his end of the bargain!

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.980
Critic: This means that, technically,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.100
the Ninja Turtle Christmas Special had better effects

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.180
because they at least made an attempt to have their lips move!

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.700
This looks like Sauron's pet chihuahua!

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.580
Even the logic doesn't make any sense!

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.560
Look what's said if Simmons fails in leading his army....

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.200
The Devil Malebolgia: If you fail me... you will die!

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.660
Critic: Ai... j... b... HE'S ALREADY DEAD!

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.640
He's in Hell!  Where else can you go from there?!

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.460
Is there a... Hell for Hell?

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.480
Is it a place just like this, except the lights flicker and there's a leaky pipe?!

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.040
Devil: Actually, there IS a Hell for Hell.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.520
Critic: Really? What is it?

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.980
Announcer: Next on TMZ!!!!

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.700
Critic: Ohhh... good choice.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.760
Devil: Mmmm....

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.160
Critic: Give yourself a "plus" for that, that's...

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.660
Devil: Yes....

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.660
Announcer (in background): TMZ!!!

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.120
Critic: So, Simmons is shown where he's buried, as he's–funny enough–

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.240
right next to a group of Satan worshipers, led by Guy Fieri!

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.420
Punk #1: Did, like, Satan send you guys?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.080
Clown: How come God hogs up all the good followers, and we get all the retards?

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.640
Critic: Oh, I don't know. Have you seen Christian movies lately?

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.040
Clown: Strike oil, half of it is mine!

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.340
Start diggin'!

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.160
Critic: Put a question mark down for that one.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.820
Devil: Why?

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.640
Critic: Because sometimes in life, that's all you can do.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.100
Oh, by the way, just to give you an idea of how bad the CGI is,

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.580
you can actually see where the glowing effect is CUT OFF!

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.400
No wonder Hell keeps losin'!  They can't even figure out how to crop an effect right!

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.900
Simmons: Aagh!!

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.160
Critic: But suddenly, Simmons starts to change.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.640
"Well, you look better in it than Topher Grace."

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.500
Clown: Spawn, General of Hell's armies!

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.060
Spawn: What have I done?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.740
Critic: No, really... what has he done?

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.820
This movie is so backward-ly told, it's impossible to follow it!

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.500
Spawn: ...when I get my hands on Wynn.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.100
Cogliostro: You're letting them get to you.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.100
Critic: "Help me fight gingivitis."

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.280
Cogliostro: Every choice has its consequences.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.600
Critic: So, he's sent to kill off Sheen's character, who's tied to a plague than can wipe out humanity.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.160
Gee... I guess...

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.860
NOBODY SAW THAT COMING!

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.800
As he gets ready to go to a party that...

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.100
*chuckle* what... what... wha... wh... wh *chuckle* wh... wha...

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.460
What is she wearing?

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.120
Wynn: Ha ha ha!

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.300
Priest: Was there ever any doubt?

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.160
Wynn: Never.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.540
Devil: See, that's what I thought you looked for in an assassin.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.900
Critic: No!! That's not what you look for...

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.340
Okay, do you have an assassin who dresses like that?

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.040
Devil: Yeah.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.700
Critic: Bring her in here!

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.800
I'm gonna show you how you react when you're looking for a professional killer!

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.860
Assassin: It's time to load up and haul a...

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.540
Critic: Next!

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.340
Assassin: But you can't turn me down like that! *scoff*

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.240
Critic: Anybody who dresses like that is not gonna take their job seriously!

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.740
Next!

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.760
Assassin: What am I supposed to wear?

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.800
Critic: Amor! Bulletproof vests! A mask to hide your face!

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.920
Assassin: How are people supposed to know that I'm a woman?

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.660
Critic: It doesn't matter if you're a woman!

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.840
It's actually better if they DON'T know you're a woman, because then you'll be harder to find!

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.260
Christ!  You're as conspicuous as someone from "The Matrix!"

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.600
Assassin: Wait, you didn't like "The Matrix"?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.200
Critic: OUT!

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.780
Assassin: But it was symbolic and meant stuff!!

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.440
Critic: Here, I'm gonna put you in contact with a REAL professional!

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.680
Benny? How fast can you get down here?

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.320
Benny: I'm already here.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.700
Devil: I like him already.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.760
Critic: Sheen and the "assassinatrix" go to the party–

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.580
where the dress code seems to be "Green Ranger"–

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.860
when Simmons, now calling himself Spawn,

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.040
does his first of many Batman ripoffs.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.920
Wow, that...

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.460
SOOO looks like it's there, doesn't it?

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.680
Can't you just feel the texture of the...

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.300
binary code?

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.820
Spawn: You don't recognize your own handiwork?

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.560
Critic: "Red Skull?"  "No, that's a different comic company.  I'm BACON SKULL!"

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.540
Priest: Nice outfit, asshole!

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.560
Critic: Look who's talking, prosti-tart!

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.580
It's okay! The... camera was just making sure your ass still looks good.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:08.880
It does.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.440
Whoa! Now, that's a chastity belt working overtime!

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.180
"There's no knockin' this cock-in!"

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.200
Priest: Aaah!

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.140
Critic: The cops show up and try to take him down,

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.360
but Spider-Ham isn't gonna be caught so easily.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.900
"Set your guns to 'Not Even Close!'"

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.180
His cape disguises him as part of the building...

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.100
...only to stop using it and have him be seen again.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.240
You know... for the guy who's gonna lead the armies of Hell,

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.280
he's kind of a clumsy clod!

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.560
"Oh, come on, guys! Stop firing at me!

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.020
Oh, you are so gonna be enslaved!

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.320
D'oh, I'm gonna go tell my weird Muppet Devil on you!"

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.800
Paramedic: Gunshot wound to the head, doc!

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.320
Doctor: Oh, she's dead.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.140
Critic: Pssh... nice delivery there, guy.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.340
You literally had TWO words to say, and you couldn't even make THOSE convincing!

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.500
Doctor: Oh, she's dead.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.860
Critic: "I gotta get some ribs.  You guys want some ribs?  I gotta get some ribs."

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.580
Clown: Oh, grow up, you sniveling ninny!

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.820
Critic: But The Violator calls Sheen over to convince him

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.560
to attach a device to his heart so that if it stops beating, the plague will be released.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.800
Clown: You don't want any smartass fruitcake taking you out ahead of schedule.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.520
Wynn: That's a good idea.  I like that.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.320
Critic: "As a member of Hell, I know I can trust you.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.540
You seem like people who would have explosions on their wall, like me.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.840
That's trustworthy, right?"

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.680
Spawn goes to see his kid, who remembers him from earlier,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.440
but this scene is especially rushed so that we can make room for...

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.000
Clown: Spawnie, Spawnie, he's our man! If he can't kill 'em, no one can!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.960
S to the P to the A to the AWN!  S to the P to the A to the AWN!  S to the P to the A to the AWN!

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.740
Critic: Okay, so far...

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.080
THIS is the scariest part of the movie!

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.500
Not Hell, not weird aardvark Satan...

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.200
this friggin' part!

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.440
Try closing your eyes.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.220
It's so disturbing, you'll see it even after they're shut!

00:13:59.340 --> 00:13:59.840
Clown: S to the...

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.960
Critic: Aaaah!!!

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.300
Clown: Go Spawnie, go Spawnie....

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.820
Critic: Tell me your second-in-command doesn't do stuff like that!

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.840
Devil: Of course not!

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.020
He just wears clown makeup, makes fart jokes, and sticks out like a sore thumb.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.020
Critic: Why would that be your second-in-command?!

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.180
Devil: Because it's... cool?

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.140
Critic: Bring him in here!

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.920
Assassin: Hey! What's goin' down?

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.780
Critic: That's so obviously the one from before!

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.660
Assassin: No, I'm totally a dude! See, watch. I'll write my name in the snow.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.180
See? Ha!

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.900
Devil: Thanks, Benny.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.940
Critic: Told you he was good.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.960
Announcer: Next on TMZ!!!

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.700
Assassin: Waaaaaah!!

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.060
Critic: So, Sheen gets a Giga Pet attached to his heart

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.800
which rigs it so that his death will set off the virus.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.660
Doctor: If your vital signs flatline for any reason,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.120
the device will uplink and detonate the Heat-16 bombs.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.220
No one would dare kill you.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.260
Critic: "And if you die in an accident or by natural causes...."

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.540
This is why you get second opinions, right?!

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.240
Clown: First I got Wynn to kill Spawn and create the Heat-16 bomb,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.400
now I get Spawn to murder Wynn and release the virus!

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.000
Critic: Uh, yeah... here's an idea... why don't YOU kill him?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.440
Or... your Nintendo 64 Devil?  Or ANY of his followers?

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.360
Why does Spawn have to do it?

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.740
Nothing about ANY of this makes any sense!

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.740
The logistics of this plan are about as solid as Wile E. Coyote's anatomy,

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.580
and look about as animated!!

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.920
Meanwhile, Spawn returns to blue lightning alley

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.100
where—big surprise—he gets a little pissed off with the Clown.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.700
Spawn: You can take this army of yours and shove it!

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.140
Clown: Sounds like a country song.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.300
"You take th' army of yours 'n' shove it! You take...."

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.620
Gambol: Enough from the clown!

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.040
Clown: Aaah!

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.300
Critic: He turns into a giant pumpkin head which—

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.940
according to 90s logic—means he can't talk anymore.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.260
He can just go "BRAAAARRAAARRRARRR!!"

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.160
And of course, he also loses the personality we've seen throughout the rest of the movie.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.340
Why does that kind of thing always happen in these films?

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.500
Is it just not as intimidating if you hear him go...

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.500
"FAAAARTS!!"

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.520
"POOOORRN!!"

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.360
"CONFUSING CHEERLEADER DAAAANCE!!"

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.660
"HOW IS MARIO MY FATHER AND YET ALSO MY BROTHERRRRR?!"

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.200
He beats the crap out of Spawn,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.080
but Mr. Sir Knight is there to show him what he must do even if he's resistant.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.340
Cogliostro: Guns are useless.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.020
Spawn: You got a better idea?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.240
Critic: *chuckles*

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.380
Yup, yup.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.160
That's, uh...

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.160
pretty stupid.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.380
"I studied the ways of the Woody Woodpecker.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.740
Hoo-hoo-huh-haa-ha."

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.420
So, the knight decides to teach him how to hone his powers.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.180
Cogliostro: They're a living extension of your own instincts.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:46.980
...alright, go!

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.780
Don't get cocky.  You have a lot more to learn.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.120
Critic: Well, this is obviously the beginning of a LOT of practicing...

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.180
Spawn: I have to get to Wanda's.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.500
Cogliostro: Take care of your powers.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.000
Critic: Well... so much for the training montage!

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.080
Come on!  That's the best part of any movie, and you're just gonna skip it?

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.780
What the hell's wrong with you?!

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.080
Wh... what if other films did that?!

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.080
"Hit the bag!"

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.540
"You're good."

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.900
"Lift the rock."

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:15.560
"That's enough."

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:16.940
"Wax on..."

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.200
..."eh, the rest doesn't matter."

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.800
Even when it's explained, it doesn't make any sense.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.300
Like, what does THIS mean?:

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.640
Cogliostro: Take care of your powers.  When you drain them, you die.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.540
Critic: You didn't even explain the dying part very well, and now you're saying his powers can drain?

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.540
What kind of lame-ass Hell is this?

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.000
Devil: No, no, it's quite clear.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.420
When the powers of Hell start to run low, you just get one of these:

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.700
Ahhh... the "E" stands for "Evil," you know.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.960
Critic: Spawn goes after Wanda, but "Keep On Clownin'" is there to try and stop him.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.320
Clown: Ha ha ha!

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.560
*war whoop*

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.860
Critic: Ah, he must be using his "Hell Driving Powers" to steer the truck.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.260
Seriously, does Hell have an instruction book we can read?!

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.980
But Spawn gets dipped resulting in Violator trying to kill him, but somehow...

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.900
this happens:

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.900
Clown: See you at Wanda's!  Ha ha ha!!

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.060
Critic: "Yeah, I kinda keep forgetting how I work.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.460
Sometimes I can fly, sometimes I don't feel pain.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.380
I'm really wondering why we hired you if I could do all this stuff anyway!"

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.240
So, Sheen and Violator get to Wanda's house, and they hold the family hostage until Spawn gets there.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.000
Clown: Hello, Cyan, remember me?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.740
Booga booga booga booga! Ah-la-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-la!

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.480
Critic: Yup... somebody okayed that effect, folks!

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.880
I think this movie really underestimates the value of saying "no."

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.120
Clown: Big as life, and twice as rotten!

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.760
Ridi, Pagliaccio!

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.360
Critic: "I have other leftover effects from 'The Mask,' if you'd like to see 'em."

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.060
The Devil Maleboldia: Ha ha ha ha!

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.740
Critic: "Uh... was that meant to be left in?

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.740
Kinda looked like an editing error....

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.500
Okay!  Well, I'm just gonna keep walkin', here.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.840
Hope you fix that in post."

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.820
Wynn: Either you join Hell's army, or she dies.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.900
Spawn: Nooo!!

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.480
Critic: So it looks like Sheen kills Wanda, which of course is supposed to trick Spawn into killing him.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.660
So Spawn takes the device out of his heart and destroys it—

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.840
just... new Hell Power 361—

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.200
as it's revealed that Wanda was just a decoy played by Violator.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.360
Wynn: You set me up!

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.020
Clown: I was counting on Spawn killing you,

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.100
then you would get his soul and kickstart the apocalypse now!

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.840
Critic: Yes.  I'll rewind that to make sure you heard it correctly.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.540
Clown: ...kickstart the apocalypse now!

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.500
Critic: Can I get all of Hell to collectively "boo" with me?

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.380
I got a feeling that'd be a pretty epic "boo."

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.940
Devil: I don't see why not.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.140
Critic, Devil, &amp; all of Hell:  BOOO!!! BOOO!!!

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.040
Critic: The knight saves the real Wanda, and they follow Violator into Hell.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.960
And yeah, if you thought the effects looked lame before,

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.800
Get a load of this PS1 bullshit!

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.880
Cogliostro: Aaaaaaaaaaah!!

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.820
Critic: Triangle!  Triangle!  Push the triangle!!

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.400
D'oh, I need a character with big boobs!

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.220
This doesn't feel right if there isn't a character with square, pixelated boobs!

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.620
Violator: *screams in agony*

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.220
Critic: Oh!  So... stabbing them in the neck causes them to... explode.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.140
Jesus Christ!  Do I need to take notes?

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.320
I think Mogwais have less rules than this!

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.520
The Devil Malebolgia: If you won't lead my army,

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.980
then you must die!!

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.280
Critic: *chuckles* What is THIS guy doing?

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.020
Did one of the Spawns suddenly have a seizure?

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.460
"Whooo-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!! I'm Crazy Spawn! I'm Crazy Spawn!

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.360
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo! Ha ha ha ha ha!!

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.960
The Devil Malebolgia: You will never escape me!

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.060
Critic: "Oh, drat!  He escaped me! I'm a really dumb Devil!

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.980
I put no thought into any of this!

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.800
ANY OF THIS!!"

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.800
Oh, no, of course!  When you explode into green particles,

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.260
that just enables you to travel via fireplace and put yourself together via bookshelf!

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.000
Everybody knows this about Hell!

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.580
Clown/Violator: You'll pay for this!

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.260
Spawn: Give my regards to your boss.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.880
Tell him he's next.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.680
Critic: "I'll slow his rendering to 'Food Fight' quality.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.560
'FOOD FIGHT' QUALITY!"

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.340
"Don't worry, kids.  'Blade' will be out soon."

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.900
So, now that you know the movie WASN'T popular when it came out,

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.120
what are your thoughts on it?

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.320
Devil: I think it's "The Crow" and "Darkman's" sloppy seconds.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.360
Critic: That's more like it!

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.880
The sad thing is, there really IS good stuff in it.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.800
Leguizamo is kinda fun, the idea is pretty cool,

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.580
and the makeup in it is friggin' phenomenal!

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.840
These are the same people who did "Walking Dead" and the "Evil Dead" movies,

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.720
so we know Spawn and Violator are never gonna look as good as this,

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.000
which is why it hurts so much when it's mixed in with so many awful effects.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.280
And backwards storytelling. And clumsy editing!

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.880
This could have been a really damn cool movie,

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.180
but even when the fight scenes come up, you care so little about why they're fighting

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.780
that it becomes so hard to get invested.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.820
It's a shame some really hard work from the costumes and makeup

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.820
have to be overshadowed by the crappy laziness in other departments.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.560
In an age where we love to give sequels to anything,

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.540
you can see clearly why "Spawn" stands alone.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.140
So, you think you learned what works &amp; what doesn't work when it comes to Hell?

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.400
Devil: I think so.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.500
If I'm going to take over the world, I'm going to do it MY way.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.020
Critic: That's the spirit!

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.120
Oh! Well... that was fun!

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.400
I oughta travel to Hell more often.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.920
Devil: Citizens of Earth, I am the Devil.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.620
The uprising of Hell has begun.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.480
Critic: Ooh, yeah, I forgot he was doing that.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.240
Devil: There is no salvation.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.120
No pleading for mercy.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.320
Critic: Yeah, I probably shouldn't have given him those pointers.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.140
Devil: Prepare to face my army of destruction!

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.860
Kermit Soldier: We're going to kill you all! Yaaaaayyyy!!

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.440
Kermit Soldiers (singing): Look at us, here we are, right where we belooooong!

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.800
Critic: *sigh* Maybe it won't be as bad as I thought.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.340
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to!

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.540
Assassin: Yeah! Ha ha! I love ALF! Ha ha ha!

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.260
Woo!  Ha ha! Like, ribbit! Ah ha ha ha ha!  Oh my God!

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.020
Kermit Soldiers: Yaaaaayyyy!!

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.160
Clown: ...kickstart the apocalypse now!

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.880
Doug: Hey, everybody!  Doug Walker here, doin' the charity shoutout,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:16.940
and this week, we are doing the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, also known as "LLS."

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:23.240
This is the world's largest voluntary health organization dedicated to funding blood cancer research,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.840
education, and patient services.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.660
Their mission is to cure Leukemia, Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Disease,

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.900
and improve the quality of life of patients and their families.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.620
Since their first funding in 1954,

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.300
they've been awarded more than $680 million in research funding.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.640
If you look at their YouTube videos, you can see

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.420
that not only has this organization made a big difference in people's lives,

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.280
but the research has even helped save lives.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.140
If you go to their site or their YouTube channel, you can see all the good this charity is doing,

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.960
from fundraising, to triathlons, to so much more.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:03.660
Definitely go check it out and see if we can find a cure for these terrible diseases in our lifetime.
