00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.100
Toby is a farmer.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.160
He plants 12 rows of
carrots in a field.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.670
Each row has 6 carrots.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.040
How many carrots did Toby plant?

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.050
So let's try to
visualize this thing.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.035
So they tell us each
row has 6 carrots.

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:15.780
So let's try to visualize a row.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.310
So that's 1 carrot,
that's 2 carrots, that's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.860
3 carrots, that's 4
carrots, that's 5 carrots,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.850
and that's 6 carrots.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.450
And I can even do,
just so it looks

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.480
nice, the little leafy
part of the carrots.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.470
So we can visualize
these as carrots.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.830
So that's 1 row of carrots.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.130
They tell us each
row has 6 carrots.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.280
Now, there're 12 of these.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.050
He plants 12 rows of carrots.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.000
Let me see if I can
copy and paste this.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.310
So copy and paste.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.114
So that's 2 rows.

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:45.780
I want to make sure
I have enough space.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.110
2 rows.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.720
That's 3 rows.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.530
That's 4 rows.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.800
This is 5 rows.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.957
This is 6 rows.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:00.290
And actually, I can just copy
and paste the whole thing.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.110
This is 6 rows.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.080
I just need to double
that to get to 12 rows.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.050
So let me do that.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.840
So copy and paste.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.430
There you go.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.820
So there's 12 rows
right over here.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.900
And let's number this.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:19.120
So they tell us each row has
6 carrots-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.670
They tell us he
plants a total of 12

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:31.830
rows-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.490
How many carrots did Toby plant?

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.620
Well, you could do
this exercise and then

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.174
try to count all
of these carrots.

00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:38.590
But that seems a
little bit crazy.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.049
These are already
a lot of carrots.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.090
And especially if these
were even larger numbers,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.690
it would take you
forever to count it.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.610
Luckily for us, we have
multiplication as a tool

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.910
that we can use.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.690
So if you have 12 rows and
each of those rows have 6,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.520
this is really 12 times 6.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.200
You're going to have 12 rows.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.930
In each of those,
you have 6 carrots.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.720
So you could say you
have 6 carrots 12 times.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.460
So it's going to be 12 times 6.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.740
If you remember your
multiplication tables up to 12,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.750
you'll remember that
12 times 6 is 72.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.530
So he has 72 carrots.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.149
Even if you only remember--
well, I'll just leave it there.

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:22.690
If you remember your
multiplication--

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.148
which you should, because that
is one of the things in life

00:02:25.148 --> 00:02:30.939
that will have long-lasting
benefits-- it's 72 carrots.
