00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.120
Nothing gets movie fans talking like an action
packed trailer, which means the first public

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.260
look at an upcoming film really can mean the
difference between a runaway blockbuster and

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.260
a box office disappointment.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.689
It's not all that shocking that movie trailers
- just like movie posters - have become an

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.779
exact science, with the same colors, poses,
and tricks used by every major studio.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.689
But once you take a closer look at blockbuster
trailers, you may be surprised at just how

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:30.829
similar they really are.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.200
Here are Screen Rant's 5 Ways Movie Trailers
Are All The Same.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
The Foghorn

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.560
You have to give credit to Christopher Nolan
for working a major plot point of Inception

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.899
into the trailers, setting the action to the
booming music of "Mind Heist," a song drawing

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.760
on the booming notes used as a countdown by
the movie's dream thieves.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.960
Audiences didn't know what to make of it,
but rival studios didn't need to find out

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.039
before following suit.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.670
It wasn't just the Mind Heist blasts that
were stolen immediately, but the structure

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.730
of the sequence as a whole.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:08.310
We can hear the same sounds in the Avengers
trailer, GI Joe 2, Prometheus and Transformers

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.310
3.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.770
These days it's hard to find a trailer that
doesn't flip from black screens to random

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.950
action beats to drive the back half of a trailer
home, which means movie fans might completely

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.620
forgot there was ever a time before "the Inception
BWOOMMMMM".

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.620
The Bass Drop

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.040
The popularity of earsplitting horns, massive
explosions and out of control electro rock

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.610
in most blockbuster trailers came at a price
- with so much going on, it was hard to actually

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.490
keep up the tension or suspense.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.910
The solution wasn't brilliant, but it was
obvious: drop everything back down to silence,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.570
just to build it all the way back up.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.440
But how do you pull that off and make it seem
cool?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.140
How about an electronic, bass drop as if the
power has been cut?

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.290
It's not even funny how quickly movies raced
to steal this other trick, and use it in the

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.550
exact same way.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.491
In the Mad Max Fury Road trailer it can be
heard near the start of the trailer.

00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:02.000
The Furious 7 trailer obviously took notes
from its predecessor�s and Hunger Games

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.810
joined in with a nice touch near the middle.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.950
Whether it's leading into a slow mo tease,
a cryptic tagline, or spoiling the most epic

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.110
moment of the film, you apparently can't get
there without dropping the bass beforehand.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.670
How else will audiences know that what they're
looking at is awesome?

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.940
Ominous Voiceover

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.400
Knowing that a movie trailer will turn into
a frantically cut, deafening, then silent,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.610
then deafening roller coaster by the end,
studios know they've got to start quiet - so

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.260
the loudest moments feel even louder.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.570
What better way to open than with random lines
of dialogue without any real context, preferably

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.780
spoken over sombre strings, low rumbles, or
single, high pitched musical notes?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:44.819
We can also seenthis happening in the Avatar
trailer, Man of Steel, X-Men Days Of Future

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.350
Past, Terminator Genisys and TMNT!

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.290
The origin of this trick is easier to understand,
since single lines of dialogue really can

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.319
sum up a movie's themes, getting audiences
to use their imagination.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.819
But when every other movie decided that disembodied
lines divided by unnatural pauses were better

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.400
than actually showing the scene in question,
the move became a meaningless one.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400
THE Montage

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.440
There may have been a time when a single scene,
stunt, or just assorted settings would sell

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.270
an audience on the action in store.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.950
But at some point, movie studios decided it
was better to tease every dollar of the film's

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.300
budget in one frantic montage.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.690
Set either before or after the Foghorn sequence,
this montage can be filled with characters

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.290
screaming, shaky cam footage, close ups of
the hero and villain in combat, you name it.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.709
It's this part of the trailer that can be
the most irritating to fans trying to avoid

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.010
spoilers, since a closer look at split second
cuts can reveal entire twists and plot points

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.480
- leaving viewers to wonder why the studio
would spoil some of the best moments.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:51.390
In Star Trek Into Darkness, the foghorns symphony
starts to set the mood for what�s coming.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:04:01.450
The same happens in Iron Man 3 when the foghorns
stop and the montage starts.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:13.430
Fellow Avenger Movie Thor The Dark World followed
the trend.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.100
Selling the movie is still the top priority,
but even if the franchise is a guaranteed

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.500
blockbuster, this strict trailer formula demands
some things get spoiled months ahead of time.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.669
The Final Gag

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.759
Once the trailer has opened calmly, built
to its first crescendo, dropped the bass back

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.590
to zero, then built to a foghorn-filled montage
of assorted action, probably leading into

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.900
the movie's official title, there's still...
something missing.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.470
One last joke, one last wink to the audience,
or if nothing else, one last rhetorical question

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.610
followed by another glimpse of a completely
different action set piece.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.430
With the action typically sandwiched between
the setup and punchline, this final gag is

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.819
the studio's cherry on top.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.590
It can also be the cheesiest moment of all,
when successful franchises take a victory

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.529
lap, already seeing the piles of money coming
their way.

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:08.819
Man Of Steel treated us to and with once again
Iron Man 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.210
and Thor feeding off each other.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:25.300
Let�s not forget a couple of years before,
Batman Begins gave us and the iconic line.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.220
The same happens with horror movie trailers
starting silently, before one last jump scare

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.600
to get the squeamish screaming.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.550
But it's action comedies that get the worst
deal, since it's usually one of the movie's�

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.680
�best� jokes that gets the spoiler treatment
for one last laugh.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.559
Those are the most common tricks and conventions
when it comes to cutting a trailer, but which

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:43.580
ones have we missed?

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.129
Can you think of the best trailers to buck
the trend?
