increased prevalence and the reason for
 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.240
increased prevalence and the reason for
this is because evolutionarily humans

this is because evolutionarily humans
 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.070
this is because evolutionarily humans

that gets sent to your brain and that's
really the origin of hearing now what

come back naturally and they can start
 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.580
come back naturally and they can start
hearing again so this process is

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590
hearing again so this process is
 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.709
hearing again so this process is
hardwired and in nature but mammals just

haven't found the way to turn on this

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180
haven't found the way to turn on this

system with many technologies designed
 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.459
system with many technologies designed
to address hearing loss they really just

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469
to address hearing loss they really just
 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.929
to address hearing loss they really just
treat symptoms rather than the root

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939
treat symptoms rather than the root

cause of the disease which is the loss

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799
cause of the disease which is the loss
 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.010
cause of the disease which is the loss
of the hair cell and the way to think

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020
of the hair cell and the way to think
 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.170
of the hair cell and the way to think
about this is like if you have a TV

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180
about this is like if you have a TV
 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.749
about this is like if you have a TV
screen and you start losing the pixels

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759
screen and you start losing the pixels
 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.569
screen and you start losing the pixels
on the TV screen essentially what these

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579
on the TV screen essentially what these
 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.029
on the TV screen essentially what these
aid devices do is they make the screen

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039
aid devices do is they make the screen
 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.130
aid devices do is they make the screen
brighter but they don't fundamentally

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140
brighter but they don't fundamentally
 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.279
brighter but they don't fundamentally
replace all the pixels that are lost so

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289
replace all the pixels that are lost so
 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.080
replace all the pixels that are lost so
it does help you pick up some degree of

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090
it does help you pick up some degree of
 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.120
it does help you pick up some degree of
signal but it doesn't in any way replace

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130
signal but it doesn't in any way replace
 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.550
signal but it doesn't in any way replace
that native function of hearing which is

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560
that native function of hearing which is
 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.800
that native function of hearing which is
really our goal of regrowing hair cells

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810
really our goal of regrowing hair cells
 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.480
really our goal of regrowing hair cells
and putting those pixels back into place

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490
and putting those pixels back into place
 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.190
and putting those pixels back into place
and giving you that natural hearing at

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200
and giving you that natural hearing at
 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.139
and giving you that natural hearing at
frequency we're focused on an entirely

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149
frequency we're focused on an entirely
 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.660
frequency we're focused on an entirely
new mode of medicine and the objective

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670
new mode of medicine and the objective
 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.880
new mode of medicine and the objective
of this is to make your body's natural

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890
of this is to make your body's natural
 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.819
of this is to make your body's natural
stem or progenitor cells regenerate

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829
stem or progenitor cells regenerate
 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.809
stem or progenitor cells regenerate
damaged tissue in place and this could

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819
damaged tissue in place and this could
 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.490
damaged tissue in place and this could
really transform medicine across a whole

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500
really transform medicine across a whole
 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.270
really transform medicine across a whole
variety of diseases and organs and where

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280
variety of diseases and organs and where
 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.680
variety of diseases and organs and where
we've learned this from is actually

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690
we've learned this from is actually
 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.240
we've learned this from is actually
looking at the portions of the hue

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
looking at the portions of the hue
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.880
looking at the portions of the hue
body that are very regenerative and for

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890
body that are very regenerative and for
 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.230
body that are very regenerative and for
instance if you look at the human

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240
instance if you look at the human
 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.110
instance if you look at the human
intestine it recreates itself every five

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120
intestine it recreates itself every five
 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.750
intestine it recreates itself every five
days entirely and that'll actually last

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760
days entirely and that'll actually last
 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.520
days entirely and that'll actually last
until you well over a hundred years old

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530
until you well over a hundred years old
 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.530
until you well over a hundred years old
so your body knows how to recreate

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540
so your body knows how to recreate
 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.110
so your body knows how to recreate
certain tissues our objective is to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120
certain tissues our objective is to
 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.440
certain tissues our objective is to
identify what are the local signals that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450
identify what are the local signals that
 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.690
identify what are the local signals that
cells get from their niche environment

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700
cells get from their niche environment
 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.640
cells get from their niche environment
that tell them to start to regrow and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
that tell them to start to regrow and
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.560
that tell them to start to regrow and
start to repair tissue so we could start

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570
start to repair tissue so we could start
 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.720
start to repair tissue so we could start
turning on the dormant progenitor and

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730
turning on the dormant progenitor and
 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.010
turning on the dormant progenitor and
stem cells that exist throughout the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020
stem cells that exist throughout the
 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.010
stem cells that exist throughout the
body in order to make good medicines out

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020
body in order to make good medicines out
 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.590
body in order to make good medicines out
of that we focus on applications where

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600
of that we focus on applications where
 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.840
of that we focus on applications where
those cells can be activated very

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850
those cells can be activated very
 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.150
those cells can be activated very
selectively and very locally for a short

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160
selectively and very locally for a short
 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.670
selectively and very locally for a short
period of time that gives you tremendous

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
period of time that gives you tremendous
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.650
period of time that gives you tremendous
benefits in terms of the safety and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660
benefits in terms of the safety and
 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.900
benefits in terms of the safety and
controllability of reactivating these

controllability of reactivating these
systems and our first application is to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040
systems and our first application is to
 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.250
systems and our first application is to
do this in hearing loss where we found

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260
do this in hearing loss where we found
 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.290
do this in hearing loss where we found
that there are dormant progenitors that

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300
that there are dormant progenitors that
 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.420
that there are dormant progenitors that
exist within the cochlea that in some

cochlea to restore the hearing function
we frequently get asked about the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150
we frequently get asked about the
 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.850
we frequently get asked about the
difference between stem cells and
