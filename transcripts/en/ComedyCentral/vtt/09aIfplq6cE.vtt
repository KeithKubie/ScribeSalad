- Hey, let me ask you
a question.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.076 align:start position:0%
Wait, when the guy
was chasing you,

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.077 align:start position:0%
how did you get away?

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.145 align:start position:0%
How did you climb
a fence?

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.513 align:start size:59% position:41%
- I hopped a fence.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.249 align:end position:100%
If you ever have
to hop a fence,

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.817 size:84% position:58%
you hop that fucking fence.

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.653 align:end position:100%
Uh, it was a low--
it was, like, that high,

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.088 align:end position:100%
and I just scaled it
immediately.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.758 align:start position:0%
- Did you feel like a real
Mexican when you were--

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.793 align:start size:38% position:63%
- [laughing]

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:34.960
[laughter]

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.362 align:start size:53% position:47%
That's fucked up.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.430 align:end position:100%
Are you gonna take that,
fellas?

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.865 align:start size:53% position:47%
That's fucked up.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:43.536 align:end position:100%
I'm enlisting all the other
Mexicans here...

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.038 align:end position:100%
to kill the man
in the denim suit.

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:48.374

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.542 align:start size:22% position:78%
Lookit.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.877 align:end position:100%
He looks like an evil
ranch owner.

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:52.945 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.482 align:start position:0%
It's like a--
it's like this.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:56.816 align:start position:0%
What time is it?

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:57.884 align:start position:0%
Mm...

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.718 align:start position:0%
It's time to leave
the Chavez Ravine,

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:02.956 align:start position:0%
'cause we built
the fucking Dodgers over here.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.624 align:end position:100%
- That's totally
pulling an old woman

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.125 align:start size:50% position:50%
out of her house

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:09.128 align:end position:100%
so you can fucking
bring the Dodgers in.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.196 align:start position:0%
- Jackie Robinson!

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.196 align:start position:0%
Fucking beat it.

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:12.564 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Yeah.

00:02:12.564 --> 00:02:13.900 align:start position:0%
- Uh, here's the deal
about Al Madrigal.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.368 align:start position:0%
We've known each other
for a long time.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:16.702 align:start size:38% position:63%
- Long time.

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:19.571 align:start position:0%
- He's not someone
to fuck with.

00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:20.873 align:end position:100%
- I look like someone
to fuck with.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.408 align:start position:0%
- He sure does!
Look at him!

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.709 align:end position:100%
- A lot of people
fuck with me.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.977 align:start position:0%
- What are you,
like, 5'10", 5'9"?

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:26.712
- Yeah, I'm not 5'10".
- Yeah.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.915 align:end position:100%
- With the hunch,
about 5'8".

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.349 align:start size:31% position:69%
Uh, with--

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.817 align:start position:0%
- He's got anger issues,
you guys.

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:32.852 align:start size:22% position:78%
- I do.

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.486 align:start position:0%
- He's got serious
anger issues.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:36.522 align:start position:0%
And, uh, we all went
one time to La Joya,

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:37.723 align:start position:0%
me, him,
and Steve Rannazzisi.

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:38.992 align:start size:69% position:31%
- That's what happens.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.592 align:end position:100%
So if you're
a Comedy Store comic,

00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:42.161 align:end position:100%
you get this gig
in San Diego, and it's fun,

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.696 align:end position:100%
so you want to go
with your buddies,

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.065 align:end position:100%
so I go down with Ari
and Rannazzisi,

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.367 align:end position:100%
and we all stay
at this condo together.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.269
But then I know people there,

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.206 align:start size:75% position:25%
and, uh, we, uh, go out.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start size:44% position:56%
We go out big,

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.541 align:start size:72% position:28%
and I am a lightweight.

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.777 align:end position:100%
On top of having
anger issues,

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.446 align:start size:75% position:25%
I cannot hold my liquor.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.881 align:start size:66% position:34%
So I have two drinks,

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.950 align:end position:100%
and then we start, uh,
doing gravity bong hits.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.518 align:start position:0%
- That's when
it gets good.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:07.854 size:78% position:39%
That's when it gets good.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.555 align:start position:0%
We went to this backyard.
It's in La Joya.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:11.190 align:start position:0%
Like, rich kids,
like, rented a house.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.759
They have all these fire pits,
and we're just fucking smoking

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.028 align:start position:0%
out of shit
we didn't understand.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.696 align:start position:0%
They were like,
"Put your hand here,

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.964 align:start position:0%
put your other hand there,
and then breathe in."

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:20.366 align:end position:100%
- "What's happening?
Oh, man!

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.600
Okay."
- Yeah.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.035 align:end position:100%
- "I'm gonna go
lay down."

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:25.705 align:end position:100%
And I'm lying there
all fucked up.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.373 align:start position:0%
- You should have seen
how blasted he was.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.875 align:start size:44% position:56%
- Just wasted,

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.777 align:start size:69% position:31%
as drunk and fucked up
as I can possibly get.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:31.944 align:start position:0%
- So, like, "Al, Al."

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:33.279 align:end position:100%
- And then
what happened next?

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.247 align:start position:0%
- What happened next was--
what did happen next?

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:36.615 size:81% position:41%
How did I do this exactly?

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.083 align:end position:100%
- I don't know,
but I don't like it.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:39.418 size:78% position:39%
- Okay, I had a fun thing

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:42.721 align:start position:0%
where I would go to my friends
and I'd learn stage slaps,

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:44.156 align:start position:0%
and so, like, if you
just slap somebody,

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:46.392 align:start position:0%
just don't get this knuckle in,
just above there,

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.461 align:start position:0%
you can--you know, I'll show you
on a girl so you guys don't--

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.896 align:start position:0%
wait, I missed it.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.630 align:start position:0%
Well, all right, anyway,
it's been a while.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.165 align:end position:100%
- Trying to slap
an audience member.

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:54.933
- [laughing]
- No one else does that.

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:57.303 align:start position:0%
- You gotta treat your audience
like respect, you know.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:58.938 align:start position:0%
Slap them around
once in a while.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:02.441 align:start position:0%
Anyway, I thought it'd be funny
if I did that to Madrigal.

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.809
- Not funny.
- Yeah.

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.144 align:start position:0%
I was like, "Hey, Al.
Hey, Al."

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:06.813
And then I just fucking--
- Just--

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
- Pow!

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.248 align:start size:59% position:41%
- Open-hand smacked
the shit out of me.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:10.650 align:start position:0%
- It wasn't really
a stage slap at all.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.917 align:start position:0%
I mean, I tell you
above there...

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:12.919 align:start size:66% position:34%
- It was a real slap.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.087 align:start position:0%
- I got him here
and above.

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:17.657 align:start position:0%
It got the two parts
that hurt the most.

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:19.358 align:start position:0%
And I--boom!

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:20.660 size:78% position:39%
I was a little drunk too,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.461 size:88% position:44%
but I knew what I was doing.

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:24.597
[laughter]

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.599 align:end position:100%
- So then we went
back to the condo, and--

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.599 size:75% position:38%
- He just took it, dude.

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.001 align:start position:0%
He was like, "Ugh."

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:30.369
- That's how fucked up I was,

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:31.871 align:start size:69% position:31%
but I'll never forget.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.974 align:start size:47% position:53%
So we went back
to the condo...

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.108
[laughter]

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:39.712 align:end position:100%
And I set an alarm
for 4:30 in the morning.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:43.615
[laughter]

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:46.352 align:end position:100%
And I woke up,
and I got two pitchers

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.988 align:end position:100%
full--filled them with ice
and got ice water.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:51.890 align:end position:100%
And I walked over,
and I stood above Ari.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.995 align:end position:100%
And I just poured it all over
him and his sleeping bag

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.363 align:start size:81% position:19%
and ruined the entire bed.

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.131 align:start position:0%
- Couldn't even go back
to sleep after that.

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:01.533 align:start position:0%
Like, I woke up like,
"What the fuck!"

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:02.968 align:start size:63% position:38%
- But I remember I--

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:04.036 align:start size:72% position:28%
then I leaned over him.

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:07.640 align:start size:31% position:69%
He's like:
[babbling]

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.808 size:84% position:42%
- That's a pretty good Ari.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:11.744 align:end position:100%
- I leaned over him.
[babbling]

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.312 align:end position:100%
I leaned over him,
and I said,

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:15.181 align:start size:72% position:28%
"Never touch me again."

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.717
[laughter and applause]

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.151 align:start size:41% position:59%
Crazy person.

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.652
- I haven't. I haven't.
- No.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:21.654
- I haven't.
- You shouldn't.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:22.889 align:start size:44% position:56%
No one should.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.857
- Al Madrigal, everybody.
- Yay!

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.159
[cheers and applause]
