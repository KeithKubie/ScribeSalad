00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
One of the things you may have noticed, 
is that our app database continues

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.110
to grow forever, 
eventually filling up the device.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.640
This is a great way 
to get our app uninstalled.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.030
So let's fix this. 
Add code to delete weather data

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.173
that is more than one day old. 
Use the Calendar function

00:00:17.173 --> 00:00:18.899
to do data arithmetic.
