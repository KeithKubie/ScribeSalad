and a half years as a journalist and
it's been very interesting because I'm

01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:57.730
it's been very interesting because I'm
 

01:53:57.730 --> 01:54:00.509
it's been very interesting because I'm
seeing various things it seems to me the

01:54:00.509 --> 01:54:00.519
seeing various things it seems to me the
 

01:54:00.519 --> 01:54:03.330
seeing various things it seems to me the
serious problem that I see is that the

01:54:03.330 --> 01:54:03.340
serious problem that I see is that the

serious problem that I see is that the
Security Council could have done the

01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199
Security Council could have done the
 

01:54:05.199 --> 01:54:08.149
Security Council could have done the
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and

01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and
 

01:54:08.159 --> 01:54:10.169
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and
there were no weapons of mass

01:54:10.169 --> 01:54:10.179
there were no weapons of mass
 

01:54:10.179 --> 01:54:12.720
there were no weapons of mass
destruction all those resolutions led to

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:12.730
destruction all those resolutions led to
 

01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:14.609
destruction all those resolutions led to
the u.s. being able to get the

01:54:14.609 --> 01:54:14.619
the u.s. being able to get the
 

01:54:14.619 --> 01:54:17.609
the u.s. being able to get the
resolution to invade and then the UN

01:54:17.609 --> 01:54:17.619
resolution to invade and then the UN
 

01:54:17.619 --> 01:54:23.310
resolution to invade and then the UN
became the supported being the u.s.

01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320
became the supported being the u.s.
 

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:26.310
became the supported being the u.s.
being the occupier and so that's I think

01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320
being the occupier and so that's I think
 

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:29.759
being the occupier and so that's I think
the legitimacy of the UN is to have this

01:54:29.759 --> 01:54:29.769
the legitimacy of the UN is to have this
 

01:54:29.769 --> 01:54:32.399
the legitimacy of the UN is to have this
kind of activity going on and it just

01:54:32.399 --> 01:54:32.409
kind of activity going on and it just
 

01:54:32.409 --> 01:54:35.359
kind of activity going on and it just
seems then there's no lessons from that

01:54:35.359 --> 01:54:35.369
seems then there's no lessons from that
 

01:54:35.369 --> 01:54:38.069
seems then there's no lessons from that
instead the same thing appears to be

or is is it going to lead to the ability
to build a bomb in a country like Iran

01:54:50.549 --> 01:54:50.559
to build a bomb in a country like Iran
 

01:54:50.559 --> 01:54:53.609
