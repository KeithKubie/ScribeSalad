00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:22.720
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.300
JACK OLSEN: There's
always this association

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.510
between the unicycle
and the circus.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.350
And I couldn't be farther
from being a performer.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.936
I like to pursuit it for sport.

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:35.560
We started trail riding because
once you get the hang of riding

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.757
on the road it gets monotonous.

00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:40.215
You get on the trail and it's
just so much more satisfying.

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:45.530
ROSS BRADLEY: We're just a bunch
of guys that really enjoyed

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.740
mountain it's a very,
very inefficient way

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.300
to get around the woods.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.660
JACK OLSEN: You're
working for every inch.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.090
You have to continuously
be aware of every bump

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.780
so that you can account for it.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.630
After a while you get
a sense of what rocks

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.630
you can actually ride over.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.790
You start pushing that
further and further.

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:15.030
ROSS BRADLEY: So Bryce
is a big strong guy

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.910
and rides big strong ways.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.300
It's a big chunk of meat
running down the road.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.750
Jack is amazingly fast,
flies all over the place.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.290
JACK OLSEN: I think
I like to push myself

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.790
by committing to speed.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.110
So it can go poorly
very quickly.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.957
But more often than
not it works out.

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:37.540
ROSS BRADLEY: Monty, he actually
hasn't been riding that long.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.873
We called him Superman for a
while because of the way he

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:43.650
would fall, which was all out.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.800
CHAD RAMBERG: I was close
to being on my face.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.883
ROSS BRADLEY: And then me.

00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:49.320
I like going random
ways off-road.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.755
I love going down steep things.

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:52.588
I like going through
stuff that doesn't look

00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:53.875
like you can ride through it.

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.375
BRYCE JACOBSON: It's like the
sound of 10,000 knuckles being

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:59.008
cracked at the same time.

00:01:59.008 --> 00:01:59.850
You've got it, Russ.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.752
You've got it buddy.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.340
ROSS BRADLEY: This
is a unicycle.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.509
It's special because
of the size of the tire

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.000
and the amount of air
that can be put into that.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.560
Fat tire is nice.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.500
It goes over rocks,
sticks, mud, goo, sand.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.230
The handle is very important.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.010
It helps to anchor your
feet into the petals.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.760
It's got brakes.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.470
These are hydraulic.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.640
So unicycles do not coast.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.200
When you stop pedaling
the wheel stops.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.489
BRYCE JACOBSON: OK, so
mounting a mountain unicycle

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.030
you want to make sure that your
pedals are in the right spot.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.410
So you want to give
yourself a pedal

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.120
that when you push down on
it pushes the unicycle back

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.180
underneath you.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.105
JACK OLSEN: When
I was in college

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:51.629
a group of us all
kind of learned

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.670
how to unicycle together.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.920
We did get to the point where
we were riding all over campus.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.470
We'd ride to class.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.666
We got a lot of attention, maybe
not what we were looking for.

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:02.540
ROSS BRADLEY: I could
ride a unicycle since I

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.190
was 12, 40 years from today.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.980
I was ridiculed as a kid.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.401
Because kids find different
things to pick on other kids

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:10.900
about.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.860
And I didn't care.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.494
It was my thing.

00:03:13.494 --> 00:03:14.660
I go to work on my unicycle.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.230
I work at a federal facility.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.840
And I park it right out front.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.620
Everybody knows who I am.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.790
CHAD RAMBERG: I
learned later in life.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.012
The hardest thing is
10 hours of failure,

00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:29.560
of falling on your face
literally for 10 hours.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.700
It's a challenge.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.120
ROSS BRADLEY: On a unicycle
at the very last minute

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.370
you might get turned
the wrong direction,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.070
or worse yet your pedal
is not in the right spot.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.270
All of those things
have to come together.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.210
And when they do it's great.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.435
And when they don't you fall.

00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:46.434
If you're not falling
you're not doing it right.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:04:14.689
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.480
CHAD RAMBERG: It's a
certain type of person

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.829
that tends to ride
a unicycle You've

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.480
got to be not afraid to look
stupid and not worry about what

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.001
people think of you.

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:26.500
The group that I ride with we
do it just because we love it.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.349
It's the thrill and excitement
of doing something that you

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:30.390
didn't know you could do.

00:04:32.347 --> 00:04:34.430
BRYCE JACOBSON: But you
know, once you kind of get

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.130
the hang of it it's really
not a whole lot harder

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.921
than riding a bike.

00:04:44.677 --> 00:04:46.260
NARRATOR: All Points
Project is a part

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.910

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.620
features short documentaries
from around the globe.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.587
Be sure to watch our video on
Thailand's bicycle revolution.

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:55.170
SUBJECT: I was racing
through traffic.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.850
This car was right
in front of me.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.730
It had a metal cage around it.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.669
My head went right onto
the cage, like bonk.

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.210
NARRATOR: New episodes
