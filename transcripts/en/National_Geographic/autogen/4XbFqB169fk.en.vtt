it's completely reasonable to think that

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
it's completely reasonable to think that
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.020
it's completely reasonable to think that
there's life out there there's just so

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030
there's life out there there's just so
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.820
there's life out there there's just so
many possibilities billions of stars and

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
many possibilities billions of stars and
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.740
many possibilities billions of stars and
billions of galaxies and other that it

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
billions of galaxies and other that it
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.790
billions of galaxies and other that it
uh surely there's life after finding

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
uh surely there's life after finding
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.880
uh surely there's life after finding
life even primitive microbial life would

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
life even primitive microbial life would
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.130
life even primitive microbial life would
change our place in the universe by

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
change our place in the universe by
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.180
change our place in the universe by
telling us that we're not alone

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190
telling us that we're not alone
 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.070
telling us that we're not alone
and it would most likely be an

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080
and it would most likely be an
 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.140
and it would most likely be an
indication that we're getting closer to

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150
indication that we're getting closer to
 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.950
indication that we're getting closer to
finding an intelligent civilization it

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960
finding an intelligent civilization it
 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.960
finding an intelligent civilization it
would be really fun if we could find an

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970
would be really fun if we could find an
 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.580
would be really fun if we could find an
alien that you know could send me an

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590
alien that you know could send me an
 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.560
alien that you know could send me an
email or Twitter or whatever all day

long but the profound question is is

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300
long but the profound question is is
 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.080
long but the profound question is is
life or non-life once we have the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090
life or non-life once we have the
 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.840
life or non-life once we have the
microbial we have the potential for

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850
microbial we have the potential for
 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.880
microbial we have the potential for
intelligence but if we don't have a

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890
intelligence but if we don't have a
 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.590
intelligence but if we don't have a
life-form at all we don't have the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600
life-form at all we don't have the
 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.850
life-form at all we don't have the
potential for anything but what if we do

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860
potential for anything but what if we do
 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.660
potential for anything but what if we do
find complex life out there what would

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670
find complex life out there what would
 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.930
find complex life out there what would
it look like would it be anything like

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940
it look like would it be anything like
 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.590
it look like would it be anything like
what we see in Hollywood movies it is

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600
what we see in Hollywood movies it is
 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.020
what we see in Hollywood movies it is
humorous that Hollywood depicts aliens

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030
humorous that Hollywood depicts aliens
 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.740
humorous that Hollywood depicts aliens
more or less the same way there's a

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750
more or less the same way there's a
 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.750
more or less the same way there's a
Klingon here and a Romulan there and

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760
Klingon here and a Romulan there and
 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.120
Klingon here and a Romulan there and
there's slanty eyes and you know big old

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130
there's slanty eyes and you know big old
 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.149
there's slanty eyes and you know big old
brains and so on any sort of alien that

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159
brains and so on any sort of alien that
 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.760
brains and so on any sort of alien that
resembles a human is ludicrous two eyes

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770
resembles a human is ludicrous two eyes
 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.370

a nose and a mouth there's no reason

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380
a nose and a mouth there's no reason
 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.930
a nose and a mouth there's no reason
that an alien would have to be adapted

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940
that an alien would have to be adapted
 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.800
that an alien would have to be adapted
this way over hundreds of millions of

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810
this way over hundreds of millions of
 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.200
this way over hundreds of millions of
years all the creatures of our planet

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210
years all the creatures of our planet
 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.620
years all the creatures of our planet
have adapted to their environment so the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630
have adapted to their environment so the
 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.110
have adapted to their environment so the
chemistry's are similar

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120
 
 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.880
 
which means your genetic makeup isn't

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890
which means your genetic makeup isn't
 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.950
which means your genetic makeup isn't
all that different from an earthworm or

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960
all that different from an earthworm or
 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.330
all that different from an earthworm or
even your pet basically all animals are

even your pet basically all animals are
 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.600
even your pet basically all animals are
worms for worms we got a head we got a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610
worms for worms we got a head we got a
 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.730
worms for worms we got a head we got a
tail we're long and skinny and that's

tail we're long and skinny and that's
 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.470
tail we're long and skinny and that's
how we move forward dinosaurs or worms

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480
how we move forward dinosaurs or worms

what people don't understand is that

under conditions that are very different
 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.940
under conditions that are very different
from those here on the earth if you

from those here on the earth if you

lived on a planet with twice the gravity

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200
lived on a planet with twice the gravity
 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.830
lived on a planet with twice the gravity
of Earth there'd be a lot more pull on

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840
of Earth there'd be a lot more pull on
 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.110
of Earth there'd be a lot more pull on
your body and you'd come crashing down

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120
your body and you'd come crashing down
 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.360

twice as hard if you fell
