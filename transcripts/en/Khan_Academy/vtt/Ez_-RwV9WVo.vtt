00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.630
Let's say I have the point
3 comma negative 4.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.740
So that would be 1, 2,
3, and then down 4.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.530
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.910
So that's 3 comma negative 4.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.310
And I also had the
point 6 comma 1.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.050
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 comma 1.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.510
So just like that.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.560
6 comma 1.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.750
In the last video, we figured
out that we could just use the

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.530
Pythagorean theorem if we
wanted to figure out the

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.270
distance between these
two points.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.000
We just drew a triangle there
and realized that this was the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.870
hypotenuse.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.570
In this video, we're going to
try to figure out what is the

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.980
coordinate of the point that
is exactly halfway between

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.170
this point and that point?

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.510
So this right here is kind of
the distance, the line that

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.000
connects them.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Now what is the coordinate of
the point that is exactly

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.520
halfway in between the two?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910
What is this coordinate
right here?

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.830
It's something comma
something.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.280
And to do that-- let me draw
it really big here.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.590
Because I think you're going to
find out that it's actually

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.255
pretty straightforward.

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:08.050
At first it seems like a
really tough problem.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.620
Gee, let me use the distance
formula with some variables.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.490
But you're going to see, it's
actually one of the simplest

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.210
things you'll learn in
algebra and geometry.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.430
So let's say that this is
my triangle right there.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830
This right here is the
point 6 comma 1.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.240
This down here is the point
3 comma negative 4.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.310
And we're looking for the point
that is smack dab in

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.840
between those two points.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.090
What are its coordinates?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.110
It seems very hard at first. But
it's easy when you think

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.360
about it in terms of just the
x and the y coordinates.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.700
What's this guy's x-coordinate
going to be?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.000
This line out here represents
x is equal to 6.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.530
This over here-- let me do it
in a little darker color--

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.460
this over here represents
x is equal to 6.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.120
This over here represents
x is equal to 3.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.690
What will this guy's
x-coordinate be?

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.530
Well, his x-coordinate is
going to be smack dab in

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.660
between the two x-coordinates.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.980
This is x is equal to 3, this
is x is equal to 6.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.760
He's going to be right
in between.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.830
This distance is going to be
equal to that distance.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.020
His x-coordinate is going
to be right in between

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.770
the 3 and the 6.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.800
So what do we call the number
that's right in between

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.710
the 3 and the 6?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.650
Well we could call that the
midpoint, or we could call it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.540
the mean, or the average,
or however you want

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.180
to talk about it.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.980
We just want to know, what's
the average of 3 and 6?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.730
So to figure out this point,
the point halfway between 3

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.700
and 6, you literally just figure
out, 3 plus 6 over 2.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.280
Which is equal to 4.5.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.000
So this x-coordinate
is going to be 4.5.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.050
Let me draw that
on this graph.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.330
1, 2, 3, 4.5.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.050
And you see, it's smack
dab in between.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.610
That's its x-coordinate.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.440
Now, by the exact same logic,
this guy's y-coordinate is

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.740
going to be smack dab between y
is equal to negative 4 and y

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.650
is equal to 1.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.520
So it's going to be right
in between those.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.450
So this is the x right there.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.810
The y-coordinate is going to be
right in between y is equal

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.470
to negative 4 and
y is equal to 1.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.040
So you just take the average.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.390
1 plus negative 4 over 2.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.040
That's equal to negative 3
over 2 or you could say

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.940
negative 1.5.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.630
So you go down 1.5.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.450
It is literally right there.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.200
So just like that.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.260
You literally take the average
of the x's, take the average

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.370
of the y's, or maybe I should
say the mean to be a little

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.150
bit more specific.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.840
A mean of only two points.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.320
And you will get the midpoint
of those two points.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.840
The point that's equidistant
from both of them.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.380
It's the midpoint of the line
that connects them.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.150
So the coordinates are 4.5
comma negative 1.5.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.200
Let's do a couple
more of these.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.560
These, actually, you're going
to find are very, very

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.970
straightforward.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.690
But just to visualize
it, let me graph it.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.660
Let's say I have the point
4, negative 5.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.270
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.100
And then go down 5.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.420
So that's 4, negative 5.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.960
And I have the point
8 comma 2.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.100
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 comma 2.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.410
8 comma 2.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.149
So what is the coordinate
of the midpoint

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.899
of these two points?

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.600
The point that is smack
dab in between them?

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.970
Well, we just average the
x's, average the y's.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.020
So the midpoint is going to be--
the x values are 8 and 4.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.260
It's going to be 8
plus 4 over 2.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.660
And the y value is going to be--
well, we have a 2 and a

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.510
negative 5.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.220
So you get 2 plus negative
5 over 2.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.460
And what is this equal to?

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.750
This is 12 over 2, which is 6
comma 2 minus 5 is negative 3.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.280
Negative 3 over 2
is negative 1.5.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.610
So that right there
is the midpoint.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.040
You literally just average the
x's and average the y's, or

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.660
find their means.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.820
So let's graph it,
just to make sure

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.220
it looks like midpoint.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.170
6, negative 5.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.520
Negative 1.5.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.520
Negative 1, negative 1.5.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.100
Yep, looks pretty good.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.020
It looks like it's equidistant
from this point and

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.550
that point up there.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.090
Now that's all you
have to remember.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.485
Average the x, or take the mean
of the x, or find the x

00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:22.840
that's right in between
the two.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.800
Average the y's.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.050
You've got the midpoint.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.160
What I'm going to show you now
is what's in many textbooks.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.530
They'll write, oh, if I have
the point x1 y1, and then I

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.250
have the point-- actually, I'll
just stick it in yellow.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.950
It's kind of painful to switch
colors all the time-- and then

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.390
I have the point x2 y2, many
books will give you something

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.900
called the midpoint formula.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.820
Which once again, I think is
kind of silly to memorize.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.460
Just remember, you
just average.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.780
Find the x in between, find
the y in between.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.675
So midpoint formula.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.880
What they'll really say is the
midpoint-- so maybe we'll say

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.410
the midpoint x-- or maybe
I'll call it this way.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.560
I'm just making up notation.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.080
The x midpoint and the y
midpoint is going to be equal

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.170
to-- and they'll give you this
formula. x1 plus x2 over 2,

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.580
and then y1 plus y2 over 2.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.070
And it looks like something
you have to memorize.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.140
But all you have to
say is, look.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.090
That's just the average,
or the mean,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.340
of these two numbers.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.050
I'm adding the two together,
dividing by two, adding these

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.730
two together, dividing by two.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.900
And then I get the midpoint.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.770
That's all the midpoint
formula is.
