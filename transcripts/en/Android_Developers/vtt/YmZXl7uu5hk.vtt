&gt;&gt; Ankur Kotwal: Hi everyone and welcome to
another APEC Android Developer Office Hours

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.100
session.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.840
Thanks for joining us today.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.320
We have Ryosuke here from Tokyo Japan.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.700
&gt;&gt;Ryosuke Matsuuchi: Hello.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.550
&gt;&gt; Ankur Kotwal: Hi Ryosuke.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.350
And Tony Chang has just joined us as well
from Hong Kong.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.710
&gt;&gt;Tony Chang: Hi Guys.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.570
&gt;&gt; Ankur Kotwal: And I'm Ankur Kotwal and
I'm joining in from Sydney Australia.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.900
So we actually don't have a lot of questions
today, so hopefully that means our global

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.800
teams have been doing a good job of answering
questions.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.840
Or that people are still just really enjoying
themselves after IO.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.440
Anyways, let's get started with the questions
that we have.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.399
We have the Moderator thread.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.010
So the first question is.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.200
I'll read it out word for word and then I'll
interpret it.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.110
It says "How to make a Google+ or YouTube
style slide menu?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.149
It is not included in the Android design.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.400
But I think it is good.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.150
Is it included in the API?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.630
If not, why not?"

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.930
So my understanding of this question is it's
referring to the slide out menu that you get

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.630
on the left hand side now in the Google+ and
the YouTube apps.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.810
And basically it's a new kind of design style
that we see is getting popular.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.150
And we're obviously starting to adopt it in
our official apps.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.079
Right now, there is nothing available for
developers to build that themselves.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.980
Having said that, we're actually planning
to update the Android design guide to show

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.079
you how to build it yourself.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.310
We'll probably be providing some sample code
to go with it and then that way it will be

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.840
available to you.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.310
So stay tuned.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.130
It is coming.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.070
Alright, next question is on Android Beam.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.070
Tony.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.509
&gt;&gt;Tony: Yeah, so let me take this one.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.690
So the question was "We are excited when knowing
that Android Beam is having an upgrade during

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.950
the IO 2012.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.290
Any reason on why Android Beam tech NFC plus
Bluetooth, not NFC plus wifi direct like SB.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.760
To control device player than connect it by
controlling the Nexus Q.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.620
Well, first of all, I don't think like, we
are in favor of one technology over another.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.050
But that said, there is really some advantage
using Bluetooth.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.530
So let me highlight them.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.400
So the first one is in terms of power consumption.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.880
Bluetooth is really doing very well.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.580
Sometimes even better than wifi.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:57.160
Another reason of choosing Bluetooth is when
you connect with to wifi direct, you have

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.070
to disconnect from the wifi network.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.040
So that's how you still can connect to the
internet using radio connection, like using

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.560
your 3G or 4G radio.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.940
But there is some kind of user, not smooth
user experience there.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:26.319
And finally wifi direct is available in, I
believe, in ICS and so in terms of a compatibility,

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.340
Bluetooth NFC is probably much more compatible
in all the Android devices.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.680
Hope that answered your question.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.680
&gt;&gt;Ankur: Thanks Tony.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.690
So the next question is one about Project
Butter.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.480
So, just a quick introduction, Project Butter
is one of the big undertakings that we had

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.170
in Jelly Bean.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:59.440
And it was really all about making the user
interface "buttery smooth" and highly responsive.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.930
So Ryosuke, why don't you handle, take this
one.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.090
&gt;&gt; Ryosuke: Sure.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.180
Yeah, OK the question was, OK, I am reading
this.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.849
"We have seen Project Butter in action at
the IO.

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.720
We would like to know if there is anything
we should do to make our applications better

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.389
by syncing our custom fields with re-sync.

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:30.100
Is there anything that we need to do explicitly
to enable this feature?"

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.230
This was a question from Bangalore India.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.210
I think there would be several things I would
like to clarify.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:49.190
First of all, this Project Butter is something
that you can divinate without changing your

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.190
code.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:58.160
So it means that without doing anything on
Jelly Bean and above your application should

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.030
be already behaving much smoother than before.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:11.740
And having said that, there are several APIs
that you can take out, in order to take further

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.740
advantage of this re-sync.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:25.900
And I think that the most typical operation
that you would like to do, whenever re-sync

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.320
happens, probably you would like to simply
invalidate your field.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.650
Actually, that this Android animation framework
already has a method for that.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.610
And it is called view.postinvalidate on anime
shop.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:53.650
When you say that, as soon as the display
print starts, you have, you get invalidated.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.690
And if

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.729
[background voice]

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:56.729
Sorry?

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.839
&gt;&gt;Ankur: No, my mistake, sorry.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:59.870
&gt;&gt; Ryosuke: Oh.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.870
OK.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.870
Yeah.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.870
So.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.240
This, so there are several other methods on
view, like post on animation, or post on animation

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.280
[diday].

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:21.610
Um, aside from post Invalidate on animation,
you can use these new methods.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.130
These cross [inaudible] with other Android
animation framework.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:31.190
And they are automatically synchronized with
the re-sync on Jelly Bean.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.560
And these are simple APIs to use.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.210
And also if you are rendering in some different
sled.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:50.110
Outside of your own normal sled, possibly
you may be doing some custom rendering using

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.449
open DL or something.

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.990
In those cases you may not be actually using
the Android animation framework.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:08.039
Still, you can divinate this Jelly Bean project
Butter by using our new API called Choreographer.

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:14.740
And this is a totally new API that we introduced
starting API developer 16.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:24.169
And you can basically say that the, this Choreographer
API is you can use when you would like to

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:31.250
put your callback synchronized with this basic
timing.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:41.099
So you can do whatever you want at the beginning
of this display REM cycle, using this Choreograph

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:42.099
mechanics.

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:49.321
And so this does not depend on Android animation
frameworks, so this is doable even if you

00:07:49.321 --> 00:07:55.810
are doing anything you would like without
standard view link mechanism.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.610
That was one explanation I was able to offer
for this question.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.350
I hope this answers your question.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.470
Thank you.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.600
&gt;&gt;Ankur: Alright.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.010
Well it looks like we have someone that's
joined us on the Hangout.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.169
&gt;&gt; Ryosuke: OK.

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:11.330
&gt;&gt;Ankur: Pavan.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.490
Hi Pavan.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.650
&gt;&gt;Pavan: Yeah.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:14.650
Pavan.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.650
Yeah.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.650
Hi.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.650
&gt;&gt;Ankur: Nice to meet you.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.590
So do you have any questions for us?

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.270
&gt;&gt;Pavan: No, actually I was looking for what
kind of group it is and what are you discussing,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.419
guys, so is there anything I can chip in?

00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:28.960
&gt;&gt;Ankur: I'm sorry, it's a little bit hard
to hear you Pavan.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.161
Could you repeat what you said?

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:35.789
&gt;&gt;Pavan: I said I was looking, I was talking
and I was texting, maybe I can chip in what

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.160
you guys are discussing about.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.599
&gt;&gt;Ankur: Well you've come in at an interesting
time because we've just sort of run out of

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:42.869
questions to answer.

00:08:42.869 --> 00:08:44.050
&gt;&gt; Ryosuke: OK.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.920
&gt;&gt;Ankur: So, you probably wanna catch the
YouTube recording afterwards and catch up

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.250
on the questions that we already answered.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:57.660
So, um, yeah, if you have any of your own
questions at the moment, this is a good time

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.660
to ask.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.730
If there's anyone, I can see that we've got
a number of viewers on the stream.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:10.190
So if you have any questions that you'd like
us to, please post them to the thread.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.330
We are we're ready and waiting to answer.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:20.130
So Pavan while we have you here have you had
a chance to look at the YouTube videos from

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.130
Google IO?

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.600
&gt;&gt;Pavan: No, not yet.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.720
&gt;&gt;Ankur: Not yet?

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720
OK.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.040
Have you done any Android development yourself?

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040
&gt;&gt;Pavan: Yeah.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.990
Basically we have, we have, uh, very few apps.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:36.970
One basically that I particularly liked and,
basically, the app, publishing apps.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:37.970
&gt;&gt;Ankur: OK.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.330
Publishing apps.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.750
Already on the market?

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.280
On play?

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.630
Sorry, I missed that.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.980
&gt;&gt;Pavan: The two are developed privately.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.230
&gt;&gt;Ankur: Oh, they're private builds.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.230
OK.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.230
Fair enough.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:00.750
Well it looks like people are fairly quiet
today.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.970
We've got 50 viewers at the moment and they
look shy so.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:10.690
&gt;&gt;Tony: Yeah, I guess we should give them
some time to go over all the YouTube videos.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:16.360
We have a lot of new content after Google
IO, so let's give them some time to digest

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.510
and probably next week we will have more questions.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.220
&gt;&gt;Ankur: Yeah, I hope so.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:30.350
So we'll be doing this weekly just like our
colleagues in the US as well as in the [miyat]

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.610
so our European colleagues there.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.370
So we'll post up a moderator link next week.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:42.310
And if there isn't anything else right now,
I guess we'll see you next time.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.310
Alright?

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.730
&gt;&gt; Ryosuke: Sounds good.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.940
&gt;&gt;Ankur: Alright.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.269
Thanks Pavan for joining us.

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:48.420
Thanks Tony and thanks Ryosuke.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.420
&gt;&gt;Ryosuke: OK.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.420
&gt;&gt;Tony: Thank you.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.420
Bye.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.420
&gt;&gt;Ankur: See you everyone.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:52.425
&gt;&gt;Ryosuke: Thank you very much.
