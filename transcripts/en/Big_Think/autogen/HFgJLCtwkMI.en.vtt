that instead of doing just the easy the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
that instead of doing just the easy the

simple thing let's actually look at

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
simple thing let's actually look at
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.170
simple thing let's actually look at
where you get the most bang for the buck

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
where you get the most bang for the buck
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.080
where you get the most bang for the buck
and do the thing that will do the most

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
and do the thing that will do the most
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.110
and do the thing that will do the most
good in the long run

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120
 
 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.900
 
if co2 is the problem it sounds like an

obvious thing to cut the carbon

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410
obvious thing to cut the carbon
 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.930
obvious thing to cut the carbon
emissions but the problem is we don't

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940
emissions but the problem is we don't
 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.750

also means that we don't just conserve

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119
also means that we don't just conserve

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.700
emissions to the right level economists
have been looking in that and the answer

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710
have been looking in that and the answer
 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.230
have been looking in that and the answer
is the right level is somewhere between

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240
is the right level is somewhere between
 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.050
is the right level is somewhere between

no but it is going to cost us and so we

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950
no but it is going to cost us and so we
 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.640
no but it is going to cost us and so we
got to be careful if we cut back too

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650
got to be careful if we cut back too
 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.040
