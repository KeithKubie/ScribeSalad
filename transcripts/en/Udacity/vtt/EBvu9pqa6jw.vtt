00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270
So how about we try modifying the greedy vertex cover algorithm.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.840
Remember, the greedy approximation algorithm is that while not edges are covered,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.580
we choose a vertex has the most uncovered edges and we put that vertex into the vertex cover.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.910
So we're going to modify this by also picking up random edge each time we go through this loop

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.100
and picking one of that edges endpoints at random and adding that endpoint to the vertex cover.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.350
Now, what I'd like to know is does this algorithm perform as well as a

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.030
factor 2 approximation algorithm or maybe does it perform even better.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.820
Now, I'd like you to do is go to the forums and provide a proof that does,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.300
or if it doesn't, then provide a counter example--provide a graph that it doesn't perform as well

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.380
as the factor 2 approximation algorithm on.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.180
So it could be either one, and I'd really like all of you to discuss this and see what it proves

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.280
or counter examples you come up with.

00:00:51.280 --> 99:59:59.000
So when you've done that, go ahead and post to the forums and then check this box.
