Speaker 1:          00:00          You talk about playing the game, quote unquote, to win, but what about people that play the game to win for themselves and how do I defeat there? That's a good, good question. And it hit me. Yeah, when I saw that question. Ooh, that's a good point. And that's a good, there's a very important distinction there because I'm always saying play the game. Yeah. Or, Hey, you can't play the game. You got up, you got to build the relationships with the boss. You've got to learn what they like. And you kind of told the party line, you kind of do the little things. You got to support the, the corporate headquarters or the boss or the man, right? Or whatever entity is up in that ivory tower. I want you to play the game, get them on your side. And the reason I saved to do those things is that so you can get more controls so that people ask your opinion so that you get listened to so that perhaps you get promoted, which is good. But the reason you're doing all those things, the reason that you're playing the game is to help your team accomplish the mission. That's what you are trying to do is to help your team accomplish the mission.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Now the, the other side of that is what this question is about. People that are playing the game for personal gain, they, they play the game so that they can get listened to so they can drive their personal agenda so they so vague can get promoted and they want to get promoted so that they can abuse their power. And maybe that abuse of power is just, is just working less. Maybe it's making other people do the crap jobs, whatever the, whatever the case may be. But they've got an agenda and they're going to try and get promoted so they can take care of themselves. And that is not why I tell you to play the game. And that's not why I played the game. And I definitely played the game and I played to win, but I played because I wanted my my squad or my platoon or my task unit or my training command to be able to better accomplish our mission.

Speaker 1:          02:15          That's why I played the game. Now there is a secondary benefit of playing the game and that is that you could possibly get promoted earlier. You could get praise from the boss that looks good on your record and and all those things can happen when you're playing the game. But that's just like collateral sort of fringe benefits. But that's not why you're playing the game. You play the game to help the team win and when the team wins, you win, which also makes the team win again. So it's like a positive cycle because you start developing a good reputation. Now you get more leeway from the Boston and more leeway you get from the boss. The more you have the ability to make maneuvers on the battlefield, the more you can maneuver on the battlefield, the more offensive you can be, the more offensive you can be, the more you win, and then you get more ability to move more because your boss has given you even more room to maneuver. So it's a, it's a cycle. It's a good positive cycle.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Now when you have someone that's on the team that's playing the game for themselves, first of all, no one likes that person, right? Everyone can see that person. Yeah. No one likes them and there's, believe me, the military, the military has unbelievable people that play the game for the best possible reasons to help their platoon and help the mission and help us succeed. There's also plenty of people in the military and in every, every different line vinyl work. There's plenty of people that play the game because they want to. They want them. They were looking out for themselves. Yeah. Looking out for number one right? Isn't that the expression they're looking out for? Number one, there's plenty of people and I dealt with people like that all that time and what did I do? I used it to my advantage and I'll tell you what I would get in their head and what I would do is I would make them think that the best way for them to win for themselves personally was for the team to win.

Speaker 1:          04:10          That I would get that into their head because they'll tell a lot of times they miss that point. They're looking out for themselves, they're not worried about the team. And I would get them thinking that they're going to look the best if the team wins. Hey, if you really want to look good, the best way you can get promoted as if we look good. You know, if the team does great, if you get us the gear, we want the equipment, we want the training that we need, that's the best way you're going to look awesome cause we're going to succeed more and that's going to make you look good. And I'm, of course I'm going to be more tactful than, I'm not saying it like that, but I'm saying it right. Right. Get get those word and getting them to get the messaging is there. You want me to be saying things like, hey, you know, our boss doesn't like our boss doesn't like leaders that complain. Right. [inaudible] you can tell the boss he doesn't like complainer's. You know what I mean? Little things like that, right? Yeah. Hey, the boss, the boss likes to hear the truth about stuff he wants to know. You know what I mean? Little things like that and you know, here's the thing, that person, that person might get the promotion.

Speaker 2:          05:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:08          Because what you've done is you've helped them act correctly actually, and there's a chance, a decent chance, a good chance even that they carry that forward. They realize that, hey, the best way to play the game is to help the team. And the best way to look good is to help. That is to make the team good and succeed at the mission.

Speaker 2:          05:25          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          05:28          And it's really one of the classic cases. Then we'll know we'll get into ownership a little bit, but if something goes wrong, right, the person that's looking out for themselves blames everyone else. And so that's a challenge, right? Because once you start blaming, once that ball starts blaming everyone, then the whole team starts blaming each other. So how do you fix that? Well, it's, we've talked about this a million times. You, you step up and say, hey, you don't bosses my fault and lost cause that's right. It's your fault. And there's a, there's a good chance that they recognize how positive that is. And it may take a while and it may never happen because some people are just savages, right? Some people are just complete. They only care about themselves. They only care about the next promotion and getting the next award and getting the next bit of recognition. There's people like that, there's, they're horrible, they're horrible, they exist. But they're pretty small. Most people, if they see, hey this, this is working for this guy, it can work for me too. And that starts to spread. And the other thing that happens I think is if someone's obese, just a flagrant self promoter,

Speaker 1:          06:48          that you might get them one promotion because you were there to kind of make them look good, but the next time around they're going to get seen. They're going to get found out, they're gonna. People are gonna realize what kind of person they are and that's, that's where it catches up with them. So you keep playing the game, you keep, you keep working hard, don't worry about them and actually do your best to help them out. The person that's like self promoting, do your best to help them out. They're the boss. Make them look good. I always want to make my boss look good. Yup. It's going to help you in the long run. It hurts sometimes it's hard to do. Sometimes our ego gets in the way. Sometimes God put that ego in check because what's more important? Because if you're my boss Echo and you're doing this just to make yourself look good, if I then undermine you will.

Speaker 1:          07:38          And now we don't accomplish the mission as well. I'm actually a bad person because I didn't do my best to accomplish the mission. Right. We didn't look good. Yeah. I'm not worried about how we look, but we failed in our mission. Well, we didn't do our mission to the best of our ability. So No, I'm not going to let that happen. You want to look great. Cool. I want to make you look great because I want us to look great doing our mission because that's what's important to me. And if so some of the collateral damage of that is that you look great even though you're a jerk and I get you promoted, that's okay because eventually you're going to get found out or you're going to learn to be a better person and to support the team and that's how you got promoted and you're gonna realize that and you'll become a good leader.

Speaker 3:          08:15          Yeah. Yeah, I agree with that one.

Speaker 1:          08:21          Like I always have where people can see that too. You know, they can see like if your boss is like a self promoter or whatever and you have it in your head. I understand. I understand this cause I did it in a situation where I'm like, shoot, I kind of feel inside, like I don't want to like go make an effort to make them look good kind of thing. Cause it's like he doesn't deserve it and a thing and what? Like what? I'm going to make them look good and now everyone's going to think that he looks good kind of thing. But then when you really think about it another not, they see that. Yeah, you're right. And the goes though for you. Like if you, if you're like to, you know, if you're just focusing on the positive stuff, you know, you know how like what do they say if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all.

Speaker 1:          09:05          If you're really doing that, like people notice that too. They'll be like, man that guy is like really positive focusing on this, you know, kind of thing. Like people see it and this doesn't mean you're just Mr Positive, sugarcoating everything. And I don't know, it's not, we're to talking about that, but you are not focusing on the negative. Instead of saying, oh, we're horrible at this. You say, you know what, we've got some deficiencies here. Here's what I'm gonna do to fix them. Yeah. Yeah. How simple is that? Better? Yeah, no, the point is people they see, they see, don't think that, you know, like you're going to help, you know, make this guy look good in there and just get it. They're going to not see it and then they're just going to fall further. He is trick or something bad. They see that most of the time.

Speaker 1:          09:47          Most of the time. That example that you said about, um, uh, playing to their ego or whatever, where you're like, hey, you should, you're going to look really good if you've ever seen the movie Milana, I saw three minutes on it. Oh, see, there you go. She does a, so the guy, the main guy name the demigod who's name is Molly and played by the Rock, by the way, 20 Johnson. Great movie by the way. Um, she does him like that. She's like, Hey, let's, they got to go do this mission, you know, for restore the heart, you know, whenever it's a long story, but, and he's like, you know, whatever reluctant. And he's like, she's like, hey, you'll be a hero again. And he's like, I'm already a hero. She's like, well, no, not for a while. You know, you haven't done anything lately, but if you do this and you'll be the hero to everyone. And Yeah. Any, and of course he does it of course. But yeah, man, it's good example. It works. There it is. Proof on, on Maulana.
