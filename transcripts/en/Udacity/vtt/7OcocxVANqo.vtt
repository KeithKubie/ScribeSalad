00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And this was an easy one.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All we take is the function variance(data)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and pass it into the square root and return the result in standard deviation,

00:00:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and this gets us the correct solution.
