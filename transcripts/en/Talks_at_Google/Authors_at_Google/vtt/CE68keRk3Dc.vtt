00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:08.240
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.300
Welcome to Talks at Google
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.680
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Robert Shiller.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.730
Dr. Shiller is Sterling
Professor of Economics at Yale

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.870
and winner of the 2013
Nobel Prize in economics.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.280
He's the author of the New York
Times best seller "Irrational

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.200
Exuberance," and with George
Akerlof, also a Nobel winner,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760
he's coauthored a previous
book in addition to today's.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.790
Dr. Shiller joins
us today to discuss

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.490
the provocatively titled
"Phishing for Fools:

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.470
The Economics of
Manipulation and Deception."

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.090
As he says in the
book, "Competitive

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.540
markets by their very nature
spawn deception and trickery

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.420
as a result of the same
profit motives that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.565
give us our prosperity."

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:04.090
I'll let him take it from there.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.839
Please join me in
welcoming Bob Shiller.

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:10.751
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.780
ROBERT SHILLER: Thank you.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.190
Jonathan told me
that you recently had

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.000
Dick Thaler in the same series.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.030
That's interesting to me.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.450
Dick is an old
colleague of mine.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.450
We've been running a
behavioral economics workshop

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.170
at the NBER, which is right
near here, for 25 years.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.530
And he wrote a book called
"Nudge" with Cass Sunstein

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.470
about government policy.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.970
And the book I'm
going to talk about

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.560
could be considered
the anti "Nudge."

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.990
It's kind of the opposite.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.090
The presumption was that nudges
are used for good purposes,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.160
and maybe they are.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
Do you know what a nudge is?

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.070
This is a new-- I'm drifting
from my prepared talk.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.370
We're all critical
of economists.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.910
There aren't any economist
here, probably, right?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.970
So economists have
adopted a canonical model

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.650
of an economy consisting of self
interested, utility maximizing

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.780
individuals who take
prices as a given

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.020
and maximize their
utility individually.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.030
And that leaves to
some kind of optimality

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.640
ultimately in the
equilibrium that follows.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.230
So both Thaler and I are
critical of that model

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.090
that underlies economics.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.630
And our criticism
has something to do

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:01.610
with the field of psychology,
of neuroscience, sociology,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.086
which have a different approach
to studying human nature.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.760
I feel a little uncomfortable
talking at Google.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.700
I don't think I prepared
adequately for you.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.014
That's because a lot of what
we talk about is marketing,

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:23.980
and we have an
uncomfortable relationship

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.940
to marketing as you'll see.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.320
Not necessarily negative,
but just uncomfortable.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.910
And I don't know what
Google, isn't Google,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.680
there's different
ways of looking at it.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.286
By the way, you're Google
not Alphabet, right?

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:40.465
AUDIENCE: There's
some Alphabet here.

00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:41.840
ROBERT SHILLER:
I'm all confused.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.810
I'm talking to an
organization in transition.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.530
I don't know how to.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.640
But I was thinking, I think of
you as a search engine company,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.820
but that's very narrow.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.390
But I think maybe it's better
to think of you as a marketing

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.870
company.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.450
Is that a good?

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.500
You're a big data company,
and we have mixed feelings

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.752
about all of these things.

00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:04.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.550
So I thought I should start
by saying that I've already

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.160
thought of Google as an
ethical company in this space.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.390
So just did a test this morning.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.660
I went on to
news.google.com, and I just

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.279
looked at what came up.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.240
And there was, the way
my computer does it,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.350
I saw a big news story
about Hurricane Patrick,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.770
which is the biggest
hurricane ever that's

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.480
about to hit Mexico.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.320
That was the Google story.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.709
And then to compare that
I went, can I say it here?

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:38.208
Bing.

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:42.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.220
Now their screen, the
lead story in their screen

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.410
was lone gunman kills one person
at Tennessee State University

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.350
after a dice game.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.120
OK.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.380
Now that's sort of all
right as news, but I think,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.900
that's what we're going to
call phishing in my mind.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.970
We use the word
phishing in our title,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.430
you see it there, as a
metaphor for a broader

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.220
range of deception.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.040
So think about Bing putting
that story on as the lead story.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.680
Is that really high
minded news reporting?

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.050
Well, to me it seems
not, especially

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.660
since there's now
a new website, I

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.650
forget the name, that
lists every mass shooting.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.940
And it turns out if they
define a mass shooting

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.720
as, this didn't qualify but,
four people killed at least.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.550
And there's one every
day in the United States.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.190
So it's like why,
is this really news?

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.400
And then at the bottom
left of the Bing screen,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.680
there was a news
story, and the title

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.300
was "Drunken man breaks in by
mistake to a neighbor's house

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.640
and crawls into bed
with two young girls."

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.020
Now that is definitely
not a news story

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.560
for me in the sense that
it's wasting my time.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.560
So I've had this good
feeling about Google, largely

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.080
from that, well, in many things.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:21.695
So what this book is about
is about what's really,

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:27.750
it's a certain kind of general
problem with free market,

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.610
unregulated economies.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.600
And by the way, the
co-author, George Akerlof

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.950
is as you mentioned is my
coauthor on another book,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.250
he to me is a very
independent thinking person.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.670
I wanted to write a book with
him not quite knowing where

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.210
it would go, because I
like working with people

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.930
who think differently.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.110
And both he and I
have always felt

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.510
somewhat critical about what
goes on in our profession.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.090
The point is to bring that out.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.510
Now, the problem--
or also, what is

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.460
a fool, that's our coined word.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.380
That's someone who may
be very intelligent,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.660
but doesn't appreciate how much
manipulation and deception is

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.690
being foisted on him.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.700
So the idea of our
book is that we

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.160
would talk about many
different kinds of manipulation

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.980
and deception.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.030
Talk about it from
a behavioral, from

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.900
a psychological standpoint.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.570
And another thing about our book
is that we're different from,

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.970
there's a long history of books
on this topic as you may know.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.090
We wanted to take it from a
more economic perspective.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.630
With both George Akerlof and
I, when we were teenagers,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.975
we didn't know each other then,
we read Vance Packard's book

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:56.975
"The Hidden Persuaders."

00:07:56.975 --> 00:07:57.990
Do you know this book?

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.250
It was a bestseller
in the 1950s.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:09.510
It detailed how advertisers
use psychology to trick you.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.320
And you are already aware that
they do that sometimes, but you

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.280
read Vance Packard's book,
and it comes across looking

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.600
much more frequent.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.390
The problem with
Vance Packard's book,

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.030
though, is that it doesn't
have any economics in it,

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.340
and it seems to
portray the marketers

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.370
as an evil conspiracy.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.770
And we didn't feel that that
was the right way to look at it.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:41.960
So our book is about what we
call a "phishing equilibrium."

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.800
It's not that people
are evil, it's

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:52.538
that we have a market
system that allows,

00:08:52.538 --> 00:08:56.160
that almost forces
people to play the tricks

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:05.830
that we don't like, and it's
called competitive pressures.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.090
So the theory of
competitive equilibrium

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.080
is sometimes connected to
Darwin's theory of evolution,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.220
constant pressure on
businesses to make profits,

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.300
and that means
then that they will

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.080
be very efficient, because
they will be struggling hard

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.270
to succeed.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.540
But the problem
is that they might

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.020
have to be dishonest
within subtle,

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.030
it has to be within
the law, of course.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.920
But this more subtle
form of dishonesty

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.809
underlies problems that
we see in free markets.

00:09:41.809 --> 00:09:43.350
We're going to come
around at the end

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.620
to a plea for civil
society, or an argument

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.300
that civil society
is what really

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.620
matters in a successful
free market economy.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.270
By the way, I should
add since I'm here,

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.310
I believe in free
markets, and in fact, I

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.390
have something of an
entrepreneurial history.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.650
I started with Case
and Weiss, a company

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.760
called Case, Shiller,
Weiss in 1991

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.770
that produced home price
indices and valuations.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.630
We were ahead of Zillow.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:24.720
We had an online in the mid
1990s home valuation service.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.640
And the outcome wasn't
as successful as Zillow,

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.690
but we sold our company in 2002.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:37.910
And now Core Logic is
continuing our index production.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.380
And we've established a futures
market for single family homes

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.240
based on our indexes,
and that's still

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.790
going, not hugely successful,
but Standard and Poor's

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.670
publishes our indexes.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.610
So that was our
successful venture.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.560
Then we had an unsuccessful one
that I won't tell you about.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.740
But it may not be
unsuccessful, because I

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.950
think that what we
tried, which was

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.200
to create markets
for real estate

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:09.260
and oil and other maybe GDP
is still being talked about.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.080
I think the story
is not over yet.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.720
So I'm really pro free markets
and pro entrepreneurship.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.070
This is just a, what
I'm talking about,

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.110
what we're talking about in this
book is just a dent into that.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.750
And it's don't go too
far with the belief

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:36.040
in that just self interest will
promote good economic outcomes.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:43.210
So I think that one thing that
economists don't recognize

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.540
is how the world is
driven by social movements

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.750
and thought leaders.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:57.870
And they tend to,
one of the problems

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.570
is that, there's many
problems that are,

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.130
but in terms of our
thinking as academics,

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:12.440
there's a tendency to be
affected by prevailing theory.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.510
Something that Daniel Kahneman
calls theory induced blindness.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.490
A theory becomes established
as part of a movement,

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.610
and then it gets tremendous
prestige for a while,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.405
and then it becomes overrated.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.200
And I think what
George and I want

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.130
to argue against in our
book is the overratedness

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.910
of the free market
capitalism idea.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.000
So let me step back
and think about, I

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.910
don't know if any of you had
graduate training in economics.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.403
Probably some of you have
had undergraduate training.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.540
There is one of
the core elements

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.440
that you will be taught
in a economic theory

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.450
course will be something
called the fundamental theorem

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.140
of welfare economics.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.202
Do you know this?

00:13:14.202 --> 00:13:15.380
At least one of you doesn't.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.470
Whether you've heard of the
exact theorem is irrelevant.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.770
I think you've heard of the
general sense of conclusion

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.070
from it.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.380
The fundamental theorem
of welfare economics,

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.770
which you can find in
micro theory textbooks,

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.560
is a mathematical
theorem that describes

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.980
a competitive equilibrium.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.950
You assume that each individual
is completely selfish, only

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.960
interested in
himself or herself,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.140
and this person
maximizes utilities

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.810
subject to a budget constraint.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:58.480
They're also producers that
produce the commodities,

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.680
and they maximize their profits
subject to a budget constraint.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.080
But there is no social
feeling whatsoever.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.080
Everyone does it for
personal reward only.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.290
The outcome, the theorem says,
is in a competitive equilibrium

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:19.650
if there are no externalities,
that the allocation of goods

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.700
and services will
be Pareto optimal.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.420
You ever heard of this term?

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.950
Some of you have.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.740
Vilfredo Pareto was
an economic theorist

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.240
who flourished around 1900.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.500
And he actually anticipated
the fundamental theorem

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.240
of welfare economics, but
didn't prove it adequately.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.950
The Pareto optimality
means there is no way

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.410
to make everyone better off.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:52.030
You can redistribute income, you
can take from one to another,

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.840
and that will make one better
off and the other worse off,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.740
but there is no
way in equilibrium

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.270
to make everyone better off.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.330
Moreover, this became accepted
by economics departments

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.730
who then thought, well,
redistribution is not

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.400
our department.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.310
Should we take from the rich and
give to the poor, for example.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.010
That's philosophy
department stuff.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:19.650
Economists redefine
themselves in the 20th century

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.160
as technicians.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.745
Right, they say, should
we take from the rich

00:15:23.745 --> 00:15:24.620
and give to the poor.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.350
That's not science,
that's philosophy.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.520
That's ethics or morals.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.860
We are called in to talk about
is the economy functioning

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:38.570
well, and that functioning
means Pareto efficiency.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.130
So I think that the economics
departments of the world

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:47.370
became less philosophical, less
moral in their orientation,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.630
less interested in
how people behave.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.480
They had this
mathematical framework,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.470
which had nothing about
people except that there

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.760
are relentlessly selfish.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.750
They then dragged out of
Adam Smith, who in 1776 wrote

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.490
the classic of all time
in economics, the book,

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.950
"The Wealth of Nations."

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.410
And there is a
quote they pull out

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:13.310
one place in this book
where Adam Smith seems

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:18.650
to think that completely selfish
behavior within the limits

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:24.720
of a market economy that upholds
property rights is optimal.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.550
He said something
like, I'm trying

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.040
to remember the
exact quote, but he

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.900
said, "It's not to the
beneficence of the providers

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.140
of food that I get my dinner.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.420
The Baker, the brewer,
and the butcher

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.340
provide my dinner, because of
my paying them for what they do,

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.310
not out of any concern for me."

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.650
And then Adam Smith went
on to say, you know,

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.940
I get more from
those selfish people

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.080
than I get from all the social
reformers of the world who

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.520
don't seem to make
any difference.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.960
That's all talk.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.640
That was a very loose
quote of Adam Smith.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.640
But you know what?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.640
These are extreme views.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.829
And even Adam Smith
didn't believe that,

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.510
because if you look in
other parts of his work,

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.530
he wrote another book in 1759
called "The Theory of Moral

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.780
Sentiments."

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.599
And in that book, he said
that people are not selfish.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.579
They have some aspects
of selfishness,

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:30.080
but they're inherently
social creatures.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.740
Very interesting book,
his 1759 book, by the way.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.310
Vilfredo Pareto who
named Pareto optimality,

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.340
himself didn't believe it.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.280
In fact, he dropped
out of economics,

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.530
and he spent the last
30 years of his life

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.950
as a sociologist trying
to understand society.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.690
I think that there is something
wrong with this theory.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:56.130
In 1918-- you see I have a
long time frame of history.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:02.050
I read these old ideas, and I
find it's useful to do that.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.190
Go back 100 or 200
years, they have

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.200
ideas that we've forgotten.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.540
Professor Irving Fisher
at Yale University

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.400
said that this whole
thing about utility

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.460
that economists talk
about, it's not right.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.930
People don't maximize
their utility.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.570
The word utility goes back to
the philosopher Jeremy Bentham

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.010
who said all philosophy
should be oriented toward,

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.630
all morality should be
oriented toward utility.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:38.630
But utility, he said, meant
something like the human well

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.850
being, human fulfilment.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.960
Irving Fisher said, that's
not what people maximize.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.070
They maximize, he said we
need another word for it.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.780
And he couldn't figure out
a really good word for,

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.030
it's not in a language,
so he coined one.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.770
And he said it's wantability.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.100
What you maximize
is not your utility,

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:05.110
it's what you want at the moment
that you make the purchase.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:09.750
That term, by the way
I love Google Trends,

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.740
Google Ngrams has changed
my life, because I always

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.740
look up any idea.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.890
So I looked up wantability
on Google Ngrams,

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.900
and I find his word did
not exist before 1918.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.410
It exploded into usage
for the next 20 years,

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.210
and then has exponentially
decayed since then.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:38.460
Now if you teach micro
theory in a university,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.860
it's kind of a
difficult assignment,

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.590
because it's supposed to be some
classical theory that everyone

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.534
should know.

00:19:44.534 --> 00:19:46.200
And it's a little bit
depressing to have

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.820
to teach this old stuff.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.560
So nobody's really interested,
oh, I'm exaggerating.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.000
But you'll teach the fundamental
theorem of welfare economics

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.180
with reverence and never come
back to distortions in it.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.360
Now here what
we're talking about

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.650
is a phishing equilibrium.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:09.670
I think the simplest example,
because you've likely

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.460
already heard of it, but
it's a very minor example,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.980
but I'll start with this, is
the candy bars at the checkout

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.830
counter.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.280
Have you ever noticed
at a grocery store

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.970
when you go to the
checkout, you're

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.130
standing in line
waiting to, now it

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.750
might be a
computerized checkout,

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.820
but it would be still
standing in line for a while,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.670
they have candy
bars right there.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.410
So why is this?

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.080
Well, about 30 years ago some
social reformers and thought

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.830
leaders decided to
make a case about this.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.140
You know why they
put them there.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.640
It's because you don't go to
the grocery store intending

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.840
to buy candy bars, and
in fact, you probably

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.580
have an idea that I'm
not going to buy that.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.360
But now they put them right in
front of you at the worst time,

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.960
right at the end of
your shopping trip

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.040
when you're standing
there in line.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.390
Moreover, many people go to
the store with young children.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.340
Now you've been shopping for 45
minutes, they're getting tired,

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.320
and now you're putting
them in the experience

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.070
of standing in line.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.930
It's a most unpleasant ending.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.620
So they know that
you're vulnerable,

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.320
and they put it there.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.037
Several decades ago
a number of stores

00:21:24.037 --> 00:21:25.620
announced that they
would not do that,

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.810
because there seemed to be a
public reaction against it.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.950
However, if you
look now at stores,

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.226
it's all happening, it's all
back, the candy bars are back.

00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:36.060
And my colleague
George points out

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.290
that the children's candy
is put at children's eye

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.720
level in the store.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.900
So this is just
illustrating what I

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.850
mean by a phishing equilibrium.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:51.590
Imagine that you took a job
as a manager of a supermarket.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.290
Do you think you would do this?

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.290
I've pointed out that
you are in a sense

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.280
exploiting your customers by
putting candy bars right there.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.100
It's almost evil, but it's not.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.950
The outrage has passed,
it had its moment,

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.860
and now it's now it's faded.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.390
And so, would you do it?

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:16.290
Well, the grocery
store business happens

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.950
to be a highly competitive.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.820
It's not a mostly
innovative business.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.000
There's a lot of competitors.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.410
There's no organizational
slack, which gives you freedom.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.310
If you became a manager
of a grocery store,

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.940
you would probably become
very quickly conscious

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.220
that other grocery stores go
out of business all the time.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.220
Your profit margin
is something like 2%.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.310
You can't monkey around
too much without risking

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.300
the whole enterprise.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.740
So you probably would
do it, too, right?

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.050
The other thing is
that managers learn

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:55.010
that the best way to
manage if in doubt, imitate

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.540
what other people are doing.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.350
You assume that
they've experimented.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.950
It's costly for
me to experiment.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.760
Apparently, everyone puts
candy bars at the checkout,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.740
so I will do that too.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:13.740
Now I've picked a very
minor example about this.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.870
What we did in our book is
also somewhat similar to what

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.400
Vance Packard and
others have done

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.410
is just give a lot of examples.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.790
Our examples come from all
different times in history.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:32.332
Some of them-- let me just
give you a couple of examples.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.300
One of them is, there's a
book by Natasha Schull called

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.280
"Addiction by Design," and
it's about slot machines.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.440
It's really about
machine gambling.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:49.880
She points out that gambling
has changed in recent decades,

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.970
and it's become more
machine oriented.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.970
That is slot machines are rising
as a share of total profits

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.750
for gambling enterprises.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.460
And why is that?

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.000
Well, she presents
an analysis saying

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.440
that people are more
vulnerable toward addiction

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.580
when they are under the
control of a machine.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.144
So gambling is less and less.

00:24:12.144 --> 00:24:14.560
I'm going to have some friends
over, and we'll play cards,

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.520
we'll play a little poker, which
would be a social environment.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:25.740
When they first discovered
slot machines in the 1890s,

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.400
slot machines were found to be
addictive to a small percent

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.950
of the population.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.030
They seemed to
just keep doing it.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.290
Have you ever noticed
these people in a casino?

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:43.540
I think it has something
to do with a brain bug.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.580
Another book, I like
books, so I'm mentioning,

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.800
there is a book by
neuroscientists Dean Buonomano

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.130
called "Brain Bugs."

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.600
His premise is that the
brain is a computer,

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.680
and it has a built
in program as well as

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.450
adjustments that you add as a
part of your education later.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.530
But the built in
program has bugs in it.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:14.240
It's a product of Darwinian
evolution, but only incomplete.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.350
Evolution is much slower
than computer programs

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.900
are and writing code, and
so there are lots of bugs.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.700
The book details all the bugs.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.630
And I think it's
interesting reading.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.420
It's a funny perspective
to take on yourself.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.850
Well, apparently this
slot machine addiction

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.050
has something to do
with a bug in the reward

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:38.250
system in the brain that
for some people encourages

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.403
repetitive behavior.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.760
I used to code in Fortran,
so I kind of think of it

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.786
as being stuck in a do loop.

00:25:46.786 --> 00:25:48.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:54.040
So according to Natasha Schull,
researchers on slot machines

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.970
have tried to figure out what
makes for a successful slot

00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:59.960
machine.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:05.270
And they found out that I
guess the optimal interval

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.890
between gambles is
3 and 1/2 seconds.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.720
So they try to make it,
that's because it's somehow

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.780
the reward
neuroscientists have found

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.970
tends to come at the
moment of anticipation.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.940
The work of Wolfram Schultz, so
the dopamine system sends out

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.240
signals the moment
you think I've just

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.377
placed a bet I'm hopeful.

00:26:28.377 --> 00:26:30.710
And then that dies out after
a certain interval of time.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.220
So if you want it to
be optimally addicting,

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.030
you have to make it
easy for the person

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:38.149
to keep playing bets
at that interval.

00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:40.440
So they've eliminated the
crank that used to pull down.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.120
That seemed to interfere
with the optimal frequency.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.544
And another thing
they've learned

00:26:46.544 --> 00:26:47.960
is that people are
trying to stop.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.260
They're sitting there thinking,
you know I've lost $25 already,

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.250
maybe I should stop.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.450
But they can't quite
bring themselves to stop.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.500
Well, they've discovered
through research

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.690
that people who are
gambling machine addicts

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.610
tend to stop if there's anything
interrupting the flow of just

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.280
pushing, pushing, pushing.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.980
It used to be that coins
would come out when you won,

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:15.000
and they'd make a loud noise
and a big spectacle and great.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.460
But the problem is that
it disrupted the flow,

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.054
and many people would pack
up and leave at that point.

00:27:20.054 --> 00:27:21.970
You don't want them to
pack up and leave right

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.270
when they've won something.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:28.090
So they now substitute a
synthesised digital sound

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.210
of coins falling, so it
won't break the rhythm

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.090
of your keeping on betting.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.820
They've also
discovered that people

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.310
are a little bit ashamed to be
sitting at the slot machine,

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.850
so they try to find a nook where
they are away from other people

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.230
observing them too much.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.810
But they have a social component
to the gambling still has that.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.580
They like to see the
excitement of the Casino.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.510
So you optimize
the structure, so

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.550
that they have the slight
sense that they're hiding

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.830
in privacy with this machine.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:01.822
Anyway, you get the idea.

00:28:01.822 --> 00:28:04.280
I don't how you people, you're
not doing anything like this

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.490
here, right?

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.080
I hope not.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.470
But even so, if you can
imagine taking a job designing

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.150
slot machines, you
might be affected

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.600
to do the same sort of thing.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.710
Let me give you another example.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:24.920
Coca-Cola is the most
famous beverage ever.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.170
Why?

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.190
Now I've always wondered this,
because I never particularly

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.250
liked it.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.050
I don't dislike it either.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.320
I mean, it's just,
Yeah, it's fine.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.520
But how did it get to be so big?

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.800
Well, it's a testimony
to marketing.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.240
And the people at
Coca-Cola had a belief

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:49.450
that-- I'm relying this on
a book "Salt, Sugar, Fat"

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.460
by Michael Moss.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.470
It was a best seller a year ago.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.080
According to his
history of this,

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.970
the Coca-Cola
people were acutely

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.200
aware of the
importance of attaching

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.430
memories of good moments
to their beverage.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.130
And they would try
to use advertising

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:13.730
to make a connection,
so that later on you

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.260
would just think Coca-Cola,
it's great, it's good.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.280
Somehow, I feel good.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.360
Now I think that what
those people did was

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.520
they did something that
was an anticipation

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.960
of modern neuroscience.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.030
And that is that
neuroscience now

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:35.110
says that the human
mind as a computer

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:39.260
has a filing system for
memories that attach emotions

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.490
to each memory.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:44.890
So I think it's a good idea to
put an emotion on every memory.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.790
It's not a human idea,
that's an evolutionary idea.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.770
It's like having a file cabinet
with different colored folders,

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.140
and important stuff you
put in a red folder,

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.315
so it attaches an emotion.

00:29:58.315 --> 00:30:00.440
Another is starting to see
that the brain is really

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.830
structured that way.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.820
So for example, you
have the amygdala,

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:10.300
which is somewhere in here, that
attaches emotions to memory.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.015
The right amygdala specializes
in fear, for example.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.850
Did any of you see the
new movie "Inside Out."

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:24.490
It's a children's
movie, Disney Pixar.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.020
I went with my wife to
see it, because it's

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.560
supposed to be a
children's movie,

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.790
but I thought it was
far more interesting

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:38.920
than most adult movies,
most that I've seen lately.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.420
It features an 11 year old girl.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.350
It gives you a peek
inside her brain.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.250
Now it's a little
bit simplified.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.965
It says there are
five emotions, just

00:30:49.965 --> 00:30:51.140
like there are five senses.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.860
You know sight, hearing,
touch, smell, and taste.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.010
There are five emotions.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:31:01.570
They're fear, anger, joy,
disgust, and, I forget.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.070
AUDIENCE: Anger.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.870
ROBERT SHILLER: Anger, yes.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:08.860
And so the idea is that
these are already built in.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.200
It's the same in every culture.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:16.190
And it shows, the whole
drama of this movie

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:24.650
is that the attachment
of emotions to memories

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:29.270
and the concern that the
people inside your brain

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:33.660
have about the dangers
of attaching emotions

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.750
to core memories, because it
can change your personality

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:37.730
afterward.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.300
It's dangerous to have
negative emotions attached

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.930
to important memories.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:46.330
So I think Coca Cola people
appreciated this right

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.980
from the beginning.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.582
And it was that sort of thing.

00:31:49.582 --> 00:31:51.040
Well, I'm giving
you some examples.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.290
We have many other examples.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:57.850
We attribute the financial
crisis recently to at least

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:59.260
partly to phishing.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.655
People had the advantage of
selling certain securities.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.500
That a lot of emotional tension
in life that people have

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.730
is running out of
money and fearing

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:19.230
for their possible
bankruptcy, and I

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.120
think that marketing
helps them do that.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.880
Anyway I'm supposed to wrap up.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.297
What I wanted to do
is get to what is our,

00:32:32.297 --> 00:32:33.880
I don't know if I
presented this well,

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:41.340
but I wanted to get
to the idea that we

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.560
have about why we are
as successful as we

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.120
seem to be in this country.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.840
What is our core
reason for success.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:58.040
A view has enveloped that it
is because of our free market

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.160
institutions that
encourage entrepreneurs.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:07.940
That's certainly partly right,
but is that the only thing.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:13.270
Or should we, it seems like
we might be oversimplifying

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:16.690
to give quite so much.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:20.950
So why is America
a great country?

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.420
I have a couple of suggested
readings on this, which

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.120
you can find on Google Books.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.006
And I'm so thankful to Google,
which gives me so much help.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.570
In 1780, I think the year
was, Benjamin Franklin wrote

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:40.020
a short article to be
published in Europe.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.200
And the title of the
article was "Information

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.600
for People Contemplating
Repairing to America."

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:54.280
It was a description of
America in 1780 for Europeans.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:59.730
And in that description
he said, "Be warned.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.620
Your erudition will do
you nothing in America.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.410
The Americans are
very practical people,

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.740
and they want to see results.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.770
If you are a skilled
workman of some sort, fine,

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.719
come to America
and you'll do well.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:18.620
But if you're on an aristocrat
or an artist or a philosopher,

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.633
don't come."

00:34:20.633 --> 00:34:21.924
That's something about America.

00:34:21.924 --> 00:34:24.480
It reflects the kind
of people who came here

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.800
and the attitude that developed.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.750
The other one you my read
is Alexis de Tocqueville

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.880
who has a lot to say
about American character.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.040
The point is that this country
is a success partly because

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.330
of free markets, but also
because of civil society.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.830
And it's actions
that people have

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:49.520
taken to prevent the phishing
equilibrium from dominating.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.929
So it's not just individual acts
of ethics or acts of concern.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.950
We can exhibit, for example, the
founder of Ogilvy and Mather,

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:03.800
the ad agency,
Ogilvy in the 1940s

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.870
announced that his company would
not take on any more cigarette

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:09.770
advertisements.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.060
I think that if you read
the medical literature

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.340
in the 20th century,
it started to become

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:20.310
like I have a hunch cigarette
smoking is bad for you by 1915.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:26.460
By 1940 it still wasn't
proven, but someone

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.280
who read the literature would
probably say, this is it,

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.770
I'm not smoking.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.630
It looked pretty bad.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:38.350
So that's when Ogilvy pulled
out of a cigarette advertising.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:41.390
But it didn't have no
effect on the outcome,

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:44.370
because somebody else
just goes right back in.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.360
There's a profit to be made.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.960
And there was a profit
to be made from phishing.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:56.420
The cigarette companies tried
a strategy of sowing confusion

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.510
about tobacco.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.670
They found that the president
of the University of Michigan,

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:04.430
Little, was a
skeptic and a smoker.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.070
He loved his smoking.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.010
And they got him to
say that no one has

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.820
proved at a statistically
significant level

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.090
that smoking is harmful.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:14.770
Maybe he was right,
or maybe they

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.370
didn't understand causality
well enough to prove it.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:23.450
But basically, it was a feint
to try to get people confused,

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.130
and it was for profit.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.830
So what we really
need is somebody

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.630
who will stand above
the profit incentive

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:35.800
and will do something to try
to limit profit opportunities

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.610
for things that we can't stand.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:42.610
And I've been
concluding my talks

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:48.340
by just giving a few examples
of heroes who sort of started

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.250
social movements.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.726
And there are a
great many heroes.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:01.280
What I've been doing as a game,
I've done a book tour for this.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.520
I'll try it here, too.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.680
The game is I'll give you
some names of famous people

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.500
who upheld morality in
business and ask you

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.230
if there's anyone
here who can tell me

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.225
who they are by their name.

00:37:15.225 --> 00:37:16.850
Now, if you read our
book, you'll know,

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.180
but that's cheating.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.550
So let me start with
Florence Kelley.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:25.830
Anyone heard of her?

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.560
As anticipated, no one has.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:35.790
Florence Kelley in 1899 set up
the National Consumers League,

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:40.660
which tested products for
safety and put a white label,

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.840
this was a nonprofit,
a white label

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.380
on products that were safe.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:52.300
William Henry Merrill, now
this is not the Merrill Lynch

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.320
Merrill.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.140
Again no one.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.930
In 1893 he was an
electrician who

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:03.510
was asked to inspect the
electricity at the Chicago

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.500
World's Fair palace
of electricity.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.710
It was really an
exciting display

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.190
of what things were going
to come through electricity,

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.350
but it was unsafe.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.780
Their wiring wasn't
right, so he decided

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:20.010
to set up a nonprofit called
United Laboratories or UL,

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:24.090
and they would put their
mark on safe products.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.210
This worked, because it
made it impossible to phish.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:31.080
The word got out, don't
buy if it doesn't say UL,

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.100
and that stopped certain
kinds of phishing.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.270
By the way, UL made
a corporate change

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:43.100
just as Google has in this month
in 2012, it went for profit.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.470
I believe it's still
doing the same business,

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:50.430
and it's the same socially
conscious business.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:56.910
Another hero, Alice Lakey
and Harvey Washington Wiley.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:59.894
OK, 0.

00:38:59.894 --> 00:39:00.810
I've done this before.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.500
I hope I'm not offending you.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:09.120
What these people did is made
a public campaign about drugs.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:14.480
They argued that
as of 1900, most

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.130
drugs that you could buy in
a drug store were fraudulent.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.050
There was something
like Swaim's Panacea.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:21.850
What is that?

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.700
First of all, it claimed
to cure any illness.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.610
There's something
wrong about that.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.630
And then secondly, they
tested what was in it.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.490
And it was just ordinary
household flavoring.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.140
It was a complete fraud.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.940
And they said, but
what's to stop a business

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.420
from doing that?

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.650
When they advertised
in magazines,

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.050
they're telling the
magazine, don't criticize

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.190
us or we'll pull our ad.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.070
So there's no incentive
for the advertising.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.760
Well, maybe there
was some incentive.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.700
But to do a testing lab
and to do-- so anyway,

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.280
they got the government to
create the Food and Drug

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.450
Administration in 1906.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:01.392
Another hero, Stuart Chase
and Frederick Schlink.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.610
OK, Stuart, they wrote
a book in the 1920s

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:10.160
called "Your Money's Worth."

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.480
And they said the FDA is not
enough, because they're still

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.810
monkeying with you.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.980
They said, take the
example of toothpaste.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.492
I'm quoting from their book.

00:40:19.492 --> 00:40:20.950
"We go to a drug
store, and there's

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:22.710
10 different brands
of toothpaste,

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.280
and they all make health claims.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.572
Maybe they're all safe,
the FDA has tested them,

00:40:28.572 --> 00:40:30.030
but what about
those health claims?

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.830
How does anyone know?"

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.110
So they said, "We need
a regular publication

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.540
that tests products."

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.530
That was done in 1936.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:40.230
That's Consumer Reports.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.240
Finally, one more
here, Ben Bernanke.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.142
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:46.600
Well, I guess I
don't have to tell.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.790
But I think that he's a hero.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:52.160
It's not a for profit
operation that he led,

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.060
it was the Federal Reserve.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:02.030
And he probably prevented
another Great Depression,

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.840
which was based on
a loss of confidence

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.400
and a tumult within
the financial sector.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.380
Controversial
things that he did.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:27.240
So anyway, that's my view, our
view expressed in this book.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.420
I say that our book is,
I'm already controversial.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.170
I may have offended some of you.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:38.960
It's considered unpatriotic to,
it seems considered unpatriotic

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.430
here in America
especially to say anything

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:45.510
in favor of any
kinds of regulation.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.390
But I wanted to
add that I'm not,

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:50.320
there's a tendency to
think about free markets

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.020
versus government.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.360
I'm not thinking so
much about government.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:42:00.250
Those heroes I gave you were
outside of the government

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:03.250
except for Ben Bernanke.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.750
The idea of civil
society is a society

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:12.610
with people who have
a sense of community,

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:15.380
a sense of responsibility
for what goes on.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.680
They tend to view the government
as just people we hire to do

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.580
what we want as a community.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.230
They don't allow
themselves to be

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:31.570
captured by propaganda,
because of their sense

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:32.940
of responsibility.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:36.230
And they tend to
be educated people,

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:40.670
and they take the
effort to get knowledge.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:44.330
So that's what this
book is a plea for.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.780
Now how this fits into
Google with its big data

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.002
and its Cloud.

00:42:51.002 --> 00:42:52.460
There's so many
things you do here,

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.700
I find it hard to summarize
what I would think.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.840
But it seems to me
that there is already

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.110
a moral spirit at Google as I
was saying at the beginning.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:07.320
And I think you have
more organizational slack

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.080
than a grocery store does.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.630
That means you can
philosophize about the long run

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.550
future of this organization.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:20.140
And you can take steps that
are maybe costly in terms

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:25.050
of profits today, but in the
long run are the right things

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:30.490
to do, and may not even be
in the long run crossly.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:33.615
I'll stop with that and
open this up to questions.

00:43:36.345 --> 00:43:39.255
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:39.255 --> 00:43:40.237
Thank you.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:49.020
AUDIENCE: How can behavioral
economic theory influence

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.640
like what's taught
in universities?

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.040
Will it take over?

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.847
Will rational actor
eventually not be taught?

00:43:56.847 --> 00:43:58.680
ROBERT SHILLER: Well,
I think it will always

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.250
be taught, because it's
actually a useful thing

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.140
to the rational actor,
and the idea of Pareto

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.066
optimality is worth
talking about.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.950
But the problem with
the economics profession

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:20.340
now is that it like other
academic disciplines,

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.330
they get separated and isolated.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:28.320
And it develops a sort
of departmental inertia.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.830
Here's what happens.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.330
You become the
economics department.

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:33.550
Now in your research.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:34.610
Now you're a community.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:39.920
There's a social
tendency, tribal tendency.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.740
You start to view the psychology
department as arrival,

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.695
arrival for university funding.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:53.040
And moreover, you start
developing a brand.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.300
So you attract PhD
students, let's say,

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:01.610
who wanted to become
mathematical economist.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:02.760
So what do you do?

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.280
You can't say, well, we've
changed our mind this year,

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.300
we're going to teach
you psychology.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.924
That's not what they want.

00:45:08.924 --> 00:45:09.840
They want to get jobs.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.214
It becomes all routinized.

00:45:11.214 --> 00:45:12.630
They want to get
jobs, so you have

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:16.640
to teach them what
will get them a job

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.140
in a conventional
economics department.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.900
And also there's
this pressure to be

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:27.450
at the frontier that means
that you don't have time

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.550
to read other things.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:31.800
So you're struggling
so hard to get

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.370
at the pinnacle of some
mathematical discourse.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.230
You just run out of time.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.360
By the way, there's
another interesting book,

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.580
which just came out by
Gillian Tett called "The Silo

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:48.490
Effect," which argues this more
generally for corporations.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:52.300
Maybe this is an argument
against Alphabet, by the way.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.920
They said, Larry
Page said it would

00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:01.710
be neater and more incentivizing
or accountable or something

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:05.970
if we divide Google
into a separate unit

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.850
with separate CEOs.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:11.730
But what Gillian Tett
says is that can produce

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:15.160
a bad outcome of too
much specialization,

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.900
and then also a kind
of culture developing

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.020
in each one of
these units that's

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.550
kind of antagonistic to
other cultures in a sense

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.790
that if you defy the
norms of your tribe,

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:32.420
you will be unpatriotic
in some sense.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.665
So I haven't finished
reading her book,

00:46:34.665 --> 00:46:38.190
bu it sounds like it's a
really important topic.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.810
And it accounts for the kind
of errors that are commonly

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:46.020
made in modern society.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.700
AUDIENCE: So because of some
of this momentum in economics

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.750
like forgetting
graduate students

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:56.350
that want to do
mathematical economics,

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:59.110
is there any math associated
with some of these more

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:00.029
behavioral approaches?

00:47:00.029 --> 00:47:01.070
ROBERT SHILLER: Oh, Yeah.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:02.040
AUDIENCE: Can it?

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.940
ROBERT SHILLER: Yeah,
behavioral economics

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.910
has some mathematics in it.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.340
Right, I mean you can ask
what is it that people do,

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.110
and there can be, there's
mathematical psychology.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:15.980
But the problem
is it doesn't have

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:20.510
the elegance of general
equilibrium economic theory.

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:24.160
And people who
want to understand

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.510
how did this whole
set of prices get set.

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:29.190
Where did they come from?

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:33.340
Free markets generate them,
but where and how and why?

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.700
That incline, there's a sort
of wishful thinking bias that

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.870
develops if you are a theorist.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:43.260
You kind of hope this
expected utility maximization

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.600
theory is right, because it
makes for a nice modeling.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.310
If you look at what
psychologists say,

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.220
it's just too messy.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.380
And you can't say whether
we've-- parade or optimality is

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.770
a nice concept, because it
gives you a clear conclusion.

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:01.572
But if people are
psychological animals,

00:48:01.572 --> 00:48:03.530
how do we know that we've
made them better off?

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:06.720
I'll give you an example
that Daniel Kahneman, who

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.300
wrote a nice book,
"Thinking Fast and Slow."

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.760
He's a psychologist
interested in economics.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.770
But one thing he did is he
questioned whether we even

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:18.540
know our own happiness.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.720
You assume that people
are making purchases

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.300
to make themselves happy.

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.630
Do people know what
makes them happy?

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:26.880
So he did the
following experiment.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.840
He asked subjects
to thrust their hand

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:34.820
into a bowl of ice
water for 60 seconds.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.380
By the way, try that.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.225
You won't like it.

00:48:38.225 --> 00:48:41.970
It gets really annoying.

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:46.060
That was condition
A. Then condition B,

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.670
he asked them to do that
again, but actually it's

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:51.170
for 90 seconds.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.670
But he's got a little
temperature raiser

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:57.280
in the bowl that raises the
temperature for the last 30

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.180
seconds to something
more comfortable.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.820
And then later asks which
did you like better A or B?

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:08.630
Most people like B better.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.800
That's because,
apparently their memory

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.520
is affected by the improvement.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.850
It's been 70 seconds, now I'm
starting to feel OK again.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:22.470
But they were actually
in ice water longer.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:27.070
So by some objective criteria,
they should have picked A,

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.300
but they didn't.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.920
So the question is
whether people even know

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.680
whether they're happy or not.

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.220
It's a different view.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:39.570
It makes it harder to do
economics, because yeah,

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:43.930
the human brain is this
complicated interconnected

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:45.410
calculating machine.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:47.180
What's good?

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.880
I don't know what's good for it.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.650
And if people don't know,
it just kind of leaves

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:52.880
you inconclusive.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.420
So economists won't like that.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:07.280
AUDIENCE: It's interesting
that your heroes were not

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.950
government people.

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:12.000
And of course, the
defenders of pure--

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.210
ROBERT SHILLER: Ben Bernanke
was, but most weren't.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.585
AUDIENCE: Your
free market theory

00:50:15.585 --> 00:50:17.920
would argue that the
most extreme would

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.250
say, oh well, we don't
need government regulation,

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:25.410
because the markets will
pop up people like this

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:29.480
where there's demand for them.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:35.750
I'm curious about your
general views about that.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.500
And even professional
licensing, of course,

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.470
Milton Friedman famously
argued that not even doctors

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.200
and lawyers should be licensed.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.780
But I'm interested in
the latest phenomenon

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.030
of this seems to be reviews.

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:51.950
So Amazon has
reviews of products,

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:56.360
Uber, Airbnb both have
reviews of both sides

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.240
of the transaction.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.720
Google is trying to
get more reviews.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.570
I'm curious about your thoughts
about the review phenomenon.

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:09.270
Obviously, it has
lots of problems,

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:14.770
not just organized campaigns
to do biased reviews,

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:18.100
but sort of the herd
instinct with reviews

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.100
and lots of other things.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:24.410
Are reviews really the latest
of this heroic phenomenon

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:28.620
or is it all just self
deception or what's going on

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:32.300
with the whole review thing?

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.910
ROBERT SHILLER: Well, you raise
a lot of interesting points.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.610
Let me start with
Milton Friedman.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:44.120
In 1962 he wrote a book called
"Capitalism and Freedom" that

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.040
was actually an outgrowth of
an earlier work he'd done with,

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:53.090
who was at, Kuznets on
occupational licensing.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:56.890
And in that book, he argued
that occupational licensing

00:51:56.890 --> 00:52:01.410
is merely an effort
by the practitioners

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:03.890
to exclude competition.

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:06.250
So here's what happens.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:11.650
The AMA goes to appear before
a medical licensing board

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:15.390
and argues persuasively
that something has to be,

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:19.170
a practice has to be prohibited
unless it's licensed.

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:21.870
But that in fact is
merely keeping others

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:24.510
out of practicing.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:27.870
The outcome is that our
medical services are excellent,

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:32.150
but there aren't enough of
them, and they're too expensive.

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:35.810
He said that somehow the
community doesn't understand

00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:38.406
that, and so it's a doop.

00:52:38.406 --> 00:52:39.780
He's really talking
about it kind

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.760
of manipulation and deception.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.800
But the problem
is, what would we

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:49.980
do about not having any
licensure for doctors?

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.370
The problem is we
know that there

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.370
is a lot of quack
medicine that could

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.640
be sold to ignorant people.

00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:01.680
So maybe what he proposed
has never been adopted

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.600
by any country, I think.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.180
Any advanced country has
licensing for doctors.

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:10.640
But another thing is I actually
like Milton Friedman and admire

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.820
his works.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.650
What he actually
did with that book

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:17.930
was quite significant,
because within a few years

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:22.620
of the publication of that book,
the first nurse practitioner

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:28.260
program was started, or
a physician's assistant.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.710
What that did is
it really increased

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:33.560
the supply of medical services.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:39.030
The AMA back down and allowed
that a physicians assistant

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:43.580
could practice in the
office of a licensed MD.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.730
The outcome of that
was the reduction

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:51.500
in the cost of medical
services and improved health.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:55.020
So I think that the
idea that regulators

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:58.300
can be captured
by the regulator,

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.570
that the regulations don't
always serve the public

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.010
is correct.

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:06.170
But that shouldn't
be taken as a blanket

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:09.380
argument against regulation.

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:13.250
The other thing you've asked is
about reviews on websites now

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:16.290
that allow people to
see others comments.

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:18.526
I think that is a
wonderful development.

00:54:18.526 --> 00:54:21.860
It used to be that--
our ability to shop

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:23.990
has become so much better.

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:25.680
We get the right thing.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:29.085
By the way, our GDP
numbers don't reflect that.

00:54:29.085 --> 00:54:34.850
If you were back in 1955
buying shoes that bothered you,

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:38.030
buying medicines
that made you sick,

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:41.150
things like that, because you
couldn't read those reviews,

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:44.270
you had a salesman
who wasn't unbiased.

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.320
That's all you could
get information from.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.780
So I think our human
welfare has gone up

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:52.360
much more than GDP has gone up.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.370
So there's a real question
about the productivity numbers

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:57.000
and the outcome numbers.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.450
So what you talk about
are wonderful things.

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:04.150
But offsetting that there are
risks on the other side that

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:08.540
phishing that is malicious can
be pursued more dramatically.

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:12.580
Well, that's why we use that
word phishing and with a "ph."

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.420
It goes both ways.

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.790
I'm reminded that ISIS is
a product of the internet.

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:23.560
Apparently, their ability--
the whole business model

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:28.240
of the Islamic State
is to recruit fanatics

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.000
from all over the world.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.320
And they have a
way to do that now.

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.640
And it's creating
a real problem.

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.680
So I don't know where
all this is going net,

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.430
but I think it's important
that people at Google

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:42.840
maintain a sort of
philosophic and moral stance

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.810
about what they do.

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:46.810
And they already are doing that
as I said at the beginning,

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:49.340
and it is important
to keep that up.

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.390
Yeah.

00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:52.280
AUDIENCE: So I
have two comments.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.366
One is about physicians
and licensing.

00:55:55.366 --> 00:55:56.740
I once proposed
to a friend who's

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:59.210
a physician that that
was a means of limiting

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:02.630
the number of doctors
and keeping costs up.

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.630
And she told me that, well,
actually it's the opposite.

00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:09.630
In the cities where we have
more doctors per capita,

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.620
the medical expenses
are much higher.

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.490
And so the more
doctors you have,

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:16.105
the more you spend on them.

00:56:16.105 --> 00:56:16.980
ROBERT SHILLER: Yeah.

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.610
AUDIENCE: And so
I have a question,

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:19.300
what you think of that.

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.130
And then I have another
question follow up,

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:23.510
which is in the press we've
seen a lot of articles

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:25.710
recently about
the cost of drugs,

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:30.360
and how drug companies are
buying up old generic drugs

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.167
and combining them
in interesting ways,

00:56:32.167 --> 00:56:33.750
and then charging
essentially whatever

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:36.560
they want for them, because
they are the only supplier.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.090
They really have a monopoly.

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:41.540
And I'm curious how you
think the government

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:46.153
or the population as a whole
should deal with that issue.

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.850
ROBERT SHILLER: Yeah, OK,
well, first thing there

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:56.560
is a natural moral hazard
in the medical profession

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.300
that doctors will recommend
surgery that's not necessary,

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.840
because they want
to make the money.

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.010
And you as a client have
no ability to judge.

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:07.494
That apparently goes on.

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.350
Similar things happen in
now financial professions.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:16.160
Financial advisors
will steer you

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.070
to client the products that
charge huge management fees

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:21.970
for questionable activities.

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:27.250
These are all part of
the phishing equilibrium.

00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:30.710
So what do we do about that?

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:34.170
Well, that's a big and
long and complicated story.

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:37.790
One thing is I think
that there is something

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:39.920
about appealing to ethics.

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.870
And also you're asking doctors
to sign an oath of loyalty

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:45.490
to their client.

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.860
I was proposing
in one of my books

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:56.240
that right now we have a tax
subsidy for financial advice,

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.830
that is it's
deductible, but I think

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:02.050
that we should make two
changes in that deductibility.

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:06.060
One is it should be a tax
credit rather than a deduction,

00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.910
because the people who need
financial advice the most

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:12.250
are low income who generally
don't have any advantage

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.130
to itemizing.

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:17.170
The other thing is that I
think financial advisors should

00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:19.890
get a government
subsidy of this form

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:23.000
only if they sign
an oath of loyalty

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.470
to their client meaning that
they will not steer them

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:32.370
toward products that are
more lucrative for them.

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:36.940
So that would create, I think
a financial advice profession

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.830
that resembles the
medical profession.

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:44.820
I think most doctors don't
schedule you for surgery

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.190
that you don't need.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.710
And that's especially
true, because they

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:52.140
have signed some kind of oath.

00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:55.170
And they could be
sued for malpractice.

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:58.680
So it's partly a fear, but
I think it goes beyond that.

00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:00.820
People do have some morals.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.610
And if you said you
would do something,

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:08.430
you probably would just,
most people will just do it.

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:13.070
So buying up drugs and
raising the price, that

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:15.200
is something that we,
it was in the news

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.340
recently for an
outrageous example.

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.350
I can think of free market
justifications for that

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.790
if that additional profits
would then eventually

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:28.560
go to more drug research
that would help.

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.090
Maybe it's expensive
to do the research,

00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:33.010
and so maybe some
drugs have to be high.

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:34.426
AUDIENCE: The
government funds it.

00:59:34.426 --> 00:59:36.590
ROBERT SHILLER:
Well, anyway, you've

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.610
brought an example of
a questionable activity

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:42.950
that I don't have
answers to all of them.

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:45.760
This book is just a
general thought piece

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:50.250
that's supposed to change
people's deep assumptions

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:52.160
about the free market.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.160
I think I'm out of time.

00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.410
Is that right?

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:56.580
OK, well, thank you.

00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.230
[APPLAUSE]
