00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
oh

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.250
At one point or another maybe even now you might be thinking

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.839
Hey, I'm such a failure. I'm hopeless maybe even worse. I'm not made for this world. You are not alone

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.200
We all go through it sometimes even the most successful people

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.918
Everyone feels discouraged from time to time, but the point isn't to dwell on our negative feelings instead

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.799
We should see if there are ways we can overcome these feelings

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410
Here's 10 tips to help you bounce back

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.249
1 think about what it is you want.

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.298
Brainstorm a list of your goals including the ones you've thrown away

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.649
Even ones you've buried as far back as your childhood that you hope to reach

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.229
Then go through them and read them

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.149
thinking about when you first got inspired to pursue those goals and how you felt back then and

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.669
Then let them drift through your mind for a short while

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.869
2. take small steps.  After

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.599
You've taken the time to sleep on it think of something small that you can do to spark your inspiration and motivation

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.530
Something manageable the point of this is to regain control

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.859
It doesn't have to be directly related to your goals as long as it's something you can do even if you think it's insignificant

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.640
Or doesn't make sense for example. You can clean your room. Go for a jog or just buy a gift for yourself?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.629
Anything that gives you a purpose and makes you feel like life is worth it. You're getting a reward based on an action taken

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.929
3. Consult somebody. Once you hopefully you feel slightly better about yourself

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.869
It's time to start working towards your goals it can be overwhelming in the beginning when you're trying to take your first steps

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.559
Since you might be unsure of what you have to do to actually fulfill your goals

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.129
To help you get started consult someone someone you respect

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.579
Ask for five minutes of their time tell them about your goals and let them know that you're unsure of how to get there

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.750
Listen to any advice they offer to get measurable steps you can go after

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.619
4. Start taking those steps.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.499
Give yourself some time to take those steps

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.730
Time is a key factor in

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.869
Creating change and building up a habit the more time you dedicate to something or the more time you give yourself to achieve

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.580
Something the more manageable your goal becomes and the less stress you are to achieve them

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.779
Give yourself enough time to start reframing your mindset and pursuing that goal

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.790
5. report your accomplishments to someone even if you feel like you did nothing for an entire week

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.850
subconsciously

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.730
Because you have told yourself you will do it

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.410
You're constantly working toward your goals in the background even if you think you actually did nothing

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.179
However, if you look closely enough you will start to see changes in your own behavior

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.959
Take note of these changes, and how they might be contributing to your goal

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.639
Then report it to someone maybe even the person you consulted in the beginning the purpose of reporting is to make your actions measurable

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.420
six start researching solutions on your own

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.530
Now that you finally started to get back into the groove of things and no longer feeling down and hopeless about yourself you will now

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.000
Have more energy to figure out the steps you personally want to take to get closer to your goals

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.600
You may feel more motivated to think and research on your own now instead of letting someone else tell you what you should do

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.420
Coming up with a game plan on your own will help you develop the independence you need to start relying on yourself

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.100
7 again tell yourself you will give yourself a good amount of time to apply the new strategies

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.589

Eight after you feel like you've done everything you can think of it's time to find a professional

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.879
Now that you've finally committed to your goals

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.359
It's time to move a little faster find an expert in the field

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.769
Someone who's actually gotten to or past where you want to be and get their help?

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.959
Whether it's taking lessons from them or working under them as an intern it's important to gain

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.420
Experience through the eyes of someone who's working in the environment you want to be in good job getting this far?

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.579
10 lastly don't give up the most important step is to never give up

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:40.100
Giving up is like starting over from square one and everything is about momentum. You might not notice small changes or improvements, but they're happening

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.160
