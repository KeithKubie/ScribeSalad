00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:01.180
DAN ATKINS: All right.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.310
Hi, everybody.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.440
Thank you for joining us today
for a panel we're calling

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.420
The Reality of Virtual Reality.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.170
We like the title.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.870
It sounds dramatic.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.950
My name is Dan Atkins.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.800
I'm a publishing
producer here at Google,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.550
focused on Daydream, which
for us is a combination

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.590
of both our AR and VR efforts.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.930
But today we're going
to be talking about VR.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.950
And VR, as you guys know, is
still very much an emergent

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.950
medium.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.189
It's one where we're
continuing to learn

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.462
from every product
that comes out.

00:00:34.462 --> 00:00:36.420
And more importantly,
we're still in this phase

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.850
where app developers can still
learn a tremendous amount

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.640
from game developers,
and vise versa.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.030
So we're lucky enough today
to be joined by two people who

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.910
really run the spectrum of VR
entertainment in the industry

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.790
right now and have been
pretty prolific in doing so,

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.500
both having shipped
multiple titles

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.812
across multiple platforms.

00:00:57.812 --> 00:01:00.270
So Nic, Jonathan, thank you
guys so much for being with us.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.420
JONATHAN FLESHER: Thank
you for having us.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.710
DAN ATKINS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm hoping that
we can start just

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.875
by hearing a little bit
about who you guys are

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:10.500
and what brought you to VR, and
a little bit about the products

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.461
you've been working on.

00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.960
So Nic, maybe we
can start with you.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.918
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Sure.

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:15.870
My name is Nic Vasconcellos.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.270
I am one of the founders
of Turbo Button.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.150
We are a small
indie studio in LA.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.930
We are three people strong
and just recently released

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.320
this game, "Along Together"
on Google Daydream.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.080
And the game is--

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.297
you play as a kid's
imaginary friend,

00:01:33.297 --> 00:01:34.380
going on these adventures.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.310
And you have the power to
move things in the environment

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.270
and help this kid
find their lost dog.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.120
So we've been going for
a couple of years now.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.850
We started in the
beginning of 2015.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.450
Started by doing a
couple of Gear VR games,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.620
and then this is our latest.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.350
DAN ATKINS: Awesome.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.050
And Jonathan.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.995
Do you want to do the same?

00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:00.620
JONATHAN FLESHER:
I'm Jonathan Flesher.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.490
I work at a company
called Baobab Studios.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.510
It was founded by
Maureen Fan, who

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.440
used to run the "Farmville"
franchises at Zinga.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.200
And Eric Darnell, who
was the writer/director

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.660
of the "Madagascar" films
when he was at Dreamworks.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.990
And Larry Cutler,
who is our CTO, who

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.830
was the head of global
character animation

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.105
technology at Dreamworks.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.480
And so we've really
come together

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.640
as bringing traditional
cinematic animation

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.850
and video game talent
to create something

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.800
new for virtual reality.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.990
And you'll see on the screen,
we have three pieces today.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.630
The first one, "Invasion!"

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.252
most recently won an Emmy award.

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:38.960
We're very flattered
to have that happen.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.380
And it's been a top performing
app across all the platforms.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.380
"Asteroids!" will be
released this holiday season

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.880
on Daydream.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.807
And "Rainbow Crow" will be
coming out sometime next year.

00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:51.640
DAN ATKINS: Awesome.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.190
And I think we have a
clip to watch on that one.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.650
JONATHAN FLESHER:
On "Asteroids!"

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.430
DAN ATKINS: On "Asteroids!"

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.700
JONATHAN FLESHER: Yes.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.616
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:57.616 --> 00:03:00.193
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.656
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.640
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.600
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Cool.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.050
DAN ATKINS: I love that clip.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.920
JONATHAN FLESHER: Thank you.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.836
DAN ATKINS: Very cool.

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:41.790
So I'm wondering if we
can start a little bit--

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.580
I want to take us through the
life cycle of a product, here.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.163
And so I was wondering
if we can start

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:48.940
with a little bit about the
concept phase for you guys,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.100
particularly ideation.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.160
How do you define a razor,
what makes a good idea for VR

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.050
versus a bad idea?

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.010
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Sure.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.720
For us, so Turbo Button,
we only do VR games.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.100
That is our focus,
is the gaming side.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.520
So a lot of times, there's two
ways that we'll start ideas.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.439
One is with interaction,
which is probably the biggest

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.480
way that we start things.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.510
It's like does this thing
just feel good in VR?

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.779
Very often mechanics driven.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.670
And it doesn't even--

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.420
I think because everything is so
early on, like you were saying,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.510
it might not be the
most mind-blowing thing,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.470
but even just the smallest
interaction design

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.290
that can just feel really
good feels like 10 times

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.800
better because it's in VR.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.880
And so it's just really finding
those core little moments

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.030
that feel really nice and
then building around those.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.600
And then sometimes we also
come from the other direction.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.725
I'd be curious to know how
you guys think about it.

00:04:43.725 --> 00:04:45.960
Because it's just thematic.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.590
It's like, oh, I want to
be in this world, or just

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.280
a little moment of whether
it's a character looking at you

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.400
or something like
that, that can be

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.920
the hook, the hook moment
that you build everything else

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.840
around.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.484
So yeah.

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:03.900
JONATHAN FLESHER: We come at
it very much from a narrative

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.330
storytelling perspective.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.060
That's the benefit of having
a guy like Eric Darnell

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.460
is he's very prolific
in terms of his ideas

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.930
and has written a
number of scripts

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.070
that we then start with.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.600
These are the story lines.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.720
And he actually will pitch
them to the office as a whole,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.140
so we have these
brainstorming sessions.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.210
And then he runs
through the story,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.190
and then we get
feedback from a story,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.290
and he takes that
and adjusts it.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.960
And then we go into
interactive sessions,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.650
thinking about wouldn't it
be cool if we could do this.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.300
And so there's already
starting to be this emerging

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.480
body of things that happen in VR
that people have attached names

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.830
to, like the dollhouse effect.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.870
Do I lean in and
see little people

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.580
and peer into their
houses, to I'm in water.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.560
I put my head above
water, I put it below, I

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.680
see under the water.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.860
And all those types
of things are super

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.850
cool to be watching
created in this new medium

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.430
because it's just like
when smartphones came out,

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.850
and "Angry Birds" did
the I can actually

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.620
get the feel of like a
slingshot on a piece of glass.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.190
So this is that new
thing here, and that's

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.000
kind of how we go
through that process.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.958
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Yeah.

00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.070
And I think our razor for what
works or doesn't work often

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.770
comes down to comfort.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.020
Very often comfort, at least.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.460
It's like any little
thing that can feel weird

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.780
can make you feel ill or
dizzy or something in VR.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.420
It's very easy to do.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.900
And I think, especially in our
earlier days of our company,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.400
we would do a lot
of experimentation

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.100
around camera motion.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.870
A couple of our games are
these third person experiences

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.210
like "Along Together"
where the camera's moving

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.820
through the environment,
and that can very easily

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.550
make people feel uncomfortable.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.880
To develop those systems
to make them comfortable,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.432
we literally will
be just like laying

00:06:49.432 --> 00:06:51.890
on a sofa for about an hour,
because we've tried something,

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.120
and it's like, oh, god.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.578
JONATHAN FLESHER:
You need the guys

00:06:54.578 --> 00:06:56.570
without the depth
perception at the office who

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.630
don't get nauseous.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.220
NIC VASCONCELLOS:
Exactly, exactly.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.146
We're not those
guys, none of us.

00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:04.770
JONATHAN FLESHER: And I'd say to
follow up on that, in addition

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.580
to the comfort level, the things
that we're really focused on

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.400
is that interactivity
that you're layering in

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.440
doesn't really detract
from the narrative.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.360
That's of critical
importance to us

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.690
as storytellers is that
the interactivity enhances

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.077
the story as opposed to becomes
the focus of the experience.

00:07:23.077 --> 00:07:24.660
DAN ATKINS: So I
mentioned prototyping

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.460
plays a significant role
in this as well, right?

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.459
You guys are trying
different things in software

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:31.200
as you're going and figuring
out what makes sense.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.820
What's the razor for you guys
between talking about an idea

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.282
and being convinced that
it's worth building?

00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:40.782
NIC VASCONCELLOS:
You can start off.

00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:42.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.121
JONATHAN FLESHER: That's
a really tough question.

00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:46.070
Because right now, VR
is a brand new media.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.730
If you come from the film,
television perspective,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.310
that's a very, very
well-known vocabulary.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.530
So if you go to film school
anywhere in the world,

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.790
they're going to talk about hard
cuts, soft cuts, pans, zooms,

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.510
all these types of things that
is the language of storytelling

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.430
in film and television.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.950
And once you get to VR, it's
all thrown out the window.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.120
You're no longer on a set.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.000
You no longer have this window
that you're looking through.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.670
You are now in the
experience, and there's stuff

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.960
that can happen all around.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.110
So a lot of that
stuff is all new.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.200
So it's really
hard to say there's

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.090
a well-defined process for
determining whether it works

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.400
or it doesn't, because
it's all brand new.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.049
And so that's part
of the excitement,

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.206
but also the challenge of
working in this medium.

00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:37.039
DAN ATKINS: Totally.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.955
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Getting
it in people's hands

00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:41.890
as quickly as possible has
really been our biggest thing.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.530
And it's hard.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.597
I mean, you are dealing with
so many different problems

00:08:45.597 --> 00:08:47.930
and things you're trying to
overcome during development,

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.096
and you don't often have
time to throw it at people.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.250
But the sooner you can get
it into somebody's hands

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.710
and really find out what's
working and what's not.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.170
Everybody always wants to
develop their best practices

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.480
for everything,
but I think we're

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.384
not quite there yet for VR.

00:09:04.384 --> 00:09:06.800
There like there are certain
things here and there that we

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.650
have learned ourselves or
heard from other developers

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.309
or whatever that we can try
to avoid or specifically do

00:09:13.309 --> 00:09:14.600
because it makes things better.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.272
But I think those rules
are not hard and fast.

00:09:18.272 --> 00:09:19.730
They don't work in
every situation.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.399
Something that actually
feels good in one situation

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:23.690
might feel terrible in another.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.190
And so it's really just
about how other people react.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.229
And it's the same.

00:09:30.229 --> 00:09:32.270
No matter what you're
developing, whether it's VR

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.880
or not, you are
looking at this thing

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.310
that you're creating
for so many hours

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.670
that it's hard to have any
kind of perspective on it

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.917
until you see somebody
else react to it.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.250
JONATHAN FLESHER: And I would
say there's a lot of stuff

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.620
that when you come
out of the film

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.990
and television or the video
game industry that actually

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.290
is applicable.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.610
So we actually do
do storyboards,

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.070
even though those are
obviously 2D versus not

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.630
an immersive environment.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:04.040
There is a pacing and a
way to direct the scene,

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.600
even though it's immersive.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.180
And I'd say that the beauty of
what game engines like Unity

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.180
are doing right now--
they call it the real time

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.210
revolution-- is the
traditional animation process

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.790
was animating in Maya and
then going into RenderMan,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.070
and you'd have to wait
forever for this stuff

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.260
to be rendered out, and
then you'd look at it

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.610
and go, oh, that's not right.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.650
And then you go back,
and you have to redo it.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.190
Whereas our developers
can sit, just like

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.510
is normal in the video game
business, where you'd be like,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.010
what?

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:31.820
It's not normal?

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.720
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.221
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:35.136
JONATHAN FLESHER: They'd
put on their headset,

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:36.179
and they'd see it there.

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:37.720
Oh, I need to put
a cup on the table.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.845
Oh, I should have this
character come in from here.

00:10:39.845 --> 00:10:41.990
And they can go and make
those changes in real time

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.620
and see it right away.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.620
And so that rapid prototyping is
new for the animation industry

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.380
but I think very comfortable
for the video game industry.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.338
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Yeah.

00:10:52.338 --> 00:10:54.230
I think we spend a
lot of time doing

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.150
a lot of rapid
prototyping and game jams

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.850
and all that kind of stuff, just
to try ideas out really quickly

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.920
and throw them out.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.305
And actually, storyboarding
is one of the things

00:11:03.305 --> 00:11:06.389
that we had a hard time
with at first, too.

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:08.180
Just figuring out how
to lay out the space,

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.691
I remember our artists,
I was like, hey,

00:11:10.691 --> 00:11:12.440
we need like a storyboard
for this moment.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.989
Here are the beats.

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:15.780
Figure out what you
want this to look like.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.470
And he's drawing everything
in these tiny squares

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.540
and shots and camera angles,
and I'm like, uh, no.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.230
I basically had to go back in
and redraw the frames for him,

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.939
but very lightly.

00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:29.188
And I was like, you know what?

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.530
Feel free to draw outside this.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.652
Think about how this
whole space feels.

00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:34.110
And that really
helped at the time,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.130
and now, seeing things
like Google Blocks

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.447
and Unity is starting to do some
of their real time VR editing

00:11:41.447 --> 00:11:42.530
tools and stuff like that.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.572
Do you guys use any of
that for laying stuff out?

00:11:44.572 --> 00:11:45.529
JONATHAN FLESHER: Yeah.

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:46.910
We've used both
Unreal and Unity,

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.970
and we're currently building
our current two pieces on Unity,

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.891
and so we use their
timeline feature heavily.

00:11:52.891 --> 00:11:54.140
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Yeah, I bet.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.670
JONATHAN FLESHER: And there's
a lot of really interesting

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.807
things that they're
disrupting again

00:11:57.807 --> 00:11:59.390
in the traditional
animation industry,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.710
but it's quite
comfortable for games.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.740
NIC VASCONCELLOS: It's crazy.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.050
I really want to get my hands
more on actually editing

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.770
scenes in VR.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.720
Because actually, one
of the hardest things

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.210
is starting a new level
and really understanding

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.130
what the scale of
that place feels

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.900
like compared to yourself.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.760
We do a lot of
scaling up and down

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.289
of the character to do the
toy box effect like you

00:12:22.289 --> 00:12:23.080
were talking about.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.280
So we don't always--

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.939
it's very hard to imagine
until you're actually in it

00:12:27.939 --> 00:12:29.480
what the scale of
that thing will be.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.470
JONATHAN FLESHER:
Storyboarding, there

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.330
are companies out
there developing tools,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.050
and people have tools internally
to do storyboarding in VR,

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.200
and that's some of the
rapid prototyping tools

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.020
that are being developed and
used out there right now.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.160
Really helps.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.327
DAN ATKINS: So we have these
rapid prototyping tools

00:12:45.327 --> 00:12:46.701
that allow us to
visualize things

00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:48.780
far more quickly and
experiment far more quickly,

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.700
which is clearly a benefit
to animation and games.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.290
As you guys have been going
through this rapid prototyping

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.030
phase, and you're
actually moving

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.929
from that prototyping phase
into building your products,

00:12:58.929 --> 00:13:00.470
what are some of
the biggest mistakes

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.840
you've made trying to author
content in this new medium?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.420
Obviously, there is
the sending people

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.610
to the couch to be
sick for a while

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.440
when things don't go super well.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.665
But what are some others?

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:13.040
JONATHAN FLESHER:
I'd say for us,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.670
it's being heavy-handed
with the users.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.530
It's pretty
interesting, because you

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:23.360
have to prepare for everything
from an experienced VR

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.870
user, which there are shockingly
few out there right now,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.910
just given the penetration
of the platform,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.030
to complete newbies.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.190
And so you'll find people who
will jump in the experience,

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.550
and they'll just start
staring off into the distance,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.830
or they won't even
move their head.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.336
Move your head.

00:13:41.336 --> 00:13:43.970
They're like, whoa!

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.500
And you have to
plan for all those,

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.610
but I think a core learning
is that people, just

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.000
like in every other
media, they don't really

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.370
like to be forced
what to do, so you

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.460
have to entice them
to do the things

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.120
that you want so that they can
experience the story as it was

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.880
meant to be told, in our case.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.120
So heavy-handed things like
forcing them into a position,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.460
or doing something,
or not allowing

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.870
them to interact with something,
has been less well-received

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.249
versus others.

00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:17.540
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Audio's a
huge thing for that, right?

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.456
JONATHAN FLESHER: Yes.

00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:20.840
Audio characters.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.780
We often say one of the
things you can do in VR

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.310
is think like a magician.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.080
If you want the
audience to look at you,

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.409
you look at the audience.

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:30.200
If you want them to
look at something else,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.170
you look at that.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:32.900
That happens.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.510
And if you have big,
expressive characters,

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.330
that's fairly easy to achieve.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.250
And then obviously, audio cues.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.930
It's a little challenging
with the audio

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.910
because not everything works
that well in spatialized audio.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.197
Not everybody has
high-tech headsets.

00:14:47.197 --> 00:14:49.780
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Especially if
you're on mobile or something,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.330
right?

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:50.690
JONATHAN FLESHER: Uh-huh.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.040
So you've got to be
able to span that gap.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.420
And I think just like
in games, it often

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.660
helps to think of the
lowest common denominator

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.930
and build up from there.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.090
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Yeah.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.960
I think actually, maybe--

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.460
you would probably
hate me for this.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.350
But one of the things that we
have traditionally had problems

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.940
with in the past is actually our
character interaction moments.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:21.050
We've definitely spent a lot of
time prototyping interactions

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.150
and gameplay mechanics.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:26.379
And we still very much value
characters and narrative

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:27.920
and all that kind
of stuff, but we do

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.772
come from a gaming background.

00:15:30.772 --> 00:15:33.230
And so we definitely have had
times in some of our products

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.100
where we don't prototype our
character interactions early

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.880
enough.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.210
And some of them end up working,
and it's great, and yeah.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.950
But we've definitely
had moments where

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.940
we build out this whole
character interaction.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.490
In my head, I'm like,
this is going to be great.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.531
It's going to be awesome.

00:15:47.531 --> 00:15:50.185
And then it totally flops.

00:15:50.185 --> 00:15:52.010
And now you're
like, well dang, I

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.900
have to restructure
my whole story.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.755
That was a pivotal moment.

00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:57.380
JONATHAN FLESHER:
Welcome to our world.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:57.780
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Yeah.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.580
[LAUGHS]

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.510
JONATHAN FLESHER: And
the piece that we're just

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.060
releasing this holiday
is you actually follow

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.030
the two aliens that were in the
first piece, "Invasion!", who

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.980
came down and invaded
Earth, and were repelled

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.880
by a cute little bunny, Chloe.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.090
You follow them to their
ship in outer space.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.940
And we found when we first
put people out there--

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.460
you play, actually, a
helper robot on the ship.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.534
And we gave you robotic hands.

00:16:18.534 --> 00:16:20.450
And people just start
running around the ship,

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.414
jamming their hands
into various places,

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.830
thinking they were R2-D2, and
they were going to take over

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.330
control of the ship,
there was going

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.280
to be some Easter egg somewhere,
and completely missing

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.305
the narrative.

00:16:31.305 --> 00:16:35.030
Or taking the ball that you
could play fetch with a dog

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.360
and like hitting things,
trying to beat the characters.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.012
It's a very, very interesting
thing to run through.

00:16:41.012 --> 00:16:42.470
DAN ATKINS: Yeah,
you give somebody

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.386
a ball to play fetch
with a dog, and then they

00:16:44.386 --> 00:16:46.685
go try to murder
everything with the ball.

00:16:46.685 --> 00:16:48.060
One of the things
that strikes me

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.476
as you guys are
talking about this

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:52.400
is how some of the most profound
moments in your products,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.220
at least for me, have been
some of the most simple

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.150
in some ways.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.850
Like "Invasion!" is always one
of the first VR experiences

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.350
I show somebody,
and it's largely

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.350
because you have that moment
where Chloe, the bunny,

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.750
comes running right up
to you and slides right

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.410
into your body.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.609
And you really have this
moment of eye contact,

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.239
which is incredibly powerful.

00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:11.780
And it's the first
medium I can think

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.170
of where you have eye contact.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.121
And then similarly,
with "Along Together,"

00:17:16.121 --> 00:17:18.079
the first real interaction
you have in the game

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.640
is just waving to
another character,

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.190
and how endearing that is
and how much it connects you

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.429
to those characters.

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:25.220
Have you guys noticed
a theme of simplicity

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.765
in these interactions
that feels important?

00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:29.390
Are you noticing that
users are growing

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.000
into more complex interactions
as they continue to progress

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.890
through more VR content?

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.760
NIC VASCONCELLOS:
I think there's

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.980
something about
simple interactions

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.480
that like immediately
connect with people.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.760
It doesn't matter--

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.200
I don't think anybody is
sitting there going, oh, man.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.300
I'm like bored of waving.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.887
Actually, it might
get to that point,

00:17:49.887 --> 00:17:50.970
now that I think about it.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.250
If we have too many moments
of you wave to this character,

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:53.840
it's like, OK.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.450
Yeah.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.370
I've done this in VR
before, that's fine.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.714
But I think so far it's been
not so much about just trying

00:18:06.714 --> 00:18:09.380
to be like, oh, this is a simple
interaction that would be cool.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.042
It's just what
sells that moment.

00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:14.750
And we're not really
necessarily worrying

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.540
about how complex it should be.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.690
I mean, especially for the
very beginning of a sequence.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:21.990
A character looks at you.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.030
You wave at them.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.280
Really pulling somebody
into that experience.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:31.100
You have to do something
that is minimally--

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.921
or it's easy to understand
and as impactful as possible.

00:18:35.921 --> 00:18:37.920
I feel like I'm talking
in circles a little bit,

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.780
but I think that
is really key to--

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.380
especially as we are getting
mostly new users into VR,

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.990
we don't really make
games assuming that people

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.630
have played VR before.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.380
We're still assuming this
might be the first time

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.830
somebody is ever
picking this up,

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.102
so how do we make it as easy
to get into as possible?

00:18:59.102 --> 00:19:00.060
DAN ATKINS: Absolutely.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.060
JONATHAN FLESHER: I don't
think it's necessarily

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.620
a simplistic thing.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.440
The kind of magic of
Chloe coming up to you

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.920
and bouncing around, it's
amazing to watch people.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.230
You'll see people start
hopping around on the floor,

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.610
trying to jump back and forth.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.470
And they're like, oh my god.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.750
The AI behind that is amazing.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.530
She's reacting to me
and playing with me.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.071
I'm like, no.

00:19:20.071 --> 00:19:22.760
That's actually just a
simple hop back and forth.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.550
There was eye tracking in
there, which helped a lot.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:29.330
But the key piece being
that it's more that it feels

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.350
like real life.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.320
And to dig deeper
on that, it is not

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.120
that it's necessarily
photorealistic,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.770
because you are actually a
bunny, and that's a bunny,

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.740
and it's clearly not real life.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.770
But it's that it feels
natural in terms of the way

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.980
that you actually interact
in your day-to-day life.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.730
And that's what
you're striving for.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.521
And that could be a
simplistic interaction.

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:50.470
It could be complex.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.220
Obviously, we're going
to probably stumble

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.219
across the more simplistic
ones, because they're

00:19:54.219 --> 00:19:56.390
going to be easier for us
to figure out right now.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.600
But as the medium grows
and gets better over time,

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.940
those will obviously
become more complex.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.932
But it's that key of
replicating the feel of life.

00:20:04.932 --> 00:20:05.890
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Yeah.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:10.217
And I think thinking about the
interactions by themselves,

00:20:10.217 --> 00:20:11.300
they might be very simple.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.235
But I think they can
be emotionally complex.

00:20:14.235 --> 00:20:15.860
JONATHAN FLESHER:
That's a great point.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.818
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Yeah.

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:18.392
And that is what
really feels good.

00:20:18.392 --> 00:20:19.100
DAN ATKINS: Yeah.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.242
That makes total sense.

00:20:20.242 --> 00:20:22.700
It's funny you mention that,
because I think the reaction I

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.200
see from a lot of
people, you can always

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.700
tell when the bunny
is about to hit,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.190
because they go [SOUND OF ALARM]
you have that moment.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.315
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Actually,
that's kind of fun too,

00:20:30.315 --> 00:20:32.780
intentionally doing things that
are slightly uncomfortable.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.071
Not in a physical way, but
just in a way that will make

00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:35.750
you go, oh.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.209
It really wakes you
up and gets you going.

00:20:38.209 --> 00:20:39.500
That's really fun to play with.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.670
DAN ATKINS: Very cool.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.160
So you both have, at
this point, shipped

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.130
multiple products on
Daydream, on Rift,

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.802
on all sorts of platforms.

00:20:48.802 --> 00:20:50.510
What have you learned
from those releases

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.594
that you think you'll apply
to your next products?

00:20:52.594 --> 00:20:54.135
What are the biggest
takeaways you've

00:20:54.135 --> 00:20:55.490
gotten from these experiences?

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.250
JONATHAN FLESHER: I don't
know if I have takeaways.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.010
Right now, it's a
very challenging time

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:05.730
as a developer.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.370
Because if I'm in
the West-- forget

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.560
China right now--
but in the West,

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.680
there's arguably six
platforms to port to.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.260
And if you're talking about
a video company that's

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.840
on consoles or
mobile devices, it's

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.960
Sony and Microsoft
or Apple and Google.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.780
It's a much more
limited universe.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.580
And so that's challenging.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.510
I hope that goes away
and narrows down soon.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.240
But the thing that we're
super excited about

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.260
is actually taking
the best of Daydream,

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.200
which is the portability,
the anywhere,

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.160
and expanding that power into
these standalone headsets.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.410
You guys are
launching one shortly.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.390
And being able to bring
more and more rendering

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.370
power into those
standalone headsets,

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.560
inside out tracking
with Tango, that

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.530
solves a whole host of
consumer adoption problems.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.380
Like, it's a pain in the
butt to put boxes up there

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.100
and run through that stuff.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.240
So you guys are really
pushing into the area that we

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.430
want to go, which is
we think it's mobile.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.680
We think it has
inside out tracking,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.930
has AR pieces to
be layered into it,

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:15.272
and that's the stuff that we're
waiting for and excited about.

00:22:15.272 --> 00:22:17.730
NIC VASCONCELLOS: I think for
us, the biggest thing that we

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.770
want to continue doing is
character interaction, which

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.020
you guys love too, right?

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.062
It's fun.

00:22:28.062 --> 00:22:30.270
You automatically get a lot
of personality out of it.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:34.360
You get a more connected feeling
with that world that you're in.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.530
And we've done that, and
every one of our games

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.830
so far has been
character-driven.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.940
And it's hard to do in terms
of costs and stuff like that.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.440
I think a lot of
people might shy away

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.049
from some of that
sometimes, or just--

00:22:53.049 --> 00:22:53.590
I don't know.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.680
I mean, obviously there are
a million different types

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.820
of games, and everybody should
play all those different kinds,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.660
but we like to focus on those
character moments and stuff.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.500
And we're only three
people, but our first--

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.830
it's me and my business partner,
and our first and only hire

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.310
so far has been a full-time
animator, which I think

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.590
a lot of people are like why?

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.340
JONATHAN FLESHER: No,
that's really smart.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:16.980
DAN ATKINS: Makes total sense.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.450
JONATHAN FLESHER: Because
I've got to tell you,

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.533
characters are core to
what we do as storytellers.

00:23:20.533 --> 00:23:22.950
And the simple
idea is that if you

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.020
don't care about the
characters, you don't really

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.280
care about the story.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.012
And if you're developing
story-driven games,

00:23:30.012 --> 00:23:32.470
I think you fundamentally have
to start in that same place,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.670
is that the characters are
critical to that development

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.700
of that story.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.840
NIC VASCONCELLOS: I think
I found too-- or at least

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.050
this is the feeling
that I get when

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.520
I play character-driven
stuff, is

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.140
that having other characters
around very quickly

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.350
helps ground me in that world
and make me feel like I'm

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.207
a part of that story as well.

00:23:51.207 --> 00:23:53.540
JONATHAN FLESHER: And again,
you don't have to be human.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.456
You don't have to be--

00:23:54.456 --> 00:23:56.090
it doesn't have to
be photorealistic.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.090
NIC VASCONCELLOS: Right.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:57.875
Not at all.

00:23:57.875 --> 00:23:59.250
JONATHAN FLESHER:
I think for us,

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.500
the way we like to describe
that, that framework,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.260
because when I was in
video games, I used to say,

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.530
video games were just
interactive animation.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.720
And animation was just a
non-interactive video game.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.320
And I've since learned
that I'm not that smart,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.820
and the world's far
more complex than that.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.150
The way we talk
about it at Baobab

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.070
is we want the empathy
of the film, the agency

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.870
of video games, because you
have that interactive medium,

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.060
and the motivations
of real life.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.120
And that comes together,
when you get it right,

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.560
in a magical way.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.642
That's our goal of our company.

00:24:34.642 --> 00:24:35.600
DAN ATKINS: Absolutely.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.880
So we're running a
little low on time.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.640
Any advice you have for
folks who are thinking

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.350
about starting up on Daydream?

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:49.320
Ways to get started, good tools
of the trade, good tricks.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.580
NIC VASCONCELLOS: I think from
the design side of it at least,

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.350
we had--

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.560
just understanding the
capabilities of the controller

00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.500
is super important.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.860
I think early on in development
of "Along Together," we

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.160
were trying to do a lot of
stuff with the gyroscope

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.820
and the accelerometer, and it
had all these features that we

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.505
were trying to do a
bunch of stuff with.

00:25:09.505 --> 00:25:11.130
I'm not saying this
is always the case,

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.080
but for us, really
scaling back and saying,

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.770
OK, what is the
simplest way for people

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.920
to interact with this controller
and interact with the world?

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.650
Kind of like you
were saying earlier,

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.430
really figuring out the
simple interactions that

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.360
have a big impact.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.284
And we felt like doing too much
with the controller in general,

00:25:30.284 --> 00:25:32.700
even though there are all these
things you can do with it,

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.560
really increased the
learning curve quite a lot.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.320
So I think really getting
your controls streamlined,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.100
if you're doing a game, or even
just anything with interaction,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.170
I think that's a big place
to start for Daydream.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.319
DAN ATKINS: Awesome.

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:52.110
JONATHAN FLESHER: Yeah,
I'd say, obviously,

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.940
Unity makes it a
much easier prospect

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.210
to get into mobile devices.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.150
Obviously, you should be
working in a game engine.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.670
I do think that your
point around controllers

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.370
is really well said.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.950
There was an interesting stat
that Oculus released last week

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.260
at Oculus Connect
around the pieces that

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.970
had effective use of the
controller, which theirs

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.140
is a 3-DOF controller
as well, dramatically

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.580
increased engagement and
length of viewer time.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.200
So I'd say definitely wrap
in a controller [? stream. ?]

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.450
And I'd say, finally, don't
try to do too much too fast.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.740
Bite-sized experiments.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.620
See how it goes and learn.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.050
That's probably the fastest
way to get something good out

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:37.047
there.

00:26:37.047 --> 00:26:37.880
DAN ATKINS: Awesome.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.492
Well, I want to thank you
both for being here today.

00:26:40.492 --> 00:26:42.950
I'm really looking forward to
seeing what you guys do next,

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.140
in terms of your next
products, and thank you

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:50.340
for giving us a quick education
on VR and VR storytelling.
