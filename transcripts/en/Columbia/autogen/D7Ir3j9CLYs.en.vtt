00:53:12.799 --> 00:53:15.829
about something here which is
extraordinarily time-sensitive but also

00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839
extraordinarily time-sensitive but also
 

00:53:15.839 --> 00:53:20.769
extraordinarily time-sensitive but also
extraordinarily complex we're aiming to

00:53:20.769 --> 00:53:20.779
extraordinarily complex we're aiming to
 

00:53:20.779 --> 00:53:25.160
extraordinarily complex we're aiming to
address a quality of life issue that

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:25.170
address a quality of life issue that
 

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:28.699
address a quality of life issue that
will be of importance for well over half

00:53:28.699 --> 00:53:28.709
will be of importance for well over half
 

00:53:28.709 --> 00:53:32.089
will be of importance for well over half
the planet very soon which is the well

00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099
the planet very soon which is the well
 

00:53:32.099 --> 00:53:33.709

dressing a environmental security issue

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:39.800
dressing a environmental security issue
 

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.540
dressing a environmental security issue
of profound significance and I think

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:43.550
of profound significance and I think
 

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:46.600
of profound significance and I think
we're also addressing indirectly a

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:46.610
we're also addressing indirectly a
 

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:49.660
we're also addressing indirectly a
national security and a global security

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:49.670
national security and a global security
 

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:52.270
national security and a global security
issue and that is how does a world

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:52.280
issue and that is how does a world
 

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.820
issue and that is how does a world
economy that's already pressing very

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:54.830
economy that's already pressing very
 

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:57.640
economy that's already pressing very
hard against the natural resource base

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:57.650
hard against the natural resource base
 

00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:00.520
hard against the natural resource base
and in my view has already lifted the

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:00.530
and in my view has already lifted the
 

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:04.510
and in my view has already lifted the
real price of oil by a factor of roughly

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:04.520
real price of oil by a factor of roughly
 

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.600
real price of oil by a factor of roughly
three during the past ten years and I

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:07.610
three during the past ten years and I
 

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:09.370
three during the past ten years and I
think it's likely to stay high and

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:09.380
think it's likely to stay high and
 

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.950
think it's likely to stay high and
continue to rise how do we face these

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960
continue to rise how do we face these
 

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.290
continue to rise how do we face these
challenges there's also a national

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:14.300
challenges there's also a national
 

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.630
challenges there's also a national
technological challenge which is the

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640
technological challenge which is the
 

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.840
technological challenge which is the
very real point that were in some crisis

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:21.850
very real point that were in some crisis
 

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:28.000

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:59.350
economy in my view is in crisis not just
a financial crisis but a technological

00:54:59.350 --> 00:54:59.360
a financial crisis but a technological
 

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.750

we're launching an entirely new dynamic

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:26.670
we're launching an entirely new dynamic
 

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:27.920
we're launching an entirely new dynamic
we have to give it a little bit time

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:27.930
we have to give it a little bit time
 

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.570
we have to give it a little bit time
yeah we've got to stick with this way

01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:29.580
yeah we've got to stick with this way
 

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:32.150
yeah we've got to stick with this way

day kind of hard to imagine August right

01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:34.680
day kind of hard to imagine August right
 

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.190
day kind of hard to imagine August right
now but what about that hot August day

01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:37.200
now but what about that hot August day
 

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.440
now but what about that hot August day
at three o'clock in the afternoon what

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:39.450
at three o'clock in the afternoon what
 

01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:41.210
at three o'clock in the afternoon what
do we need to do to make sure that our

01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:41.220
do we need to do to make sure that our
 

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.980
do we need to do to make sure that our
grid is stable enough at that point to

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:42.990
grid is stable enough at that point to
 

01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:45.560
grid is stable enough at that point to
support the additional energy we will

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:45.570
support the additional energy we will
 

01:21:45.570 --> 01:21:48.010
support the additional energy we will
need for electric vehicles well at those

01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:48.020
need for electric vehicles well at those
 

01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.200
need for electric vehicles well at those
relatively few hours of the year days of

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:51.210
relatively few hours of the year days of
 

01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:54.070
relatively few hours of the year days of
the year right I think that there are

01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080
the year right I think that there are
 

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.050
the year right I think that there are
technologies we just heard about one

01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060
technologies we just heard about one
 

01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:01.430
technologies we just heard about one
that onstar is developing so I'm

01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440
that onstar is developing so I'm
 

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.590
that onstar is developing so I'm
optimistic that those hurdles are very

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600
optimistic that those hurdles are very
 

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.730
optimistic that those hurdles are very
solvable and the integration of

01:22:06.730 --> 01:22:06.740
solvable and the integration of
 

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:10.250
solvable and the integration of
information with energy as the smart

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260
information with energy as the smart
 

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.010
information with energy as the smart
grid is developed will alleviate that

01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:13.020
grid is developed will alleviate that
 

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:16.040
grid is developed will alleviate that
problem so I don't see that as a

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:16.050
problem so I don't see that as a
 

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:18.110
problem so I don't see that as a
showstopper that kind of definitely not

01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120
showstopper that kind of definitely not
 

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.850
showstopper that kind of definitely not
so we're ready now we're ready now

01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860
so we're ready now we're ready now
 

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.100
so we're ready now we're ready now
especially in the early years we just

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:22.110
especially in the early years we just
 

01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:25.570
especially in the early years we just
were hearing about the the cycles of

01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:25.580
were hearing about the the cycles of
 

01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.710
were hearing about the the cycles of
introduction of products right that's

01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:27.720
introduction of products right that's
 

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.880
introduction of products right that's
going to take some time and uh that that

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:30.890
going to take some time and uh that that
 

01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:33.020
going to take some time and uh that that
so you're saying demand additional

01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:33.030
so you're saying demand additional
 

01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:34.850
so you're saying demand additional
demand will ramp up slowly ramp up slow

right and that that learning experience

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480
right and that that learning experience
 

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.260

seen the introduction of new
technologies before right there's the

01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:54.700
technologies before right there's the
 

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:57.490
technologies before right there's the
introduction of computer technology and

01:22:57.490 --> 01:22:57.500
introduction of computer technology and
 

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.530
introduction of computer technology and
the implications is a Don on energy

01:22:59.530 --> 01:22:59.540
the implications is a Don on energy
 

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.590

charging stations and if so who's going

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:29.450
charging stations and if so who's going
 

01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:31.030

to be in charge of building them and

01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040
to be in charge of building them and
 

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:34.440
to be in charge of building them and
maintaining them uh yes I think that we

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:34.450
maintaining them uh yes I think that we
 

01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:39.420
maintaining them uh yes I think that we
buy large do need charging stations and

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:39.430
buy large do need charging stations and

not only the vehicle but what happens
 

01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:28.410
not only the vehicle but what happens
and not just the grid but how the energy

01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:28.420
and not just the grid but how the energy
 

01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:31.260
and not just the grid but how the energy
is produced what that means for air

01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:31.270

was talking about how the car is
actually drive and what happens to what

01:28:39.959 --> 01:28:39.969
actually drive and what happens to what
 

01:28:39.969 --> 01:28:42.840

happens to the traffic flow so from a

happens to the traffic flow so from a
 

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:44.790
happens to the traffic flow so from a
public health point of view there are

01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800
public health point of view there are
 

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.910
public health point of view there are
many aspects of this there's the energy

01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920
many aspects of this there's the energy
 

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.930
many aspects of this there's the energy
aspects there's the traffic safety

01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:50.940
aspects there's the traffic safety
 

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:55.860
aspects there's the traffic safety
aspects and so forth I think one of the

out a question to all of you and then

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:28.530
out a question to all of you and then
 

01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:30.230
out a question to all of you and then
ask for some questions from the audience

or in the taxi fleet here how what steps
need to happen for that to move forward

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:44.010
need to happen for that to move forward
 

01:40:44.010 --> 01:40:46.760

on electric transportation more than
many cities through the subway but what

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:50.490
many cities through the subway but what
 

01:40:50.490 --> 01:40:52.510
many cities through the subway but what
has that what else has to happen here

01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:52.520

it into a hydrogen and in fact the

01:48:56.890 --> 01:48:56.900
it into a hydrogen and in fact the
 

01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:58.810
it into a hydrogen and in fact the
plug-in and hydrogen option are much

01:48:58.810 --> 01:48:58.820
plug-in and hydrogen option are much
 

01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:00.910
plug-in and hydrogen option are much
more attractive than the internal

01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:00.920
more attractive than the internal
 

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:02.950
more attractive than the internal
combustion engine option there is an

01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960

application of compressed natural gas I

01:49:05.049 --> 01:49:05.059
application of compressed natural gas I
 

01:49:05.059 --> 01:49:06.009
application of compressed natural gas I
think that's going to make a lot of

01:49:06.009 --> 01:49:06.019
think that's going to make a lot of
 

01:49:06.019 --> 01:49:08.319
think that's going to make a lot of
sense and that's with them class 8

01:49:08.319 --> 01:49:08.329
sense and that's with them class 8
 

01:49:08.329 --> 01:49:11.620
sense and that's with them class 8

things because the diesel engine doesn't

01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:13.880
things because the diesel engine doesn't
 

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.520
things because the diesel engine doesn't
have a lot of good alternatives so I

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:15.530
have a lot of good alternatives so I
 

01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:17.200
have a lot of good alternatives so I
think compressed natural gas can play

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:17.210
think compressed natural gas can play
 

01:49:17.210 --> 01:49:19.120
