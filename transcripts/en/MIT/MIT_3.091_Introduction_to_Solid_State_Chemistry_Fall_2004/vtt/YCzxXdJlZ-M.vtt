00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:39.133
One announcement,
there will be a weekly quiz on

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Tuesday based on homework nine,
which will cover glasses and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
chemical kinetics.
Speaking of which,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that's something we started talking
about last day,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I found this cute quote,
that kinetics is nature's way of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
making sure that everything doesn't
happen all at once.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And, we looked at the rate laws,
the most general rate law is shown

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
here, the rate of consumption of a
particular reactant goes has some

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
function of its instant
concentration raised to the power,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:01:00.580
, wnhich is the order of reaction.
The specific chemical rate constant,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.740
k, is the proportionality. And, k
can be influenced by temperature

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.910
through this Arrhenius type
relationship, which compares the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.080
exponential of the activation energy
with the available thermal energy.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.240
And, we saw that we can integrate
that rate equation,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.410
and put the data to the test.
If we have a first-order reaction,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.850
we should get a semi-log dependence.
And, I think I've got that shown

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.570
here. Here's the data that I showed
you last day. This is just a normal

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.280
decrease in concentration with time,
typical attenuation curve. If we

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.990
put it to the first-order test,
according to this relationship we

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.710
should get a straight line with a
slope of minus k.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.420
And, we saw that in the special
case of first-order actions,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.140
it makes sense sometimes to talk
about half-life in particular with

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.780
radioactive decay.
We also looked at second-order

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.350
reactions, which have a slightly
different functional dependence

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.920
shown here. And,
then we went back and looked at the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.490
underlying physical chemistry of the
activation energy.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.070
And, we came up with this model,
which we presented in terms of

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.640
mechanical analog.
And, we saw that we could look at

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.210
the decrease in chemical potential
as not being monotonic but as

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.910
requiring some initial activation.
And so, we have here to energy state

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.740
of the reactants at one value,
the energy state of the products at

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.580
a lower value,
and the difference between those

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.410
values is the driving force for the
reaction, the delta E of the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.240
reaction. But,
in order to get from the reactant

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.070
state to the product state,
we first have to activate. And

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.910
physically, there are a number of
things that are going on,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.740
and at the end of the lecture I'll
show you an example with reference

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.580
to an automobile exhaust catalyst,
what is happening in terms of

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.410
forming some kind of activated
complex, which allows the reactants

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.240
to reorganize themselves so that
they can recognize that there is an

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.080
energy to be gained by their
reacting with one another,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.370
and how a catalyst facilitates this.
And specifically,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.120
we see that there is a tiny,
tiny fraction of the population

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.870
distribution that has enough energy
to surmount the activation barrier

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.620
and the inhibitor and the catalyst
respectively either impede the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.370
reaction by raising the effective
activation energy,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.120
thereby lopping off an even greater
amount of the distribution,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.870
or facilitate the reaction by
lowering the activation energy,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.620
thereby making a greater fraction of
the thermal distribution available

00:03:41.620 --> 00:04:01.406
for participation in the reaction.
And, I think that's where we left it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.500
last day. And so,
today what I'd like to do is to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.500
continue the whole discussion of
what is broadly termed

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.300
rate phenomena.
So, chemical kinetics is part of a

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.900
unit here in 3.
91 that I'm going to call rate

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.500
processes. And,
rate processes are basically

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.100
processes that involve rate of
change with respect to time.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.700
And, so one of course is chemical
kinetics. And we just spent some

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:24.330
time looking at chemical kinetics.
But, there's another area that we

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.990
want to touch upon,
and it's an area called transport

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.660
phenomena. And,
there's a reason for talking about

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.330
this. When we think about how we're
going to process materials in order

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.990
to achieve solids with desired
properties, we have to think about

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.660
the two basics that are required to
sustain a reaction.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.120
And those are matter and energy.
So, let's look at what's involved in

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.370
each of these,
matter and energy.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.620
We have to furnish these to the
reaction. And so,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.870
if we're going to think about energy
in terms of transport phenomena,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.120
that gets us into heat transfer.
But, we're not going to discuss heat

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.370
transfer in 3.
91. I can't do everything.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.620
Instead, what we're going to do is
we're going to look at something

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.870
that's representative of transport
phenomena and we're going to look at

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:40.940
mass transport.
And mathematically there are many

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
parallels between heat transfer and
mass transport.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
When we talk about mass transport,
if we're trying to drive a reaction,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
we have to do two things. We had to
deliver reactants to the site,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and we have to remove products from
the site. If we don't do both,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the reaction could either starve or
choke. And, we saw a good example

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
of that early in the semester when
we talked about the Hindenburg.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The Hindenburg was a good example
of a reaction that had a huge

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:57.920
driving force of hydrogen explosion.
But, the Hindenburg did not explode

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.780
because we had 7,
00,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.640
And, in order for that to react
explosively, we would have had to

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.490
deliver 7,000,
00 cubic feet of oxygen

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.350
instantaneously.
And we couldn't do that.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.210
We could not do that, so because
the reaction was starved thanks to a

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.070
transport phenomena problem,
instead of an explosion, what we got

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.750
was a burn.
And, as a result,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.250
two thirds of the occupants of the
vessel were able to walk off it.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.750
And, not so many perished as
otherwise would have.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.250
So, transport phenomena,
clearly important. And, the

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.750
dominant form of mass transport in
solids is diffusion.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.250
So, when we're talking about mass
transport in solids,

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.750
we have to talk about diffusion.
And that's why we're going to do it.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.250
So, let's think of an example.
Suppose I've got this wafer of

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.810
silicon.
And we've talked about doping.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.430
We've talked about doping. Suppose
I want to render it p type.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.060
So, what I want to do is I want to
infuse this with a subvalent dopant

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.680
such as boron.
So, how do we do that?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.300
Do we smear this with boron and
just wait? What's the process?

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.930
Well, let's take a look more
closely. What we can do is we can

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.560
take our wafer,
and I'm going to exaggerate the

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.180
dimensions. So,
it's going to look more like a

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.220
hockey puck than a silicon wafer.
So, here's the silicon,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.660
and we're going to put this into a
furnace. And,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.110
we want to get boron into the wafer.
And, we are not going to do this by

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.550
melting. We're going to do this
while the wafer is the solid state.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.990
That's why we're over here talking
about diffusion.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.440
It's a solid-state process.
So, what we do is pass a form of

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.880
boron over the wafer as the gas
diborane. And,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.330
the diborane passes over,
and on contact with the silicon is

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.770
decomposes to form boron,
which goes into the silicon,

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.840
plus hydrogen.
And that hydrogen,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.530
of course, remains in the gas phase.
And, we could even write a rate

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.230
constant because this is a chemical
reaction. This is the composition

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.920
of diborane into hydrogen and boron,
and we could even take a guess that

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.610
the rate of this,
I haven't measured it,

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.300
but the rate would go as some
relationship involving the

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:39.400
concentration of diborane
to some power, n.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:27.710
So, we've seen that,
but now I want to do is I want to

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.420
ask, what is the process by which
boron enters the silicon?

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.140
So, now I want to zoom in here to
the near surface.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.850
And here's the free surface of
silicon. This is the surface.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.570
This is inside the wafer. And,
I've got boron that's decomposing

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.280
and dissolving.
Remember, it goes up

00:08:46.280 --> 00:09:05.360
substitutionally, sitting
on silicon sites.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:55.450
So, now I'm asking,
how does the boron enter the silicon?

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:00.900
What are the kinetics of the
ingress of boron?

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.360
So, that's what we want to ask:
rate of ingress of boron through

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.810
silicon. That's what we want to
look at. And,

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:17.270
this is not some kind of a
cooperative process because

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:22.900
the silicon is solid.
So, individual atoms have to move

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.720
step by step through because it's a
substitutional solution that's

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.540
forming here. So,
we can take a guess at it.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:40.360
If I now make this the coordinate
system, call the free surface x

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.180
equals zero, and this is moving down
into greater depth.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:10:03.693
I can make a plot of ingress of
boron into silicon.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So, this is x which is depth from
surface. This is the free surface

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
at x equals zero.
And, I'm going to fix the

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
concentration of diborane in the
reactor. And so,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
the concentration of boron at the
surface will be fixed.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
As long as I keep the concentration
of diborane fixed,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
concentration of boron at the
surface will be fixed.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, what I'm going to do is plot
the concentration of boron in the

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
silicon as a function of
depth from the surface.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:28.130
And, we know deep inside the silicon,
there's no boron.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.260
So, here it should be zero.
We know at the surface it's

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.390
constant. The question is,
what is the shape of the curve?

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.530
Just as I showed you last day, we
talked about first order,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.660
second order. What it boils down to
is, what is the shape of the curve?

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.790
And, we know it's going to look
something like this.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.930
Doesn't that look a lot like the
attenuation curve for the loss of

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.330
matter in a chemical reaction?
It starts at some constant value and

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.990
trails off asymptotically.
So, really the question is,

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:06.660
what is the shape? And, how do we
answer that question?

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.330
We can't look at this and eyeball
it. Instead, what we do is we do a

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.990
new mapping. Map concentration into
some function of concentration.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.660
Map depth into some function of
depth such that I will

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.250
get a straight line.
And then I can,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.750
with the naked eye,
say, I've got it. I know what's

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.250
going on here.
And so, therefore,

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.750
the model that transformed c into f
of c, x into g of x,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:43.250
then underlies the whole
representation.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.750
And so, the mathematical
formulation of diffusion we owe to

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.660
someone by the name of Adolf Fick.
He was a physician.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.990
But he loved mathematics.
And, he did to diffusion what

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:03.330
Balmer did to spectroscopy.
Recall, Balmer studied the

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:08.660
measurements that were made by
Angstrom. And it was Balmer who fit

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.990
Angstrom's data to that equation
that ultimately we learned to be in

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:19.330
concert with the Rydberg Equation.
What Fick did: he looked at Thomas

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.580
Graham's.
Thomas Graham had published some

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.740
diffusion data for the rate of
ingress of some materials into

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.910
aqueous media.
And, Fick was the one who was able

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:40.080
to fit Thomas Graham's data and give
us a model. And,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.240
here is, let's jump through here.
This is the cover page. This is

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:50.410
the first page of the paper.
This was published in Annalen der

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:55.130
Physik und Chemie in Leipzig, 1855.
And, here we are on page 59,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:59.390
"On Diffusion" by Dr. Adolf Fick
from Zurich. And it starts off as

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.660
you've seen before.
There's a little bit of background.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.930
There is references to the
antecedent literature.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.190
And away we go. 1855: so,
what did he tell us in this

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.460
important paper?
Well, let's take a look at his

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.730
representation of what's going on in
this process. He was able to

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:40.726
quantify this and give us a measure
that has predictive capacity.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And what he said was that the rate
of ingress expressed by a term

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
called flux, flux measures the rate
of infusion. It's a mass flow rate.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So, clearly it must have some kind
of units of mass per unit time,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
so I'm going to use SI units,
kilograms per second,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
but diffusion is quantified on the
basis of unit cross sectional area.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:14:00.830
So it's a mass flow rate of species,
i, in, I'm going to make it in one

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:06.660
direction, in the x direction,
the way I've set things up in a

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:12.490
previous sketch.
So, it's kilograms per second on a

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:18.330
unit area a basis.
So, flux is mass flow rate per unit

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:24.160
area. So, the flux of species i,
what he observed is it's related to

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:40.920
the concentration gradient
in species i.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It is the concentration gradient
that dictates the rate of ingress.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Gradient in concentration of i in
the x direction.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Later on, you can generalize this
in three directions.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You can replace the derivative with
the del, and do it with three

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
dimensions simultaneously.
The constant of proportionality is

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
D, the diffusion coefficient
or diffusivity.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And, finally, there is a minus sign.
Why? Because species move from

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
high concentration to low
concentration.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So, if I look at the curve above,
I expect that since the

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
concentration is high at the free
surface, that the flux is moving

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
from left to right.
We would expect J sub i to move

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
from high concentration
to low concentration.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:28.150
But, look at the slope.
The slope here is negative.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.300
So, in order to have a positive
flux with a negative slope,

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.460
we fix it, no problem. Math is easy.
You just put a minus sign.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.610
So, that's the genesis of the minus
sign to make the coordinates come

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.760
out properly. And,
units, well, we know the units on

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.920
concentration.
Concentration must be in kilograms

00:15:48.920 --> 00:16:06.973
per cubic meter.
So, we've got that.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.600
D by dx, the dx, this x actually
calls for a unit.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.000
So, that's one over meter.
And, if I'm going to have kilograms

00:15:42.000 --> 00:16:06.400
per square meter per second on the
left, and these are the units of dc

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.800
by dx, then it follows that
diffusivity must have units of

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:30.066
length squared per time.
So, diffusivity is expressed in

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.600
meters squared per second,
concentration, kilograms per cubic

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.000
meter, the derivative one over m,
and the flux in the following units.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:29.380
But, there's more.
Fick, in this paper,

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.760
was so visionary. He said,
you know, this describes diffusion

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:40.150
of matter into matter.
But he says, this also bears a

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:45.530
resemblance, are you ready for this?
I said there are some parallels

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:50.920
between heat transfer and mass
transport. Fick recognized in his

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.300
paper that, you know,
this is similar to Fourier's first

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.410
law for heat conduction.
He said, look at the parallel.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:06.240
This is the rate. This is the heat
flux. Instead of a mass flux,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.080
this is heat flux. So, this is
joules per meter squared per second,

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.910
goes as minus some thermal
conductivity times the gradient in

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.740
temperature. So,
temperature is the potential acting

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.580
on heat conduction the way
concentration is the potential

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.330
acting on diffusion.
And, this is thermal diffusivity.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.990
And then he says, why stop at two?
Let's go for the hat trick. Let's

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.660
go for three. He says,
you know what? This is just like

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:44.330
Ohm's law. This is just like Ohm's
law. Well, you know Ohm's law as V

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.990
equals IR. But,
you can write V as minus the

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.660
gradient in electrical potential,
minus the gradient in electrical

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:58.080
potential gives you voltage.
And then, I can write instead of

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.240
resistance, I can write conductance.
So, I can map that into, since I

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.410
know V, V equals minus that.
I can then write Ohm's law as the

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.580
current. See,
this is a current.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.740
It's heat flux. This is a current.
It is a mass flux. So, let's write

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.910
Ohm's law not with potential as a
function of current. Let's

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:24.440
write current density.
This is amps, which is Coulombs per

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:31.330
second per square meter goes as
minus the conductivity G times d phi

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:38.220
by dx. So, in one paper,
he unifies electron drift,

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:45.100
heat conduction, and mass transport
by diffusion. Not bad,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:19:01.000
not bad. And this guy was a medical
doctor.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:59.250
So, it shows you that knowledge
knows no boundaries.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:15.466
So, what is diffusion?
Let's define diffusion as mass

00:18:46.500 --> 00:19:13.750
transport by random atomic motion.
And, I'll make that point by the

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:29.833
end of the lecture so you'll
understand what it is.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.500
So, what does it tell us so far?
It tells us if we want to increase

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.000
the rate of ingress,
remember, we are still running this

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.500
doping operation,
I hope you haven't forgotten about

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.000
our silicon fab line here.
We're still trying to dope this

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.500
with boron. So,
what it's telling us is that if I

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.000
want to get a higher flux,
I need to get a higher gradient,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.500
which means I need to have a higher
surface concentration.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.000
So, if I have a higher surface
concentration,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.500
I will increase the flux by
increasing c sub s,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.000
which means increase the pressure of
B2H6.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:59.570
So, that's good.
But, there's another way we can

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.140
increase the rate of ingress.
We can increase the rate of ingress,

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.710
we know from experiment,
increase J by increasing temperature.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.280
We saw that with the chemical
kinetics. Well,

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.850
where's temperature?
I don't see any temperature effect

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.420
here unless you're going to say,
well, concentration is density, and

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:36.573
density is a mild function
of temperature.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
No, here's where all the chemistry
is. It's inside the diffusivity

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
because what's diffusivity going to
be related to?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
If it's boron moving through
silicon, diffusivity must be related

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
to atom mobility.
And, atom mobility must be related

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
to atom arrangements.
And, what dictates atom

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
arrangements? Bonding.
And what dictates bonding?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Electronic structure. You see,
chemistry is not just a litany of

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
silly little laws and rules and
facts. There's a unity here.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
So, the chemistry is all contained
in D, and that's also where the

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
temperature effect is contained.
It should come as no surprise to

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
you that the temperature dependence
of diffusivity obeys an Arrhenius

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
type relationship where we have some
pre-exponential,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
which instead of A in honor of
Arrhenius is D naught,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
they don't honor Arrhenius when they
talk about diffusion.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
They just put D naught,
exponential minus Q, not to be

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:25.660
confused with the heat flux.
This is the term that they use: Q

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.990
over RT. And,
Q is an activation energy.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:36.330
It's an activation energy for
diffusion, which means it's an

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:41.660
activation energy for atomic motion.
And, you are normally going to see

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:46.990
it RT. R is simply,
not to be confused with the Rydberg

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:52.330
constant, this is the gas constant,
which is the product of the Avogadro

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:57.080
number and the Boltzmann constant.
You're going to say,

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.240
well have I know whether I'm
supposed to put the Boltzmann

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.410
constant here or the universal gas
constant? Simple: the exponential

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:09.580
must be dimensionless.
So, if the units of Q are joules

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.740
per atom, then you're going to use
the Boltzmann constant.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.910
If the units on Q are joules per
mole, then you're going to

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:37.620
use the gas constant.
Otherwise, you're going to be off by

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
a mere factor of six times ten to
the 23rd. And,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
that should tip you off that
something's wrong because you're

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
going to get diffusion coefficients
that are either blindingly fast,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
you would have atoms moving at a
gazillion times the speed of light,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
or you will have five times the
universe to dope the silicon with

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
the boron. So,
that should tip you off that

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
something's wrong.
And, as far as typical values go,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Q is on the order of about 2
electron volts or 200 kilojoules per

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
mole when we're talking about
diffusion in solids.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:23:02.280
And, I do want to draw attention,
I mean, clearly when we're talking

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.560
about matter moving through matter,
solid, it's got to be diffusion. In

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.850
liquids, we can have cooperative
motion, convection,

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.140
stirring, but, you can have in
capillaries and narrow fissures,

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:19.420
you can have diffusion in the liquid
state. And, in the case of the

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.710
liquid, the value is on the order of
about a tenth of that,

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:43.553
about 0.2 eV, which is about 20
kilojoules per mole in liquids.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
So, that will give you some sense.
So that means, if we plot the

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
natural law of the diffusion
coefficient as a function of the

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
reciprocal of the absolute
temperature as we saw before with

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
the Arrhenius plot for the specific
chemical rate constant,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
you get a straight line with a
negative slope because high

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:52.370
temperature is to the left.
One over T increases to the right.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:57.120
And, the slope of this is minus the
value of the activation energy for

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.870
diffusion divided by either the
Boltzmann constant or the universal

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:06.620
gas constant. So,
that's the story. Now,

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.370
I want to try to give some insight
into what the activation process

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:16.120
must be. What's going on at the
atomistic level that we're trying to

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.870
activate? And,
for that, I go to this cartoon.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.620
We see the cartoon showing that
this is now diffusion of metal in a

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:44.573
close packed system.
So, we see an atom with a vacancy

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:34.600
next to it. That's the first thing.
The atom must diffuse into a

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:54.466
vacancy. If there's no vacancy,
the atom can't move. But, we know

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:43.400
there have to be vacancies.
We've already seen from earlier

00:24:43.400 --> 00:25:03.466
that it's impossible above zero
Kelvin to have a vacancy free metal,

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:51.570
or solid crystal.
And so, this cartoon shows the atom

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:54.730
moving from the site to the left
jumping into the vacancy,

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.890
and eventually occupying the site to
the right. And,

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.050
there's a few things good and bad
about this sketch.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.200
Let's look at it from the top.
Forget the bottom. The bottom is

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.360
showing you interstitial diffusion.
Let's just focus on the top. First

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.520
of all, you've got to have a vacancy.
This is important.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.680
You know that if you watch traffic,
you ever been stuck in traffic? You

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.840
are, say, the fourth car back from
the traffic light.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:36.480
The light turns green.
Then you don't move.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
The light turned green.
What's the matter with everybody?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Well, it takes time for the first
car to move to create a vacancy

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
behind it. And then,
the second car moves, creates a

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
vacancy behind it.
The third car moves to create a

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
vacancy in front of you.
So, you drive into car vacancies.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
And, you can stand on a bridge
sometime and look at cars pulling

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
away from a light.
And instead of watching the cars

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
move, watch the vacancy move
backwards. That's what you have to

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
have here. If you cease to wait for
the vacancy, then you end up with

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
what's shown here.
And you see the atoms deforming.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:54.120
OK, now the atoms don't deform.
This is nuts. This picture is

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.240
incorrect. So,
what's really going on?

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.370
What's really going on?
This is the lattice at zero Kelvin.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:06.490
This is the lattice at zero Kelvin.
What do we know is going on?

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.620
Those atoms are vibrating. So,
we have to consider a pulsating

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.740
lattice. And,
we have to understand what the range

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.870
of pulsation is.
What's the amplitude of the

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:38.206
pulsation, and what's the frequency
of the pulsation?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:27.900
OK, so I need frequency,
and I need amplitude. Because the

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.810
squishy, these are not Nerf balls.
These are hard spheres. So, this

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:37.720
cartoon is only partly correct.
So, first of all, what's the

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.630
pulsation frequency?
Well, this is the vibrational

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:47.540
frequency of a crystal is called the
Debye frequency denoted nu sub D,

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.140
the Debye frequency.
And, the Debye frequency at room

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.420
temperature is on the order of about
10 trillion per second,

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.710
ten to the 13th hertz, ten to the
13th times a second the atoms in all

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.990
of us are vibrating.
But, diffusion, if we work

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.280
backwards from established data,
we learned that the jump frequency,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.570
in other words, the jump rate, the
jump frequency which is denoted

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.850
capital gamma,
is on the order of about 100 million

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.140
per second.
So, that's a big number,

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.420
but it still 100,000 times smaller
than the Debye frequency.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.710
So, most of the atomic motion is
oscillatory. Most of it is

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.990
oscillatory. So,
this is one attempt in ten to the

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.280
fifth is successful.
So, this means that even if you

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.570
have a vacancy next door,
even if you have a vacancy next door,

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:47.850
you will try 100,
00 times to jump into the vacancy

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.930
before you get in.
And what has to happen?

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.810
What has to happen is the two atoms
on either side,

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.680
the ones that are shown here as
squashed, those two atoms,

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.550
at least one of them has to be
moving out at the moment you're

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.430
moving in. And,
when that atom moves out at the

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:11.300
moment you try to move it,
you can squeeze through without

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.180
having to result to the Nerf ball
model. OK, let's not have any

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.060
deformable atoms.
So, that's what we are learning

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:23.230
here, that we have this to wait for.
So, what does this mean?

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.690
This means, then, that the
activation energy can be broken into

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:32.150
two components.
First of all, we have to form the

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:36.610
vacancy. So, we've got that.
We learned that earlier when we

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:41.070
studied defects.
So, there is an enthalpy of vacancy

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:45.530
formation. You have to pay for that,
pay to open up a vacancy next door,

00:28:45.530 --> 00:29:05.060
and then there's the energy
associated with this fluctuation.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:54.570
And that's called the enthalpy of
migration, atom migration.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:59.140
And the first one is related to
bonding because this is really,

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.710
in essence, the inverse of the
bonding energy.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:08.280
And, the second one must be related
to structure. It must be related to

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.850
free volume. And,
here's a cute graph that illustrates

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:17.420
this. These are all FCC metals:
lead, aluminum,

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:36.573
silver, gold, copper,
and iron. Iron is both FCC and BCC.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:27.270
But, we'll put it on the graph for
completeness. And so,

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:32.540
what's plotted here is activation
energy. And, it's a function of

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.810
melting temperature,
activation energy as a function of

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:43.080
melting temperature.
Activation energy for diffusion as

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:48.360
a function of the melting point:
well, we know that the melting point

00:29:48.360 --> 00:30:07.053
must be related to bond energy.
And, bond energy is related to the

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
energy of vacancy formation.
So, a low melting metal has a low

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
activation energy for diffusion.
A high melting metal has a high

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
bond energy, therefore,
a high vacancy formation energy.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
There is such beauty in this graph.
There is completeness here. It

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
ties everything together.
It's really so elegant.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:27.710
And, we can also look at diffusion
by an interstitial mechanism.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.420
That's what's shown underneath here,
same idea. The only difference is

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:35.140
with interstitials,
there are so many interstitials,

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.850
they exist. We don't have to pay to
form the interstitials.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:42.570
The interstitials are there by
virtue of the fact that we don't

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:46.280
have 100% packing.
The closest pack structure we have

00:30:46.280 --> 00:31:07.026
is FCC. And, that is 74% atomic.
So therefore, it's 26% free volume.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
So, we've got 26% to play with,
and it's unlikely we've got

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
interstitial loading to consume all
of that. So, in the case of

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
interstitials,
the Q is simply equal to delta H of

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
migration in the case of
interstitials.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
You don't have to pay for formation
of vacancies.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:18.180
So now, let's get to the question of

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.560
random atomic motion.
This is what will convince you that

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.930
we have random atomic motion.
Let's look at a really clean

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:31.300
experiment. Let's look at this one.
We talked about radioactivity last

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.680
day. Suppose I make a diffusion
sandwich that consists of the

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.050
following: I'm going to put cobalt,
cobalt, and cobalt. It's all pure

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:44.430
cobalt. The only difference is the
center of the sandwich is going to

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:48.810
consist of radioactive cobalt.
And, the two layers of bread are

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:53.060
cool cobalt.
So, there's no concentration

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.190
gradient here because you know that
radio isotopes behave identically,

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.330
chemically. The fact that there's
radioactivity does not affect the

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.460
chemical bonding capabilities of
cobalt because it doesn't affect the

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.590
electronic structure.
And as far as the mass effect goes,

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:13.730
it's so tiny that it can be
disregarded. So,

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:17.860
what happens over time?
If there's no concentration

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:37.453
gradient, according to Fick,
there should be no diffusion

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:27.590
But what happens,
as this cartoon shows,

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:33.190
if we have a center band here that
consists of a mix of radio cobalt

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:38.790
and regular cobalt,
over time we find that the cobalt is

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:44.390
uniformly distributed throughout the
specimen. And,

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:49.990
if we stop action and measure the
rate of dispersion of cobalt through

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:55.590
the specimen, we find that the rate
is described by Fick's law.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:01.190
So, we have random jumping at the
atomic level in accordance

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:06.150
with Fick's first law.
So, this is a demonstration that we

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:10.460
have things occurring at the
atomistic level involving random

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.760
jumping. And,
to make the case more potent,

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.070
the actual curve here obeys a
Gaussian, which is exactly the

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:23.380
random walk problem,
you know, the drunken sailor walks

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.690
out the door, takes one step or two
steps, and so the chances that he

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:46.180
gets five steps away are
vanishingly small.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:36.750
The chances are that he falls after
one or two steps are higher.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:56.533
So, you will get a Gaussian curve
here for the distance at the cobalt

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:46.250
has gone as a function of time.
So, what's wrong with this cartoon,

00:33:46.250 --> 00:34:06.033
by the way? We've talked about this
is cobalt jumping through cobalt.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:54.220
Where does cobalt have to jump to?
It has to jump into a vacancy. I

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.440
don't see any vacancies here.
So, the chances of this cobalt

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.660
jumping and exchanging with the
adjacent cobalt,

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.880
now we're not talking about a tiny
fluctuation to allow cobalt to

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.110
squirt into a vacancy.
We are talking about a fluctuation

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:10.330
like this to allow two cobalts to
crisscross. And,

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.550
I mean, that's just not going to
happen, maybe once in the life of

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.770
the universe. But I don't think
it's going to happen.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:36.473
So, we really need to have
vacancies in here.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:26.330
And, ultimately we have to recognize
that diffusion is heavily influenced

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:32.660
by defects: no vacancies,
poor diffusion. Many vacancies,

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:38.990
better diffusion. So, let's take a
look at some evidence of this.

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:45.330
This is a plot of diffusion
coefficient is a function of

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:51.660
temperature. It's an Arrhenius plot
in accordance with this curve here.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:35:09.386
And what we have is for a variety
of impurities in solid iron.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:35:02.880
So, let's look up at the top here.
This is hydrogen. And you can see

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.770
that the diffusivity of hydrogen
increases with temperature up to the

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:12.660
temperature at which iron converts
from BCC to FCC,

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:17.550
and then there's an abrupt drop in
the diffusivity of hydrogen.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:21.820
What's happening? What's happening?
What's the void fraction of BCC

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.460
versus the void fraction of FCC?
FCC is more tightly packed, and so

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.110
we see an abrupt fall.
Here's carbon; same thing.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.760
The diffusivity rises up to the
transformation temperature,

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.400
falls, and then continues to rise.
And, note the difference in the

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.050
slope. The slope of carbon in BCC
iron is gentler than the slope of

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.700
carbon in FCC iron.
Well, what's that mean?

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:47.350
It means that the slope in FCC iron
is this upper value.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:36:06.366
The slope in BCC iron is the lower
value.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:54.910
You don't have to pay for the
formation of vacancies.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.820
Here's the self diffusion of iron
in iron. Look,

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:02.730
it drops two orders of magnitude
when it moves from BCC to FCC.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.640
And, just to make the point, this
is carbon in graphite.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.560
This is self diffusion of carbon in
graphite. What's the problem there?

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.470
Where do we see that as operating?
Well, we said that delta H vacancy

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:18.380
formation is related to bonding.
So, here you see the comparison

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.300
between metallic bonding,
which is what you have in iron,

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:26.210
so self diffusion of iron if I were
to project this curve up to the

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:30.120
temperature, so we can compare at
the same temperature,

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.040
we see seven, eight orders of
magnitude difference between self

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:54.280
diffusion of iron in iron.
That's a metal in a metallic crystal,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
versus carbon in graphite,
which is carbon in a covalent

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
crystal. So: big difference in
performance. Now,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
there are other ways of looking at
it.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:53.520
Let's look at other defects.
How do other defects affect?

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.050
So, here's a cartoon showing the
diffusion of some solute into a

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.580
material, only this is a real
material. It's a polycrystalline

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.110
material. So,
there is a grain boundary.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.640
And, as you know, grain boundaries
have a little more openness.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.170
The atoms at the grain boundary
have fewer nearest neighbors.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.700
Well, if what you are trying to do
is to jump to that little narrow

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.230
saddle point waiting for those atoms
to pulsate, in a grain boundary,

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.940
you don't have to wait.
The atoms are farther apart.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.830
So, it's like the difference
between having to drive down an

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.720
expressway, or drive down a narrow
city street. You've got a much

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.600
easier time moving quickly down the
expressway. All right,

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.490
so we can see what the cartoon is
trying to show is that up at the top,

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:41.380
we see the rate of ingress of this
solute through the bulk,

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.270
or we say it is lattice diffusion,
classical lattice diffusion. Down

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.160
the grain boundary,
at the same time, we see a much

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.050
deeper penetration because the
material is able to move

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.730
with less constraint.
And, along the surface,

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.190
it can move very readily.
Surface diffusion is very,

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:03.660
very rapid. And, here's some data.
These are three different

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.130
investigations of diffusion of
silver, self diffusion.

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:10.590
OK, this is silver diffusing
through silver.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:14.060
So, this is classical.
What they call volume diffusion is

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.530
what we would call lattice diffusion
or bulk diffusion,

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:36.993
single crystal, silver moving
through silver.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:24.760
How would you make these
measurements? What's the only way

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.520
you could identify one silver from
another? You have to use radio

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.290
tracer. OK, so using radio tracer,
they're able to get self diffusion

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:36.050
coefficients, and you see,
what they've done is they've flipped

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:39.820
this around. This is very wimpy.
This is so wimpy; look at what

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.580
they've done. These people,
the people that plotted this,

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.350
they're such sissies. Look, do you
have any trouble figuring out that

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.110
temperature is increasing in this
direction? I mean,

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:54.940
you can think in one over T space.
This is how I feel comfortable.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.820
Why look in an Arrhenius plot, I
want a negative slope and a straight

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.700
line. And, what they did is look at
the numbers. See the numbers?

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.580
They're ascending from right to
left because they're so chicken that

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.460
they're afraid to have temperature
rising from right to left.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:14.350
So, what they did is they plotted
the diffusion coefficient,

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.230
natural log of the diffusion
coefficient. But,

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:22.110
they've got one over T rising from
right to left so that they'll get

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:40.753
positive looking slopes
on their lines.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:29.470
It's very girly.
I don't like this.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:32.940
I don't like this. OK,
so look at this. Now, here we have,

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.410
first of all, a very steep slope.
So, that indicates a higher

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.890
activation energy because we have a
higher lattice energy with which we

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.360
have to deal. Here's the grain
boundary. The grain boundary,

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.840
first of all, it's several orders of
magnitude higher,

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.310
and the slope is gentler,
indicating that we have less

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:53.780
constraint. And,
finally up at the top,

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.260
we have the surface diffusion which
has, and I draw your attention

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:16.720
to the values.
Here, we are down to around ten to

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
the minus eight,
ten to the minus nine,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
ten to the minus ten in units of
centimeters squared per second.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Look at the surface diffusion. Ten
to the minus five,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
ten to the minus four,
here's diffusion in molten ferrous

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
alloys, ten to the minus five,
ten to the minus four. So, what

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
we've got here is diffusion across
the surface is on a par with

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
diffusion in a liquid.
So, it gives you a very vivid

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
demonstration of how there's a
relationship between the physical

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
constraints of the lattice and
diffusion coefficients.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:41.330
So, we can capture that by saying
that the activation energy for what

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:45.660
I've been calling bulk diffusion or
lattice diffusion,

00:40:45.660 --> 00:41:03.653
this is classical vacancy stuff,
OK?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:55.450
Vacancy mechanism,
OK, via vacancy, this activation

00:40:55.450 --> 00:41:00.900
energy is much greater than the
activation energy for diffusion

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:06.360
along grain boundaries,
which is much greater than the

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:11.810
activation energy across a free
surface. So, what do we see?

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:17.270
The trend in moving from left to
right is decreasing coordination

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:22.140
number, which means more freedom.
And, as Q goes down,

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:26.420
the value of D goes up.
So, all other things being equal,

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:30.710
this is for, let's compare apples to
apples. So, this is for

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:34.990
self-diffusion,
silver in silver,

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:39.280
iron in iron, what have you,
the diffusion coefficient for

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.570
lattice diffusion is going to be
less than the diffusion coefficient

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:47.850
for grain boundary diffusion which
is less than the diffusion

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.940
coefficient for surface diffusion.
And so, things are making sense.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:55.830
And finally, to make the point, it
even applies in amorphous solids.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:59.720
So, I want to show you some data.
This is helium entering different

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.600
glasses. We just finished the unit
on glasses. So,

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.490
let's put it all together.
So, what people have done here is

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:11.380
measure, they're using a permeation
velocity. For all intents and

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:15.270
purposes, the ordinate is
proportional to the diffusion

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:19.160
coefficient. So: high permeation
velocity, a high value of

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.050
permittivity, K,
is the same as high value of D,

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:40.866
diffusivity.
And, what do you find?

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:12.500
First of all: Arrhenius type
behavior, and secondly you see the

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.500
most rapid infusion of helium is
with fused silica,

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:22.500
Vycor. As we come down here,
we see more and more modification.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:27.500
Down here we have soda lime glass.
So, let's pick a constant

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:32.500
temperature, let's say,
200。. Fused silica is strictly

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:57.160
network former.
Borosilicate has network former plus

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.490
some borate intermediate.
Down here, we have soda lime,

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:05.830
which consists of network former
plus a fair bit of sodium oxide.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:10.160
So, the chain lengths are getting
shorter. We have tighter packing.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.490
The void space is smaller. And,
down here, we have lead borate.

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:18.830
Lead borate has a huge amount of
modification. It's a euphemism

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:23.330
for crystal.
So, we have lead crystal down here.

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:27.990
We have amorphous silica here. At
constant temperature,

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:32.660
we can see this is ten to the minus
eight. This is ten to the minus 14,

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:37.330
a million times difference in the
coefficient for helium entering the

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:41.990
glasses at the same temperature.
So, again, the message is, as the

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:46.660
channel is less and less constrained,
you have a higher and higher rate of

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:51.330
diffusion. And so,
what they did here is they plotted,

00:43:51.330 --> 00:44:10.726
as a function of the amount of,
these are all network formers.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:59.360
So, as the fraction of network
formers rises,

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.720
you get a more open structure.
As the fraction of network formers

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.080
falls, that's to say the chain
lengths are getting shorter.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.450
You've got tighter packing. So,
this is beautiful. It's an isotherm

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.810
showing the rate of helium ingress
as a function of amount of network

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:16.170
formation. And,
here's the last one I'll show you.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:19.540
I couldn't resist. These are so
beautiful. Look at this.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:22.900
This is now the same glass,
but instead of asking, what's the

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.270
rate of helium?
Let's compare: same glass,

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:29.630
same structure; what's the rate of
helium ingress,

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:49.726
neon ingress, nitrogen ingress,
and what do you find?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:37.390
The larger the species.
And, this is H, but in fact it's H2.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:41.790
So, what do you find?
The larger the species,

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.190
the greater the activation energy
for ingress of the species into the

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:50.590
same glass. So,
this is changing the size of the

00:44:50.590 --> 00:45:09.713
diffuser and keeping the size of the
channel constant.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:59.540
This one here was keeping the size
of the diffuser constant,

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:04.080
and changing the size of the channel.
So, everything is making sense.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.630
So, I wanted to give you an example
showing how the catalyst works.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:13.180
And so, I'd like to talk about
catalytic converters in automobiles.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.720
This is the number one market for
industrial catalysts:

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.300
catalytic converters.
A little bit of background.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:26.920
Gasoline is a mix of hydrocarbons,
but the dominant one is octane here:

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.530
C8H18, which we burn with air.
And air, of course, is only 20%

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:36.150
oxygen. It's roughly 80% nitrogen.
So, when we burn gasoline, we make

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:40.760
not just water vapor,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:45.380
but the air at those temperatures
forms various nitrous oxides.

00:45:45.380 --> 00:46:03.760
And these are, in fact, the
precursor to smog.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:53.330
So, back in the early 70's,
it was decided that in order to

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:56.660
improve urban air quality,
we need to convert unburned

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.990
hydrocarbons. Some of the gasoline
actually doesn't end up being burned.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:03.320
And, some of it's completely burned
to carbon monoxide.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.660
And, of course, there's nitrous
oxide. So, here's what the mandate

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.990
was: to convert the hydrocarbons to
water vapor and carbon dioxide.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.330
I know carbon dioxide is implicated
in greenhouse gases,

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:16.660
but believe me, if you've got a
choice of carbon monoxide or carbon

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:36.453
dioxide, I recommend you
go with carbon dioxide.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:24.580
So, we'll solve the small problems
first. And then,

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:29.170
nitrous oxides convert then to
nitrogen, oxygen,

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:33.760
and CO2. Now, look at the nature of
these three reactions.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.350
The first two involve oxidation
reactions. The last one involves a

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:42.940
reduction reaction.
Now, if I told you I want to make a

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:47.520
single reactor in which you should
simultaneously conduct three

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.110
different chemical conversions,
two of which are reductions, and one

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:56.700
of which is an oxidation,
in the same place at the same time,

00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:00.910
you would say, you're nuts.
You can't do that.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:04.740
Well, that's the challenge that was
presented to the auto industry.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.580
And, on top of that, some pinhead
in the government decided to invoke

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.410
the Sherman Antitrust Act,
which was designed to prevent people

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:16.240
from colluding on price-fixing.
But they invoked it in colluding on

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.080
technological developments.
So, all of the auto companies were

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.940
obliged to work independently.
So, GM, and Ford,

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.820
and Chrysler, couldn't pool their
resources. GM alone tried 1,

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.700
00 formulations. Why did they try 1,
00? Because people don't understand

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:35.580
the basis science of catalysis.
And, when you don't understand,

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:39.460
there's only one way to proceed.
It's called by inspection,

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.350
cook and look. It's very costly.
And, finally, this is what they

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:47.230
settled on: platinum palladium for
the first two reactions,

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:51.110
and rhodium for the last one.
Basically, you go to the most

00:47:51.110 --> 00:48:09.620
expensive part of the
periodic table.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:59.460
And, that's the formulation.
Tom, if we could go to the document

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.920
camera, this catalyst is put on a
substrate. So,

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:08.380
we want to use as little of the
precious metals as possible because

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:12.840
it's a surface reaction.
What's happening is the catalyst is

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:17.300
sitting here. So,
this is platinum, rhodium,

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:21.760
and palladium. And, what happens is
it provides a site for selectivity,

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.920
absorption of CO's.
So, CO's can absorb as follows as

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.760
opposed to in the gas phase,
two of these molecules are zooming

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.610
along at high speed.
And, it's not good enough for them

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:37.460
to just collide.
They actually have to be close

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.300
enough together for a long enough
period of time for bonds to decay

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.150
and form. If we adsorb,
they can sit side by side long

00:48:45.150 --> 00:49:05.366
enough for something to do this.
And then they have to desorb.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:53.460
You have to adsorb the reactants and
desorb the products.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:57.920
So, this is now a ceramic catalyst.
You can see it's been extruded like

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.380
pasta and then fired.
So, all up and down these honeycomb

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:06.840
channels, we put a dilute wash of
acids containing platinum,

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:11.300
rhodium, palladium, fire because we
want the thinnest,

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:15.760
thinnest layer of the precious metal
all up and down this ceramic

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:36.120
catalyst. So, that's what's inside.
If you look up underneath the car,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
you'll see the exhaust tubing, and
it will flare out to something about

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
this size. And then,
it goes on to the muffler.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
So, this is the three-way catalytic
converter. And then,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Tom, could we go back to the
computer, please?

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
And then, hand and glove with this
came unleaded gasoline.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000
We couldn't have catalytic
converters with leaded gasoline

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
because leaded gasoline contains,
as the name implies, lead as

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
tetraethyl lead shown here with this
compound. And,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
one of the combustion products is
lead oxide.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:59.420
Well, lead oxide you've met before.
It's a modifier. But, it's also

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.850
volatile. It's volatile.
So, it will go down through the

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:06.280
exhaust stream to the catalytic
converter. And,

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.710
it is converted as NOX is to
elemental lead.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:13.140
And then, it decomposes.
So, now you have elemental lead,

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.570
and elemental lead alloys with
platinum, palladium,

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:37.540
and rhodium. Now, what do you think
the catalytic value of lead is?

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.500
Well, let me tell you.
Given the difference in price

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:09.000
between these three and this,
if this had any catalytic value,

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.500
we wouldn't be using these. So,
what this does is it poisons the

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:18.000
catalyst, and after several
tank-fulls of gas,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.500
renders the catalyst useless.
So, the advent of the three-way

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:27.000
catalytic converter was accompanied
by the advent of unleaded gasoline.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.333
Have a nice weekend.
