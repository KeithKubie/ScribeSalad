00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.069
there Phoenix has a big interest in this
I mean any large city that's stuck in

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079
I mean any large city that's stuck in
 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.479
I mean any large city that's stuck in
the middle of a desert should have a

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489
the middle of a desert should have a
 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.800
the middle of a desert should have a
huge investment in food now if you're an

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810
huge investment in food now if you're an
 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.479
huge investment in food now if you're an
Arab country of course you can afford

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489
Arab country of course you can afford
 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.909
Arab country of course you can afford
most Arab not all Adam countries but if

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919
most Arab not all Adam countries but if
 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.800
most Arab not all Adam countries but if
you're a rich our country with lots of

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810
you're a rich our country with lots of
 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.259
you're a rich our country with lots of
oil you trade oil for food and water and

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269
oil you trade oil for food and water and
 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.270
oil you trade oil for food and water and
things like this but they don't even

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
things like this but they don't even
 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.589
things like this but they don't even
want to do that anymore what they would

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599
want to do that anymore what they would
 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.360
want to do that anymore what they would
love to do is be self-sufficient so they

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
love to do is be self-sufficient so they
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.640
love to do is be self-sufficient so they
can sell everything and make a huge

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650
can sell everything and make a huge
 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.259
can sell everything and make a huge
profit rather than having to spend some

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269
profit rather than having to spend some
 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.539
profit rather than having to spend some
of that on themselves so I think the

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549
of that on themselves so I think the
 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.780
of that on themselves so I think the
logic of this is inescapable and that is

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790
logic of this is inescapable and that is
 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.640
logic of this is inescapable and that is
that we must learn to feed the city

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650
that we must learn to feed the city
 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.269
that we must learn to feed the city
people with City grown food
