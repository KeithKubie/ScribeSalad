00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.090
so today I'm going to tell you about how

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100
so today I'm going to tell you about how
 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.980
so today I'm going to tell you about how
the Fibonacci sequence appears in the

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990
the Fibonacci sequence appears in the
 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.630
the Fibonacci sequence appears in the
medal round set hopefully your mind will

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640
medal round set hopefully your mind will
 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.190
medal round set hopefully your mind will
be blown

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200
be blown
 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.750
be blown
so the Fibonacci sequence the rule is

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
so the Fibonacci sequence the rule is
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.220
so the Fibonacci sequence the rule is
that you take the previous two numbers

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230
that you take the previous two numbers
 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.780
that you take the previous two numbers
and you add them together to get the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
and you add them together to get the
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.509
and you add them together to get the
next right so we started with 1 1 their

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
next right so we started with 1 1 their
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.450
next right so we started with 1 1 their
sum is 2 the next number will be the sum

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
sum is 2 the next number will be the sum
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.510
sum is 2 the next number will be the sum
of 1 &amp; 2 which is 3 the sum of 2 &amp; 3 is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
of 1 &amp; 2 which is 3 the sum of 2 &amp; 3 is
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.900
of 1 &amp; 2 which is 3 the sum of 2 &amp; 3 is
5 the sum of 3 &amp; 5 is 8 I'll do one more

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
5 the sum of 3 &amp; 5 is 8 I'll do one more
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.470
5 the sum of 3 &amp; 5 is 8 I'll do one more
and then you can continue on easy easy

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
and then you can continue on easy easy
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480
and then you can continue on easy easy
right and this occurs everywhere that

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490
right and this occurs everywhere that
 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.070
right and this occurs everywhere that
has interesting connections to things in

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
has interesting connections to things in
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.930
has interesting connections to things in
nature and all of that but I just want

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
nature and all of that but I just want
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.889
nature and all of that but I just want
to show you where it appears on the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
to show you where it appears on the
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.950
to show you where it appears on the
Mandelbrot set so slightly less easy so

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
Mandelbrot set so slightly less easy so
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.080
Mandelbrot set so slightly less easy so
the Mandelbrot set is a special object

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090
the Mandelbrot set is a special object
 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.479
the Mandelbrot set is a special object
inside of the complex plane so the plane

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
inside of the complex plane so the plane
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.150
inside of the complex plane so the plane
of complex numbers and the way you cook

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
of complex numbers and the way you cook
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.119
of complex numbers and the way you cook
this thing up is by considering a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
this thing up is by considering a
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.520
this thing up is by considering a
certain type of dynamical system so if

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
certain type of dynamical system so if
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.939
certain type of dynamical system so if
you give me a complex number C so here's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
you give me a complex number C so here's
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.680
you give me a complex number C so here's
a picture of the complex plane so these

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
a picture of the complex plane so these
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540
a picture of the complex plane so these
are the real numbers and these are the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
are the real numbers and these are the
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.430
are the real numbers and these are the
real numbers x I which is that square

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
real numbers x I which is that square
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.920
real numbers x I which is that square
root of -1 if you give me a complex

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
root of -1 if you give me a complex
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.260
root of -1 if you give me a complex
number C it's in the Mandelbrot set if

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
number C it's in the Mandelbrot set if
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.020
number C it's in the Mandelbrot set if
when you take the function Z squared

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
when you take the function Z squared
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.780
when you take the function Z squared
plus C and you look at what happens to 0

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
plus C and you look at what happens to 0
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850
plus C and you look at what happens to 0
when you plug it into this function

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
when you plug it into this function
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.070
when you plug it into this function
repeatedly if that number doesn't get

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
repeatedly if that number doesn't get
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.830
repeatedly if that number doesn't get
large then C is in the Mandelbrot set so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
large then C is in the Mandelbrot set so
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.300
large then C is in the Mandelbrot set so
I know that sounds sort of complicated

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
I know that sounds sort of complicated
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.609
I know that sounds sort of complicated
but just let me do an example Rach so if

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
but just let me do an example Rach so if
 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.120
but just let me do an example Rach so if
you look at C equals minus 1 right then

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
you look at C equals minus 1 right then
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.670
you look at C equals minus 1 right then
you look at the function Zed squared

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
you look at the function Zed squared
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.420
you look at the function Zed squared
minus 1 you plug in the number 0 0 if

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
minus 1 you plug in the number 0 0 if
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.370
minus 1 you plug in the number 0 0 if
you plug it into this function gives you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
you plug it into this function gives you
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.010
you plug it into this function gives you
minus 1 minus 1 if you plug it into this

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
minus 1 minus 1 if you plug it into this
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.200
minus 1 minus 1 if you plug it into this
function gives you 1 minus 1 which is 0

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
function gives you 1 minus 1 which is 0
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149
function gives you 1 minus 1 which is 0
again and so you're just gonna repeat

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159
again and so you're just gonna repeat
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.550
again and so you're just gonna repeat
this pattern and so this number doesn't

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
this pattern and so this number doesn't
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620
this pattern and so this number doesn't
get large no matter how far out we go

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
get large no matter how far out we go
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510
get large no matter how far out we go
and so this number is in the Mandelbrot

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
and so this number is in the Mandelbrot
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.850
and so this number is in the Mandelbrot
set it's about right here so for each

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
set it's about right here so for each
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.620
set it's about right here so for each
complex number you make this decision

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
complex number you make this decision
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.510
complex number you make this decision
based on what happens to 0 under

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
based on what happens to 0 under
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.609
based on what happens to 0 under
iteration so it looks something like

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
iteration so it looks something like
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.859
iteration so it looks something like
this so there's this big piece in the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
this so there's this big piece in the
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.899
this so there's this big piece in the
middle all this interior is included by

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
middle all this interior is included by
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.080
middle all this interior is included by
the way and a little disc around minus 1

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
the way and a little disc around minus 1
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.539
the way and a little disc around minus 1
and there's some more pieces coming off

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
and there's some more pieces coming off
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.050
and there's some more pieces coming off
of here and some kind of funny tenderly

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
of here and some kind of funny tenderly
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.359
of here and some kind of funny tenderly
stuff goes on out here and a few more

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
stuff goes on out here and a few more
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.699
stuff goes on out here and a few more
pieces this way another heart-shaped

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
pieces this way another heart-shaped
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.770
pieces this way another heart-shaped
piece mathematicians love this thing

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
piece mathematicians love this thing
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.590
piece mathematicians love this thing
even non-math

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600
even non-math
 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.030
even non-math
love this thing that maybe for different

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040
love this thing that maybe for different
 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.510
love this thing that maybe for different
reasons all right so where is the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520
reasons all right so where is the
 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.370
reasons all right so where is the
Fibonacci sequence I mean first of all

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380
Fibonacci sequence I mean first of all
 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.190
Fibonacci sequence I mean first of all
this thing has nothing to do with whole

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200
this thing has nothing to do with whole
 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.190
this thing has nothing to do with whole
numbers an addition and arithmetic and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200
numbers an addition and arithmetic and
 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.420
numbers an addition and arithmetic and
the kinds of things that you think about

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430
the kinds of things that you think about
 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.280
the kinds of things that you think about
with Fibonacci which is why it's weird

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290
with Fibonacci which is why it's weird
 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.950
with Fibonacci which is why it's weird
that you can see it in here but so let

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960
that you can see it in here but so let
 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.750
that you can see it in here but so let
me show you how to find it I didn't draw

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760
me show you how to find it I didn't draw
 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.220
me show you how to find it I didn't draw
too many of them but there's a bunch of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230
too many of them but there's a bunch of
 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.780
too many of them but there's a bunch of
these little components coming off of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
these little components coming off of
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.350
these little components coming off of
this main piece they're called the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360
this main piece they're called the
 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.390
this main piece they're called the
hyperbolic components but let's not get

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400
hyperbolic components but let's not get
 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.970
hyperbolic components but let's not get
into that too these components I'm going

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980
into that too these components I'm going
 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.220
into that too these components I'm going
to assign a number and that number is

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
to assign a number and that number is
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.650
to assign a number and that number is
going to be the number of branches that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660
going to be the number of branches that
 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.600
going to be the number of branches that
come off the sort of tenderly bit which

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610
come off the sort of tenderly bit which
 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.430
come off the sort of tenderly bit which
is called an antenna so like here if

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
is called an antenna so like here if
 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.530
is called an antenna so like here if
this component there's this part where

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540
this component there's this part where
 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.480
this component there's this part where
we have these tendrils and there's three

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490
we have these tendrils and there's three
 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.040
we have these tendrils and there's three
different directions you can go in the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050
different directions you can go in the
 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.230
different directions you can go in the
antenna and so this component will have

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240
antenna and so this component will have
 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.240
antenna and so this component will have
number three and similarly over here it

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250
number three and similarly over here it
 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.530
number three and similarly over here it
actually turns out there's only two

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540
actually turns out there's only two
 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.410
actually turns out there's only two
directions you can go in that antenna so

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420
directions you can go in that antenna so
 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.390
directions you can go in that antenna so
this is component number two now if we

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400
this is component number two now if we
 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.910
this is component number two now if we
look for the next biggest one the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
look for the next biggest one the
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.920
look for the next biggest one the
largest component between the two and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930
largest component between the two and
 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.560
largest component between the two and
the three component I've drawn it here I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570
the three component I've drawn it here I
 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.020
the three component I've drawn it here I
haven't drawn the tendrils but I'll try

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030
haven't drawn the tendrils but I'll try
 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.590
haven't drawn the tendrils but I'll try
it turns out that there's exactly five

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600
it turns out that there's exactly five
 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.540
it turns out that there's exactly five
directions that you can go from that

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550
directions that you can go from that
 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.640
directions that you can go from that
antenna and the next biggest between

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650
antenna and the next biggest between
 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.220
antenna and the next biggest between
these two if you draw the antenna I'm

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230
these two if you draw the antenna I'm
 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.930
these two if you draw the antenna I'm
not sure I can fit it in here since I

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940
not sure I can fit it in here since I
 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.920
not sure I can fit it in here since I
think you already know what the answer

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930
think you already know what the answer
 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.680
think you already know what the answer
will be is eight so if you go through

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690
will be is eight so if you go through
 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.500
will be is eight so if you go through
the Mandelbrot set and you start with

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510
the Mandelbrot set and you start with
 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.120
the Mandelbrot set and you start with
these two components the two and the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130
these two components the two and the
 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.890
these two components the two and the
three components and you look between

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900
three components and you look between
 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.410
three components and you look between
them for the next biggest component the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420
them for the next biggest component the
 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.670
them for the next biggest component the
next biggest one will be the next

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680
next biggest one will be the next
 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.910
next biggest one will be the next
Fibonacci number so I want to explain

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920
Fibonacci number so I want to explain
 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.560
Fibonacci number so I want to explain
why explain at least part of why I have

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570
why explain at least part of why I have
 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.290
why explain at least part of why I have
I bet I called this big piece the main

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300
I bet I called this big piece the main
 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.650
I bet I called this big piece the main
component it's called the main cardioid

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660
component it's called the main cardioid
 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.780
component it's called the main cardioid
it's number is one actually that's a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790
it's number is one actually that's a
 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.060
it's number is one actually that's a
really good question but it's not so

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070
really good question but it's not so
 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.270
really good question but it's not so
obvious to see from antennas so so the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280
obvious to see from antennas so so the
 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.470
obvious to see from antennas so so the
main cardioid here number one it turns

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480
main cardioid here number one it turns
 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.080
main cardioid here number one it turns
out that there's a very natural way to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090
out that there's a very natural way to
 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.390
out that there's a very natural way to
stretch this thing back into a disk

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400
stretch this thing back into a disk
 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.430
stretch this thing back into a disk
which is something we understand really

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440
which is something we understand really
 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.260
which is something we understand really
well right so this is always useful in

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270
well right so this is always useful in
 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.820
well right so this is always useful in
sort of geometry of that kind of study

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830
sort of geometry of that kind of study
 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.500
sort of geometry of that kind of study
if you can change something just a

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510
if you can change something just a
 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.940
if you can change something just a
little bit and get back to something you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950
little bit and get back to something you
 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.450
little bit and get back to something you
understand

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460
understand
 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.760
understand
really well so there's a natural way to

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770
really well so there's a natural way to
 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.939
really well so there's a natural way to
view this thing just by some stretch so

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949
view this thing just by some stretch so
 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.400
view this thing just by some stretch so
this disk maps under this stretch to a

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410
this disk maps under this stretch to a
 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.200
this disk maps under this stretch to a
cardioid and I want to look at what

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210
cardioid and I want to look at what
 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.629
cardioid and I want to look at what
happens to first of all my center point

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639
happens to first of all my center point
 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.680
happens to first of all my center point
it turns out goes to zero this ray will

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690
it turns out goes to zero this ray will
 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.800
it turns out goes to zero this ray will
map to this ray this ray is I guess zero

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810
map to this ray this ray is I guess zero
 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.110
map to this ray this ray is I guess zero
of the way around the circle right if we

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120
of the way around the circle right if we
 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.300
of the way around the circle right if we
go halfway around the circle it maps to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310
go halfway around the circle it maps to
 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.150
go halfway around the circle it maps to
this line inside the main cardioid if we

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160
this line inside the main cardioid if we
 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.580
this line inside the main cardioid if we
go say a third of the way around the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590
go say a third of the way around the
 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.189
go say a third of the way around the
circle it maps to a kind of a funny

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199
circle it maps to a kind of a funny
 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.770
circle it maps to a kind of a funny
curve inside the main cardioid and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780
curve inside the main cardioid and
 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.439
curve inside the main cardioid and
staying for two thirds and so on so you

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449
staying for two thirds and so on so you
 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.960
staying for two thirds and so on so you
can track what happens to these Ray's

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970
can track what happens to these Ray's
 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.999
can track what happens to these Ray's
under this stretch and here's the thing

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009
under this stretch and here's the thing
 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.129
under this stretch and here's the thing
is that the place where the Rays end up

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139
is that the place where the Rays end up
 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.830
is that the place where the Rays end up
in the main cardioid are exactly the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840
in the main cardioid are exactly the
 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.360
in the main cardioid are exactly the
places where it connects to these

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370
places where it connects to these
 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.510
places where it connects to these
components so here is the connection to

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520
components so here is the connection to
 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.060
components so here is the connection to
the two component and here is a

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070
the two component and here is a
 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.159
the two component and here is a
connection to that top three component

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169
connection to that top three component
 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.969
connection to that top three component
and that bottom three component we have

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979
and that bottom three component we have
 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.339
and that bottom three component we have
a five component up here in the middle

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349
a five component up here in the middle
 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.520
a five component up here in the middle
right side so there must be some five

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530
right side so there must be some five
 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.850
right side so there must be some five
ray which lands there and in fact there

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860
ray which lands there and in fact there
 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.830
ray which lands there and in fact there
is it turns out that that's the two

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840
is it turns out that that's the two
 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.020
is it turns out that that's the two
fifths of the way around the circle ray

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030
fifths of the way around the circle ray
 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.270
fifths of the way around the circle ray
and the point is that under this

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280
and the point is that under this
 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.969
and the point is that under this
stretching map the number of antennae

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979
stretching map the number of antennae
 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.469
stretching map the number of antennae
the number we assigned to each of these

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479
the number we assigned to each of these
 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.439
the number we assigned to each of these
components is the denominator of the

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449
components is the denominator of the
 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.060
components is the denominator of the
fraction that tells you how far around

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070
fraction that tells you how far around
 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.070
fraction that tells you how far around
the circle you went this question of

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080
the circle you went this question of
 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.290
the circle you went this question of
what's the largest component between any

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300
what's the largest component between any
 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.629
what's the largest component between any
two other components turns into this

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639
two other components turns into this
 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.820
two other components turns into this
totally separate question of what's the

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830
totally separate question of what's the
 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.740
totally separate question of what's the
fraction with the smallest denominator

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750
fraction with the smallest denominator
 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.950
fraction with the smallest denominator
between these two fractions why is the

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960
between these two fractions why is the
 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.580
between these two fractions why is the
five component at two fifths and not one

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590
five component at two fifths and not one
 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.730
five component at two fifths and not one
fifth or three fifths what so the one

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740
fifth or three fifths what so the one
 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.290
fifth or three fifths what so the one
that I drew is between one-third and

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300
that I drew is between one-third and
 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.029
that I drew is between one-third and
one-half and so that's the two fifths

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039
one-half and so that's the two fifths
 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.570
one-half and so that's the two fifths
but there are five components at 1/5 3/5

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580
but there are five components at 1/5 3/5
 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.370
but there are five components at 1/5 3/5
and 4/5 you're totally right so yep so

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380
and 4/5 you're totally right so yep so
 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.959
and 4/5 you're totally right so yep so
works every time with the denominators

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969
works every time with the denominators
 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:20.820
works every time with the denominators
but the point is that you can read off

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830
but the point is that you can read off
 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.200
but the point is that you can read off
these numbers in two different ways

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210
these numbers in two different ways
 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.420
these numbers in two different ways
right the antennas or the denominators

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430
right the antennas or the denominators
 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.890
right the antennas or the denominators
of the fraction for the way around the

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900
of the fraction for the way around the
 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.899
of the fraction for the way around the
circle so we're closing in on Fibonacci

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909
circle so we're closing in on Fibonacci
 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.879
circle so we're closing in on Fibonacci
so I said that okay we changed this

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889
so I said that okay we changed this
 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.469
so I said that okay we changed this
question completely to a question of

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479
question completely to a question of
 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.089
question completely to a question of
what's the fraction with the smallest

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099
what's the fraction with the smallest
 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.709
what's the fraction with the smallest
denominator between two fractions

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719
denominator between two fractions
 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:37.530
denominator between two fractions
one-third which is less than some four

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540
one-third which is less than some four
 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.470
one-third which is less than some four
action which is less than 1/2 and the

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480
action which is less than 1/2 and the
 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.420
action which is less than 1/2 and the
question is I want a small denominator

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430
question is I want a small denominator
 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.760
question is I want a small denominator
fraction or how small can it be well it

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770
fraction or how small can it be well it
 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.940
fraction or how small can it be well it
can't be 4 right because 2 over 4 is the

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950
can't be 4 right because 2 over 4 is the
 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.790
can't be 4 right because 2 over 4 is the
same as 1/2 and 1/4 is too small but it

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800
same as 1/2 and 1/4 is too small but it
 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.920
same as 1/2 and 1/4 is too small but it
can be 5 because 2/5 really is between

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930
can be 5 because 2/5 really is between
 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.030
can be 5 because 2/5 really is between
these two numbers

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.040
these two numbers
 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.010
these two numbers
okay so two fifths is the answer here

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020
okay so two fifths is the answer here
 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.050
okay so two fifths is the answer here
now what if we were to do the next one

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060
now what if we were to do the next one
 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.430
now what if we were to do the next one
the next one was asking between the

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440
the next one was asking between the
 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.260
the next one was asking between the
three and the five components right so

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270
three and the five components right so
 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.810
three and the five components right so
we want a number that's between 1/3 and

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820
we want a number that's between 1/3 and
 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.150
we want a number that's between 1/3 and
2/5 that has the smallest possible

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160
2/5 that has the smallest possible
 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.850
2/5 that has the smallest possible
denominator and again you can check six

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860
denominator and again you can check six
 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.040
denominator and again you can check six
and seven aren't going to do it it turns

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050
and seven aren't going to do it it turns
 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.710
and seven aren't going to do it it turns
out that the answer is 3/8 and in

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720
out that the answer is 3/8 and in
 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.200
out that the answer is 3/8 and in
general the crazy thing is that if your

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210
general the crazy thing is that if your
 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.030
general the crazy thing is that if your
fractions are close enough together the

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.040
fractions are close enough together the
 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.580
fractions are close enough together the
way to find one between them that has

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590
way to find one between them that has
 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.710
way to find one between them that has
the smallest denominator is just by

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720
the smallest denominator is just by
 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.130
the smallest denominator is just by
taking the median or the fairy sum or as

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:26.140
taking the median or the fairy sum or as
 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.490
taking the median or the fairy sum or as
some people refer to it freshmen sum

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500
some people refer to it freshmen sum
 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.480
some people refer to it freshmen sum
because you get it by adding together

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.490
because you get it by adding together
 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.100
because you get it by adding together
the numerators and adding together the

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110
the numerators and adding together the
 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.180
the numerators and adding together the
denominators well because I think it's

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.190
denominators well because I think it's
 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.220
denominators well because I think it's
mean actually I mean maybe a

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.230
mean actually I mean maybe a
 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.680
mean actually I mean maybe a
kindergarten son is that better that's

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:43.690
kindergarten son is that better that's
 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.080
kindergarten son is that better that's
right that's right it is a legitimate

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090
right that's right it is a legitimate
 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.420
right that's right it is a legitimate
thing I can tell you why it's bad right

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430
thing I can tell you why it's bad right
 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.010
thing I can tell you why it's bad right
so why is it a bad way to add fractions

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.020
so why is it a bad way to add fractions
 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.080
so why is it a bad way to add fractions
because it matters how you represent

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.090
because it matters how you represent
 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.060
because it matters how you represent
your fractions so if you try and add 1/3

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.070
your fractions so if you try and add 1/3
 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.950
your fractions so if you try and add 1/3
to 1/2 this way you'll get something

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.960
to 1/2 this way you'll get something
 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.990
to 1/2 this way you'll get something
different than if you add 1/3 to 2/4

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000
different than if you add 1/3 to 2/4
 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.050
different than if you add 1/3 to 2/4
right so it's not so good but it works

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.060
right so it's not so good but it works
 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.380
right so it's not so good but it works
for this it works for this right so 1/2

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:04.390
for this it works for this right so 1/2
 

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.300
for this it works for this right so 1/2
here's the symbol usually use for

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.310
here's the symbol usually use for
 

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.040
here's the symbol usually use for
medians the mediant of these two

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.050
medians the mediant of these two
 

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.680
medians the mediant of these two
fractions is just two-fifths the mediant

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:10.690
fractions is just two-fifths the mediant
 

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.600
fractions is just two-fifths the mediant
of these two fractions is 3/8 and so on

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:12.610
of these two fractions is 3/8 and so on
 

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.910
of these two fractions is 3/8 and so on
so where is Fibonacci Fibonacci is

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:14.920
so where is Fibonacci Fibonacci is
 

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.700
so where is Fibonacci Fibonacci is
because look at the fractions I started

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:17.710
because look at the fractions I started
 

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.890
because look at the fractions I started
with I started with the first two

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:19.900
with I started with the first two
 

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.780
with I started with the first two
elements of the Fibonacci sequence and

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:21.790
elements of the Fibonacci sequence and
 

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.850
elements of the Fibonacci sequence and
the third and fourth elements of the

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:23.860
the third and fourth elements of the
 

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.920
the third and fourth elements of the
Fibonacci sequence and the way I get the

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:25.930
Fibonacci sequence and the way I get the
 

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.020
Fibonacci sequence and the way I get the
next thing is by adding the other two

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.030
next thing is by adding the other two
 

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.690
next thing is by adding the other two
together and so it's exactly the rule

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:30.700
together and so it's exactly the rule
 

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.200
together and so it's exactly the rule
which defines the Fibonacci sequence

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.210
which defines the Fibonacci sequence
 

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.659
which defines the Fibonacci sequence
coming up in these fractions coming up

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:36.669
coming up in these fractions coming up
 

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.950
coming up in these fractions coming up
in their medians

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:37.960
in their medians
 

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.590
in their medians
and so coming up in the Mandelbrot set

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:39.600
and so coming up in the Mandelbrot set
 

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:54.440
and so coming up in the Mandelbrot set
