percent now you might think that that's
 

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:19.679
percent now you might think that that's
a relatively small number and in some

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:19.689
a relatively small number and in some
 

00:09:19.689 --> 00:09:22.590
a relatively small number and in some
ways it is but it happens to be the

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600
ways it is but it happens to be the
 

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.040

five point seven percent to 2.5 trillion
 

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.460
five point seven percent to 2.5 trillion
dollars that makes it one seventh of the

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:38.470
dollars that makes it one seventh of the
 

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.360

significance of this okay you you read a

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:57.220
significance of this okay you you read a
 

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.160

compiling that data which means it

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:54.630
compiling that data which means it
 

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.230
compiling that data which means it
actually may be the lowest ever because

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240

the lowest ever so what does that mean
 

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.250
the lowest ever so what does that mean
it actually means because this ratio is

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260
it actually means because this ratio is
 

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.940
it actually means because this ratio is

companies can't have access to debt

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800
companies can't have access to debt
 

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.770
companies can't have access to debt
private equity firms have highly

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780
private equity firms have highly
 

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.910
private equity firms have highly
leveraged companies and they're

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920
leveraged companies and they're
 

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.830
leveraged companies and they're
outperforming publicly traded firms

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:57.840
outperforming publicly traded firms
 

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.930
outperforming publicly traded firms
because publicly traded firms don't have

00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940
because publicly traded firms don't have
 

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.030
because publicly traded firms don't have
access to debt and great great questions

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040
access to debt and great great questions
 

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.220
access to debt and great great questions
and let's take the ladder first what I

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:04.230
and let's take the ladder first what I
 

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:08.690
and let's take the ladder first what I
showed you was the debt ratio which is

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700
showed you was the debt ratio which is
 

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.260
showed you was the debt ratio which is
different from debt the debt ratio is a

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:12.270
different from debt the debt ratio is a
 

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.410
different from debt the debt ratio is a
way to calculate essentially is the

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420
way to calculate essentially is the
 

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.700
way to calculate essentially is the
company able given all kinds of risks to

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:19.710
company able given all kinds of risks to
 

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.560
company able given all kinds of risks to
deal with those risks going forward it

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:21.570
deal with those risks going forward it
 

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.220
deal with those risks going forward it
is not a date a point that says this is

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:25.230
is not a date a point that says this is
 

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.020
is not a date a point that says this is
the level of debt that a company has so

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.030
the level of debt that a company has so
 

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.760
the level of debt that a company has so
it's a very important distinction okay

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:28.770
it's a very important distinction okay
 

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.730
it's a very important distinction okay
so that that's why we use the debt ratio

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740
so that that's why we use the debt ratio
 

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.000
so that that's why we use the debt ratio
not to show you essentially the level of

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.010
not to show you essentially the level of
 

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.830
not to show you essentially the level of
borrowing of a company but to show you

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:36.840
borrowing of a company but to show you
 

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.680
borrowing of a company but to show you
how that company is operating with the

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:39.690
how that company is operating with the
 

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.230
how that company is operating with the
debt that it has so that and by the way

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240
debt that it has so that and by the way
 

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.490
debt that it has so that and by the way
that is not an original if you will

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500
that is not an original if you will
 

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.710
that is not an original if you will
analysis that's something that I think

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720

companies that's one way to measure it

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740
companies that's one way to measure it
 

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.820
companies that's one way to measure it
now in terms of data points and where we

really in 2011 that we started to see
 

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.979
really in 2011 that we started to see
enough evidence to say this really is a

enough evidence to say this really is a
 

00:38:55.989 --> 00:38:59.670
enough evidence to say this really is a
recovery and its unmistakable so those

00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680
