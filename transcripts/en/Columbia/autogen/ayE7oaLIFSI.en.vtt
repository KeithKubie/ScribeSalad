things like that so we'll talk talking a
little bit about that but I have to be

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510
little bit about that but I have to be
 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.939
little bit about that but I have to be
honest when I first heard about this

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949
honest when I first heard about this
 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.470

the landmarks that you're going to hit

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850
the landmarks that you're going to hit
 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.110
the landmarks that you're going to hit
on your way during this course but as I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120
on your way during this course but as I
 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.520
on your way during this course but as I
read more about the open syllabus

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530
read more about the open syllabus
 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.770
read more about the open syllabus
project and looked at their website what

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780
project and looked at their website what
 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.660
project and looked at their website what
I saw and said with this this is that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670
I saw and said with this this is that
 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.510
I saw and said with this this is that
syllabi are the DNA of the teaching

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520
syllabi are the DNA of the teaching
 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.700
syllabi are the DNA of the teaching
Enterprise and I thought a little about

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710
Enterprise and I thought a little about
 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.210
Enterprise and I thought a little about
about that and like really is that is

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220
about that and like really is that is
 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.010
about that and like really is that is
that a metaphor we're going to use for

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020
that a metaphor we're going to use for
 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.110
that a metaphor we're going to use for
these things is it is it really a good

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120
these things is it is it really a good
 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.540
these things is it is it really a good
one but and I thought a little bit more

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550
one but and I thought a little bit more
 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.120
one but and I thought a little bit more
about that and it occurred to me there

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130
about that and it occurred to me there
 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.770
about that and it occurred to me there
was this quote I remember sharing on

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780
was this quote I remember sharing on
 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.840
was this quote I remember sharing on
Nova because Nova is just a wonderful

place to share things that DNA is

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179
place to share things that DNA is
 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:16.139
place to share things that DNA is
basically a parts list and if we look at

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149
basically a parts list and if we look at
 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.330
basically a parts list and if we look at
how the open syllabus projects are

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340
how the open syllabus projects are
 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.029
how the open syllabus projects are
presenting these syllabi not as open

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039
presenting these syllabi not as open
 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.639
presenting these syllabi not as open
full-text necessarily but as metadata

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649
full-text necessarily but as metadata
 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.550
full-text necessarily but as metadata
drawn from the syllabi that is in

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560
drawn from the syllabi that is in
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.830
drawn from the syllabi that is in
essence what we're getting here is a

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840
essence what we're getting here is a
 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.830
essence what we're getting here is a
parts list of what is making up these

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840
parts list of what is making up these
 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.590
parts list of what is making up these
educational endeavors right and so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600
educational endeavors right and so
 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.709
educational endeavors right and so
looking at it like this you don't know

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719
looking at it like this you don't know
 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.679
looking at it like this you don't know
you know how someone travels along that

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689
you know how someone travels along that
 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.419
you know how someone travels along that
path but you start getting a sense of

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429
path but you start getting a sense of
 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.309
path but you start getting a sense of
what those parts what are those

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319
what those parts what are those
 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.889
what those parts what are those
components that make up these courses

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899
components that make up these courses
 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.429
components that make up these courses
that makes that make up the journey

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439
that makes that make up the journey
 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.379
that makes that make up the journey
through the education and this is

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389
through the education and this is
 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.569
through the education and this is
actually really interesting because what

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579
actually really interesting because what
 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.160
actually really interesting because what
we can end up doing that is we ingest

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170
we can end up doing that is we ingest
 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.050
we can end up doing that is we ingest
all these syllabi and they go into this

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060
all these syllabi and they go into this
 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.929
all these syllabi and they go into this
database and you know then we're able to

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939
database and you know then we're able to
 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.330
database and you know then we're able to
to structure api's over this where we

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340
to structure api's over this where we
 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.480
to structure api's over this where we
can put certain queries to it and we get

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490
can put certain queries to it and we get
 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.910
can put certain queries to it and we get
answers out about this parts list and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920
answers out about this parts list and
 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.770
answers out about this parts list and
there are some some questions that have

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780
there are some some questions that have
 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.449
there are some some questions that have
already been proposed up there you know

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459
already been proposed up there you know
 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.250
already been proposed up there you know
and I think there there are others and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260
and I think there there are others and
 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.949
and I think there there are others and
the parts list kind of idea is really

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959
the parts list kind of idea is really
 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.949
the parts list kind of idea is really
fascinating because once you have all of

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959
fascinating because once you have all of
 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.550
fascinating because once you have all of
these parts what's the next really

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560
these parts what's the next really
 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.339
these parts what's the next really
interesting thing is what are people

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349
interesting thing is what are people
 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.069
interesting thing is what are people
doing with these parts it might not be

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079
doing with these parts it might not be
 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.619
doing with these parts it might not be
what you ever expected it might be

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629
what you ever expected it might be
 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.039
what you ever expected it might be
something really new and and where

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049
something really new and and where
 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.960
something really new and and where
you're really starting to build on this

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
you're really starting to build on this
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.849
you're really starting to build on this
and take advantage of this as consider

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859
and take advantage of this as consider
 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.550
and take advantage of this as consider
who are the community who's making up

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560
who are the community who's making up
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.349
who are the community who's making up
that community that you're presenting

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359
that community that you're presenting
 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.559
that community that you're presenting
these parts to and i think joe presented

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569
these parts to and i think joe presented
 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.819
these parts to and i think joe presented
this a little bit well at the very

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829
this a little bit well at the very
 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.140
this a little bit well at the very
beginning when he said well who are the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150
beginning when he said well who are the
 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.520
beginning when he said well who are the
audience's that we're dealing with right

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530
audience's that we're dealing with right
 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.440
audience's that we're dealing with right
we're dealing with educators that's some

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
we're dealing with educators that's some
 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.930
we're dealing with educators that's some
of our audiences researchers who I think

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940
of our audiences researchers who I think
 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.429
of our audiences researchers who I think
a great deal of our members are today

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439
a great deal of our members are today
 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.929
a great deal of our members are today
students I think students are a big part

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939
students I think students are a big part
 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.399
students I think students are a big part
of our audience that we really haven't

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409
of our audience that we really haven't
 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.580
of our audience that we really haven't
talked about much today for what this

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590
talked about much today for what this
 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.770
talked about much today for what this
project might mean and I was thinking

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780
project might mean and I was thinking
 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.140
project might mean and I was thinking
about there's this there's this project

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150
about there's this there's this project
 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.119
about there's this there's this project
called making it matter and they really

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129
called making it matter and they really
 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.929
called making it matter and they really
focused on how can data and link data be

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939
focused on how can data and link data be
 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.479
focused on how can data and link data be
of benefit to third world countries and

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489
of benefit to third world countries and
 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.580
of benefit to third world countries and
the educational countries I'm thinking

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590
the educational countries I'm thinking
 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.949
the educational countries I'm thinking
about that as yet or not as a possible

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959
about that as yet or not as a possible
 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.220
about that as yet or not as a possible
audience for the open syllabus project

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230
audience for the open syllabus project
 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.349
audience for the open syllabus project
and how to make these data available to

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359
and how to make these data available to
 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.039
and how to make these data available to
them as as another way to use this this

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049
them as as another way to use this this
 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.300
them as as another way to use this this
wonderful corpus that we're putting

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310
wonderful corpus that we're putting
 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.470
wonderful corpus that we're putting
together here now there are a lot of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480
together here now there are a lot of
 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.750
together here now there are a lot of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760
examples out there in the science world
 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.869
examples out there in the science world
about collections of data and the

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879
about collections of data and the
 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.520
about collections of data and the
communities that are built around data

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530
communities that are built around data
 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.710
communities that are built around data
and one of these is a protein databank

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720
and one of these is a protein databank
 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.990
and one of these is a protein databank
right and so one of the things they have

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000
right and so one of the things they have
 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.119
right and so one of the things they have
worked for ages about collecting

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129
worked for ages about collecting
 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.550
worked for ages about collecting
information about protein and protein

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560
information about protein and protein
 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.009

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019
structures and through this project of
 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.990
structures and through this project of
the protein database they've been able

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000
the protein database they've been able
 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.869
the protein database they've been able
to establish a community that

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879
to establish a community that
 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.699
to establish a community that
corresponds with each other and sees the

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709
corresponds with each other and sees the
 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.990
corresponds with each other and sees the
value in submitting these data to this

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000
value in submitting these data to this
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.449
value in submitting these data to this
general collective area right this very

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459
general collective area right this very
 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.500
general collective area right this very
focused database for in this case

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510

that again they've looked at ways to to

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859
that again they've looked at ways to to
 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.680
that again they've looked at ways to to
talk with their community and to build

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690
talk with their community and to build
 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.070
talk with their community and to build
that community in all the different ways

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080
that community in all the different ways
 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.679
that community in all the different ways
and you can see if you can if you go to

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:28.689
and you can see if you can if you go to
 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.420
and you can see if you can if you go to
that side if you can see here all the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430
that side if you can see here all the
 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.619
that side if you can see here all the
different things that they have there

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629
different things that they have there
 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.779
different things that they have there
they have electors that are built around

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789
they have electors that are built around
 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.379
they have electors that are built around
these these data they have tools they

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389
these these data they have tools they
 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.290
these these data they have tools they
have both their iOS and Android apps out

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300
have both their iOS and Android apps out
 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.510
have both their iOS and Android apps out
there for exploring all of the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520
there for exploring all of the
 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.670
there for exploring all of the
information that they've been able to

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680
information that they've been able to
 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.390
information that they've been able to
collect here and really adding value

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400
collect here and really adding value
 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.800
collect here and really adding value
value to that type of information as

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810
value to that type of information as
 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.330
value to that type of information as
well which I think is one of the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340
well which I think is one of the
 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.770
well which I think is one of the
foundations for having you develop a

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780
foundations for having you develop a
 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.510
foundations for having you develop a
community and he's not gonna build

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520
community and he's not gonna build
 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.770
community and he's not gonna build
around something it doesn't have any

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
around something it doesn't have any
 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.659
around something it doesn't have any
value for anyone so that's one of the

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669
value for anyone so that's one of the
 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.399
value for anyone so that's one of the
ideas that would encourage everyone here

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409
ideas that would encourage everyone here
 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.730
ideas that would encourage everyone here
to think about especially going into the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740
to think about especially going into the
 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.439
to think about especially going into the
hackathon tomorrow the non-technical

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449
hackathon tomorrow the non-technical
 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.439
hackathon tomorrow the non-technical
half decide about the ideas that you can

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449
half decide about the ideas that you can
 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.770
half decide about the ideas that you can
develop around so really who are our

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780
develop around so really who are our
 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.379
develop around so really who are our
audiences and what things might they

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389
audiences and what things might they
 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.839
audiences and what things might they
find useful out of this and I'm going to

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849
find useful out of this and I'm going to
 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.839
find useful out of this and I'm going to
talk a little bit about more about that

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849
talk a little bit about more about that
 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.760
talk a little bit about more about that
because I think one of the the other

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770
because I think one of the the other
 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.339
because I think one of the the other
ways of building community is making

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349
ways of building community is making
 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.559
ways of building community is making
sure that not only do people find value

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569
sure that not only do people find value
 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:26.730
sure that not only do people find value
in the work that you're doing but the

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740
in the work that you're doing but the
 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.959
in the work that you're doing but the
people who are doing the work are

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969
people who are doing the work are
 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.519
people who are doing the work are
getting credit for the work that they're

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529
getting credit for the work that they're
 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.510
getting credit for the work that they're
doing and I'll talk a little bit about

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520
doing and I'll talk a little bit about
 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.839
doing and I'll talk a little bit about
that later on but one of the first steps

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849
that later on but one of the first steps
 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.760
that later on but one of the first steps
to building this community and having

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770
to building this community and having
 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.619
to building this community and having
all of these data types work together is

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629
all of these data types work together is
 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.749
all of these data types work together is
interoperability right the gears have to

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759
interoperability right the gears have to
 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.959
interoperability right the gears have to
mesh together and I think part of part

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969
mesh together and I think part of part
 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.939
mesh together and I think part of part
of this is being worked on through the

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949
of this is being worked on through the
 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.129
of this is being worked on through the
type of database that's been set up the

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139
type of database that's been set up the
 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.279
type of database that's been set up the
the denotes equal amount Mongo database

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289
the denotes equal amount Mongo database
 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.010
the denotes equal amount Mongo database
that's being used and that idea of a

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020
that's being used and that idea of a
 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.019
that's being used and that idea of a
flexible schema structure that's being

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029
flexible schema structure that's being
 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:56.730
flexible schema structure that's being
built around that so we're not locked

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740
built around that so we're not locked
 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.769
built around that so we're not locked
into one thing but different parts of

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779
into one thing but different parts of
 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.110
into one thing but different parts of
information can be pulled out for

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120
information can be pulled out for
 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.230
information can be pulled out for
different queries and different research

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240
different queries and different research
 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.219
different queries and different research
questions that can be asked but one of

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229
questions that can be asked but one of
 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.589
questions that can be asked but one of
the important parts about this is that

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599
the important parts about this is that
 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.290
the important parts about this is that
to think about and to keep in mind that

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300
to think about and to keep in mind that
 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.110
to think about and to keep in mind that
when you are performing research on

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120
when you are performing research on
 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.790
when you are performing research on
these data that you want to be able to

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800
these data that you want to be able to
 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.950
these data that you want to be able to
not just for your own concern to go back

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960
not just for your own concern to go back
 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.930
not just for your own concern to go back
and see but what's that question that I

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940
and see but what's that question that I
 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.879
and see but what's that question that I
asked and what did I ask that question

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889
asked and what did I ask that question
 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.129
asked and what did I ask that question
of and this goes back to the point that

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139
of and this goes back to the point that
 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.680
of and this goes back to the point that
Jonah brought up earlier today about so

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690
Jonah brought up earlier today about so
 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.469
Jonah brought up earlier today about so
we have this constantly evolving set of

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479
we have this constantly evolving set of
 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.079
we have this constantly evolving set of
information how do you how do you

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:34.089
information how do you how do you
 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:38.129
information how do you how do you
identify what that was when you ask your

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139
identify what that was when you ask your
 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.129
identify what that was when you ask your
question of it how can you go back and

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139
question of it how can you go back and
 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.020
question of it how can you go back and
confirm that you'd get the same question

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030
confirm that you'd get the same question
 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.239
confirm that you'd get the same question
or that your algorithm works in the same

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:45.249
or that your algorithm works in the same
 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:47.249
or that your algorithm works in the same
way and so these are some of the issues

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:47.259
way and so these are some of the issues
 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:50.489
way and so these are some of the issues
I encourage you to think about as when

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:50.499
I encourage you to think about as when
 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:52.409
I encourage you to think about as when
you think about this corpora as a data

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419
you think about this corpora as a data
 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.749
you think about this corpora as a data
set in and of itself is how do you

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759
set in and of itself is how do you
 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:57.239
set in and of itself is how do you
uniquely identify what you ask the

00:06:57.239 --> 00:06:57.249
uniquely identify what you ask the
 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:59.790
uniquely identify what you ask the
question of how do you really CLE

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800
question of how do you really CLE
 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.719
question of how do you really CLE
identify what your question was

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729
identify what your question was
 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:06.179
identify what your question was
because if for instance you're you're

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:06.189
because if for instance you're you're
 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:07.860
because if for instance you're you're
asking your question through a coding a

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870
asking your question through a coding a
 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.700
asking your question through a coding a
coded query right and languages change

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710
coded query right and languages change
 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.209
coded query right and languages change
so you want to be able to document all

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:15.219
so you want to be able to document all
 

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:16.980
so you want to be able to document all
of these things and always keep in mind

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990
of these things and always keep in mind
 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.499
of these things and always keep in mind

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310
metadata is a love note to the future
 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.939
metadata is a love note to the future
we're not just talking about the

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:23.949
we're not just talking about the
 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.760
we're not just talking about the
metadata associated with that data set

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:26.770
metadata associated with that data set
 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.249
metadata associated with that data set
right we're also talking about how are

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:29.259
right we're also talking about how are
 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.420
right we're also talking about how are
you describing how you ask your question

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430
you describing how you ask your question
 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.249
you describing how you ask your question
what part of that data set did you ask

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:35.259
what part of that data set did you ask
 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:37.469
what part of that data set did you ask
the question of was it the whole dataset

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479
the question of was it the whole dataset
 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:39.719
the question of was it the whole dataset
was a part of the data set was it the

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:39.729
was a part of the data set was it the
 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:42.360
was a part of the data set was it the
data set at a certain date and time what

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.370
data set at a certain date and time what
 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.179
data set at a certain date and time what
were the the software that were in

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:45.189
were the the software that were in
 

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:46.980
were the the software that were in
operation at that point around the data

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:46.990
operation at that point around the data
 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.450
operation at that point around the data
set and I think Dennis had brought up

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.460
set and I think Dennis had brought up
 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.209
set and I think Dennis had brought up
that they take snapshots of the database

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:51.219
that they take snapshots of the database
 

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:53.399
that they take snapshots of the database
and I don't see them up there since they

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:53.409
and I don't see them up there since they
 

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:55.679
and I don't see them up there since they
take snapshots Kenneth right of the

00:07:55.679 --> 00:07:55.689
take snapshots Kenneth right of the
 

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:58.019
take snapshots Kenneth right of the
database so weekly or daily or things

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:58.029
database so weekly or daily or things
 

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:00.179
database so weekly or daily or things
like that so one of the things I would

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:00.189
like that so one of the things I would
 

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:01.439
like that so one of the things I would
encourage you to think about is when

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:01.449
encourage you to think about is when
 

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:03.749
encourage you to think about is when
taking those snapshots don't just take

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759
taking those snapshots don't just take
 

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:06.059
taking those snapshots don't just take
that snapshot give that snapshot and

00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:06.069
that snapshot give that snapshot and
 

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.519
that snapshot give that snapshot and
identifier so someone at some point can

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:08.529
identifier so someone at some point can
 

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.769
identifier so someone at some point can
go back in time and say I asked the

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:10.779
go back in time and say I asked the
 

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:13.379
go back in time and say I asked the
question of this this snapshot right

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:13.389
question of this this snapshot right
 

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:15.420
question of this this snapshot right
here not this one over here but this one

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:15.430
here not this one over here but this one
 

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.029
here not this one over here but this one
right here so that you can not only go

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039
right here so that you can not only go
 

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.999
right here so that you can not only go
back and replicate your answers but also

00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:21.009
back and replicate your answers but also
 

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:24.240
back and replicate your answers but also
do really informed comparisons of how is

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:24.250
do really informed comparisons of how is
 

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.800
do really informed comparisons of how is
the data is it different when you ask

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:25.810
the data is it different when you ask
 

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.300
the data is it different when you ask
that same question of it and how does

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:27.310
that same question of it and how does
 

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.159
that same question of it and how does
influence how your results are different

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:29.169
influence how your results are different
 

00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:31.409
influence how your results are different
so something to think about as we move

00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:31.419
so something to think about as we move
 

00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:34.709
so something to think about as we move
this project forward now one of the

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719
this project forward now one of the
 

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:38.969
this project forward now one of the
other things that we always we're

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:38.979
other things that we always we're
 

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:40.980
other things that we always we're
dealing with every day as a challenge no

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:40.990
dealing with every day as a challenge no
 

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.509
dealing with every day as a challenge no
matter what we're doing is academics is

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519

one of that revolution right one of you

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:46.149
one of that revolution right one of you
 

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:48.420
one of that revolution right one of you
know how are you getting credit how is

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.430
know how are you getting credit how is
 

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.130

is needed at every single step of the
 

00:08:58.299 --> 00:09:00.599
is needed at every single step of the
way and I think this is really an

00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:00.609
way and I think this is really an
 

00:09:00.609 --> 00:09:02.280

we'll be moving to the full collection
 

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.750
we'll be moving to the full collection
in the next few months and and that

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760
in the next few months and and that
 

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.110
in the next few months and and that
really took a lot of security auditing

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120
really took a lot of security auditing
 

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.880
really took a lot of security auditing
around what we're doing so we could

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:05.890
around what we're doing so we could
 

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.230
around what we're doing so we could
prove the University of Michigan that we

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240

and that's the kind of thing that you
 

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.240

where your umbrella support is I worked

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:39.770
where your umbrella support is I worked
 

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.170
where your umbrella support is I worked
with a lot of projects on the

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:41.180
with a lot of projects on the
 

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.030
with a lot of projects on the
sustainability issue groups like the

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:43.040

Hadi Trust is still in there an umbrella

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:51.140
Hadi Trust is still in there an umbrella
 

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.780

of the University of Michigan I think

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:52.790
of the University of Michigan I think
 

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.790
of the University of Michigan I think
that's a real viable path for a lot of

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:54.800
that's a real viable path for a lot of
 

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.280
that's a real viable path for a lot of
things and I think that's one that

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:57.290
things and I think that's one that
 

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.380
things and I think that's one that
everyone should consider other places

00:19:59.380 --> 00:19:59.390
everyone should consider other places
 

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:00.820
everyone should consider other places
for a while we're trying to build their

think that's a bad idea if you can find

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:05.030
think that's a bad idea if you can find
 

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.940
think that's a bad idea if you can find
one that could support you with the

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:06.950
one that could support you with the
 

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.920
one that could support you with the
right umbrella both for you know what

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:08.930
right umbrella both for you know what
 

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.750
right umbrella both for you know what
you need internally to do your work

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.760
you need internally to do your work
 

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.000
you need internally to do your work
whether it's your setups for your

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.010
whether it's your setups for your
 

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.310
whether it's your setups for your
repositories and your communications and

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320
repositories and your communications and
 

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.750
repositories and your communications and
your confluence kind of stuff for your

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760
your confluence kind of stuff for your
 

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.580
your confluence kind of stuff for your
developers and then whether they have

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:18.590
developers and then whether they have
 

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.250
developers and then whether they have
ongoing user group meetings that you can

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:21.260
ongoing user group meetings that you can
 

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.900
ongoing user group meetings that you can
piggyback on to so you can get the cost

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:22.910
piggyback on to so you can get the cost
 

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.090
piggyback on to so you can get the cost
down to get you know to have longer-term

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.100
down to get you know to have longer-term
 

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.850
down to get you know to have longer-term
user group meetings those are all key

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:27.860
user group meetings those are all key
 

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.360
user group meetings those are all key
things and so my big lessons out of all

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:31.370
things and so my big lessons out of all
 

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.920
things and so my big lessons out of all
of this is think before you build which

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:32.930
of this is think before you build which
 

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.530
of this is think before you build which
you guys have obviously done build for a

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:35.540
you guys have obviously done build for a
 

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.180
you guys have obviously done build for a
production service model even if you're

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:37.190
production service model even if you're
 

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.590
production service model even if you're
not doing it right away think you know

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600
not doing it right away think you know
 

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.810
not doing it right away think you know
how about in mind a plan for it enable a

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:40.820
how about in mind a plan for it enable a
 

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.340
how about in mind a plan for it enable a
diversity ecosystem for support and that

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:42.350
diversity ecosystem for support and that
 

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.200
diversity ecosystem for support and that
really means figuring out who in the

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:44.210
really means figuring out who in the
 

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.390
really means figuring out who in the
commercial community might be part of

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400
commercial community might be part of
 

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.190
commercial community might be part of
that ecosystem because out of all these

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200
that ecosystem because out of all these
 

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.570
that ecosystem because out of all these
groups that I've worked with every time

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:49.580
groups that I've worked with every time
 

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.090
groups that I've worked with every time
the ones that seem to have the longest

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:52.100
the ones that seem to have the longest
 

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.430
the ones that seem to have the longest
life in them really have found the right

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440
life in them really have found the right
 

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.860
life in them really have found the right
kind of niches to support services from

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:56.870
kind of niches to support services from
 

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.300
kind of niches to support services from
a commercial element that are around

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:58.310
a commercial element that are around
 

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.430
a commercial element that are around
them and they still remain open they

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440
them and they still remain open they
 

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.960
them and they still remain open they
still remain community stores or open

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:01.970
still remain community stores or open
 

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.220
still remain community stores or open
source whatever they're doing with their

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:03.230
source whatever they're doing with their
 

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.870
source whatever they're doing with their
software but they're finding the right

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880
software but they're finding the right
 

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.730
software but they're finding the right
kind of service providers and and

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:06.740
kind of service providers and and
 

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.500
kind of service providers and and
sometimes you know that it's not always

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:08.510
sometimes you know that it's not always
 

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.700
sometimes you know that it's not always
the first people that talk to you it's

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:09.710
the first people that talk to you it's
 

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.830
the first people that talk to you it's
the third or fourth or fifth that become

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840
the third or fourth or fifth that become
 

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.810
the third or fourth or fifth that become
that ecosystem and then the diversity of

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:13.820
that ecosystem and then the diversity of
 

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.540
that ecosystem and then the diversity of
funding streams so that was really quick

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:16.550
funding streams so that was really quick
 

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.060
funding streams so that was really quick
but it also kind of highlighted a lot of

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.070
but it also kind of highlighted a lot of
 

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.380
but it also kind of highlighted a lot of
great things were going on here today

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:20.390
great things were going on here today
 

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.000
great things were going on here today
that I heard you know from all these

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.010
that I heard you know from all these
 

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.430
that I heard you know from all these
great talks that we've seen some

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440
great talks that we've seen some
 

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.519
great talks that we've seen some
or so we can have questions or we can

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:26.529
or so we can have questions or we can
 

00:21:26.529 --> 00:21:28.289
or so we can have questions or we can
move on to the next speaker

00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:28.299
move on to the next speaker
 

00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:35.879
move on to the next speaker
possibly yeah the the raw data so the

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:35.889
possibly yeah the the raw data so the
 

00:21:35.889 --> 00:21:38.759
possibly yeah the the raw data so the
raw data all came an aggregate from

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:38.769
raw data all came an aggregate from
 

00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:42.720
raw data all came an aggregate from
Google scans from basically the project

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:42.730
Google scans from basically the project
 

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.220
Google scans from basically the project
that they set up originally for Google

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:44.230
that they set up originally for Google
 

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.049
that they set up originally for Google
Books and and the idea was to say in the

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:46.059
Books and and the idea was to say in the
 

00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:48.090
Books and and the idea was to say in the
University of Michigan library and fall

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:48.100
University of Michigan library and fall
 

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.399
University of Michigan library and fall
now the interesting part about that

00:21:50.399 --> 00:21:50.409
now the interesting part about that
 

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:52.169
now the interesting part about that
anytime you want to do that to a library

00:21:52.169 --> 00:21:52.179
anytime you want to do that to a library
 

00:21:52.179 --> 00:21:53.730
anytime you want to do that to a library
there's always gonna be something that

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:53.740
there's always gonna be something that
 

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.619
there's always gonna be something that
was missing it wasn't collected at the

00:21:55.619 --> 00:21:55.629
was missing it wasn't collected at the
 

00:21:55.629 --> 00:21:57.600
was missing it wasn't collected at the
right period of time it got lost along

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:57.610
right period of time it got lost along
 

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.519
right period of time it got lost along
the way so then when they started having

00:21:59.519 --> 00:21:59.529
the way so then when they started having
 

00:21:59.529 --> 00:22:01.590
the way so then when they started having
their other partner members like the

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600
their other partner members like the
 

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.409
their other partner members like the
libraries of the Big Ten CIC grew they

00:22:04.409 --> 00:22:04.419
libraries of the Big Ten CIC grew they
 

00:22:04.419 --> 00:22:06.060
libraries of the Big Ten CIC grew they
started doing collection analysis on it

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:06.070
started doing collection analysis on it
 

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.409
started doing collection analysis on it
saying okay we have all of this but

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:07.419
saying okay we have all of this but
 

00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:08.639
saying okay we have all of this but
we're missing these so they started

00:22:08.639 --> 00:22:08.649
we're missing these so they started
 

00:22:08.649 --> 00:22:09.899
we're missing these so they started
looking at the other libraries that had

00:22:09.899 --> 00:22:09.909
looking at the other libraries that had
 

00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:10.529
looking at the other libraries that had
them

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:10.539
them
 

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:12.899
them
aiyoo for instance for two years we had

00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:12.909
aiyoo for instance for two years we had
 

00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:15.720
aiyoo for instance for two years we had
a couple of truckloads a month that went

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:15.730
a couple of truckloads a month that went
 

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.460
a couple of truckloads a month that went
to the scanning facility and most of

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:17.470
to the scanning facility and most of
 

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.899
to the scanning facility and most of
that was just to fill in the gaps of

00:22:18.899 --> 00:22:18.909
that was just to fill in the gaps of
 

00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:20.310
that was just to fill in the gaps of
what was either not on the shelf or

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320
what was either not on the shelf or
 

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.080
what was either not on the shelf or
missing long term and Michigan's library

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.090
missing long term and Michigan's library
 

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.570
missing long term and Michigan's library
that kind of thing and then there are

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:24.580
that kind of thing and then there are
 

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.840
that kind of thing and then there are
also copies of books that were done by

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:27.850
also copies of books that were done by
 

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.389
also copies of books that were done by
individual libraries that were collected

00:22:30.389 --> 00:22:30.399
individual libraries that were collected
 

00:22:30.399 --> 00:22:32.419
individual libraries that were collected
by hoti trust and that was one of the

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:32.429
by hoti trust and that was one of the
 

00:22:32.429 --> 00:22:35.340
by hoti trust and that was one of the
incentives for membership was not only

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:35.350
incentives for membership was not only
 

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.860
incentives for membership was not only
did you get the aggregate access

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:37.870
did you get the aggregate access
 

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.049
did you get the aggregate access
long-term and storage for preservation

00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:40.059
long-term and storage for preservation
 

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:42.240
long-term and storage for preservation
for the google books collection but you

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.250
for the google books collection but you
 

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.889
for the google books collection but you
could add to that for volumes that

00:22:43.889 --> 00:22:43.899
could add to that for volumes that
 

00:22:43.899 --> 00:22:45.269
could add to that for volumes that
weren't already there that you might

00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279
weren't already there that you might
 

00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:47.490
weren't already there that you might
have already scanned from work you had

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:47.500
have already scanned from work you had
 

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.409
have already scanned from work you had
done previously for digital libraries so

00:22:49.409 --> 00:22:49.419
done previously for digital libraries so
 

00:22:49.419 --> 00:22:50.909
done previously for digital libraries so
that's that's really where all the raw

00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919
that's that's really where all the raw
 

00:22:50.919 --> 00:22:58.500
that's that's really where all the raw
data is coming from there

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:58.510
 
 

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.890
 
so right now you know the the stuff with

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:02.900
so right now you know the the stuff with
 

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.020
so right now you know the the stuff with
Google is trickling down but we're using

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.030
Google is trickling down but we're using
 

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.580
Google is trickling down but we're using
the same interface that they developed

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:06.590
the same interface that they developed
 

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.500
the same interface that they developed
which is called dren and that's how the

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:08.510
which is called dren and that's how the
 

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.810
which is called dren and that's how the
libraries continue to contribute volumes

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:10.820
libraries continue to contribute volumes
 

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:17.650
libraries continue to contribute volumes
that they're scanning moving forward no

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:17.660
that they're scanning moving forward no
 

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.460
that they're scanning moving forward no
no this is this all came from basically

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:20.470
no this is this all came from basically
 

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.200
no this is this all came from basically
you know a scanning process similar to

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.210
you know a scanning process similar to
 

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.610
you know a scanning process similar to
what Internet Archive does with their

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:24.620
what Internet Archive does with their
 

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.950
what Internet Archive does with their
book scanning but Google has some twists

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960
book scanning but Google has some twists
 

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.600
book scanning but Google has some twists
and turns on that that made it more

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:28.610
and turns on that that made it more
 

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.520
and turns on that that made it more
efficient that's of course Google

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:30.530
efficient that's of course Google
 

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:34.420
efficient that's of course Google
property so what but it's an interesting

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:34.430
property so what but it's an interesting
 

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:42.130
property so what but it's an interesting
process yeah alright and we've got the

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:42.140
process yeah alright and we've got the
 

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.140
process yeah alright and we've got the
same we got a slide deck and this was

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:44.150
same we got a slide deck and this was
 

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:51.900
same we got a slide deck and this was
going to just slide over if that's okay

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:51.910
 
 

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.790
 
okay yeah

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:54.800
okay yeah
 

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.870
okay yeah
I had trouble kind of 20 more times so

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880
I had trouble kind of 20 more times so
 

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:17.040
I had trouble kind of 20 more times so
I'm just

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.050
 
 

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:20.740
 
yeah open learning analytics is one of

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:20.750
yeah open learning analytics is one of
 

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.600
yeah open learning analytics is one of
the initiators that we are associated

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:22.610
the initiators that we are associated
 

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.420
the initiators that we are associated
with it's it's it's kind of a combined

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.430
with it's it's it's kind of a combined
 

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.180
with it's it's it's kind of a combined
effort between two groups I just started

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:28.190
effort between two groups I just started
 

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.960
effort between two groups I just started
out recently a pareo Foundation is one

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:31.970
out recently a pareo Foundation is one
 

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.960
out recently a pareo Foundation is one
of the groups and I'm wearing a pareo

the various domains like the five
 

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.020
the various domains like the five
domains in terms of open models and you

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:50.030
domains in terms of open models and you
 

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.000
domains in terms of open models and you
know open to software what goes into

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.010

related to that so it's pretty much the
same setting the core concept so it

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760
same setting the core concept so it
 

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.590

next thing I'll show you is that the
 

00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:21.609
next thing I'll show you is that the

development of syllabi our tool are

00:48:28.029 --> 00:48:28.039
development of syllabi our tool are
 

00:48:28.039 --> 00:48:30.579
development of syllabi our tool are
largely based on a template structure so

00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:30.589
largely based on a template structure so
 

00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:32.529
largely based on a template structure so
the Provost will fill out a piece of the

00:48:32.529 --> 00:48:32.539
the Provost will fill out a piece of the
 

00:48:32.539 --> 00:48:34.239
the Provost will fill out a piece of the
syllabus and then Dean's can fill out

00:48:34.239 --> 00:48:34.249
syllabus and then Dean's can fill out
 

00:48:34.249 --> 00:48:35.709
syllabus and then Dean's can fill out
more pieces of the syllabus and then a

00:48:35.709 --> 00:48:35.719
more pieces of the syllabus and then a
 

00:48:35.719 --> 00:48:37.059
more pieces of the syllabus and then a
curricula person fills out more pieces

00:48:37.059 --> 00:48:37.069
curricula person fills out more pieces
 

00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:39.339

but we call them items you've got
 

00:48:49.699 --> 00:48:51.129
but we call them items you've got
description materials and so we have a

00:48:51.129 --> 00:48:51.139
description materials and so we have a
 

00:48:51.139 --> 00:48:52.659
description materials and so we have a
structure that we can discuss maybe

00:48:52.659 --> 00:48:52.669
structure that we can discuss maybe
 

00:48:52.669 --> 00:48:55.629
structure that we can discuss maybe
tomorrow and how well this this fits but

when I go to edit a given syllabus we

00:49:01.779 --> 00:49:01.789
when I go to edit a given syllabus we
 

00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:03.879
when I go to edit a given syllabus we
have this side-by-side experience and is

00:49:03.879 --> 00:49:03.889
have this side-by-side experience and is
 

00:49:03.889 --> 00:49:05.319

you can imagine that every one of these

00:49:12.219 --> 00:49:12.229
you can imagine that every one of these
 

00:49:12.229 --> 00:49:14.109
you can imagine that every one of these

bottom for institutional policies so for

00:50:03.879 --> 00:50:03.889
bottom for institutional policies so for
 

00:50:03.889 --> 00:50:04.929
bottom for institutional policies so for
each of these given items you can

00:50:04.929 --> 00:50:04.939
each of these given items you can
 

00:50:04.939 --> 00:50:06.939
each of these given items you can
determine should an instructor be able

00:50:06.939 --> 00:50:06.949
determine should an instructor be able
 

00:50:06.949 --> 00:50:08.649
determine should an instructor be able
to come in here edit that piece not that

00:50:08.649 --> 00:50:08.659
to come in here edit that piece not that
 

00:50:08.659 --> 00:50:10.689
to come in here edit that piece not that
piece should they get a default for it

00:50:10.689 --> 00:50:10.699
piece should they get a default for it
 

00:50:10.699 --> 00:50:12.339
piece should they get a default for it
and then be able to embellish it those

00:50:12.339 --> 00:50:12.349
and then be able to embellish it those
 

00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:16.029
and then be able to embellish it those
sorts of things okay so I'm getting

00:50:16.029 --> 00:50:16.039
sorts of things okay so I'm getting
 

00:50:16.039 --> 00:50:17.799
sorts of things okay so I'm getting
close to wrapping up here I know I

00:50:17.799 --> 00:50:17.809
close to wrapping up here I know I
 

00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:18.710
close to wrapping up here I know I
talked about

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720
talked about
 

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.320
talked about
let's briefly me and I won't go more

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:21.330
let's briefly me and I won't go more
 

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.940
let's briefly me and I won't go more
into that at this point but again it's

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:22.950
into that at this point but again it's
 

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:24.740
into that at this point but again it's
this type of structure where you can

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:24.750
this type of structure where you can
 

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:27.770
this type of structure where you can
build this tree if you will of syllabus

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:27.780
build this tree if you will of syllabus
 

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.780
build this tree if you will of syllabus
documents and that's how most why most

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:29.790
documents and that's how most why most
 

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:31.820
documents and that's how most why most
institutions are interested but I'm

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:31.830
institutions are interested but I'm
 

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:33.950
institutions are interested but I'm
gonna finish up here by showcasing our

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960
gonna finish up here by showcasing our
 

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.839
gonna finish up here by showcasing our
reporting tool so when I pick an item

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:35.849
reporting tool so when I pick an item
 

00:50:35.849 --> 00:50:36.890
reporting tool so when I pick an item
report this is going to demonstrate

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900
report this is going to demonstrate
 

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.900
report this is going to demonstrate
essentially what the full tree looks

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:38.910
essentially what the full tree looks
 

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.750
essentially what the full tree looks
like for this particular instance and at

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760
like for this particular instance and at
 

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.490
like for this particular instance and at
this point if I wanted to get outcomes I

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:43.500
this point if I wanted to get outcomes I
 

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.050
this point if I wanted to get outcomes I
would click on outcomes I click Next and

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060
would click on outcomes I click Next and
 

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.609
would click on outcomes I click Next and
then presented with our search tool you

00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619
then presented with our search tool you
 

00:50:46.619 --> 00:50:48.710
then presented with our search tool you
can do full sex search for me here or if

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720
can do full sex search for me here or if
 

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.000
can do full sex search for me here or if
you want to you can drop down this

you want to you can drop down this
 

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:51.380
you want to you can drop down this
advanced menu and you get to the some of

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:51.390
advanced menu and you get to the some of
 

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.240
advanced menu and you get to the some of
the more typical parameters like what

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:53.250
the more typical parameters like what
 

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.940
the more typical parameters like what
semester it was offered when instructor

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:54.950
semester it was offered when instructor
 

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.320

in this case I'm just going to search

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:57.330
in this case I'm just going to search
 

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.470
in this case I'm just going to search
for everything and I'm gonna against all

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480
for everything and I'm gonna against all
 

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.300
for everything and I'm gonna against all
these results I'm gonna say I want just

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:02.310
these results I'm gonna say I want just
 

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:04.970
these results I'm gonna say I want just
the outcomes and here it wasn't a table

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:04.980
the outcomes and here it wasn't a table
 

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.140
the outcomes and here it wasn't a table
of just the outcomes that are

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:06.150
of just the outcomes that are
 

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:07.730
of just the outcomes that are
represented on that given syllabus and

if you want more information and there
 

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:10.849
if you want more information and there
are many more columns to this you can

detail so that's the end of the formal

00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119
detail so that's the end of the formal
 

00:51:18.119 --> 00:51:21.410

demo I guess I think I may have wrong

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420
demo I guess I think I may have wrong
 

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:25.730

direction so I want to talk just these

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740
direction so I want to talk just these
 

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.780
direction so I want to talk just these
three points about what we've learned

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:26.790
three points about what we've learned
 

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:30.020
three points about what we've learned
and then wrap up so one we're a business

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:30.030
and then wrap up so one we're a business
 

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:32.320
and then wrap up so one we're a business
that's true but we absolutely

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:32.330
that's true but we absolutely
 

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.170
that's true but we absolutely
underestimated how much how it is to

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180
underestimated how much how it is to
 

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.870
underestimated how much how it is to
sell to not only institution I mean we

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880
sell to not only institution I mean we
 

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.579
sell to not only institution I mean we
were going first after instructors but

00:51:40.579 --> 00:51:40.589
were going first after instructors but
 

00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:41.780
were going first after instructors but
institutions as a whole

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:41.790
institutions as a whole
 

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:45.890
institutions as a whole
very very very challenging syllabi come

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900
very very very challenging syllabi come
 

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.240
very very very challenging syllabi come
and all say shapes and sizes we've

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:47.250
and all say shapes and sizes we've
 

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.170
and all say shapes and sizes we've
talked about that today

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180
talked about that today
 

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.390
talked about that today
I do sincerely believe that

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400
I do sincerely believe that
 

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.400
I do sincerely believe that
standardization has its value but it

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:52.410
standardization has its value but it
 

00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:53.660
standardization has its value but it
certainly does not come easily or

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:53.670
certainly does not come easily or
 

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:55.130
certainly does not come easily or
naturally it's where we spend most of

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140
naturally it's where we spend most of
 

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.480
naturally it's where we spend most of
our implementation energy because you

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:56.490
our implementation energy because you
 

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:58.339
our implementation energy because you
have to imagine a provost has to be

00:51:58.339 --> 00:51:58.349
have to imagine a provost has to be
 

00:51:58.349 --> 00:52:00.349
have to imagine a provost has to be
willing to say it's going to be called

00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359
willing to say it's going to be called
 

00:52:00.359 --> 00:52:01.970
willing to say it's going to be called
outcomes it's not going to be called

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980
outcomes it's not going to be called
 

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.260
outcomes it's not going to be called
learning outcomes it's not gonna be

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:03.270
learning outcomes it's not gonna be
 

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:06.530
learning outcomes it's not gonna be
called objectives and that is you know a

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540
called objectives and that is you know a
 

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.960
called objectives and that is you know a
discussion in and of you know five

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:08.970
discussion in and of you know five
 

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.000
discussion in and of you know five
meetings of a faculty committee just to

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:11.010
meetings of a faculty committee just to
 

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:12.950
meetings of a faculty committee just to
come up with if it's outcomes learning

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960
come up with if it's outcomes learning
 

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:17.450
come up with if it's outcomes learning
outcomes whatever so I think that it is

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.460
outcomes whatever so I think that it is
 

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.540
outcomes whatever so I think that it is
absolutely important to utilize a common

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:20.550
absolutely important to utilize a common
 

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:22.190
absolutely important to utilize a common
taxonomy because I really think this

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200
taxonomy because I really think this
 

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.410
taxonomy because I really think this
could be you hugely beneficial how easy

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420
could be you hugely beneficial how easy
 

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:26.300
could be you hugely beneficial how easy
it is to actually develop that type of

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:26.310
it is to actually develop that type of
 

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:29.420
it is to actually develop that type of
taxonomy is is a different question but

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:29.430
taxonomy is is a different question but
 

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:30.770
taxonomy is is a different question but
that's certainly you know one of the

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780
that's certainly you know one of the
 

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.750
that's certainly you know one of the
things that we've learned so to wrap up

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760
things that we've learned so to wrap up
 

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.300
things that we've learned so to wrap up
we remain available to help largely of

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:35.310
we remain available to help largely of
 

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:36.470
we remain available to help largely of
course interested in the technology

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480
course interested in the technology
 

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.180
course interested in the technology
elements even though we can speak to

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:38.190
elements even though we can speak to
 

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:40.460
elements even though we can speak to
many of these different topics access to

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:40.470
many of these different topics access to
 

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.680
many of these different topics access to
a congress platform is on the table and

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:42.690
a congress platform is on the table and
 

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:44.570
a congress platform is on the table and
i think maybe the most interesting thing

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:44.580
i think maybe the most interesting thing
 

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.000
i think maybe the most interesting thing
would be to develop an actual standard

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:47.010
would be to develop an actual standard
 

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.220
would be to develop an actual standard
for the interchange of structured

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:49.230
for the interchange of structured
 

00:52:49.230 --> 00:53:00.670
for the interchange of structured
syllabus data so any questions for me

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:00.680
 
 

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.720
 
it's somewhere in the order of two to

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:02.730
it's somewhere in the order of two to
 

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:04.970
it's somewhere in the order of two to
three hundred thousand and again these

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:04.980
three hundred thousand and again these
 

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.070
three hundred thousand and again these
are all structured documents so the

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:07.080
are all structured documents so the
 

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:11.720
are all structured documents so the
level of detail is quite deep and we

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:11.730
level of detail is quite deep and we
 

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.370
level of detail is quite deep and we
also know that there is far less

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380
also know that there is far less
 

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.960
also know that there is far less
duplication than there might be in these

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:14.970
duplication than there might be in these
 

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:24.890
duplication than there might be in these
other efforts why is selling to

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:24.900
other efforts why is selling to
 

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:30.050
other efforts why is selling to
education hard well you need a lot of

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:30.060
education hard well you need a lot of
 

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.260
education hard well you need a lot of
consensus a lot of buy-in they if you

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:33.270
consensus a lot of buy-in they if you
 

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.710
consensus a lot of buy-in they if you
think of it purely in the business sense

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:35.720
think of it purely in the business sense
 

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.849
think of it purely in the business sense
you would think that they have a lot of

00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:37.859
you would think that they have a lot of
 

00:53:37.859 --> 00:53:39.500
you would think that they have a lot of
money but oftentimes they say they don't

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:39.510

can't you know like Dell just come in
 

00:53:51.839 --> 00:53:56.329
can't you know like Dell just come in
and offer those same types of prices so

00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:56.339
and offer those same types of prices so
 

00:53:56.339 --> 00:53:58.010

sometimes be hard we have challenges

00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119
sometimes be hard we have challenges

with getting to the right decision maker

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500
with getting to the right decision maker
 

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.220
with getting to the right decision maker
because the decision maker is actually

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:04.230
because the decision maker is actually
 

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.380

here it's it's just an arduous arduous

00:54:28.339 --> 00:54:28.349
here it's it's just an arduous arduous
 

00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:31.400
here it's it's just an arduous arduous
test and I think also maybe we were a

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:31.410
test and I think also maybe we were a
 

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:32.870
test and I think also maybe we were a
little bit early when we started out on

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880
little bit early when we started out on
 

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.560
little bit early when we started out on
this

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:33.570
this
 

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.600
this
I think you know many of these other

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:35.610
I think you know many of these other
 

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.190
I think you know many of these other
surrounding initiatives have made it a

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200
surrounding initiatives have made it a
 

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.290
surrounding initiatives have made it a
much more attractive proposition for a

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300
much more attractive proposition for a
 

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.610
much more attractive proposition for a
school to move this direction at this

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:40.620
school to move this direction at this
 

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:48.800
school to move this direction at this
point so we do when we don't largely our

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:48.810
point so we do when we don't largely our
 

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:51.190
point so we do when we don't largely our
version control comes from the fact that

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200
version control comes from the fact that
 

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.990
version control comes from the fact that
schools have the ability to make copies

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000
schools have the ability to make copies
 

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.780
schools have the ability to make copies
when they so choose so an example of

when they so choose so an example of
 

00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:59.690
when they so choose so an example of
that is it actually maybe if I back up

00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700
that is it actually maybe if I back up
 

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.140
that is it actually maybe if I back up
here this will help me explain this is

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:03.150
here this will help me explain this is
 

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:09.010
here this will help me explain this is
going way too fast

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:09.020
 
 

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.170
 
okay this is an example of our template

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.180
okay this is an example of our template
 

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.940
okay this is an example of our template
structure and you can see that you have

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:13.950
structure and you can see that you have
 

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:15.500

institution to college courses you could

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:15.510
institution to college courses you could
 

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:16.820
institution to college courses you could
like build out these but the point at

00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:16.830
like build out these but the point at
 

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.260
like build out these but the point at
which we actually do cloning that's

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:18.270
which we actually do cloning that's
 

00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:19.760
which we actually do cloning that's
essentially taking a snapshot of the

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:19.770
essentially taking a snapshot of the
 

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:21.590
essentially taking a snapshot of the
syllabus and from that point on the

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:21.600
syllabus and from that point on the
 

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.790
syllabus and from that point on the
purple is effectively what the

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800
purple is effectively what the
 

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.860
purple is effectively what the
instructor would be using so the reason

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:24.870
instructor would be using so the reason
 

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:26.990
instructor would be using so the reason
that that we do things this way is to

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000
that that we do things this way is to
 

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
that that we do things this way is to
make sure that future syllabus policies

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:29.010
make sure that future syllabus policies
 

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:31.280
make sure that future syllabus policies
I'll use a very trite example let's just

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:31.290
I'll use a very trite example let's just
 

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:33.440
I'll use a very trite example let's just
assume Columbia decided that cheating is

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:33.450
assume Columbia decided that cheating is
 

00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:35.530
assume Columbia decided that cheating is
going to be allowed next semester you

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:35.540
going to be allowed next semester you
 

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.970
going to be allowed next semester you
wouldn't necessarily want that policy to

00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980
wouldn't necessarily want that policy to
 

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.740
wouldn't necessarily want that policy to
show up on previous syllabi especially

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:39.750
show up on previous syllabi especially
 

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:41.990
show up on previous syllabi especially
from the contractual element so the kind

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000
from the contractual element so the kind
 

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.580
from the contractual element so the kind
of versioning that we have going on here

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:43.590
of versioning that we have going on here
 

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:44.900
of versioning that we have going on here
is that we're essentially taking

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:44.910
is that we're essentially taking
 

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:47.540
is that we're essentially taking
snapshots of master templates for every

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:47.550
snapshots of master templates for every
 

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:49.550
snapshots of master templates for every
given term and then we walk through the

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:49.560
given term and then we walk through the
 

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.250
given term and then we walk through the
versions of syllabi but contain if you

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260
versions of syllabi but contain if you
 

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:57.950
versions of syllabi but contain if you
will within that given course okay I

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960
will within that given course okay I
 

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:11.980
will within that given course okay I
think you had your hand

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:11.990
 
 

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:14.720
 
right so you you're you're right I mean

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:14.730
right so you you're you're right I mean
 

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.060
right so you you're you're right I mean
it's it's we are a SAS tool so actually

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:17.070
it's it's we are a SAS tool so actually
 

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.130
it's it's we are a SAS tool so actually
it's not as segmented as the schools may

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:19.140
it's not as segmented as the schools may
 

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.700
it's not as segmented as the schools may
believe that we are but because they all

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:22.710
believe that we are but because they all
 

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:24.110
believe that we are but because they all
have a common code base but yes they do

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:24.120
have a common code base but yes they do
 

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.660
have a common code base but yes they do
have actual separate databases now the

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:26.670
have actual separate databases now the
 

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:28.310
have actual separate databases now the
other question about exposure maybe also

00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:28.320
other question about exposure maybe also
 

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.170
other question about exposure maybe also
has to do with weather and the publicity

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180
has to do with weather and the publicity
 

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.090
has to do with weather and the publicity
of it so a number of the schools that we

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:32.100
of it so a number of the schools that we
 

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.190
of it so a number of the schools that we
have like Alamo and Glen are examples of

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200
have like Alamo and Glen are examples of
 

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.930
have like Alamo and Glen are examples of
institutions whereby they have to make

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940
institutions whereby they have to make
 

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:37.190
institutions whereby they have to make
everything public because of this

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200
everything public because of this
 

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.350
everything public because of this
legislation in the first place so if you

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:39.360
legislation in the first place so if you
 

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.570
legislation in the first place so if you
went into our tool you could you could

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:41.580
went into our tool you could you could
 

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.090
went into our tool you could you could
find all of those you know

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:43.100
find all of those you know
 

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:45.290
find all of those you know
instantaneously but some other schools

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300
instantaneously but some other schools
 

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.030
instantaneously but some other schools
are much more tight you know looked

00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040
are much more tight you know looked
 

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:58.820
are much more tight you know looked
about depends on what you captured I

00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:58.830
about depends on what you captured I
 

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:00.950
about depends on what you captured I
mean we've been we've been supporting

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960
mean we've been we've been supporting
 

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.720
mean we've been we've been supporting
them for years at this point so I have

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:02.730
them for years at this point so I have
 

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:04.280
them for years at this point so I have
to imagine that might have come out that

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:04.290
to imagine that might have come out that
 

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:27.900
to imagine that might have come out that
way

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:27.910
 
 

00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:31.810
 
so so yeah there's a is essentially a

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:31.820
so so yeah there's a is essentially a
 

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.430
so so yeah there's a is essentially a
pretty big separation between what we

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440
pretty big separation between what we
 

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.780
pretty big separation between what we
call of course and what we call a

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:34.790
call of course and what we call a
 

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.190
call of course and what we call a
syllabus the syllabus to us is the

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200
syllabus the syllabus to us is the
 

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.870
syllabus the syllabus to us is the
content in core that incorporates the

00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880
content in core that incorporates the
 

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:39.790
content in core that incorporates the
description the outcomes the schedule

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:39.800
description the outcomes the schedule
 

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.500
description the outcomes the schedule
the effectively the administrative

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:41.510
the effectively the administrative
 

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:43.120
the effectively the administrative
structure of the course we've heard it

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:43.130
structure of the course we've heard it
 

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:44.980
structure of the course we've heard it
called paths before I mean there's a

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:44.990
called paths before I mean there's a
 

00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:46.840
called paths before I mean there's a
number different terms the us course

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:46.850
number different terms the us course
 

00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:48.880
number different terms the us course
level data is going to include when it's

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:48.890
level data is going to include when it's
 

00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:50.770
level data is going to include when it's
offered what its title is and whatnot

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:50.780
offered what its title is and whatnot
 

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.030

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:03.700
so I'm wondering like is it very is a
premature like what are we preclude when

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:03.710
premature like what are we preclude when
 

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.410
premature like what are we preclude when
we introduce standards at this point for

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:05.420
we introduce standards at this point for
 

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.240
we introduce standards at this point for
example and where do you think this is

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:07.250
example and where do you think this is
 

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.069
example and where do you think this is
going and I think the presumption of it

01:02:09.069 --> 01:02:09.079
going and I think the presumption of it
 

01:02:09.079 --> 01:02:09.789
going and I think the presumption of it
the text-based

01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799
the text-based
 

01:02:09.799 --> 01:02:15.190
the text-based
static syllabus is so a few things we do

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200
static syllabus is so a few things we do
 

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.480
static syllabus is so a few things we do
find people who do interesting things

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:16.490
find people who do interesting things
 

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:18.099
find people who do interesting things
with our tool I'll say that in quotes

01:02:18.099 --> 01:02:18.109
with our tool I'll say that in quotes
 

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:20.289
with our tool I'll say that in quotes
but you know some of them are saying

01:02:20.289 --> 01:02:20.299
but you know some of them are saying
 

01:02:20.299 --> 01:02:22.269
but you know some of them are saying
that images they embed videos and

01:02:22.269 --> 01:02:22.279
that images they embed videos and
 

01:02:22.279 --> 01:02:23.620
that images they embed videos and
whatnot and our our tool supports that

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:23.630
whatnot and our our tool supports that
 

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:25.690
whatnot and our our tool supports that
kind of thing I think maybe the bigger

01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:25.700
kind of thing I think maybe the bigger
 

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.779
kind of thing I think maybe the bigger
question is essentially what is the like

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:28.789
question is essentially what is the like
 

01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:30.640
question is essentially what is the like
to stop at the end of the syllabus to

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:30.650
to stop at the end of the syllabus to
 

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:31.690
to stop at the end of the syllabus to
the beginning of the learning

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:31.700
the beginning of the learning
 

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.819
the beginning of the learning
environment and granted the syllabus is

01:02:33.819 --> 01:02:33.829
environment and granted the syllabus is
 

01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:35.769
environment and granted the syllabus is
oftentimes embedded as a part of the

01:02:35.769 --> 01:02:35.779
oftentimes embedded as a part of the
 

01:02:35.779 --> 01:02:37.240
oftentimes embedded as a part of the
learning environment but if you're

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:37.250
learning environment but if you're
 

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:38.829
learning environment but if you're
having some kind of video discussion I

01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839
having some kind of video discussion I
 

01:02:38.839 --> 01:02:40.329
having some kind of video discussion I
mean does that actually make sense to

01:02:40.329 --> 01:02:40.339
mean does that actually make sense to
 

01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:43.779
mean does that actually make sense to
have somehow related to the syllabus or

01:02:43.779 --> 01:02:43.789
have somehow related to the syllabus or
 

01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:44.950
have somehow related to the syllabus or
should the syllabus just say on this

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960
should the syllabus just say on this
 

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.240
should the syllabus just say on this

is actually captured so again the end of
the syllabus at the beginning of the

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:53.510
the syllabus at the beginning of the
 

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.059
the syllabus at the beginning of the
course maybe that's even a blurry line

01:02:55.059 --> 01:02:55.069
course maybe that's even a blurry line
 

01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:59.019
course maybe that's even a blurry line
but I think that you're still going to

01:02:59.019 --> 01:02:59.029
but I think that you're still going to
 

01:02:59.029 --> 01:03:00.460

right so so we are various we are

right so so we are various we are
actually very strong and we take a

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:20.850
actually very strong and we take a
 

01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:22.010

happen because often what we would find
 

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.360

is that if schools lock down our syllabi

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:26.370
is that if schools lock down our syllabi
 

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:28.760
is that if schools lock down our syllabi
entirely then instructors would

good question and it's a question that a

good question and it's a question that a
 

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.650
good question and it's a question that a
lot of people especially in the research

01:26:55.650 --> 01:26:55.660
lot of people especially in the research

data world are are crossing this so how

01:26:58.170 --> 01:26:58.180
data world are are crossing this so how
 

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:02.400
data world are are crossing this so how
do how do we capture that that unique

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:02.410
do how do we capture that that unique

do how do we capture that that unique
query against a database which is

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:04.090
query against a database which is
 

01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:05.160
query against a database which is
essentially what we're talking about

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:05.170
essentially what we're talking about
 

01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:06.780
essentially what we're talking about
right it's an unique query if it's a

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:06.790
right it's an unique query if it's a
 

01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:08.729
right it's an unique query if it's a
database at a point in time is it

01:27:08.729 --> 01:27:08.739
database at a point in time is it
 

01:27:08.739 --> 01:27:11.460
database at a point in time is it
appropriate to assign a DOI to that

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:11.470
appropriate to assign a DOI to that
 

01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:14.400

query is it not different disciplines

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:14.410

are coming up with different answers for

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:15.850
are coming up with different answers for
 

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:17.160
are coming up with different answers for
that but I think it's a question that

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:17.170
that but I think it's a question that
 

01:27:17.170 --> 01:27:19.560
that but I think it's a question that
that does need to be asked depending on

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:19.570
that does need to be asked depending on
 

01:27:19.570 --> 01:27:22.860
that does need to be asked depending on
how sensitive a particular discipline is

01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:22.870
how sensitive a particular discipline is

replication or ability to have the
 

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.040
replication or ability to have the
evidence in order to demonstrate that or

to provide a foundation for that so I

01:27:33.930 --> 01:27:33.940
to provide a foundation for that so I

to provide a foundation for that so I
simply encourage people to think about

simply encourage people to think about
 

01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:39.780
simply encourage people to think about
