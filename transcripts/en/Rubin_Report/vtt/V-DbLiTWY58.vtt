00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.160
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.280
<v 1>joining me today as a fellow at the Manhattan Institute,</v>

3
00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:09.200
a self described secular,

4
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:14.120
conservative and the author of the diversity delusion.
Heather McDonald.
Finally,

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.530
welcome to the Rubin report.

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.990
<v 2>I'm so grateful to be here.
Thank you so much Dave.</v>

7
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.230
I don't know how this hasn't happened already.
How did we not,

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.200
you're on the road all the time.
You're a hard man to connect with.

9
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.710
We've been on the road together.
We did.
We did Berkeley together and we survived.

10
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:31.160
Surprisingly,
uh,
attentive and polite crowd.
Uh,

11
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.450
it's kind of a disappointment actually.
You know,
we had dinner

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.850
<v 1>before and we were like,
oh,
you know,</v>

13
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:38.940
it'll be fine if we got some protest because there's a nice amount of protesters

14
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:39.990
where it can be enjoyable.

15
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:42.720
Then there's like the circus amount where it's not fun anymore.

16
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:45.520
But we were kind of like,
oh,
we'll get some.
And we got a few,
but nothing,

17
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.800
<v 2>nothing much in.
Of course,
they're so stupid,</v>

18
00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.390
they don't realize it in protesting somebody.

19
00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:51.680
They're just increasing the visibility.
So yeah,

20
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.480
if they really want to destroy all,
all Ali conservative opposition,

21
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:58.240
they should just stay quiet,
you know?
And let us fade into the woodwork.

22
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.101
<v 1>On that note,</v>

23
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:03.120
we'll spend the next hour trying to gin up some opposition to your ideas.

24
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:05.670
Let's do it.
Okay.
So first off,
uh,

25
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.030
I came to know about you when you spoke or you were to speak at Claremont

26
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.190
Mckenna University back in 2017 and you were going to give a talk on black lives

27
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.930
matter.
And why don't you just tell the people what happened?

28
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:22.590
Because that was the first time I found out who you are.

29
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.411
<v 2>Well,</v>

30
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:27.700
I was gonna talk about the fact that there is enormous support for the police in

31
00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:28.960
minority communities.

32
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.150
I've spent a lot of time in police community meetings in Harlem and South

33
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.200
Central La.
And for what I hear from those good people is that we want more cops.

34
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.300
We want the drug dealers off the corner.
I smelled pot in my cord.

35
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.190
Or why can't you do something about it?
There's kids hanging out,

36
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:48.670
fighting whatever happened to truancy and loitering laws.
Uh,

37
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:52.630
and so I was going to present a different narrative from the black lives matter

38
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:56.380
narrative.
A few days before my,
uh,
scheduled talk,

39
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.000
a call went out on Facebook to shut the fascist white supremacist homophobe

40
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:02.740
queer for Muslim folk down.

41
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.180
We will not allow the fascist racist Mcdonald to have a platform.

42
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.640
So initially they thought they'd move the venue because where I was speaking had

43
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:14.320
too many plate glass windows.

44
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.280
They decided to keep it in what's called the Athenaeum.
Uh,

45
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.260
but I was put into what was essentially a safe house on campus waiting for my

46
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.580
talk.
I could hear the drumming and the chanting grow louder and louder.

47
00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:32.190
I couldn't see what was going on.
It was a disconcerting experience.
Yeah.
Uh,

48
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.350
and I was escorted into the room,
uh,

49
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.840
with a police escort through a hidden tunnel.

50
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.220
I did not know at the time that about 200 students had surrounded the building

51
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.080
to prevent anybody from entering to attend the talk.
So I spoke to an empty room.

52
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.350
Uh,
the police were inside the building.

53
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:54.460
At some point they decided that they couldn't guarantee my safety and longer,

54
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.950
cause people were pounding on the plate glass windows.

55
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.100
So I was taken out the kitchen with police escort into a waiting police car and

56
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:03.334
zipped away.

57
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.620
<v 1>So I asked you this,
not because I know you don't want to play the Wii.
No,</v>

58
00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:07.580
I don't.
I really don't.

59
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.520
But it's what I think it's important for people to realize that this has

60
00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:12.980
happened to so many people who I know,
including me.

61
00:03:12.981 --> 00:03:16.070
And actually I'm very proud to say that I spoke at Claremont Mckenna a few

62
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.260
months after in that in that very room,

63
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.580
and they made it very clear that the whole point of the night was that they

64
00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:25.040
never wanted what happened to you to repeat again.

65
00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:28.310
So they actually did do what a university is supposed to do,

66
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.510
but just can you tell me,
I mean,
you strike me as a totally lovely,

67
00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:36.080
pleasant person that,
that,
that people have connections that people have the,

68
00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:39.980
they just make up what you think and that then you're treated like this.

69
00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:43.820
It's just not fun.
Right?
I mean to put it mildly fun at,
you know,

70
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:45.980
it really is some,
cause we can joke about it like,
oh,

71
00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:48.440
we love it and protests or from,
you know,
whatever.
But yeah.

72
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.070
<v 2>Well with mobs you don't know what's going to happen next.
Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.021
And again,

74
00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:59.021
I am so reluctant to say anything that can be attributed to a victim ideology

75
00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:01.280
because that is used against me.

76
00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:05.120
But I did have a remote sense of what it feels like,

77
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.570
what felt like to be in the French revolution and hearing the mob because people

78
00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:15.680
in crowds can become completely irrational.
Um,
so,

79
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.260
you know,
I,
I don't know that they're making up who I am because I,

80
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.970
well,
I certainly am not against black lives,

81
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.300
but my message to them as they understand it is tantamount to being against

82
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:36.860
black people.
And,
and what,
what this,

83
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.430
the groundwork for this insane delusion that is used against speakers is an even

84
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.150
crazier idea,

85
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:49.130
which is that students on college campuses today are at literal threat of their

86
00:04:49.131 --> 00:04:53.040
lives from circa manbient,
racism and sexism.
This is a,

87
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.460
a delusional idea that is put into these students' heads sort of k through 12

88
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.900
because the identity politics is happening sooner and sooner,

89
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.000
but it is certainly reinforced by diversity bureaucrats on campus that are in a

90
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:13.001
codependent relationship with these narcissistic students who want to elevate

91
00:05:14.991 --> 00:05:17.750
their status into the top dog victim on campus.

92
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.351
<v 1>You know,
it's funny,</v>

93
00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:21.490
I did a talk at University of New Hampshire and protestors were,

94
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.590
were screaming at me in the middle and disrupting me and they have no problem

95
00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:28.110
using their free speech to infringe on your first speech.
Of course.
Um,

96
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.731
and one of the,

97
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:31.640
somebody started screaming that we could be killed when we walk out of here.

98
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.190
I thought,
we're in the middle of New Hampshire.

99
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.440
Nobody's getting killed when you walk out of here.

100
00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:39.530
And certainly if you don't behave in any criminal behavior,

101
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.000
absolutely nothing is.

102
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.740
But they've concocted a story in their mind and it's very hard to deconstruct a

103
00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:46.840
story for these people.

104
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.140
<v 2>Yeah,
I guess so.
Because again,</v>

105
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.370
we're in a very weird position in our culture generally where the classical

106
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:58.010
virtues,
venerated strength and accomplishment,
perhaps to a fault,
you know,

107
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.380
because you had warrior cultures and for,

108
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.650
for centuries the main calling for males for accomplishment was war.

109
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.280
Uh,
but the classical virtues again celebrated heroism.

110
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.230
We now we're in a very strange position.
It's culture where we venerate victims.

111
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:19.460
And so if you can Eric gate to yourself some victim status,

112
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:24.461
and certainly the burgeoning category of gender identity is a mark of these

113
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:30.920
students,
desperate to find one final way of being transgressive that will not be

114
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:35.660
immediately assimilated into a new dirt diversity Synacor.

115
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.820
Uh,
but they are,

116
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.260
there's no way they're going to give up that sacred,

117
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.300
rarefied status of victim.
Uh,
and again,

118
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.270
there's nothing more tolerant than an an American college campus if,

119
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.830
if you're not challenging the orthodoxy.

120
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:59.770
But this is the most tolerant environment in human history for society's

121
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.220
traditionally marginalized groups.

122
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.990
It actively celebrates those traits that can still get you stoned or killed

123
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:09.650
elsewhere.
So to think,
you know,
as Brown students said,

124
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.720
occupying the president's office,

125
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.930
well it was hard for them to go to classes because they were focused so hard on

126
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:18.740
staying alive at Brown.
It's similar to New Hampshire.
I mean,
yeah,
this is,

127
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.050
this is certifiably insane thinking.

128
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.300
<v 1>Yeah.
And unfortunately there aren't enough brave professors right.</v>

129
00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:29.600
To push back on this and then it becomes this self fulfilling thing because then

130
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:31.490
the teachers start feeding into it and the whole thing.

131
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.440
So before we go too deep on that,
and I want to,

132
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:35.600
I want to do all your greatest hits here because you have,

133
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.260
you have no fear talking about really what I think are the hot button issues of

134
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:42.560
the day.
But you described yourself as a secular conservative.

135
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.480
And that is not a phrase that I hear very often.
And as I've,
you know,

136
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.650
as I come from the left and I still consider myself liberal as I've been more

137
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:54.410
embraced by say,
conservatives,
um,

138
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.650
a lot of people that knew me from way back when they'll go out,
but Reuben there,

139
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:00.860
they're just waiting to turn on you because they're,
they're really religious.

140
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:04.000
They don't really like the gays and whatever else.
Um,

141
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.160
so can you sort of describe how you came to a place that you described yourself

142
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:10.610
as a secular conservative cause?
I don't think people really think that exists.

143
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.980
<v 2>Well I guess I was always secular.
I wasn't always conservative.
Um,</v>

144
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.330
I would have secular mean to you.
First off,
I'm very unreligious.
I am,

145
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.910
I to be honest,
probably,
um,

146
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.310
perhaps to fanatically unreligious I,

147
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.420
I simply do not agree with the idea that we're,

148
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.530
uh,
overseen by a personal loving God.
I find petitionary prayer,

149
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.040
a completely narcissistic activity that anybody would dare think that a personal

150
00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:48.061
God would care about his cancer when there are people being mowed down in

151
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:53.770
earthquakes and landslides,
what I call the daily slaughter of the innocence,

152
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.030
again,
on a basis.
So,
uh,

153
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.580
I grew up not in a religious environment,
um,

154
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.120
and never even really thought about religion.
To me,
it's an interesting,

155
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:10.480
I can retroactively look at my experience growing up and,

156
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.010
and be sort of amazed at it.

157
00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:17.011
It is a verification of what religious people talk about with the bi coastal

158
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:21.120
elites.
Cause I grew up in La,

159
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.510
I went to a lot of schooling and the east coast.

160
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:26.580
So I was in kind of a liberal of the culture.

161
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.260
I don't recall knowing anybody who was religious.
Okay.

162
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.570
Until I came to New York in the nine days and started thinking of myself

163
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:39.690
realizing that I was conservative because I'd always been a liberal by default.

164
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.840
And in that environment,
especially with national view,

165
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:46.040
I started meeting religious people for the first time.
Uh,

166
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.980
<v 1>what did they make of a secular concern?</v>

167
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.410
Even if you were liberal in the classical sense,

168
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.990
but let's say a burgeoning conservative at that point.

169
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:55.790
What did they make of a secular person?

170
00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.670
<v 2>Well,
I guess my first point is about this was,
was for the American conservative.</v>

171
00:10:00.671 --> 00:10:02.170
And I just wrote a piece saying,
you know,

172
00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.740
the Republicans and conservatives who are so closely yoking conservative

173
00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:12.340
ideology with religious belief are making a mistake.

174
00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:16.420
Because I know a lot of very smart conservatives who are not themselves

175
00:10:16.421 --> 00:10:17.680
believers either.

176
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.160
And to say that the only way you can be moral is to believe in God,

177
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.750
uh,
I think is a mistake.

178
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:30.751
So I then had participated in at founded in a blog called secular,

179
00:10:30.821 --> 00:10:34.450
right.
That was founded by received Khan and,
and others.
Uh,

180
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.340
and I never was,

181
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:41.430
I was never a pariah or drummed out of the movement at all.

182
00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:46.501
I got some sort of a sarcastic comments from major figures like,

183
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.840
so how's that?
Eighth Youth is ism thing going Heather.
Right.
Um,
but I,

184
00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:54.910
I can't say that I was ever really,
uh,
punished for it,

185
00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:58.810
but I think I was regarded as a,
uh,
a curiosity.

186
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.770
<v 1>Yeah.
So obviously we're going to talk about so much of what's wrong with the</v>

187
00:11:02.771 --> 00:11:04.740
postmodern left and the progressive's,

188
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.110
but let's just talk a little bit about what's going on with the right these days

189
00:11:08.111 --> 00:11:12.220
or let you know broadly,
let's say the conservatives,
the old school liberals,

190
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.880
the Libertarians resume.
I'm finding it to be the center,
right?

191
00:11:15.881 --> 00:11:20.881
Let's say an extremely open group of people who are really willing to do this

192
00:11:22.211 --> 00:11:25.660
dive into ideas and,
and agree to disagree in all of that.

193
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.300
How have you always found it to be that way?

194
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.090
<v 2>Well,
again,
I have,
I mean,
I know you're saying you got a little,</v>

195
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.360
<v 1>a bit of push back let's say,
or did some joking about.</v>

196
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.690
<v 2>Yeah,
that just joking.
It was not malicious and it was not really serious.
Um,</v>

197
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.040
yes,
I guess so.
Again,
I've,
I'm,

198
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.430
I consider myself kind of a latecomer to the right.
Uh,
but I've,

199
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.130
I don't think it was ever closed minded.

200
00:11:48.131 --> 00:11:53.131
I think it's now maybe more self consciously open just because of the growing

201
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:55.180
totalitarianism on the left.

202
00:11:55.181 --> 00:12:00.070
So perhaps people are extra careful to uh,
you know,

203
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:03.520
make sure that they're not excluding anybody,
but,
but I don't,

204
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.960
I think if you're trying to push back against some kind of stereotype that the

205
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:12.940
right is a bunch of,
of a closed minded bigots I've never experienced,

206
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:18.020
I just don't see it anywhere.
Right.
It's actually quite staggering to me.
Um,

207
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.070
okay.
So let's,
let's just plow through a whole bunch of topics.

208
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:24.490
So we touched a little bit on policing already and the black community.

209
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:26.590
Is there anything else you wanted to add to that?
Generally?
Well,

210
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:30.910
just the black lives merit of a matte black lives matter narrative is false and

211
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:31.540
stop.

212
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.470
We are not living through an epidemic of racially biased police shootings of

213
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:40.120
black men.
These core flaw of any left wing anti cop,

214
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.110
uh,

215
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:46.110
rhetoric or the mass incarceration meme is the failure to find the proper

216
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:51.580
benchmark for evaluating police behavior.
Uh,

217
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.320
inevitably policing is compared to population ratios.

218
00:12:56.321 --> 00:12:59.530
So let's say in New York City,
uh,

219
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.370
about 50% of all pedestrian stops are of blacks.

220
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:07.810
Blacks are about 23% of the population of black lives matter activist or an

221
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:11.860
academic often would say that shows the police are racist,
wrong benchmark.

222
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:15.340
The benchmark is crime.
Policing is crime driven.

223
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.450
Blacks in New York City commit 71% of all shootings.

224
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.670
If you add Hispanic shootings to black shootings,

225
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:24.370
you account for 98% of all shootings in New York.

226
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.240
Whites are 34% of the population they commit to percent of shootings.
So,

227
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.740
so that's the basic fallacy that,
and this is a broader problem,
right?

228
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:35.290
So what would you say is the root of the root of this?

229
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:40.150
Is that I think the core difference between a liberal outlook on the world in a

230
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:45.151
conservative one is that liberals will only accept structural explanations for

231
00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:47.920
socioeconomic disparities.

232
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.220
They will not ever accept a behavioral explanation that there are behaviors,

233
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.700
cultures that are different that explain poverty rates,

234
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:02.701
say conservatives maybe to a fault are not particularly open to structural

235
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:08.530
explanations.
And we'll see behavioral,
uh,
reasons.

236
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:10.450
So for instance,
when you look at poverty,

237
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:15.700
the biggest driver in American poverty today is having children out of wedlock.

238
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.910
If you are a single mother,
uh,

239
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.860
the chances are really high that you're going to be poor and your child is about

240
00:14:23.861 --> 00:14:28.360
five times more likely to be poor than if he were a child of married parents.

241
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.230
Um,

242
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:34.230
and there's a whole set of choices for good or bad that people can make that

243
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.150
almost guarantee that you can become middleclass.
It's very simple.

244
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:44.320
Three simple things you can do,
uh,
graduate from high school.

245
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.730
Wait until you're married to have a child and work at a job full time.
Any job,

246
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.690
low minimum wage job.
73% of people who do that are not poor.

247
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.350
So that to me is the basic difference.

248
00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:02.180
So the benchmark problem in policing comes from not being willing to look at

249
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:03.750
behavior and,

250
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:08.540
and I think that is true for everything in in society.

251
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:10.910
We have the most dangerous can seed out.

252
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:15.500
There is this disparate impact analysis that says that any neutral policy that

253
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:19.850
has a disparate impact on racial groups must be biased.
Again,

254
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.630
that is a analysis that only makes sense if you don't look at behavior.

255
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.500
<v 1>So why the certain narratives then get sold much more than other narratives.</v>

256
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.480
I have my own theories on this,
but why?

257
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:36.020
Why is the narrative out there that the police are racist?

258
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:40.480
I mean I did the media all collude to decide the same thing and put it out
there.

259
00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:43.810
I mean really had is how do those,
how do those bad ideas than spread?

260
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.320
<v 2>Well,
one thing,
I don't think it's happening.
I always get us,
is this all sorrows?</v>

261
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.130
Yeah,
I don't think it is.
Everybody wants human beings like want agency,
right?

262
00:15:51.131 --> 00:15:54.880
We want to answer one answer and they want to believe that everything is like

263
00:15:54.881 --> 00:15:57.280
from top down.
I don't think it's so us money,

264
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.460
but I think there are memes that spread and I think there are ideologies and I

265
00:16:02.801 --> 00:16:07.801
think that American culture now is very uncomfortable with inner city culture,

266
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:17.200
with uh,
certain dysfunctional minority culture and doesn't,

267
00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.550
don't want to talk about it.

268
00:16:18.551 --> 00:16:23.551
We want to turn our eyes away from it and we have the most appalling history of

269
00:16:24.101 --> 00:16:25.300
racism in this country.

270
00:16:25.301 --> 00:16:30.301
It is really unthinkable how blind we were to the profound hypocrisy that

271
00:16:31.931 --> 00:16:35.830
governs so much of our politics for so long.
You know,

272
00:16:35.831 --> 00:16:39.910
one when can't begin to understand how,
how that could not have been obvious.

273
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.630
But I think our degree of guilt for that is now so great and understandable

274
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:47.494
frankly,

275
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.570
that we're very reluctant to ascribe agency to blacks.

276
00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:55.330
We want to say everything,
the continuing problems,

277
00:16:55.331 --> 00:17:00.250
the failure to close the achievement gap,
the crime disparities,

278
00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:03.190
which are massive.
The victimization disparities,

279
00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:08.191
blacks die of homicide at six times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined.

280
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:13.690
That's a civil rights problem,
but nobody wants to talk about that.
Instead,

281
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.830
we want to change the narrative to be,
it's all white racism,

282
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:23.080
which is a way of infantilizing blacks of saying there's nothing you can do for

283
00:17:23.081 --> 00:17:27.340
yourselves.
Getting rid of the acting white culture,
you know,

284
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.570
emulate like we should all emulate Asians.
I've,
I pose a thought experiment.

285
00:17:31.571 --> 00:17:36.571
If blacks acted like Asians for 10 years in all things the same like negligible

286
00:17:37.871 --> 00:17:42.700
rate of out of wedlock child rearing,
the same fanatical involvement in schools,

287
00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.720
you know,
drive parents'll drive study,

288
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.280
you're going to go to Harvard,
you know,
nothing is acceptable.

289
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.060
Don't go to Harvard if you're a these dries.
That's right.
Well,

290
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:57.780
you're going to have to be 10 times greater than any better than anybody else to

291
00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:00.480
go to Harvard and you will be right.
If,
if,

292
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.540
if the behaviors were the same and we still saw these socioeconomic disparities,

293
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:11.030
then I will entertain institutional structural racism and as,

294
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:11.911
as an explanation.

295
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:16.911
But as long as the behaviors are so vastly different in in California where we

296
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:17.904
are now,

297
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.690
the truancy rate for blacks is five times higher than any other ethnic group.

298
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.400
As long as those behaviors are so different.

299
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.560
I think it's premature to say the only possible explanation is structural
racism.

300
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.450
<v 1>Do you think this is also that we just have this sort of self fulfilling</v>

301
00:18:34.451 --> 00:18:37.150
prophecy now between the media and our politicians?

302
00:18:37.151 --> 00:18:39.250
So like right as we're taping this right now,

303
00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:43.420
the La school teachers are on strike and it's like,
well,
wait a minute,

304
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.040
I see all these lefties on Twitter,

305
00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.350
everyone complaining and teachers need more money and blah blah,

306
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.940
except it's all progressive's that run in California in la forever.

307
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.840
So it's like these are your guys that have been putting in all these policies

308
00:18:55.841 --> 00:18:58.360
that the teachers are upset by that.
But it's that they just,

309
00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.060
the answer's always easy.
It's just more money,
more money,
more money,

310
00:19:01.061 --> 00:19:02.170
more money and that,

311
00:19:02.171 --> 00:19:04.750
and that makes people feel good because it's always easy to say,

312
00:19:04.751 --> 00:19:08.590
oh well just give it more money.
And then the media does this same thing too,

313
00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:13.480
where it's just,
it's racism,
it needs more money and that there's no actual,

314
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.420
well,
they're substantive debate.
It's happening online now,

315
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.730
but not sort of in the places that it should happen.

316
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.840
Do you see politicians having these discussions?
Honestly,
anywhere or,

317
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:27.290
<v 2>well,
no,
I mean I think,
again,
nobody wants to talk about individual agency.</v>

318
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.960
Nobody wants to talk about it's behavioral choices.
And you know,

319
00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:32.510
this gets to something we've briefly touched on before,

320
00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:36.920
which is the debate around Tucker Carlson and,
and him.
It was a very odd moment.

321
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.390
I mean,
I,
I love Tucker,
but he's taking basically a left wing position,

322
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.190
which is that,
you know,

323
00:19:43.191 --> 00:19:48.191
the plight of rural America or the opioid crisis of the disengagement of males,

324
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.810
uh,
from the workforce,
uh,

325
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.910
which is a very serious thing is a result of economic policy.

326
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.780
And there's been people who've been pushing back against that on national view.

327
00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:02.290
David French.
Yeah.
This is just in the last 10 days.
Right.

328
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:05.870
And I think if a persuasive way,
which is to say,
well,

329
00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:10.370
you're doing the same kind of a shift of responsibilities.

330
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.710
It's traditionally the left does,
which is to say,
well,

331
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.800
it's these large social forces.
No,
we'll actually,
again,

332
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:21.040
even if we've got jobs moving off off shore,

333
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:26.350
they're still are individual choices that people can make that vastly increased

334
00:20:26.801 --> 00:20:29.360
their chances of success.
Again,

335
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:34.310
do not have children out of wedlock study,
do not get involved in drugs,

336
00:20:34.311 --> 00:20:38.240
don't become a pothead.
These are all within individual agency.

337
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:43.190
Obviously the left doesn't want to acknowledge that because there is some sort

338
00:20:43.191 --> 00:20:47.260
of interest in expanding bureaucracies to deal with this function.
Mean.

339
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.740
I've seen this,
I've written a lot about uh,

340
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.410
Hispanics in California and spent time in,
uh,

341
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.040
the Brendas school in Pico Rivera middle school,

342
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.160
which is just crawling with gang counselors and pregnancy counselors for the

343
00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:05.920
social dysfunction that's happening with the second third generation Hispanics.

344
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:10.180
But the bureaucracy grows larger and larger every place,
uh,

345
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:13.510
as a substitute for saying to individuals,
you know,

346
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.730
pull up your bootstraps and you can do it yourself.
Yeah,

347
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.880
<v 1>there's an odd thing where then the conservatives and the libertarians who are</v>

348
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:23.881
against authoritarianism by nature need a little bit of authoritarian structure,

349
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.571
so to speak.

350
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:29.800
I had a Catherine verbal sing in here who's a school administrator in the UK,

351
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.870
was taking,
she,
uh,

352
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.100
she was a teacher in the inner city in London and she realized how dysfunctional

353
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:38.680
everything that you're talking about was in the breakdown of the family.

354
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:41.600
And these kids,
they were malnutritioned and they had no rights.

355
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.220
They behaved horribly and all these things and now she started her own school.

356
00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:48.880
Then mckayla school and I went there and these kids in inbetween classes,

357
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:52.150
they have to walk exactly in line.
They can't speak during lunch.

358
00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:54.550
They can only talk about one topic and there's a,
you know,

359
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:58.090
any one could be called on at any given moment and I thought this is so bizarre

360
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:02.110
because here this is the right kind of authoritarianism with younger people.

361
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:05.140
I thought that that's actually pretty cool.
You got to get them young though,

362
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.300
<v 2>right?
Right.
Structure.
I mean this is,</v>

363
00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:10.930
there's charter schools in the United States like Kipp that do the same thing.

364
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.280
You know,
everything is scripted because the families are so dysfunctional.

365
00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:18.130
Now again,
predominantly single mothers,
although there's obviously,

366
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.780
let me just put in the disclaimer,

367
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.290
there are heroic single mothers out there who are doing the right thing by their

368
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:27.280
children,
but I'm sorry.
On average I'm not talking about you individual.

369
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:28.450
I'm talking on average ear.

370
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.410
It's the worst thing you could do for your kid not to have the father at the

371
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:33.640
home,
but yes,

372
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:38.170
this is the last chance these kids have to get socialized and the tragedy,
again,

373
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:40.750
to bring back to the disparate impact idea,

374
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.740
something that we've just been going through with with Trump's education

375
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:45.574
secretary,

376
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.500
the Obama administration had this idea that was already bubbling on the

377
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.970
progressive left in education schools that if black kids are disciplined more

378
00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:58.540
than white kids,
that must be because of teacher racism.
Again,

379
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.480
you are not allowed to look at behavior.
This is the key.

380
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.430
The left will never look at behavior,

381
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.880
and so the fact that black kids commit homicide at 10 times the rate black

382
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:14.791
teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 commit homicide at 10 times the rate of

383
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:19.690
white and Hispanic male teens combined according to federal data w on Thomas

384
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:24.230
side,
which is the gold standard.
I mean there's,
there's nothing like,
you know,

385
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.320
at all a wiggle room in this data,

386
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.280
that type of disparity and socialization that leads to those types of homicide

387
00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:37.180
disparities shows up in the classroom as well as any inner city kid can tell
you.

388
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.463
Uh,

389
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:43.590
the Obama rule said you may not discipline black kids more and as a result,

390
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.700
kids are running a muck in schools.
They're attacking their,

391
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.361
<v 1>basically,</v>

392
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:55.361
you just put these arbitrary rules in that clearly don't fit what is actually

393
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:56.850
happening,
but it makes you feel good.

394
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.740
<v 2>It makes you blame whites,
everything.
It's all the product of white racism.</v>

395
00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.420
Hmm.
So,
so yes,
I'm all for informal structure.

396
00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.540
If a family cannot do what I mean Aristotle,
again,

397
00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:12.470
this gets back to the secular right thing.
I hear that people say,
well,

398
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:16.640
how do you raise a moral kid without religion?
Aristotle said,

399
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:20.180
virtue is habit.
And I,

400
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.480
I don't know,
I was not raised and we'll just family,

401
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:28.481
but isn't really the case that a parent says to his five year old son,

402
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.380
don't hit your three year old brother because Jesus said not too,

403
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:38.120
or is it just do not hit your,
your three year old brother.
You know?

404
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.300
I think the authority from parental authority is sufficient and you acclimate

405
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.610
children to a set of behaviors that are self controlling,

406
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:53.750
deferring gratification by just teaching.

407
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:57.560
This is how we behave and through the inculcation of habit.

408
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.070
I don't think in raising children,

409
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.100
I just can't imagine at what point you need to invoke the 10 commandments.

410
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:08.720
I think that a lot of these behaviors,

411
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.760
the golden rule is something that can't talked about as something that is pretty

412
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.120
innate to a understanding that humans develop of what is needed to function in a

413
00:25:21.861 --> 00:25:23.930
relatively civil society.

414
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.290
<v 1>Yeah.
I have to tell you,
this is such an example of why I love doing this show,</v>

415
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:30.110
because just an hour before sitting down with you,
I don't know if you know him,

416
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:34.520
but I had a Dr. Everett Piper on who's the president of Oklahoma Wesleyan

417
00:25:34.521 --> 00:25:39.521
University [inaudible] and you guys probably agree on politics at like 99% and

418
00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.600
yet he's religious and a lot of what we talked about was from a religious

419
00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:45.434
perspective.

420
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.010
But that to me is that that's the beauty of what America is all about.

421
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.750
It's like actually on the things that,

422
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.630
that matter outside of what your personal beliefs are.

423
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.690
You're agreeing on all this stuff and then you have some differences on

424
00:25:56.691 --> 00:25:59.420
existential questions and yeah,
so be it.

425
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.371
<v 2>Well,
and,</v>

426
00:26:00.371 --> 00:26:04.280
and it's also something that we're now playing with fire of being able to

427
00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:07.220
disagree amicably.
I mean,

428
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.980
I don't know if we should all be like screaming,
you know,

429
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:15.020
send in the,
the fire alarm or that they're the firetrucks,

430
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.300
but this growing civil violence that is predominantly on the left.

431
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:22.640
Obviously Charlottesville was an abomination.

432
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.670
But I would say in terms of sheer numbers of incidents,

433
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:30.290
obvious we the the the right,
the alt right,
the craziest took a life,

434
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:33.740
which is a game changer.
I mean that's qualitatively different than anything.

435
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:38.000
Then,
you know,
following round Tucker Carlson or screaming at Trump officials.

436
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:42.050
Nevertheless,
uh,
the antifa violence is,

437
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.990
is playing with tribal hatreds in a way that I think is extremely naive if we

438
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:52.650
think that America is permanently immune from the type of violence it's still

439
00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:54.400
characterize as other societies.
Yeah.

440
00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:59.200
<v 1>No buddy on the left seems to know,
first off,
CNN ignores it basically,</v>

441
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:02.110
and then the politicians don't say anything about it.
Okay.
So let's,

442
00:27:02.111 --> 00:27:04.630
let's link this to one of the other things that you talk about a lot,

443
00:27:04.631 --> 00:27:07.960
which is sort of what's happening right now very,
very intensely,

444
00:27:07.961 --> 00:27:11.830
which seems like this new war on men or war on boys.
So how,

445
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.830
how is this related to two?

446
00:27:14.831 --> 00:27:16.930
It's related sort of in the interracial context,

447
00:27:16.931 --> 00:27:19.240
especially if you're talking about young black men,
but we can,

448
00:27:19.241 --> 00:27:21.100
we can separate those two things a little bit if you want.

449
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.250
<v 2>Well,
females are determined to think of themselves as victims to a,</v>

450
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.700
which is preposterous.

451
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.390
There is not a single mainstream institution in the society,

452
00:27:30.391 --> 00:27:33.660
whether it's a university,
a bank,
a law firm,

453
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:37.110
a government agency,
a foundation,

454
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.320
k through 12 that is not,

455
00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:43.050
well k through 12 probably not because there you've got a super abundance of

456
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:43.860
females,
but,

457
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.340
but every mainstream institution is trying to hire and promote as many females

458
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:49.770
as possible.
I know for sure,
I just,

459
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.750
it's just inevitable that I have been the so called beneficiary of gender

460
00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:58.970
preferences continuously.
You know,
there's a,
there's no good you admitted,

461
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.360
you know?
No,
it disgusts me frankly.
Uh,
you know,

462
00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:06.550
there's now this whole meme about manels a,

463
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.560
thou shalt not put together a scientific panel of the top cancer researchers.

464
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.900
If it happens to be all males,

465
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.970
you must put females on that panel.
This is crazy.
Yeah.
Who Cares?

466
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:25.020
I really do not care who solves Alzheimer's.
If it's all females,

467
00:28:25.021 --> 00:28:28.410
because they're the best.
So be it.
But if it's all males,
I don't give a damn.

468
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.020
<v 1>Are you telling me that if you had heart surgery you would want,</v>

469
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.870
<v 2>I got to check out what the best surgeon regardless of their sexuality or gender</v>

470
00:28:35.871 --> 00:28:39.110
or skin color or kind of big adore you.
I don't know.

471
00:28:39.111 --> 00:28:43.370
I guess I'm just blind to the truth prevails of females,
you know,
and,

472
00:28:43.371 --> 00:28:47.270
and look at again,
females now or at least at parody.
It's very curious.

473
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.630
All the institutions that have a super abundance of females,

474
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:55.550
nobody ever thinks to say,
well there must be anti male bias,
you know,

475
00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.710
but anything or something.
I see,
I see.
And it's also the case,

476
00:29:00.711 --> 00:29:01.460
you know,

477
00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:05.780
in academia if anybody says,

478
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:10.990
well there's these vast disparities of liberals to conservatives in academia,

479
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:16.370
which I frankly think it's kind of a side issue.
I David Horwitz.
Yes.

480
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:17.750
David Horwitz Taught,

481
00:29:17.751 --> 00:29:21.740
tells a story about going to Columbia in the 1950s and being taught by Marxists,

482
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.450
but it didn't matter because mostly politics stayed out of the classroom,

483
00:29:26.451 --> 00:29:27.770
but they were open minded.

484
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.700
And my ideal of education as frankly a pure ivory tower,

485
00:29:31.701 --> 00:29:34.610
I think everybody should just be reading Edmund Spencer's,

486
00:29:34.611 --> 00:29:39.410
the fairy queen and Milton.
And Trollope and wallowing and pastoral poetry.

487
00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:41.060
I think I shouldn't be even fun.
I don't,

488
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.340
I should be invited to a college campus because me talking about policing is,

489
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.160
is of the wisps of,
of the,

490
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.270
of transitory reality that they'll get too.

491
00:29:52.271 --> 00:29:54.280
There's time enough after you graduate.

492
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:58.880
These are four precious years to take a deep dive into beauty,
into grand.

493
00:29:58.890 --> 00:29:59.950
You're into sublimity,

494
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:03.730
into wit and to irony into the greatest expressions of mankind,

495
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.010
not into contemporary politics are homeless politics or whatnot,

496
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.440
but that's obviously highly unlikely to happen.

497
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.330
<v 1>That's fascinating to me because I guess I agree with the premise that I wish</v>

498
00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:18.420
college could be that.
Right.
And then on the other hand,

499
00:30:18.421 --> 00:30:22.140
when I go to these schools and I see so many kids engaged in the things that

500
00:30:22.141 --> 00:30:25.860
we're talking about,
I always leave incredibly inspired because I'm like,
oh,

501
00:30:25.861 --> 00:30:29.160
you guys are at least awake to these issues,
but I see your point.

502
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.320
It's like if they could be in a weird way,

503
00:30:31.321 --> 00:30:33.720
if they could be insulated from them a little bit to,

504
00:30:33.721 --> 00:30:37.620
to get to deeper learning of the foundational things,
maybe that would be better.

505
00:30:37.621 --> 00:30:37.970
But

506
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.840
<v 2>yes,
Aristotle and content,
Shakespeare and Milton's commerce,</v>

507
00:30:41.841 --> 00:30:45.200
I mean language that is so sensual,
that is just of,

508
00:30:45.201 --> 00:30:48.470
of almost terrifying eroticism.

509
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:52.420
They're not going to come across this later.
Uh,

510
00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.540
and so I'm grateful to the fact that when I was in college,

511
00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.470
I was an Acolyte of deconstruction.
Alas,

512
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.010
I spent way too much time trying to plow my throat.
Why?

513
00:31:04.011 --> 00:31:07.580
Way through La metrology blocked by Jack Derrida and you know,

514
00:31:07.581 --> 00:31:10.730
reading Lacan Jay and Paul demand,

515
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.760
which was a grotesque waste of time.

516
00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.860
But multiculturalism hadn't hit yet,
right?
So I was in college in the 70s,

517
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.040
so we read the cannon without anybody thinking to complain about gonads and

518
00:31:24.261 --> 00:31:27.920
Melanin.
So I could,
I could rate the best literature.
Right?
Who Cares?

519
00:31:27.921 --> 00:31:30.800
It didn't come up.
It's amazing.
Now you'd think that,
oh,

520
00:31:30.801 --> 00:31:34.130
this is the first thing you ask about a book.
You know,
well,

521
00:31:34.131 --> 00:31:37.580
do I see myself reflected there?
No.
Okay,
therefore,
I'm not going to read it.

522
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.911
You know,

523
00:31:37.911 --> 00:31:42.350
please do not expose me to a writer that is going to take me out of myself,

524
00:31:42.351 --> 00:31:46.340
which is something that renaissance humanists craved and yearned for.

525
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:51.290
So anyway,
um,
uh,
the whole gender thing,

526
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.303
the manuals,

527
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:57.480
there was a past president of the American physics society put out a call to

528
00:31:59.271 --> 00:32:04.271
members to nominate for physics prizes and to put on panels,

529
00:32:05.091 --> 00:32:07.700
females,
just the most egregious,

530
00:32:07.701 --> 00:32:12.350
blatant discarding of a meritocratic principle,

531
00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:17.480
something that is irrelevant to physics.
So this is everywhere.
Uh,

532
00:32:17.481 --> 00:32:19.310
and I just reject it completely.

533
00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:24.311
And the campus idea that females are at risk of rape culture on campus is

534
00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:26.510
equally ludicrous.
If,

535
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:31.550
if these statistics that the campus rape industry had been throwing around for

536
00:32:31.641 --> 00:32:34.070
the last 10 15,

537
00:32:34.071 --> 00:32:38.960
20 years will remotely accurate one to four to one to five

538
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.310
sexually assaulted during their time on campus.

539
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:48.500
That is a crime rate that is unseen around the globe.

540
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.860
Detroit as our most violent city,

541
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:57.500
all four of the FBI's violent index felonies,
which is murder,

542
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.450
rape,
aggravated assault and robbery.
You put all of those together,

543
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.490
you get a 2% violent crime rate.
Wow.

544
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.490
Rape is like 0.1% of the population.

545
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.200
Now obviously the campus thing is over four years.
Even.
So you,

546
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:20.150
you can never,
you cannot possibly get to one in 41 five.
If that were the case,

547
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:25.570
we would have seen a mass exodus of females from coed universities decades ago.

548
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.910
These highly sophisticated mothers who are right now in Manhattan paying $200 an

549
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:36.940
hour to prep their girl taught to get into the most prestigious pre k to set

550
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:41.360
them on the path to some ivy league.

551
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.260
They would be demanding single sex education.

552
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.680
You would not see on every Saturday night the girls that Uva trouping down rugby

553
00:33:51.141 --> 00:33:55.400
road to the frats and less girls are stupid.
And they do not,

554
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.490
they're not strong women together and there's rape going on and they're not a

555
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.880
warning each other,
which I'm willing to entertain that as an explanation.

556
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.720
But what I'm not willing to entertain as the explanation that there is a

557
00:34:05.721 --> 00:34:09.710
epidemic of sexual assault and females are simply like,

558
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.450
I dunno,
they're accepting it or something.
It's just,
it's very bizarre.

559
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:19.180
<v 1>So what do you make of how as the intersectional pyramid that is,
yeah.
You know,</v>

560
00:34:19.181 --> 00:34:22.740
based on these varying levels of what I would see or perceive depression,

561
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.770
I just say real oppression,

562
00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:28.540
that they constantly are talking about racism and bigotry and yet they seem to

563
00:34:28.541 --> 00:34:29.650
be the ones enforcing it.

564
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:32.770
So I think the best example of this is what's happened over the last couple of

565
00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:36.280
months with the women's march where it became very clear that many of the

566
00:34:36.281 --> 00:34:41.230
leaders were either antisemites themselves or seriously embracing of

567
00:34:41.231 --> 00:34:45.160
antisemites.
And yet these are the same people who would tell you that,
you know,

568
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.010
everyone else is a bigot and a racist.
And the rest of it,

569
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.930
I guess this is just the natural outcome of this.

570
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.830
<v 2>Well,
it's hilarious.
I love it.
I mean,</v>

571
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:56.210
I love the internal seen struggles on the left,

572
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.700
<v 1>right?
It's,
it's hilarious.
It's a comedy actually.</v>

573
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.750
<v 2>And I always wonder,
you know,</v>

574
00:35:00.751 --> 00:35:04.800
when x left does get called out for bigotry or racism,

575
00:35:04.801 --> 00:35:07.230
does it make them ever think,
well gee,
you know,

576
00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:12.060
I've been calling everybody else a racist.
I know I'm not.
These are false claims.

577
00:35:12.061 --> 00:35:15.030
Maybe the other people that conservatives aren't as well,
you know,

578
00:35:15.031 --> 00:35:20.031
so I don't know if the New York Times has called out or even people who I really

579
00:35:20.071 --> 00:35:24.570
respect.
I mean,
Nicholas Christakis at Yale,
he's a,
he's a wonderful,

580
00:35:24.571 --> 00:35:27.780
serious scholar,
but he is a man of the left,
you know,
and,

581
00:35:27.781 --> 00:35:30.850
and even after he was got eaten by this month,
right?

582
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:35.070
So he was mob for three hours by students cursing at him in the most vile

583
00:35:35.071 --> 00:35:35.641
language.

584
00:35:35.641 --> 00:35:39.900
It's just the most shocking instantiation of the cultural revolution of these

585
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.740
students that have been just fed their victimology for,

586
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:48.030
for the last 16 years.
And nobody daring to expect of them.

587
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:48.864
Civil behavior.

588
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.230
<v 1>I hope I totally get this right,</v>

589
00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:53.170
but at this moment where these kids are screaming at him at Yale,

590
00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:57.100
one of the girls screaming at him screams who hired you?

591
00:35:57.101 --> 00:36:00.370
And it turns out that she was on the board that helped hire him.
Oh,

592
00:36:00.371 --> 00:36:02.530
I remember that.
That's how bananas,
the whole thing.
Yeah.

593
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:07.020
<v 2>Right,
right.
Um,
but shouting,
you know,
you are disgusting and it just,</v>

594
00:36:07.021 --> 00:36:11.190
it was unbelievable.
But he,
even after this happened,

595
00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.920
it's sort of unfortunate.
He penned a submissive to the student body,

596
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.170
still wanting to confirm his progressive bone a few days and saying,

597
00:36:22.171 --> 00:36:26.490
well of course I understand that for minority students at Yale,
you know,

598
00:36:26.491 --> 00:36:31.050
this is a struggle which is be us.
No,
no students,

599
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:36.080
no student at Yale is in a struggle for psychological safety or an anti I haven

600
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:43.080
from racism.
Yale is again,
it is the most progressive environment,
new ministry.

601
00:36:43.081 --> 00:36:46.680
So,
so you know what we've seen with Bret Weinstein and and whatnot,

602
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:50.840
they now are realizing they're making broader uh,
affiliation.

603
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.270
<v 1>Yeah.
Well it's funny I bring,
when I do stand up now,</v>

604
00:36:53.271 --> 00:36:55.530
I usually bring one of the IDW crew with me.
You should,

605
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.570
you should join me for one of them.

606
00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.590
I love what I bring bread on several times and most of my audience now is

607
00:37:00.591 --> 00:37:02.660
libertarian or Conservative,
old school liberal.

608
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:06.240
And he's still described himself as a progressive and they love him.
And,

609
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:07.190
and even though there's a,

610
00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:10.580
there's an absolute disagreement on plenty of the issues and we get into all of

611
00:37:10.581 --> 00:37:13.850
it from climate change to everything else.
The audience cheers and applauds him.

612
00:37:13.851 --> 00:37:15.230
And I always tell him,
I go,
Bro,
you know,

613
00:37:15.231 --> 00:37:18.770
you do know that we couldn't get five progressive's to show up anywhere for us.

614
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.630
Right.
So that does tell you something about,
about the tolerant crew.
Uh,
alright,

615
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.240
moving on from hot hot button to hot button next.

616
00:37:26.241 --> 00:37:28.590
We're in a little bit of a time as you do today.
Um,

617
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.530
let's talk about immigration because this is obviously the thing at the moment.

618
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.870
What is your stance on immigration?

619
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.420
<v 2>Well,
I think low skilled mass immigration is not a good thing for this country.</v>

620
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.710
I think it's absolutely a country's prerogative to define who comes into the

621
00:37:44.711 --> 00:37:45.350
country.

622
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.880
It is not for people outside of the country to make a de facto immigration

623
00:37:48.881 --> 00:37:53.830
policy by their decisions to come into the country illegally.
And,

624
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.020
uh,
you know,
the left,

625
00:37:56.021 --> 00:38:00.900
we'll not talk about the effect on Americans' wages.
It's,

626
00:38:00.901 --> 00:38:05.590
it's quite bizarre.
You know,
Cesar Chavez,
the farm worker organizer,

627
00:38:05.591 --> 00:38:10.591
was completely against illegal immigration because he realized that it undercuts

628
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:15.820
the wages of,
of,
of American Hispanics and blacks,
Barbara Jordan,

629
00:38:15.821 --> 00:38:19.060
a black congressman in [inaudible] 94 chair to immigration panel,

630
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:23.350
totally against the levels of low skilled immigration.
We had saying it's,

631
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.000
it's affecting America's working classes the hardest.
Uh,

632
00:38:28.001 --> 00:38:32.950
and I think that we're bringing in a culture that is not in our current

633
00:38:32.951 --> 00:38:37.951
environment with its monolithic flows from the Central American Mexico.

634
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.900
It's not assimilating.

635
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:45.901
And what I've been reporting on a for a decade now is the downward assimilation

636
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:50.350
of the second third generation of Spanish into an underclass culture.
You know,

637
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:54.730
the conservative happy face narrative is Hispanic family values.
Well,

638
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:59.500
Hispanics have the second highest out of wedlock childbearing booth after
blacks,

639
00:38:59.501 --> 00:38:59.921
blacks,

640
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:04.921
it's about 71% of all black children are born to single parents with Hispanics

641
00:39:05.411 --> 00:39:08.020
is 53%.
That's really high.

642
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:13.170
When Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote his extraordinarily present a alarm about

643
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:19.051
black family breakdown in 1965 and he said as long as so many black boys are

644
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:21.310
being raised without fathers,

645
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.390
we are not going to close the economic gap.

646
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.830
We are not going to make further progress on civil rights because these boys are

647
00:39:29.831 --> 00:39:33.160
not being socialized.
At that point,

648
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:38.190
the black out of wedlock birth rate was 23% Moynahan thought that was a crisis.

649
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.930
Right now it's 71% for blacks and for Hispanics.
It's twice that.

650
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.630
<v 1>I'll never take a an opportunity not to discuss Daniel Patrick Moynihan for a</v>

651
00:39:48.631 --> 00:39:48.871
second,

652
00:39:48.871 --> 00:39:53.871
but so where are the good liberals on this or are they just gone or is it what

653
00:39:54.211 --> 00:39:55.500
you just referred to before?

654
00:39:55.501 --> 00:39:59.940
Which is they know what happens when they've called everyone else racist for so

655
00:39:59.941 --> 00:40:02.880
long so then they just cower away and disappear.

656
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.270
I mean I suspect it's some version of that cause I've kind of lived through it

657
00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:06.990
myself.
Yeah.

658
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.980
<v 2>Where are they on this being immigration or on out of like the family?
Yes.</v>

659
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:13.410
<v 1>Great.
Well on almost everything we've discussed here so far.
Where are the,</v>

660
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.200
where are the good liberals of today?

661
00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.590
<v 2>Well,
again,
they will not talk about behavior.
That is that,</v>

662
00:40:19.591 --> 00:40:24.390
that is the dividing line.
Liberal Moynahan could,
he could say,

663
00:40:24.391 --> 00:40:28.260
look at there are behavioral at this point from here on out we're going to see

664
00:40:28.261 --> 00:40:30.060
predominantly behavior.

665
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:34.980
Not that obviously in the 60s there was still just egregious racism,
but,

666
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:38.430
but it was possible to say,
although,
you know,

667
00:40:38.431 --> 00:40:41.520
even back then he was immediately turned into a pariah.

668
00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:46.110
So things weren't so great back then.
It was just mobbed.
And he,

669
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.390
that,
that report which could have,

670
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:52.740
if it had been embraced and brought into the public discourse would have meant

671
00:40:52.741 --> 00:40:55.350
that we weren't here today,
uh,

672
00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:00.470
talking and having to write these phony narratives about the fact that we still

673
00:41:00.661 --> 00:41:05.100
have this achievement gap and crime gap and incarceration gap.
Uh,
I don't know.

674
00:41:05.101 --> 00:41:09.900
I think,
again,
I think people feel very uncomfortable,
uh,

675
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.960
with the continuing racial divide and they've somehow have lost any confidence

676
00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.420
in saying to blacks,

677
00:41:21.421 --> 00:41:25.560
you have agency and it's not all our fault.

678
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:30.140
<v 1>So before we skew too far off the immigration thing,</v>

679
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.200
then how do we do this?
Right?
How,

680
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.490
how do we actually do it?
Right.
It seemed right.
Like right now as it stands,

681
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:41.930
we're sort of between,
either you want a wall and protectionism,
let's say,

682
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.160
or you want open borders.
There seems to be very little in between that,

683
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:48.290
even though I think probably 80% of us,
if not,

684
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:53.540
if not 95% of us want something that's much more in between those two things.

685
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:53.740
Yeah.

686
00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.610
<v 2>Well,
I mean the,
the bromide is,
well,
we need comprehensive immigration reform.</v>

687
00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.470
You know,
that that's there.
The safe harbor that you can say on this,
I suppose,

688
00:42:02.471 --> 00:42:07.060
I mean,
comprehensive immigration reform is basically code for amnesty for Daca,

689
00:42:07.061 --> 00:42:07.990
for the dreamers,

690
00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.130
and usually a higher levels of,

691
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:16.960
of family and chain,
low skilled immigration.
I,

692
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.970
I've written for will,
we also need eVerify we need to,
you know,

693
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:24.880
have employers have to mandatorily check the work papers are just very easy.

694
00:42:24.881 --> 00:42:26.980
It's instantaneous.
They do that.

695
00:42:26.981 --> 00:42:30.020
They get a safe harbor against any kind of liability.
Uh,

696
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.390
but I th I think frankly,
seeing these caravans,
seeing the,

697
00:42:34.391 --> 00:42:39.100
the mobs storming border patrol,
throwing rocks,
trying to scale the fences,

698
00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.370
uh,
I'm in favor of a wall.
You know,

699
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.220
the only reason to oppose a wall is because you think it works.

700
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:49.150
That's why the liberals don't want it.
Uh,
they,
you know,

701
00:42:49.151 --> 00:42:52.480
if they think it's so superfluous,
we put it up,
you know,
what the hell.

702
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.080
But they actually do think it will be effective.

703
00:42:56.081 --> 00:43:00.520
And that's why they don't want it.
Uh,
but I think again,
we need to have,

704
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.410
be able to talk about,
uh,
what low skilled the Po,

705
00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.620
the fiscal costs that this mass,

706
00:43:08.621 --> 00:43:13.621
low skilled poverty culture that we are importing is imposing on the American

707
00:43:14.531 --> 00:43:18.520
tax payer.
Whether it's through schools,
you know,
the,
all of the,
again,

708
00:43:18.521 --> 00:43:21.100
I see this at the Berrendo middle school in Pico Rivera,

709
00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:25.270
all of the counselors trying to get these kids that are getting sucked into gang

710
00:43:25.271 --> 00:43:30.220
culture to try and keep them on their feet.
Uh,
the,

711
00:43:30.221 --> 00:43:31.960
the health care costs.
You know,

712
00:43:31.961 --> 00:43:34.820
now you have demographic change so much in California.

713
00:43:34.821 --> 00:43:38.620
You have California saying we're going to have full health care for illegal

714
00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:41.830
immigrants,
mayor de Blasio in New York,
full tax payers,

715
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.050
subsidize healthcare for illegal immigrants.

716
00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:49.060
If the politics keeps changing this way,
that's going to be more and more.
And um,

717
00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:52.300
I dunno,
you know,
a lot of Americans,

718
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.900
some Americans understand that this is just extraordinarily burdensome on our

719
00:43:58.901 --> 00:43:59.734
society.

720
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.770
<v 1>Yeah.
All right.
We only have about 10 minutes left.
Okay.</v>

721
00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.160
That's everything that everything we've been talking about is,

722
00:44:05.161 --> 00:44:08.740
is sort of exactly what the diversity delusion is all about.
Yeah.
Um,

723
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.360
but if I had to pick one thing to,
to end on here,
out of the book,
what,

724
00:44:12.361 --> 00:44:14.050
what should we go with here?
Because I could do,

725
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:16.120
I could do 20 more topics with you about all of this,

726
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.810
but these things are all so interestingly linked together obviously.

727
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.500
<v 2>Well I would say the diversity mania,
the,</v>

728
00:44:23.501 --> 00:44:26.730
the sort of equation of the diversity mania,

729
00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:31.731
which is present now both in universities and abroad outside of is a race and

730
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:37.620
gender.
The most important things about the self I completely disagree with.

731
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.020
I can tell you being female is not an accomplishment.

732
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:44.250
It is not a particularly interesting status as far as I'm concerned.

733
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.540
Uh,
most important thing about the self

734
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:55.050
discrimination based on those characteristics is the defining feature of

735
00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:56.610
American society.
See,

736
00:44:56.611 --> 00:45:01.611
Ta-nehisi coats the American academic idle and the idol of the establishment,

737
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:07.950
uh,
who says that destroying the black body is the very essence of America.

738
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:09.750
And third,

739
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:15.020
that any lack of proportionality of race and gender in any institution is by

740
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:20.250
definition the result of sexism and racism.

741
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.530
That idea now it defines university culture,

742
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:27.960
but it is now spreading into the sciences.

743
00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:32.430
That's what I think is the most concerning and the most amazing because a lot of

744
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:36.420
optimists,
the people who want to see,
you know,
all this is fine.

745
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:40.260
There's all these firewalls,
the firewalls,
whether it's the free market,

746
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.041
it's corporations,

747
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:44.130
they'll never do this or it's science and the scientist are never going to be

748
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:47.280
taken care of.
You know,
they'll never taken over by identity politics wrong.

749
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:52.950
The National Science Foundation is spending billions of taxpayer dollars funding

750
00:45:52.951 --> 00:45:57.951
gender studies professors to study intersectionality and microaggressions in

751
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:02.340
engineering.
And math.
This is insane.
Uh,

752
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:03.870
you have Google,
you know,

753
00:46:03.871 --> 00:46:07.440
firing engineers who dare to challenge the feminist orthodoxy.

754
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:12.930
I have worked out,
I'm collecting a series of natural experiments,

755
00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:17.931
testing the discrimination hypothesis when it comes to gender,

756
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.193
because again,

757
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:24.260
we look at Google and we see 20% female engineers at Google and other high tech

758
00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:25.080
firms.

759
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.880
The diversity explanation is that's because Google's gatekeepers are sexist.

760
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:35.120
They are simply unable to spot engineering talent when it comes with female

761
00:46:36.091 --> 00:46:37.050
gonads.

762
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:42.410
So what we need to test the discrimination of hypothesis are institutions with

763
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:45.540
no gatekeepers that are wide open.

764
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:50.790
And I'm collecting examples of these and what they show is that there are

765
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:55.791
natural differences between males and females when it comes to appetite for

766
00:46:56.611 --> 00:47:01.350
competition.
Drive and yes,
high and math skills.
Wikipedia,

767
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:06.240
blind editing.
It's open to anybody.
There are no gatekeepers.

768
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:11.360
Anybody can edit or write a Wikipedia entry.
50,
50 men and women

769
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:17.140
come on down.
13%.
Females,
the,

770
00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:21.240
the female entries are really weak.
Nobody's,
nobody's keeping them out.

771
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.910
I noticed this where scrabble championships,

772
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.770
nobody's females predominate among casual,
uh,

773
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.580
amature home scrabble players.

774
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:35.210
There's never been a female scrabble championship,
uh,

775
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.170
uh,
spelling,
no.
Does the,
the,
uh,

776
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.980
geography bees,
the winners are males.
It goes on and on and on.

777
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:49.300
History.
Bees,
the winners are males.
These are things without gatekeepers.

778
00:47:49.301 --> 00:47:51.580
The fact of this silicon valley,

779
00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:55.270
the drive that we see to create these startups,

780
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.890
you guys in the intellectual dark web are predominantly male.
Uh,

781
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.671
that's not that.

782
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:04.210
There are not individual females out there with as much competitive drive,

783
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:07.960
as much empire building.
Let's take risks.

784
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:09.570
But one of the things that God,

785
00:48:09.571 --> 00:48:14.560
James Damore fired from Google for his infamous 10 page memo suggesting that

786
00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:19.270
there may be nondiscriminatory reasons for the lack of 50,

787
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:20.560
50 gender parity at Google.

788
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:25.510
He talked about some of the big five personality traits and he used this phrase,

789
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.020
neuroticism.
And to the late,
you're,
this sounded very offensive.
Yeah.

790
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:34.870
And he said,
females are more neurotic.
This is a common term in psychology.

791
00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.910
This has been around for decades.
That's one of the big five traits.
Right?

792
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:44.940
And it turns out that females are more risk averse and they worry more.

793
00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:47.960
<v 1>And there might be biological and yeah.</v>

794
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.270
<v 2>Horrible reasons for this.</v>

795
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:54.250
<v 1>Yeah.
So it's interesting,
I'm sure you know about this,
but,
um,</v>

796
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.380
over the last couple months where Jordan and I have been traveling,

797
00:48:56.381 --> 00:48:59.020
we went to Sweden and now everyone on the left and all the socialists,

798
00:48:59.021 --> 00:49:01.390
they always pointed Sweden as the place where they're doing everything right.

799
00:49:01.391 --> 00:49:04.470
In Sweden and Sweden,
which has done egalitarianism.
Right?
Right.

800
00:49:04.471 --> 00:49:07.120
There's no doubt about it.
They have been completely equal men and women.

801
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:10.570
Well now they've found out that for whatever reason,

802
00:49:10.571 --> 00:49:14.180
men still want to be engineers and women's still want to be nurses.
Right?

803
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.700
So now they ran the experiment properly and that they made a truly egalitarian

804
00:49:18.701 --> 00:49:19.510
society.

805
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:24.460
But the postmodernist and the leftist and the progressive's won't let them take

806
00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:27.700
the results of the experiment that they did.
Right.

807
00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:30.960
And now they're trying to rejigger the society again.
Right.
And it's,

808
00:49:30.961 --> 00:49:32.570
it's just absolutely.
Okay.

809
00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.470
<v 2>Incredible.
It's incredible.
And again,
if there's,</v>

810
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:37.590
if there's more females than males in an institution,
that's fine.

811
00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:39.630
And let me just finish that.
You know,
with the,
with the,

812
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.420
with the conservative to liberal ratio in academia,

813
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.970
if you point that out to,

814
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.060
to the liberals in academia that,

815
00:49:48.061 --> 00:49:52.110
that let you know in some faculties you have a hundred to one liberal to

816
00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.200
conservative ratio.
What they will say is,
well,

817
00:49:55.230 --> 00:50:00.230
a conservatives are just not interested in these fields or they're not as smart,

818
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.760
right.
Explanations that they will not,

819
00:50:02.761 --> 00:50:07.761
except for why females gravitate towards more to hands on relational,

820
00:50:07.801 --> 00:50:12.300
human centered work and they're,
they're just not as interested in,

821
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:12.990
uh,

822
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:17.990
perhaps being coders at 2:00 AM with cold pizza in some ugly computer science

823
00:50:19.771 --> 00:50:21.000
lab that the Geeks,

824
00:50:21.001 --> 00:50:24.390
the science geeks are predominantly males and they're probably on the spectrum.

825
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.460
So what,
get over it?
Who Cares?

826
00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.100
<v 1>Damn well.
All right.
You're super</v>

827
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.330
<v 2>busy.
So I,
I'm for all right,</v>

828
00:50:29.331 --> 00:50:31.880
we're going to do this again for sure because I feel like we just got warmed up

829
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:35.090
here.
Great.
But let's end on gimme something positive out of this.

830
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.410
But for the people that see all this that are truly worried about it are

831
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.850
emailing me every day that care about these conversations.

832
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:44.150
What are the signs that we might be getting?
Some wins.

833
00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:46.810
You are that enough people are starting to wake up to this craziness.
Well,

834
00:50:46.811 --> 00:50:50.860
your audience I think,
I mean there really are people out there,
the universities,

835
00:50:50.861 --> 00:50:55.060
people are operating under terrified silence.
I hear from professors,

836
00:50:55.061 --> 00:50:58.600
I hear from faculty.
It is unbelievable.
Yeah,
it's like styles.
He's just like,

837
00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:03.600
it's like it's Germany or Russia.
People are afraid to speak in a university,

838
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.370
which purports to be the model of human discourse.

839
00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:11.260
But there are people that are pushing back against it and all I can say is we

840
00:51:11.261 --> 00:51:15.430
are not going to beat this thing and less we push back against the narrative

841
00:51:15.431 --> 00:51:18.760
that any disparities in representation or due to racism and sexism,

842
00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:23.410
as long as that narrative wins the push for quotas,

843
00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:27.310
the destruction of scientific meritocracy is going to continue,

844
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:30.970
and China is going to end up whooping our ass when it comes to technological

845
00:51:30.971 --> 00:51:34.450
innovation.
Because when it comes to science,
they care about only one thing.

846
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:36.830
Can you do the engineering?
Okay.

847
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:37.661
<v 1>Very strange.</v>

848
00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:40.780
The people who are obsessed with our differences seem to want us to be the same

849
00:51:40.781 --> 00:51:43.620
more than anybody else.
Right.
The garbage velvety.

850
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.620
It's been the prize for Heather.

851
00:51:44.621 --> 00:51:47.200
I'm sorry this was so quick and we're going to do it again for sure.

852
00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.050
