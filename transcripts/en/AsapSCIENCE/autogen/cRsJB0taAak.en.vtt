00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.700
 Ayahuasca is a drug and hallucinogenic drug used by South American tribes 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.440
 For centuries during spiritual ceremonies. But they are becoming more prevalent among those who are looking 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.809
 About audio and visual hallucinations, but what exactly is ayahuasca? And how it affects your body 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 And your brain? 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.980
 In fact, ayahuasca is a combination of the leaves of the psychotria viridis, 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.010
 And another plant vine called Banisteriopsis caapi - while neither of them causes hallucinations alone. 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.640
 But the leaves contain DMT (dimethyltriptamine), which is similar to the composition of the structure 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800
 The neurotransmitter serotonin in your body and the chemicals in the mushroom-mushrooms! 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.940
 The problem is that your stomach enzymes naturally disrupt the DMT before it is absorbed 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.430
 In the course of your blood; and here comes the role of Karma. It inhibits your stomach enzymes 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.740
 Work well, and allow the DMT to move through your bloodstream to your brain 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.990
 To cross the blood-brain barrier. 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.400
 The effects of this drink usually appear, about half an hour after they are taken, and their hallucinogenic effect peaks 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.420
 An hour later, it begins to disappear within six hours. But 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.050
 It is reported that these hallucinogens are different from real estate such as LSD and mushroom - the mushrooms - most people are aware of 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.500
 Absolutely their visual hallucination. In addition, instead of 'hearing voices' 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.360
 The audible sounds are usually merely exacerbated by the noise around them. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.140
 Unlike those who use LSD and Mushroom Mushroom for fun, many people drink ayahuasca 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.720
 Seeking reconciliation with their thoughts and feelings and painful events in the past and present. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.280
 After that, most feel comfortable and more receptive to their thoughts 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.090
 And their current status. 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.010
 The default mode network is a characteristic area of ​​the brain, if it is hyperactive, it accompanies it 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.810
 Feeling stressed, depressed and social phobia. A magnetic resonance scan of the brain shows that ayahuasca is causing 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.650
 Significant decrease in activity within the network default mode. Where this activity is associated 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.680
 Usually with the meditative state this explains the reason for the feeling of those who seek out audio and visual hallucinations, 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.049
 And some of the Ayahuasca poets to peace with themselves, and to create their renewed sense of purpose 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.049
 After returning from the trip effect of the property. 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.830
 In addition, DMT has been associated with proteins that promote long-term memory retention, 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.970
 Neural plasticity, the re-formation of new neurons. The DMT can bind to specific receptors 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.760
 Such as those found on the mitochondria and the endoplasmic network, and may have the ability to kill 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.950
 Specific cancer cells. In addition, alkaloids taken from karma have been shown to lead to the death of cancer cells 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.010
 In mouse skin and specific cells in the human liver. But this does not mean that ayahuasca is considered 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.690
 An alternative to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but may enter the future within 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.549
 Cancer Research. Interestingly, unlike other real estate such as alcohol and cocaine, it does not cause ayahuasca 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.849
 Immunity to the body, so regular users do not need to increase the amount 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.219
 To achieve the same effect they tried the first time. 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.999
 After treatment, I always suffer from severe vomiting and diarrhea; 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:40.970
 Because the drink is very acidic, it becomes the stomach of its users usually disturbed, even for those who drink it heavily 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.900
 A dark side of Ayahuasca, too, has been linked as a cause of death, especially among tourists, 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.450
 Although the method of death is often not determined. This rise in popularity of the drink 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.230
 To the high number of false shamans and priests, who are not qualified to manufacture it safely. 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.810
 Ultimately, the data is now too small to take a serious look at Oceanic as a way of entertainment. 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.189
 We need more clinical trials to assess whether ayahuasca is safe. 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.939
