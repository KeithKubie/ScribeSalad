00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: Today's
speaker, Dick Bolles,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.530
is the author of, "What
Color Is Your Parachute?,"

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.660
a practical manual for
job hunters and career

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.059
changers-- the most popular
job hunting book in the world.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.070
He updates "Parachute"
every year.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.270
The newest edition is this year.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.270
The "Parachute" book has
been sold more than 10

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.830
million copies to date.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.960
It has been translated
into 20 languages,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.060
and is sold in 26 countries--
is used in 26 countries.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.970
Dick was a minister
for many years

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.900
before he became a writer.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.470
And prior to that, he majored
in chemical engineering at MIT

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.100
and graduated with a degree
in physics in Harvard.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.870
Dick and his son, Gary Bolles,
are no strangers to Google.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.150
Both of them have been
involved in Google's Zeitgeist

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.720
conference in the past.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.130
Today we have asked
Dick to help us

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.570
with our future--
each of our futures.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.300
What are you going
to do in five years?

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.140
Here I am happy to present
to you Dick Bolles.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.100
DICK BOLLES: Thank
you very much.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.670
Thank you, Optimists.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.430
I always am amused that
we clap before we've

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.760
heard one word out of
the person's mouth.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.980
I appreciate all of
you being here today.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.400
I know there are other things
you could do with your hour

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.280
at noon.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.170
For me, it's a
stroll in the park.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.840
I live nearby.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.460
I live 58 minutes away in
the East Bay, Danville.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.770
And I always love coming
to the Google Campus

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.880
with hardly a single
face over the age of 30,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.700
because it's nice to see
the youth of America.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.200
How many of you have
given any thought

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.630
to what you're going to be
doing five years from now?

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.480
Could you raise your hand if
you have given it thought?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.080
Ah, that's impressive.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.190
I wouldn't have thought that.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.040
Very interesting.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.757
Of course, it's
hard to figure out

00:02:15.757 --> 00:02:17.840
what you're going to be
doing five years from now.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.650
I was thinking back in my
own life, when I was 40,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.350
I could never have predicted
in a million years what

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.780
I was going to be doing
just five years from then.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.050
At that time, I
was cannon pastor

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.290
at Grace Cathedral
in San Francisco,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.430
and in the next
years, I was fired.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.260
In the next years, I was hired
to visit every college campus

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.940
in the nine Western states.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.450
I was hired to find out what
was bothering those people.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.800
And I remember we had a
meeting of my colleagues--

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.280
I had nine other
denominations working with me,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.390
I was the Episcopalian.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.840
And the others were the
Methodist, Pres-- everything

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.110
you would think of.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.380
And we had this meeting
at Glide Memorial Church,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.500
just using their offices.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.800
And they said, "Dick, you're
sitting nearest the blackboard.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.731
Would you put up what we need
to talk about during our meeting

00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:25.230
today?"

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.240
And I said, "Sure."

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.980
And they said, "Somebody
needs to go to Pocatello."

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.940
That was Idaho.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.265
We had a firebrand
campus minister there

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:37.320
that was always causing
trouble, and we always

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.880
had to go and soothe the
feathers of the administration.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.530
So I put up on the
blackboard, "Pocatello."

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.950
And then they said,
"Dick, we have

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.210
to discuss the date
for our next meeting."

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.210
So I put, "Next meeting."

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.010
And they said, "Dick, we need
to talk about the people who

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.240
are going to have to bail out."

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.240
And I wrote, "What color
is your parachute?"

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.640
Because I was playing with
the words, "bail out,"

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.200
and I thought, it's
either a leaky rowboat

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.520
where you're taking the water
out before you get swamped,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.640
or it's somebody jumping
out of an airplane.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.470
I've always had a
very playful mind.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.250
I like the mind
that God's given me.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.950
But I like most of all
about it, it's very playful.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.110
In 2002, I died, literally.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.250
I stopped breathing.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.010
My fingernails and lips
turned black, and so on.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.590
And they revived me,
which I was grateful for,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.400
and so I had been dreaming.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.750
I lay down to sleep, and
I died during my sleep.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.422
And so I thought--
when I woke up,

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:49.880
I thought I was
still in the dream.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.790
And all these
white-coated people

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.960
were rushing back and forth.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.800
And I thought, this is odd.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.950
I've never had
this dream before.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.810
So I looked at them, and
one of them came up to me

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.500
and the first question
he said is, "Can you

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.480
tell me your name?"

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.850
And I said, "Dick Bolles."

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.460
And then he said, "Can you
tell me your social security

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.960
number?"

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.360
And immediately, because
God gave me a bright mind,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.630
I realized he was
testing the viability

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.250
of my intelligence in my brain.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.070
So as I said, the one
thing I love about the mind

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.980
that God gave me is, I
love how playful it is.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.160
So I said, I'm going to play
with the next question he

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.290
asks me.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.930
So he asked me, "What's
your social security?"

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.140
And I reeled it off.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.020
And then I was ready
for him-- and this

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.410
was when George Bush was in the
White House-- he said, "Can you

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.610
tell me the name of the
President of the United

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.110
States?"

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.100
And I said, "Of
course-- chowder head."

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.910
And at first, he thought
I was really gone.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.650
And then he realized
I was joking.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.000
So, and my father-- I
got this from my father.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.130
My father was
tremendously playful,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.960
and famously, his last words,
as he lay on his bed dying,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:13.340
were, "Thank God I won't have
to go to the bathroom anymore."

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.250
So I love that kind
of playfulness.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.120
So when we had that meeting
and I wrote that silly title

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.440
on the blackboard for the
item that we had to discuss,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.320
some years later, within
the five, when I was 43,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.280
I wrote a book on what I-- I
put together all the research

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.810
I could find about why
people got sick of their jobs

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.590
and what they did when they
got sick of their jobs.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.040
And I went and interviewed
people around the country.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.880
I travel-- I kept a log.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.890
I travelled 68,000 miles, and
back and forth, back and forth,

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.200
back and forth, because I had
a huge travel budget from these

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.040
10 different Protestant
denominations that I was

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.340
working for.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.360
And so eventually, I
put it all together.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.520
I just published it,
self-published it.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.830
And I took it down to a
copy shop in San Francisco,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.510
and I said, "Can you
bind this together

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.110
and make it be a book?"

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.600
And they said, "Sure."

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.170
And then I tried to think
of what title to put on it,

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.950
and they said, "Well, what
title do you want to put on it?"

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.720
And I thought of-- I remembered
the laughter when that item had

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.010
come up on the blackboard at
that meeting two years before

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.910
this, and so I said,
"I'm going to call it,

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.720
'What Color is Your Parachute?'"

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.350
And nobody in the
world could figure out

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.450
what on earth I meant.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.750
So they started to think,
well, it's an allegory.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.800
Maybe he means, is it yellow,
are you too afraid to jump?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.020
And blah, blah, blah.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.640
It Didn't mean anything--
that's the trouble.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.240
It was, and is, a joke.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.430
Now, it shot to the top
of the best seller list.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.930
I don't know why.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.000
And the average book
sells, believe it or not,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.200
in its lifetime, total
sales of the average book

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.400
in this country is 3,000 copies.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.620
And if it sells-- they studied
how many business books were

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.250
published two years
ago, and in that year,

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.370
1,000 business books were
published, and 62 of them

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.310
sold more than 3,000.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.310
Only 62 out of the whole 1,000.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:32.814
So when you hit sales like 10
million, people pay attention,

00:08:32.814 --> 00:08:34.480
or they want to know why.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.030
And it isn't the
charm of the writer,

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.530
and it isn't the knowledge that
he's got his head, or her head.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:48.540
It reveals a vacuum-- a
vacuum in our schools.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.290
I remember going to
Hastings Law School.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.060
They asked me to speak
there some time back.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.430
And I said, "How do you
measure the number of lawyers

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.020
you're producing so that it
just fits the number that

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.970
are needed out there?"

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.960
And they said, we
make no such attempt.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.290
We don't try to match
the number of people

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.010
of people we're educating with
what the job market wants.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.820
That's not our concern.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.910
Somebody wants to be
trained as a lawyer,

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.130
she or he can come here,
and we will train them.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.410
And that is the
problem with so much

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.980
of what goes on
with our schools.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.100
It teaches us, again
and again, to think.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.080
Teaches us to store vast kinds
of knowledges in our head.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.920
But it doesn't tell
us a word about what

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.240
to do when you want to move
where the rubber hits the road.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.790
So the book has
become so popular

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.040
because of the vacuum in
our educational system.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.910
No book in the world would
sell 10 million copies

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.870
if the schools covered that
same topic in the curriculum.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.880
So that's always been
fascinating to me.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.940
Now, five years
from now-- how do

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.580
we figure out what
we're going to be

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.490
doing five years from now?

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.990
Well, the trouble is,
I'd like to sort of,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.490
with my training in technique
pursuits at MIT and Harvard,

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.490
I like to observe
what people do.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.000
Never mind telling them,
"Hey, you should go do this,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.070
you should go do that."

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.720
I like to see, what do they do?

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.540
How do they act?

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.050
And I've discovered--
over the 40 years

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.170
I've been in this field now--
I've discovered that people

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.500
approach the subject of, what
am I going to be doing five

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.200
years from now in
three different ways.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.030
The first way is to
ignore the subject.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.450
I mean, luck, I guess,
would be the summary of it.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.930
They decide, I'm going
to depend on luck.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.515
I'll find out where I
am five years from now,

00:10:52.515 --> 00:10:55.880
and that will help me to figure
out then what I'm going to do.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.010
Now, that's kind of
like surfing, isn't it?

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.030
It's like saying,
whatever are going

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.220
to be the waves that will come
along then, I'll leap on them

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.980
and I'll try to take
advantage of them.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.710
But it's going to be luck.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.260
That's going to guide
how I figure out

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.320
what I'm going to be
doing five years from now.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.635
And then I observed by watching
a lot of people over time,

00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:23.120
that there was another way in
which some people approached

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.110
the subject, and that was,
they would say to themselves,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.820
"I'll know it when I see it."

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.940
That was famously
enshrined in "Mamma Mia"

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.660
where she had three
fathers and she

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.880
didn't know which one
was really her father,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.550
and she said, "I'll know
him when I see him."

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.225
As you recall from--
those of you who

00:11:43.225 --> 00:11:46.660
saw the play or the movie,
that didn't work out.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.900
So but some people say that.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.660
They say, I'm going to approach
this the way I approach life.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:59.360
I'm going to keep looking
around, and if I see something,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.960
and it's really the kind
of thing I want to do,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.750
I'll know it when I see it.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.990
And then there's
the third approach

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.325
that people take
as an alternative

00:12:10.325 --> 00:12:14.172
if they don't like luck and
they don't like intuition.

00:12:14.172 --> 00:12:15.630
They say, "I'll
figure out what I'm

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.440
going to be doing
five years from now

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.300
by doing some forethought.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.370
I'll do some planning
now, right now.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.060
I'll figure out some
things about myself,

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.500
and I'll let that guide me."

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:34.290
Now, that's fine if we
called it designing.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.510
It's not so hot if
we call it planning,

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.960
because you cannot plan
five years from now.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.456
You have no idea whether
there we'll be a war,

00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:48.800
or what kind of natural
catastrophes come along,

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.710
or what new technologies.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:56.980
You cannot plan,
but you can design.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.180
Now one of the ways in which
I designed in my own life,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.120
and I'll use it as an
illustration of what

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.820
I mean-- I used to
camp with my family.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.100
Gary, one of my sons, is
here in the front row.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.620
I always try to bring my
own audience in case nobody

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.470
else show up.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:21.480
So the way we went
camping, we did camp

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.930
in 40 out of the 50 states while
my four kids were growing up.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:34.960
And when we would go camping, we
would say, what might we need?

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.100
Well, we might need
a long tent pole,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.580
because the car had
a very bad radiator,

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.970
and when we hit the desert
regions of the West,

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.190
sometimes the car
would overheat and you

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.640
needed a poll to push the cap
off the top of the radiator

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.492
and let all the water spout out.

00:13:51.492 --> 00:13:52.950
And then of course,
you had to have

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.290
a container with the
water in it to replenish

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.650
what went out of the radiator.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:03.290
So we didn't plan,
but we tried to say,

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.700
what are the kinds of things
we're going to run into?

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.820
And what might we need to
deal with those problems

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.790
or challenges?

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.720
So that's what, if you're
going to think about-- I'm

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.520
going to give some
forethought to my I'm

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.120
going to be doing
five years from now,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.390
the best you can hope for
is designing-- gathering

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.080
together-- under
your own auspices

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.580
and under your own watch--
gathering together anything

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.450
you might need to
deal with what's

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.770
going to happen
five years from now.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.940
So how do you do that?

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.760
Well, let's go back to all
the different approaches.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.610
We said that either
people are going

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.068
to decide what they're going
to do five years from now when

00:14:51.068 --> 00:14:53.880
they get there-- that's luck.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.720
Or they're going to keep a
watchful eye, because they

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.820
think if they see
an opportunity,

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.100
they'll know it
when they see it.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:08.390
So it's either luck, or
intuition, or designing.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.760
Now what do you
have to do to make--

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.290
let's say we are fully
trained by the computer,

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.610
and our whole brain has
rewired itself a little bit.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.760
We know we're going to be
looking for keywords all

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.320
the time.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.050
We're just going to
be scanning quickly,

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.350
we're going to be
looking for keywords.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.400
So what we need to
do, if we're going

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.140
to start to think about what is
going to happen with our lives

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.960
five years from now, is
to watch for what keywords

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.500
have to command our attention.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.390
So if you're going to
take the approach of luck,

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.730
and a lot of people
do, and it's no shame.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.220
It's just the way they
prefer to operate.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.720
If you're going to take the
approach to luck and say,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.530
I'll just wait, what luck
is going to depend on

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.320
is intersections.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.410
The more people you run
into, the more likely

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.350
you'll have luck, so-called.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.450
So what we have to
observe, if we're

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.400
going to take that
approach to what

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.760
we're going to be doing
five years from now,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.530
we have to make
sure there are more

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.250
intersections in our lives.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.810
That means a bunch of stuff.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:26.560
It mean certainly paying
attention to whatever meetings

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.060
and stuff we go to in
the course of our work.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.950
It means paying attention
to getting on LinkedIn.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.210
There's also a nice app, which
I like a lot, and some of you

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:42.190
may not know it, called
Jobs With Friends.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.910
If you're on
Facebook or LinkedIn,

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.300
you tell Jobs With
Friends-- you can search on

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.750
that, I don't remember
the exact URL--

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:57.280
and it will ask for you
to dump, or let them dump,

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.080
all the people you're linked to,
and then all the people you're

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.680
friends with.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.260
And it will catalog
where they're working,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.849
it'll catalog whether
there are any openings

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.240
at that particular
place where they work.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.990
It'll allow you to put up an
alert beside the companies that

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.390
look interesting.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:22.130
And the great thing
about it is, you already

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.050
have a contact there.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.960
Because you're starting
with your friends.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.140
You're starting with your
contacts, and then saying,

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.480
and what kinds of opportunities
might these friends

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.100
give me access to?

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.010
So Jobs With Friends
is one way to do it.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.200
Checkster is another.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.540
Checkster is spelled
C-H-E-C-K-S-T-E-R,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.470
just what you thought.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.810
Checkster is run by a friend
of mine named Yves Lermusi

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.740
L-E-M-U-S-I.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.885
And what you do there is,
you go to their home page,

00:18:01.885 --> 00:18:04.670
it's Checkster.com, I think.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:10.690
And scroll down, and there
is a box that says My Talent.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.090
And you click on that.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.670
It allows you to designate
six to twelve-- or more,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.440
if you want-- colleagues
that you have,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:25.000
friends that you have, people
that know you like a book.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.240
And over your
signature, Checkster

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.430
will send them an
email asking them

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.110
to answer some questions about
you-- about your work habits,

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.130
and that sort of thing.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.200
And when they get it,
they give you seven days,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.040
they give the friends of
yours seven days to answer,

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.830
and when they answer,
they take the names off,

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:53.530
and they mash it all together
and send you a summary.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.790
It's for your eyes only,
it's all done by machine,

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.140
and it's free.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.320
So that's one way, also to look
at how to build connections

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.270
in terms of, how do
I relate to people?

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.510
How could I relate
better to people?

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.490
Because if I'm going to
go down the route of luck

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.550
to figure out what I'm going to
be doing five years from now,

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.520
I'd better have as many
connections as possible

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.870
so that my luck increases.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.260
On the other hand,
if you decide,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.590
no, I'm not going to
just depend on luck.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.240
I'm going to be alert.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.360
I'm going to start to
really pay attention.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.320
I'm going to live by intuition.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.200
I do that in my rest
of my life, I'll

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.460
do it with five years from now.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.400
OK.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.760
What does intuition depend on?

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.750
Well, a good example would be
the husband who comes home,

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.420
and he tells his wife
how much he loves her,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:59.030
and he showers her with flowers,
and brings her chocolates,

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.520
and she says, "You're having
an affair, aren't you?"

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.560
And he says, "How
did you know that?"

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.410
And she said, "Because you
never bring me chocolates,

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.680
you never bring me
flowers, blah, blah, blah."

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.620
This is, of course, is
an exaggerated allegory.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.640
But the point I'm
making is, intuition

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.030
depends on what you notice.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.350
You notice what the benchmark
is in your relationships

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.150
with people, and in your
relationships with situations,

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.110
and then when you see a
deviation from that benchmark

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.650
that you've noticed
again and again operates,

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.100
suddenly it occurs to you,
hey, something's going on here.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.530
Because it's different.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.790
So what do you observe when
you are depending on intuition?

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:47.005
Well, you have to determine
whether, generally, you

00:20:47.005 --> 00:20:52.660
know this now-- right now--
what do you like to work with?

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.410
Do you like to work with
just information most of all?

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:01.640
Or do you like to work
with people most of all?

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.340
Or do you like to work
with things, like computers

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.440
and stuff most of all?

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:14.800
Then once you decide that,
well, I like all three, yes.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.310
But push-- push comes to
shove, which of those three

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.770
do you give preference to?

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.390
Which of those three do you
establish a priority for?

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.730
Well, I think I most like to
work with data, or information.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:31.560
OK.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.440
In that case, then what you pay
attention to in the next years

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.160
until you hit five
years from now,

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.140
is you pay attention
to everything

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.570
you run into that has to do
with jobs dealing with data.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.260
Because at least you've begun
to focus down a little bit.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.730
And when you see
deviations, like, oh that

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.800
sounds really interesting,
I've never heard that before,

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.475
you start to pay
large attention.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.400
Now let's say you want
to be a little more

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.460
in charge of your life,
so you're going to decide,

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.780
well, I'm going to approach
five years from now

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.510
by doing some actual stuff now.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.840
The question becomes,
what stuff should you do?

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:26.230
Well, a good thing to do is
an inventory of yourself.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.320
And that sounds
ridiculous, because you've

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.740
lived with yourself
these many years,

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.190
and you know
yourself pretty well.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.240
So why on earth would you
do an inventory of yourself?

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.700
Why not somebody you don't know?

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.400
Well, the answer is
because we've already

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.270
started to put
ourselves in boxes.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.930
You probably know, there were
two articles in the "New York

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.080
Times" these past
three months about how

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.140
to get hired at Google.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.920
And one of the points
of they made was,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.650
they like to interview people
who could figure things out.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.485
And I had another thought,
which I've forgotten what it is,

00:23:05.485 --> 00:23:07.660
but it'll come back.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.600
So you're going to
do a self-inventory.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.730
What are you going
to ask yourself?

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:20.820
You're going to ask yourself,
how have I put myself in boxes?

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.960
How have I said, oh, I'm a tech.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.710
Or oh, I'm a coder.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:32.480
Or, I do programming, or
I do public relations,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.260
and that's who I am.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.370
You need to have a refuge
from the concepts and pictures

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:44.180
of yourself you've been
living with thus far.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:49.110
If you're going to learn,
you first have to unlearn.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.840
Very few schools
talk about that.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.300
There's so many nutty
ideas floating around

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.730
that we are exposed
to since we were

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:02.620
tiny kids, that we
have to unlearn.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.920
And one of them is ourselves.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.070
What's your picture of yourself?

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.500
If we're locked into
the idea that I am this,

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.810
or I am that, that
inhibits us from being

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.740
able to be creative
about what we're going

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.390
to do with our lives one year
from now, never mind five.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:27.500
So you need an inventory that
will sort of say, not I'm this

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.430
and I'm that, but
an inventory that

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.510
starts out with an assumption.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.930
And the assumption
is, I am a person.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:39.188
I am a person who--
dot, dot, dot.

00:24:39.188 --> 00:24:43.390
And there are seven ways in
which you can look at yourself,

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:47.450
and the seven ways
are in my book.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.760
In fact, I invented
this because I

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.000
was helping a bunch of
people in 1977, I think,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.280
back when dinosaurs
were roaming the Earth,

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.380
and I invented this
inventory for them.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.800
It's in my book,
which, incidentally,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.860
I suppose I should do some
crass commercialism-- my book is

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.830
for sale in the
back of the room,

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.960
and it's only 5 bucks today.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.900
That's less than it usually is.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.660
And there's a thing in
the book, and also I

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.442
have a workbook as
well, which is not here.

00:25:23.442 --> 00:25:25.900
If you're going to figure out
what you're going to be doing

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:31.140
five years from now, you
cannot possibly plan that.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:34.790
But you can gather
all the stuff you

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.810
think you might
need when you get

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.310
to five years from now, that
might be helpful and useful.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:45.270
And the first thing you
gather-- when I was camping,

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.250
the first thing we
gathered was a tent.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.430
That was obviously our priority.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:52.857
When you are trying
to figure out

00:25:52.857 --> 00:25:54.690
what you're going to
do five years from now,

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.990
and you've decided not to
go down the road of luck,

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.550
not to go down the
road of just intuition,

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.140
but you've decide to
really try to design,

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.420
gather stuff you may need.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:11.490
The first thing you need most of
all is rethinking who you are.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.640
Because what you're going to
do flows from who you are,

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.890
especially if it's appropriate
work and meaningful

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.800
work for you.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:29.880
So in this inventory, you write
stories-- seven stories-- not

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.570
all at once.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.180
One at a time, then
try to figure out

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.290
what that story tells you.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:39.440
Now, in the workbook, and
also in the main book,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.580
we take you down to
the level of skills.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.540
Why?

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:48.900
Because the further down
toward the atomic level

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.680
in your understanding
of yourself

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.030
that you go-- the
further down you

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.600
go-- the more
flexibility you have.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.210
For example, I was in Spain
a couple of years ago,

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.420
and I was helping them-- they
were retraining construction

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.890
workers to be computer
repair people.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.490
That's most training programs.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.030
You've done one thing,
it's sort of not

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.950
demanded by culture
and society anymore,

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.390
so you learn one new thing.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:18.310
No.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:22.060
That is a horrible way
to go about retraining.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.210
What you want to
have is flexibility.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.920
And flexibility depends
on getting down as far

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.490
as you can to the atomic level.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:37.370
What's the most basic unit that
makes up this thing called you?

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:41.270
And the most basic
unit is your skills.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.710
You have a brain,
and the brain can

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:48.110
do two things-- the
brain can store stuff.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.990
You know a lot about
this, you know quite a bit

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:55.270
about that-- the brain
is a storage area.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:28:00.320
But the brain also has another
function-- it can think.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.660
It can say, this is a
pathway I will take.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.610
This doesn't make any sense.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.220
This new data comes in,
I've got to integrate that

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.820
into my understanding of
what I'm supposed to do here.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.840
You can think.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.910
And thinking is one of the
skills-- one of the skills

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.600
you need to pay attention to.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.810
What kind of thinking
do like to do?

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.570
Do you like to synthesize?

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.850
Do you like to break
down and analyze?

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.290
How do you like
to use your brain?

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.720
What parts of the
different skill

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:39.900
sets that a brain has, just
looking at it as a model.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.860
What are the different
things a brain can do,

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.010
and which of those
do you love to do?

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:49.560
So if you're going to design
how you're going to figure out

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.100
what you're going to be
doing five years from now,

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.270
you need to have an
inventory of yourself.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:58.910
That inventory needs
to depend on stories.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.930
You need to break those
stories down to as close

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:06.840
to the atomic level of
braindom as you can.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.840
And that means skills.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.310
What are your favorite,
favorite, favorite, favorite

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.920
skills?

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.510
Never mind what the
marketplace wants.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.070
Who cares?

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:23.600
You can always find ways to
persuade people to give you

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.340
work that lets you
use your skills if you

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.500
are enthusiastic about them.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.360
If any of you have to do
interviewing now or later

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.110
in your life, if two equally
competent people come

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:40.850
into the room, you will always
end up hiring, instinctively,

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.850
if you're good at
it, you'll always

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.650
end up hiring the one who has
a lot of enthusiasm and passion

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:47.710
for what they're doing.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.540
They didn't just choose this
because they can do it--

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.740
they choose this because
they love to do it.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.700
And that's what your inventory
is about-- figuring out,

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.270
what do you love the most?

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.550
What do you love to do?

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:04.030
What knowledges do you
love to use the most?

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:08.110
And you figure this out
now because then this

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.030
becomes some useful
information to you

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.890
that gives you flexibility.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.360
I did my own analysis
of my own skills,

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:24.050
and I had to write them out,
because I don't remember them.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:27.570
First of all, I'm
very good at writing.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.460
Secondly, I'm very
good at researching.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.450
I spend four hours
a day researching.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.660
I'm very good at teaching.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.820
And I'm good at speaking.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:47.180
So writing, speaking, analyzing,
teaching, researching.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:52.660
Because those are basic
atomic elements of who I am,

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.200
they give me flexibility.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.840
I could be a writer, or
I could be a speaker,

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.140
or I could be an analyzer,
or I could be a teacher,

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.360
or I could be a researcher.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.210
When you get down to the
atomic level of understanding

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:15.110
who you are, you then have
much greater flexibility.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:17.770
You're not committed just
to become a computer repair

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:18.710
person.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.360
You have many choices
about what route

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.600
you're going to take, as long
as your inventory has gotten you

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.900
down to that level of
understanding of who you are.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.920
And that's what you need.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.090
So when we think
about, what am I

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:38.250
going to be doing five
years from now, I mean,

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.340
I haven't got a clue
for my own life.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.310
I know I'll be with
my lovely wife,

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.440
I know I'll treasure
my lovely family,

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.100
I know I will always be
searching for ways to help

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.802
people, because
that's in my DNA.

00:31:55.802 --> 00:31:59.060
I love to help
people a lot, but I

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.550
can't be more
specific than that.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.230
I don't know what
new technologies

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:04.230
are going to come along.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.770
I do try to always adopt them.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.750
I'm sorry I'm not an Apple
man and not an Android man,

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.370
but otherwise I try
to adopt new stuff.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.370
And so when we think
about our lives,

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.760
think carefully how you're
going to understand yourself,

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.950
because your question of what
are you in five years now,

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:29.950
depends on who
you are right now.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.080
Thanks very much.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.230
