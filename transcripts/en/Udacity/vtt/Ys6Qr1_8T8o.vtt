00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The step size of 0.050 is just at the threshold of working.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is what we get for the distribution of temperature

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and you can already see quite some artifacts cropping up.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If you use just a slightly larger time step, hell breaks lose.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You'll get huge temperatures, you'll get negative temperatures, and lots of oscillation.

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Our method becomes unstable.
