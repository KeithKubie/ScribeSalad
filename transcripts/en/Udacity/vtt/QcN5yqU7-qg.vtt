00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.510
In this class you have built your own framework and also used an existing one.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.240
But when you enter the workforce and

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.260
work on projects, how do you know when to use which?

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.420
It's a common problem that you're going to be faced with.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.900
So, let's see if Jacques has any advice for us.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.477
&gt;&gt; Hey so there's actually a bit of a trade off in between using

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:25.170
an established framework like Bootstrap or using your own framework.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.230
And when you use a framework like Bootstrap,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.180
you're going to get a lot of features.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.100
I mean, as you can see, you know, as you've worked through so

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.450
far, you can build a tremendous amount with Bootstrap.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.060
When you start to need to do things outside of that framework,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.140
when you want to start doing things that Bootstrap doesn't,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.080
support, you might look at making your own.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.890
And when you make your own you get a lot of freedom.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.900
You, you can do anything really.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.240
But you're going to have to put in the work to do it.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.350
So as you approach your projects try and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.880
see what that, how that breaks down for you.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.970
If you're going to need to do a lot of things that Bootstrap doesn't support,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.860
try looking at maybe rolling your own.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.120
If you're going to be doing things that Bootstrap does or that another

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.830
framework does that you find that you really like, go for that, absolutely.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.700
At Udacity we actually use a combination between Bootstrap and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.930
some stuff that we've written ourselves, to work, alongside of it.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.870
And that's pretty much it.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.410
Congratulations on, you know, getting through, the class so far.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.750
And you know, it'd be fantastic to see you working on your own projects,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.495
or in you know, at some point a professional office like this.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:43.284
