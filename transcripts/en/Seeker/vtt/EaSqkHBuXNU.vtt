00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.580
Sending astronauts to space used to take a
computer the size of a washing machine.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.580
Now?

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.420
That same computational might can be packed
into something as small as an iPad!

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.240
But as we aim for smaller devices, we're hitting
a threshold...our current materials and techniques

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.360
may not allow us to continue to progress at
this pace.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.010
Because of this we’re being pushed in new
and exciting directions, like innovating the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.000
very stuff computers are made of: goodbye
silicon, hello gallium oxide.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.880
Traditionally, computer chips have been made
out of silicon--hence the name ‘silicon

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.880
valley’.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.879
A computer chip transistor needs to be conductive, because it needs to be able to pass electric

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.109
current through the chip, but it also need
to be able to turn off that current easily,

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.140
so that it can send both messages: yes and
no, 1 and 0.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.260
These kind of materials are called semiconductors
because they can be either a conductor or

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.469
an insulator when needed.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.530
Silicon happens to be the most abundant semi-conductor
on Earth.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.629
But we’ve pushed silicon almost to its limit
in terms of small we can get it.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.699
We’ve hit the threshold of Moore’s Law:
the idea that the number of transistors we

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.670
can fit onto a computer chip doubles every
year.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.780
That was first posited in 1965 and has held
more or less true over the decades.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.500
It’s meant that computing power approximately
doubles every two years.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.580
But now, approaching the edge of Moore’s
law has meant a flurry of exploration into

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.800
what comes next...

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.960
A paper published earlier this year outlines
a case for Ga2O3, or gallium oxide, which

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.690
may be the semiconductor we’ve all been
waiting for.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.690
One of the properties that makes this material
exciting is its large ‘bandgap’.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.780
See, semiconductors have their unique properties
because of their bandgap, which is the distance

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.540
between their outermost band of electrons,
called the valence electrons, and the conduction

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.520
band, which is where the electrons jump to,
when excited, to form an electric current.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.791
So silicon and gallium oxide are both semiconductors
with ideal bandgaps to use in computing, but

00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:51.750
gallium oxide’s bandgap is larger.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.420
This gives it a uniquely high ‘critical
field strength’ and a broad range of possible

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.980
conductivities, ultimately making it a better
future candidate for computer chip scalability.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.780
This field is brand new, like a couple months
ago new, but we think all of these properties

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.349
mean that you could fit more gallium oxide
transistors onto a chip than silicon transistors

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.680
AND this new material could potentially improve
the efficiency of future high-power electronics.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.980
These discoveries are still very much in the
experimental stages and the potential real-world

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.380
applications remain to be seen.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.960
Research like this, into new materials and
techniques, promises hope.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.400
It’s not just new materials in the same
computing methods.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.730
It’s also completely new methods of computing
like quantum computing and optical computing.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.340
The upside of being backed into a corner by
Moore’s Law it that it forces us in new

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.310
directions and into exciting boundary-pushing
territory.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.319
Want to keep pushing those boundaries with
us?

Trace’s video, here.

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.239
Fun fact: The original computers used by NASA
in the 70’s were kept cool by a substance

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.720
that was also used in blood substitutes for
medical uses.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.669
Weird. I’m Maren, thanks for watching Seeker.
