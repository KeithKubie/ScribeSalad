00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:04.439
Vsauce!

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:05.439
Kevin here.

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.330
Kids in the U.S. haven't always had summers
off.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.650
In rural areas, they went to school in summer
and winter to help during planting and harvesting

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.829
while urban kids went year round.

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:21.970
In the mid 1800’s schools shifted to a standardized
fall-spring schedule allowing for family vacations

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.840
and to give relief from buildings with no
air conditioning and doctors at the time supported

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.630
this - saying that summers off would also
help protect kids' brains from overuse.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.360
Meanwhile, kids are getting smarter.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.690
The "Flynn Effect," shows that IQ scores improve
markedly with each generation.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.519
Professor James Flynn found that if students
a hundred years ago took today's IQ test,

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.070
they'd average 70, while if students today
took the test 100 years ago, they'd average

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.510
130.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.889
Explanations include better healthcare, nutrition
and more schooling…

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:01.549
And the fact that people before the scientific
age were often adverse to classifying things

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:07.800
they couldn’t use - and didn’t routinely
engage in hypothetical or abstract thought.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.160
Neuropsychologist A.R.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.120
Luria tested this on a socially isolated farmer
about a hundred years ago and it went something

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.120
like this.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.690
What do a chicken and a dog have in common?

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.690
Nothin’.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.900
A chicken has two legs, a dogs have four.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.810
Chicken have wings - dogs don’t!

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.330
Okay you’ve explained how they're different
but how are they alike?

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.610
They’re not.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.610
Is there one word though that you could use
for both of them?

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.750
Nope.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.790
What about 'animal'?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.880
Would the word ‘animal’ fit?

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.360
Yes.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.800
Online courses are commonplace now but Sir
Isaac Pitman actually established the first

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.130
distance learning course in the 1840’s.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.780
Pitman taught shorthand by mailing postcards
to students and correcting the answers that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.170
they mailed back.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.430
In the 1920s, educational radio programs were
considered textbooks in the air.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.580
And today there are over 2,200 courses available
online around the world.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.930
For free.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.670
While South Korea is using robot teachers
to help children with learning disabilities,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.300
a kindergarten in Switzerland is bringing
education back to its roots.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.360
Literally.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.200
They have a school outside in the forest where
kids attend rain or snow learning to build

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.280
fires and shelters alongside their ABCs.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:39.530
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.450
It's School of YouTube week and you can make
a difference to the millions of children worldwide

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.010
who won't be going back to school this year.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.709
Whether due to lack of teachers, school materials
or worse so click on the donate button - if

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.640
you can - to help spread ideas and knowledge
to everyone.
