00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:12.013
When historians talk about 
the atrocities of the 20th century,

00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:17.503
we often think of those that took place
during and between the two World Wars.

00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:20.543
Along with the Armenian genocide 
in modern-day Turkey,

00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:22.653
the Rape of Nanking in China,

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:24.753
and Kristallnacht in Germany,

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:27.522
another&nbsp;horrific ethnic cleansing campaign

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:32.765
occurred on an island between 
the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:35.754
The roots of this conflict 
go back to 1492,

00:00:35.754 --> 00:00:39.432
when Christopher Columbus stumbled 
onto the Caribbean island

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:46.043
that would come to be named Hispaniola,
launching a wave of European colonization.

00:00:46.043 --> 00:00:50.665
The island’s Taíno natives were decimated 
by violence and disease

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:54.543
and the Europeans imported large numbers
of enslaved Africans

00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:58.043
to toil in profitable sugar plantations.

00:00:58.043 --> 00:01:01.335
By 1777, the island had become divided

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:05.986
between a French-controlled West 
and a Spanish-controlled East.

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:11.395
A mass slave revolt won Haiti 
its independence from France in 1804

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:14.325
and it became the world’s 
first black republic.

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:16.515
But the new nation paid dearly,

00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:21.626
shut out of the world economy and 
saddled with debt by its former masters.

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:24.965
Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic 
would declare independence

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:28.756
by first overthrowing Haitian rule 
of eastern Hispaniola

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:32.116
and later Spanish 
and American colonialism.

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:36.186
Despite the long and collaborative history
shared by these two countries,

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:39.977
many Dominican elites saw Haiti 
as a racial threat

00:01:39.977 --> 00:01:46.148
that imperiled political and commercial
relations with white western nations.

00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:48.001
In the years following World War I,

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.357
the United States occupied 
both parts of the island.

00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:54.832
It did so to secure its power 
in the Western hemisphere

00:01:54.832 --> 00:01:59.308
by destroying local opposition 
and installing US-friendly governments.

00:01:59.308 --> 00:02:02.860
The brutal and racist nature 
of the US occupation,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.208
particularly along the remote
Dominican-Haitian border,

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:10.872
laid the foundation for bigger atrocities 
after its withdrawal.

00:02:10.872 --> 00:02:15.007
In 1930, liberal Dominican president 
Horacio Vásquez

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:19.279
was overthrown by the chief of his army, 
Rafael Trujillo.

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.009
Despite being a quarter Haitian himself,

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.991
Trujillo saw the presence of a bicultural 
Haitian and Dominican borderland

00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:28.019
as both a threat to his power

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.159
and an escape route 
for political revolutionaries.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.739
In a chilling speech on October 2, 1937,

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.389
he left no doubt about his intentions 
for the region.

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.493
Claiming to be protecting Dominican
farmers from theft and incursion,

00:02:43.493 --> 00:02:48.119
Trujillo announced the killing 
of 300 Haitians along the border

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:53.179
and promised that this so-called "remedy" 
would continue.

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.879
Over the next few weeks, 
the Dominican military,

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.949
acting on Trujillo’s orders,

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.540
murdered thousands of Haitian men 
and women,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.400
and even their Dominican-born children.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.270
The military targeted black Haitians,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.470
even though many Dominicans themselves 
were also dark-skinned.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.170
Some accounts say that to distinguish
the residents

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.161
of one country from the other,

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:21.341
the killers forced their victims 
to say the Spanish word for parsley.

00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:25.470
Dominicans pronounce it perejil, 
with a trilled Spanish "r."

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.732
The primary Haitian language, however,
is Kreyol, which doesn’t use a trilled r.

00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:33.349
So if people struggled to say perejil,

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.481
they were judged to be Haitian 
and immediately killed.

00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.620
Yet recent scholarship suggests 
that tests like this

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.422
weren’t the sole factor used to determine
who would be murdered,

00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:48.431
especially because many of the border 
residents were bilingual.

00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.051
The Dominican government censored
any news of the massacre,

00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:54.242
while bodies were thrown in ravines,

00:03:54.242 --> 00:03:55.523
dumped in rivers,

00:03:55.523 --> 00:03:58.302
or burned to dispose of the evidence.

00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:02.233
This is why no one knows exactly 
how many people were murdered,

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:07.548
though contemporary estimates 
range from about 4,000 to 15,000.

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:11.341
Yet the extent of the carnage 
was clear to many observers.

00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:14.933
As the US Ambassador to 
the Dominican Republic at the time noted,

00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:19.114
“The entire northwest of the frontier
on the Dajabón side

00:04:19.114 --> 00:04:22.144
is absolutely devoid of Haitians.

00:04:22.144 --> 00:04:28.454
Those not slain either fled across the
frontier or are still hiding in the bush.”

00:04:28.454 --> 00:04:30.833
The government tried 
to disclaim responsibility

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:33.884
and blame the killings 
on vigilante civilians,

00:04:33.884 --> 00:04:37.040
but Trujillo was condemned 
internationally.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.884
Eventually, the Dominican government

00:04:38.884 --> 00:04:44.514
was forced to pay only $525,000 
in reparations to Haiti,

00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:46.364
but due to corrupt bureaucracy,

00:04:46.364 --> 00:04:51.167
barely any of these funds reached 
survivors or their families.

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:53.884
Neither Trujillo nor anyone 
in his government

00:04:53.884 --> 00:04:58.114
was ever punished for this crime 
against humanity.

00:04:58.114 --> 00:05:01.115
The legacy of the massacre remains 
a source of tension

00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:02.764
between the two countries.

00:05:02.764 --> 00:05:07.464
Activists on both sides of the border 
have tried to heal the wounds of the past.

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:10.303
But the Dominican state has done little, 
if anything,

00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:14.015
to officially commemorate 
the massacre or its victims.

00:05:14.015 --> 00:05:18.906
Meanwhile, the memory of the Haitian
massacre remains a chilling reminder

00:05:18.906 --> 00:05:22.166
of how power-hungry leaders
can manipulate people

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:24.727
into turning against 
their lifelong neighbors.
