00:00:00.605 --> 00:00:03.137
What I want to do in this
video is try to understand

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:05.942
how one company can buy another company

00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:10.203
or could merge it with another
company by using its stock.

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:13.146
So we have a situation
here, where Company A

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:18.432
is acquiring Company B for
$60,000,000 in A's shares

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.285
and what we'll see is,

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.505
it's not going to exactly be $60,000,000.

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:25.756
It'll depend on where
Company A's shares trade.

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:28.861
Right now, they're trading at $30 a share.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.590
So in order to make this
transaction happen in A's shares,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.460
what would happen is, is that A says,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.424
"Look, I need to raise the
equivalent of $60,000,000"

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:40.673
"in shares." or "I need to
create the equivalent of"

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.593
"$60,000,000 in shares."

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:44.924
"If each of my shares
right now on the market"

00:00:44.924 --> 00:00:48.195
"are worth $30 a share,
then I can do that by"

00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:51.924
"creating or issuing 2,000,000 shares."

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:54.195
So Company A here is
going to create another

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:57.272
2,000,000 shares. They're
going to create another

00:00:57.272 --> 00:01:00.164
2,000,000 shares and if
they wanted to do it as a

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:03.299
cash transaction, they could
take these shares and sell them

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.375
into the market, do a secondary
offering and then hopefully

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:10.267
raise $60,000,000 in cash
and then use that cash to buy

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:12.679
Company B, but this is a share offering.

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.178
They're not going to do it with cash.

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:17.262
They're going to directly
give, assuming Company B

00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:21.465
shareholders agree to this,
they're going to give the shares

00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:24.934
directly to Company B's
shareholders in exchange for

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:28.679
essentially getting control of
these shares right over here.

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.868
So, they're going to take
these 2,000,000 shares which

00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:34.429
right now in the market
look to be worth $60,000,000

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.200
and they're going to give
them to all of Company B's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.333
shareholders in exchange
for all of Company B's

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.203
existing shares.

00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:45.678
So what's going to happen is
Company A is going to give

00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:49.534
2,000,000 shares of Company
A to the shareholders of

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:53.266
Company B and in exchange,
Company B will give all of the

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.717
shareholders of the ... of company ...

00:01:54.717 --> 00:01:57.348
We will give their shares to Company A.

00:01:57.348 --> 00:02:01.077
So they will give, so ... or
their shares of Company B,

00:02:01.077 --> 00:02:01.514
I should say.

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:03.599
Company B's shareholders are
going to give all of their

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.267
1,000,000 shares in Company
B in exchange for those

00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:09.346
2,000,000 of Company A.

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:12.202
So what's going to happen is
each of these shareholders

00:02:12.202 --> 00:02:16.933
of Company B are going to
get 2 shares of Company A

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:20.176
for every 1 share of Company B.

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:29.133
So they're going to get 2 shares
... 2 shares of A for every

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:35.267
share of B they own and that
makes sense economically

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:38.678
because right now on the market,
let's say that it's trading

00:02:38.678 --> 00:02:43.267
at $50 a share. It has a
$50,000,000 market cap.

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:46.344
By offering a $60,000,000
in share, they're offering

00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:48.866
a premium. This is what will
kind of convince all of the

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:51.012
shareholders to maybe say, "Hey,
this is a pretty good deal."

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:54.347
"I'm getting 20% above the
market price" and when you get

00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:57.846
2 shares in exchange for your
one $50 share, you're getting

00:02:57.846 --> 00:03:02.467
2 shares that are right
now trading at $30 a share.

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.868
So it seems like a good
deal for you. I can exchange

00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:09.067
something worth $50 for two
things worth 30 or essentially

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:13.011
exchange something worth
50 for something worth $60.

00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:16.261
I'm going to take it and if
they do take it, then what's

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:20.666
essentially going to happen is,
is that those 1,000,000 shares

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:23.153
are going to be put onto the asset side of

00:03:23.153 --> 00:03:25.856
Company A's ... of
Company A's balance sheet

00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:27.345
or maybe we could just put that

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:30.267
Company B is now here, because
all of the shares are here.

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:32.694
It's not completely owned
and the company was able to

00:03:32.694 --> 00:03:34.601
do that by issuing these
shares. The other option,

00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.867
they could have issued ... They
could have sold those shares

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:39.734
in the market, raised
$60,000,000, then given the

00:03:39.734 --> 00:03:42.985
$60,000,000 directly to the
Company B's shareholders

00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:46.400
and then it would have
had the exact same effect.
