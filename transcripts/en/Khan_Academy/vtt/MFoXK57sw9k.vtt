00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.620
What we have here is four different values

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.603
some of them expressed with negative numbers

00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:09.153
or absolute value, and what I want to do is sort

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:11.786
them from least to greatest, where the least is on

00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:14.053
the left and the greatest is on the right. So sort

00:00:14.053 --> 00:00:15.513
from least to greatest.

00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:18.183
And like always, I encourage you to pause the

00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:20.363
video and try to work through it on your own.

00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:23.303
So assuming you have, you had a try at it,

00:00:23.493 --> 00:00:26.013
so the easiest way I can think about it, well let's

00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:27.913
just, let's just plot them all on a number line.

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:29.993
And you might want to draw it out or eventually

00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:31.443
you kind of have a number line in your head,

00:00:31.443 --> 00:00:32.413
and you can think about it that way.

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:35.061
So let's first think about the absolute value of

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:39.072
value of -27. So what is the absolute value of -27?

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:42.785
Well it's just going to be +27. This right over here

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:47.545
is the same thing as +27, because -27 is 27 to the

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:50.526
left of 0. 27 to the left of 0.

00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:53.822
So let's plot the absolute value of -27.

00:00:53.822 --> 00:00:56.072
Well it's really 27, so it's going to be right

00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:59.032
over here. So that is the absolute value of

00:00:59.032 --> 00:01:06.812
-27. It is +27. Alright, then we have -17.

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:10.752
Well, -17, let's see each hash mark here is

00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:17.774
3, so this is -9 and -12, -15. So -17

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.529
is gonna be right around there.

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:21.786
So that is -17.

00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:24.993
And then we have -28.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.029
So we have -27 and each hash mark is 3, so -28

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:33.029
is going to be right over there. -28.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.928
And then finally we have -22.4.

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:42.119
So let's see, we have 18, 21, 22 would be here, so

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.089
22.4 is going to be roughly right over there.

00:01:45.112 --> 00:01:47.832
So that is 22.4.

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:50.609
So if we want to sort it from least to greatest,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.710
well, we just have to start at the left end

00:01:52.714 --> 00:01:54.024
of the number line.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.490
The smallest of them, or the least of them,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.070
is -28. Then we go to -17. -17.

00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:07.521
Then we go to 22.4. Then we go to 22.4.

00:02:08.582 --> 00:02:12.332
And then we go to the absolute value of -27,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.010
and we are done.
