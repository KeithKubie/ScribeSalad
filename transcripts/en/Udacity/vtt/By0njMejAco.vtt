00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.460
So, hopefully you're able to see the most likely

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.960
inheritance pattern is autosomal and dominant. Now, what's the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.030
reason for this? An autosomal inheritance pattern means that

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.060
the alleles affecting the trait are on the autosomes, not

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.100
the sex chromosomes. So, we should see both males

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.790
and females affected fairly equally. So, we know it's not

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.120
sex linked because we see that in our pedigree.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.680
We also know it's not maternal, because maternal means it's

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.330
inherited through the mitochondria. So the mother would pass it

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.340
on to all of her children, and that's not in

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.070
fact what we see here. Now what about dominant? Well,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.370
it can be recessive, it most likely isn't recessive because recessive

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.110
traits, affected children come from unaffected parents which is not

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.410
what we see here. And we also expect the trait to

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.650
skip generations which we don't see. When it's dominant we

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.190
expect to see the trait in every generation, and affected parents

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.070
give rise to affected children.
