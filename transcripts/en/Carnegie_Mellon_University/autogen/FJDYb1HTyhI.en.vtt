who disagree I will try to persuade them

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:13.870
who disagree I will try to persuade them
 

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.620
who disagree I will try to persuade them
I will debate and I will learn from them

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:16.630
I will debate and I will learn from them
 

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.040
I will debate and I will learn from them
but i will fight every moment of every

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:20.050
but i will fight every moment of every
 

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:23.220
but i will fight every moment of every
day for what I believe is right for this

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:23.230
day for what I believe is right for this
