00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.920
You now have a server sitting out there
on the Internet and this server is doing

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.660
a lot of different things and talking
to other devices on the Internet.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.100
Depending on your application it
could be responding to web requests,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.860
database queries, sending and
receiving email, and let's not forget

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.690
handling the SSH sessions we've
been using this whole time.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.950
But how does your server know which
application is in charge of handling

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.690
each type of request?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.430
The answer is ports.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.160
Each of your applications are configured
to respond to requests destined for

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.690
a specific port.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.310
For example, a web server would
by default respond on port 80,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.490
the default port for HTTP.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.460
We can control which ports our server
is allowed to accept requests for

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.030
using an application
called the firewall.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.420
We'll do that shortly, but for
now let's explore some common ports.
