00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:13.300
This box sends ultrasonic vibrations
into the air, so that you feel objects

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.380
as if they were hanging in thin air.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.340
Now what we're going to do
is try and guess some shapes here okay?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.920
Now this is actually going to create
a noise so we can't talk

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.780
whilst you're trying to guess
that shape okay?

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.480
Right so what we're going to do
is put the picture on the screen,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.210
so everybody else can see it,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.900
and then I want you to guess if the object
is either a cone or a square.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.060
Okay so they are your two choices.
Okay are we ready?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.840
Alright so, let's just...

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.600
[LOUD ELECTRONIC NOISE]

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.620
[ELECTRONIC NOISE]

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.920
Say that again?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.440
– A cone.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.900
– We think it's a cone.
So can we see?

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.180
Yeah and that's what everybody else
can see, it's a cone, excellent, well done!

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.280
So what we have are 256 tiny speakers,
and they're creating ultrasonic vibrations,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.000
so they're outside of the human range
of hearing, so we can't hear them.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.040
But Ethan can feel them.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.120
And in fact that feeling you know when you're near a very loud bass speaker?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.140
So you can feel it in your chest?

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.280
So - like that but much
much more precise
