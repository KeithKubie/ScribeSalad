00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.560
A MELISSA DENEE TV SHOW (916)745-2895....So on my way here I stopped by the hardware store and picked up some of these shelving brackets.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.740
You can find them shelving aisle and they're about a dollar maybe a little more than a dollar each

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.600
They come in all kinds of different sizes I got some small ones and I got some larger ones

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.900
These things are fairly durable. I think they're made of steel and they're relatively lightweight,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.320
So if you're backpacking or hiking you can take some of these along.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.180
They don't take up much space and they very easily transform

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.510
Into a stove let me show you how it works

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.739
You can see there's a short end and a longer end, so depending on how high you want your stove, you can use the longer

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.689
end for a little more height, or you can turn it and use the shorter end and get a wider stove that's a little bit

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:37.700
closer to the ground. Now I've just finished making a fire you can see it's burned down to the coals here

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.120
We don't really want flames looking up at us because if we, did we'd be burning our hands but

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.140
Now that it's at this point

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.980
We can take these brackets and push them down into the ground and leverage them in the right way that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.910
We can actually hold a fairly heavy pot

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.319
Now if you look down at the pattern here, it could be a little bit better but basically you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.620
Want the tip of each

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.669
Hanger to be overlapping the next one so when those are all lined up it's very stable you can put a lot of pressure on

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.629
That and it's not going to buckle. And look at that it gets you right nice close to the coals so you're gonna have a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.499
Lot of cooking heat, and if you want to make sure they're all the same height, you can put something like a pan on there

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.889
Just bang it a little bit. And now you've got a nice cooking top and you can vary the height above the poles or move

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.939
The coals in and out to determine what kind of temperature in heat you want in your pan

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.029
Now if you've got a fire that's still going or you've got a very big and heavy pot you might want to consider some of

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.470
These bigger shelving brackets that will give you a little bit more room to play with so you don't burn your hands as you put

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.220
Them into the fire and again these have a short side and a long side so you can

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.759
Choose what you

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.169
Want. All right, so to put this thing to the test I just filled this stainless steel container all the way to the top with

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.899
Water and if we just slam this thing down, Boom.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.030
Doesn't even flinch

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.439
And guys I didn't even do like a perfect triangle with this base so that just shows you what kind of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.479
Integrity it has and what kind of things you can do with it. This thing is amazingly strong, it's actually blowing my mind kind of

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.538
Makes me wonder if I could stand in it. Oh yeah look at that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.530
165 pounds not a problem and check this out guys after they've cooled down and you've knocked off all the dust they've got these grooves in

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.549
The back which means you can

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.828
Lock them together for very easy and convenient storage. So that Is how to hack yourself a stove

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.509
Using shelving brackets. I hope you enjoyed this project. Thanks so much for joining me for this

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.209
Experiment and I'll be looking for you in the next video, talk to you then
