00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.050
An investment firm
creates a graph

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.360
showing the performance of a
specific stock over 12 months.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.570
Over the course of
the year, is the price

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.540
of the stock rising,
falling, or staying the same?

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.480
So over this axis right over
here, the horizontal axis,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.680
they have month by month.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.210
And we move forward in time--
July, August, September,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.100
October.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.000
And in this axis, the vertical
axis, we have the price.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.410
So, for example, in July
the price of this stock

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.620
was a little over $10.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.820
Then in August, it moved up
to-- it looks like around $11.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.930
And then we could keep
going month by month.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.560
And this type of
graph right over here

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.380
is called a line
graph because you

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.350
have the data points
for each month.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200
And then we connected
them with a line.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.740
And the reason why we
connect them with a line

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.739
is to really see if there's
some kind of a trend

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.310
here to really show that
you have something that's

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.770
moving from one
price to another.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.810
And so line graphs
tend to be used

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.165
when you have something
that's changing over time.

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:00.040
Now, with that out of
the way, let's actually

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.410
answer their question.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.220
Over the course of
the year, is the price

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.410
of the stock rising,
falling, or staying the same?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.640
So on a month-to-month
basis, you have, for example,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.680
from July to August,
the price went up.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.410
Then from August to September,
the price went down.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.940
Then it went up for two months.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.910
Then it went down for a month.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.640
Then it went up for
a couple more months.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.260
Then it went really up
from February to March,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.460
went all the way
up to almost $17.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.950
Then it went down again.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.590
And then it kept going up again.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.660
But they're asking us not
did it go up every month.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.400
They're saying over
the course of the year

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.510
is the price of the
stock rising, falling,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.800
or staying the same?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.800
And if you go from July, which
is where our data starts right

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.620
over here, our price
was around $10.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.070
And even though there were a
few months where it went down,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.250
the overall trend is that
the price is going up.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.410
The overall trend is
that the price going up.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.550
And you can even see that.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.080
In July, it was $10.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.800
And then by June
of the next year,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.440
it was approaching--
I don't know,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.800
it looks like it's
about a little

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.440
over $16, maybe almost $17.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.880
So it actually
had gone up a lot.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.780
They don't give us
July of the next year.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.840
But the overall
trend is definitely

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.986
the upwards direction
right over here.

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.610
And you can see it just visually
by looking at this line graph.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.520
Even though there's a
few bumps that go down,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.538
the overall direction is upward.
