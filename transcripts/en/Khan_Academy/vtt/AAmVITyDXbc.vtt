00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.211
- [Voiceover] Karl filled
up the tank of his truck

00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:05.241
with 400 liters of fuel
and set out to deliver

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:07.664
a shipment of bananas to Alaska.

00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:11.045
The truck consumed 0.8 liters of fuel

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.227
or eight-tenths of a liter of fuel

00:00:13.227 --> 00:00:15.839
for each kilometer driven.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.846
Graph the amount of fuel
remaining in the truck's tank

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:21.778
in liters as a function of distance

00:00:21.778 --> 00:00:23.928
driven in kilometers.

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:27.076
And right over here we
have, we have a graph

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:28.922
where we have a coordinate plane

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:32.486
where our horizontal coordinate
is distance in kilometers,

00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:37.042
and our vertical, our vertical
axis is fuel in liters.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:41.088
So we can define the line by
moving these two points around,

00:00:41.088 --> 00:00:43.309
because two points define a line.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.497
And so, let's just think about two points

00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:46.525
that we could figure out.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:49.497
Can we figure out the fuel
at two different distances,

00:00:49.497 --> 00:00:52.162
and then that will help
us define the line.

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:54.547
Well, the first thing that
we might want to think about

00:00:54.547 --> 00:00:57.107
is, well, what about before
we've traveled at all?

00:00:57.107 --> 00:00:59.411
That might be the easy
thing to figure out.

00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:01.657
What was the amount of fuel in the tank

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:03.029
when we haven't traveled at all?

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:06.083
And they tell us that in this passage.

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:09.332
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about that.

00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:12.251
Well, they tell us Karl filled
up the tank of his truck

00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:15.684
with 400 liters of fuel
and then set out to deliver

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:17.102
a shipment of bananas.

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:18.914
So before he had driven at all,

00:01:18.914 --> 00:01:20.814
right after he'd filled his tank,

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.291
he had 400 liters of fuel.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.089
So we could say when
distance was zero kilometers,

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:28.434
he had 400 liters of fuel.

00:01:28.434 --> 00:01:30.292
So we have one point on that line.

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:32.572
Now we gotta think about
where we might want to put,

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.791
where we want to put this other point.

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.434
And the way I think about it is,

00:01:36.434 --> 00:01:38.822
well, let's just, we know he's consuming,

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:42.283
he's consuming eight-tenths
of a liter of fuel

00:01:42.283 --> 00:01:44.409
for each kilometer driven.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.045
But they don't have, you
know, we're not going by

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:47.508
one kilometer, two kilometers.

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:48.505
They're going by, this is like

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:50.623
50 kilometers, 100 kilometers.

00:01:50.623 --> 00:01:52.210
So let's think about how much fuel

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.308
he would have consumed after
driving 100 kilometers,

00:01:56.308 --> 00:01:58.745
and if he consumed that
much, we would subtract that

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:00.510
from the amount of fuel he started with,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.891
and then that would tell us,

00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:03.371
that would tell us where
this point would be.

00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:05.281
It's going to be some place over here,

00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:07.800
and it's going to be, it's
going to be below 400,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.332
'cause we're consuming fuel.

00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:12.711
Fuel should be going down
as distance increases.

00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:16.123
This should be a downward-sloping line.

00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:18.411
So I have my, I have my scratchpad here.

00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:20.636
Let me, let me get it out.

00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:21.975
And I have the same question there.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.025
It just gives us all the same information.

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:27.664
But what I want to figure
out is, so we already know,

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:29.509
we already know that.

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:33.305
So we have distance, distance.

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:35.840
Let me, I'll just write.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.345
Actually, let me just
write the whole thing.

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.562
Give myself a little bit more space.

00:02:39.562 --> 00:02:43.510
Distance in kilometers.
Distance in kilometers.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.802
And then you have fuel,

00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:49.092
you have fuel in liters.

00:02:49.092 --> 00:02:51.197
You have fuel in liters.

00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:52.381
And we already figured out that

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.738
before he got on, right
after he filled up his tank

00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:57.652
but before he set out on his trip,

00:02:57.652 --> 00:03:01.947
at distance zero kilometers
he had 400 liters of fuel.

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:04.536
And we've already actually plotted that.

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:07.055
But then we said, well what
happens at a hundred kilometers?

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:10.290
At a hundred kilometers,
how much fuel will he have?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.019
Well, they tell us that he
consumes 0.8 liters of fuel

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.517
for each kilometer.

00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:20.988
So, 0.8 liters

00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:23.634
per kilometer, and then
we just multiply that

00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:25.634
times the number of kilometers.

00:03:25.634 --> 00:03:29.148
So, times 100 kilometers.

00:03:29.148 --> 00:03:32.086
The units work out, kilometers
divided by kilometers.

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.792
We're just going to be left with liters,

00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:35.452
and then we multiply the numbers.

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:37.310
Eight-tenths of a hundred,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.492
well that's going to be equal to 80,

00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:43.636
and the units are liters, 80 liters.

00:03:43.636 --> 00:03:45.356
So at a distance of a hundred kilometers,

00:03:45.356 --> 00:03:47.359
he's going to have consumed, right,

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.488
let me be careful here.

00:03:48.488 --> 00:03:51.263
He's going to have consumed 80 liters.

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:53.748
He's going to have consumed 80 liters.

00:03:53.748 --> 00:03:57.404
So the fuel, the fuel
is actually going to be

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:00.830
what he started with, what he started with

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.111
minus how much he consumed.

00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:06.784
So it's going to be minus 0.8,

00:04:06.784 --> 00:04:07.915
and if we want to write the units there.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.210
I might as well, so,
you know, this is liters

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.668
right over here.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.688
This is 400 liters.

00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:16.885
And I can write this
kilometers, kilometers.

00:04:16.885 --> 00:04:18.462
It's going to be 400 liters

00:04:18.462 --> 00:04:22.522
minus 0.8 liters

00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:27.835
per kilometer times, times,

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:28.798
let me make that clear,

00:04:28.798 --> 00:04:33.360
times 100, times 100 kilometers.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.901
And same thing, kilometers
divided by kilometers,

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:41.750
and we are left with 400 liters
minus 0.8 liters times 100.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.132
Well, that's just going
to be equal to 400 liters,

00:04:45.132 --> 00:04:46.908
which is how much he started with,

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:49.718
minus eight-tenths of a hundred is 80,

00:04:49.718 --> 00:04:52.502
and the units left is 80 liters.

00:04:52.502 --> 00:04:54.139
So 400 liters minus 80 liters,

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.857
that's going to be 320 liters.

00:04:56.857 --> 00:04:59.527
So when he has traveled
a hundred kilometers,

00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:03.033
he will have 320 liters left in his tank.

00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:04.368
So let's plot that.

00:05:04.368 --> 00:05:05.948
So when he has traveled
a hundred kilometers,

00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:08.095
actually, I just randomly
had put the point there,

00:05:08.095 --> 00:05:11.670
he is going to have 320
liters left in his tank.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.130
And just like that, we have
plotted the line that showed

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.976
how much fuel he has in his tank

00:05:16.976 --> 00:05:21.596
as a function of, as a
function of distance traveled.

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:22.943
And you can even see from this

00:05:22.943 --> 00:05:24.578
that he's going to run out of fuel

00:05:24.578 --> 00:05:27.070
at the 500-kilometer mark.
