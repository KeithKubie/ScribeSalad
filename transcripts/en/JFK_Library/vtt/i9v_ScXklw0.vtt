00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:03.597
- I hope that current members of Congress

00:00:03.597 --> 00:00:07.263
recall that it actually
doesn't take a lot of courage

00:00:07.263 --> 00:00:10.430
to aid those who are already powerful,

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:14.833
already comfortable, already influential.

00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:19.202
But it does require
some courage to champion

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:22.785
the vulnerable and the
sick and the infirm.

00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:30.540
Those who often have no access
to the corridors of power.

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:34.932
I hope they understand that courage means

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:38.930
not simply doing what is
politically expedient,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.055
but doing what they believe,

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:43.638
deep in their hearts, is right.

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:51.463
And this kind of courage
is required from all of us.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:57.597
Those of us who consider
ourselves progressives.

00:00:57.597 --> 00:00:58.899
Those of us who are Democrats.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.401
We've got some soul searching to do

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.566
to see what kind of courage we show.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.483
We have our own dogmas.

00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:16.348
Those of us not in elected
office have to show some courage.

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:21.132
We're prone to bestow
the mantle of courage

00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:24.635
too easily on the
prominent and the powerful.

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:27.448
And then too eager to
wrap ourselves in cynicism

00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:31.615
when they let us down
because they weren't perfect.

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:37.362
We lose sight, sometimes,
of our own obligations.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:39.882
Each of ours.

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:41.595
All the quiet acts of courage that

00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:44.535
unfold around us every single day.

00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:47.839
Ordinary Americans who give
something of themselves

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:49.059
not for personal gain,

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:52.392
but for the enduring benefit of another.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.545
The courage of a single
mom who's working two jobs

00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:58.795
to make sure her kid can go to college.

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:03.610
The courage of a small
business owner who's

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.852
keeping folks on the payroll

00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:08.376
because he knows a family relies on it.

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:12.121
Even if it's not always
the right thing to do

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:13.788
for his bottom line.

00:02:15.997 --> 00:02:17.582
The courage of somebody who volunteers

00:02:17.582 --> 00:02:20.249
to help some kids who need help.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.312
When we recognize these acts of courage,

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:28.777
we then necessarily recognize

00:02:28.777 --> 00:02:31.426
our own responsibility as citizens

00:02:31.426 --> 00:02:32.848
and as part of the human family

00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:34.637
to get involved and to get engaged

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:36.304
and to take a stand.

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:38.367
To vote.

00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:40.562
To pay attention.
