00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:14.530
JASON SILVA: There's a great
line by the philosopher Alain

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.660
de Botton where
he says, we don't

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.340
cry because something is sad.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.185
We cry because something
is more beautiful

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.020
than we expected it to be.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.290
So essentially, we
are moved to tears

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.030
in order to address, to
correct an imbalance,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.580
a cognitive dissonance
between what we expected

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.960
and what we actually
found, to realize

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.399
that what you found was
more conducive to your needs

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.190
than what you thought
you were looking for,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.780
the sort of the
serendipity of melancholy,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.220
of aesthetic experience,
when it feels like something

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.840
is unexpectedly so much
more moving than you thought

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.790
it would be.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.230
This is such a mystery.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.324
These moments in
which we are moved

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:01.860
to the point of
tears, that define

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.310
our lives, these moments
of aestheticized,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.750
italicized experience,
these moments

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.230
pregnant with
significance, these moments

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.492
of revelatory ecstasy,
ecstatic signification.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.714
It's such a cool idea.

00:01:17.714 --> 00:01:20.210
I love it when music does it
to me, when theater does it

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.570
to me, when films
do it to me, when

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.560
staring into the iris of a
lover's eye does it to me.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.730
You get the goosebumps.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.960
You get the shivers
down your spine.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.841
These moments.

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:31.340
Mmm.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.560
You don't cry because
something is sad.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.660
You cry because it
is more beautiful

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.710
than you expected it to be.
