FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi everyone.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.330
Thanks so much for
coming today.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.380
I'm very pleased to welcome
Time Wise to Google today.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.240
Tim is an American anti-racism
activist and writer.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.910
He's the author of six books,
including the highly acclaimed

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.850
memoir "White Like Me,
Reflections on Race from a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.530
Privileged Son." His next book
"The Culture of Cruelty, How

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.670
America's Elite Demonize the
Poor, Valorize the Rich and

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.480
Jeopardize the Future," will
be released in winter 2014.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.650
Please join me in welcoming
him to talk to us today.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.740
TIM WISE: Thank you very
much for coming.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.690
I'm particularly grateful
that you're here.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.960
Because even though I've done
this for a very long time, and

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.540
now about 24 years of doing
anti-racism work of some sort

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.260
or civil rights work of some
sort and about 18 of those on

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.610
the road speaking to folks
around the country.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.520
You never really know when
somebody asks you to come in

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.300
and talk-- whether it's at a
company or whether it's at a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.680
college or a high school or
occasionally a middle school

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.840
or community group, wherever
it is I go--

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.880
who's going to show up.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.310
How many people are
going to show up.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.080
How much interest there is
in the conversation.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.940
One of the reasons in particular
you don't know that

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.720
nowadays, maybe even more so
than when I began this work so

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.880
long ago, is that in just about
every sense, all the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.390
other voices in the culture-- at
least the majority of them,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.280
if not all--

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.850
seem to be telling you in a
lot of different ways that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.930
this kind of conversation
really isn't necessary.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.170
That we really don't have
to have this talk.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.550
That we don't have to address
issues of race or racial

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.600
equity in the workplace or in
the school system or the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530
justice system or the housing
market or anywhere else.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.370
Because to hear those voices
tell it-- and again, you'll

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.140
hear this echoed through
the media.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.830
You'll hear this echoed
through the words of

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.170
politicians and talking heads
all around the country.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.700
We're living in this--
presumably, in their mind--

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.280
sort of post-racial era where
these conversations, though

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.720
they were very, very important
a while back, they're now,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.740
like, so 1965 or something.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.190
Or maybe even 1995, if
we're being generous.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.610
Or maybe even 2007, if we're
being really generous, right?

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.290
But now that we're in this
post-racial era symbolized, of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.200
course, first and foremost by
the election not once but

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.847
twice of a man of color as
president, you don't have to

00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:18.700
have this conversation.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.890
I don't need to give it.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.770
You don't need to hear it.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.355
In fact, I remember immediately
after President

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:26.043
Obama was elected the first
time, I opened my email the

00:02:26.043 --> 00:02:28.740
next day and knew there would
be all kinds of wonderful,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.910
lovely things that people
would have to say to me.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.040
And one of them was especially
pertinent to this

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.680
conversation.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.510
It was all capital letters.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.700
So you know you're dealing
with crazy when it's all

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.750
capital letters and they're
e-screaming at you, as if I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.820
wouldn't have known they were
pissed if they had taken the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.050
caps lock off.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.130
And the email was something to
the effect of saying, well

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.810
now, you're going to have to
find a new hustle, right?

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.340
Because that's clearly what
fighting racism is, is just a

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.010
big hustle to make a lot of
money and get very famous.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.510
Because that is exactly what
you would do if you were

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.740
sitting in a dorm room at the
age of 19 thinking to

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.860
yourself, what the hell would I
do if I wanted to get really

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.860
rich and really famous?

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.530
Oh, I would fight
white supremacy.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.030
Because that always
works out well.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.090
So anyway, it said, you should
get a new hustle.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.770
Because now that Barack Obama
has been elected, clearly we

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.040
don't have to have this
conversation anymore.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.010
Racism is dead.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.320
And you're going to have to find
some other line of work.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.710
Now, if that were only one
voice and an angry email

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.700
saying that and the day after
an election, then maybe I

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.560
wouldn't have taken it very
seriously, just like I don't

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.750
take most of the emails that I
receive all that seriously.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.970
But unfortunately, that mantra
was repeated, usually in a lot

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.980
more erudite way than that.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.870
Without the capital letters.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.690
Without the electronic
or real screaming.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.380
But by people oftentimes very
well intended and quite

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.410
sincere in their belief that
we're living in this sort of

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.790
post-racial era where this
conversation is not important.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.700
Of course, if we just think
about it for maybe two

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.540
seconds, we can recognize, I
hope, almost immediately why

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.590
the notion of post-raciality
is absurd.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.740
At least if the only evidence
you have for it is the

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.520
election of a black
man as President

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.220
of the United States.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.050
If you have other evidence,
feel free to present it.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.090
But if that's the sum total of
your evidence-- if that's

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.660
exhibit one and two and three
through seven, then you're

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.020
probably not a very
firm ground.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.470
Anymore so than we would have
been on firm ground if someone

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.490
were to have said, let's say, in
Pakistan in 1989, the year

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.300
after Benazir Bhutto, a woman,
was first elected president of

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.800
that country, that
sexism was no

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.620
longer an issue in Pakistan.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.220
Patriarchy has been smashed.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.750
And this we know, because
a woman is the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.350
head of state in Pakistan.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.290
Or when Margaret Thatcher was
elected in Great Britain.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.670
Or when Indira Gandhi was
elected in India.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.790
Or Golda Meir in Israel.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.340
Or Corazon Aquino in
the Philippines.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.180
So in all of these countries--
you can probably think of

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.930
others-- there have been
female heads of state.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.910
We still haven't had one.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.100
So if I were to suggest, for
instance, to my two daughters,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.940
who are 12 and 10, that what
they probably really ought to

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.560
do if they want equal
opportunity as women is pack

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.170
up their bags and move to
Karachi, my guess is that even

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.970
the 10-year-old, who has no idea
where the hell Karachi

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.340
is, would know that the odds
were that wasn't a good bet.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.670
Just because a woman had been
the head of state in Pakistan

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.625
did not mean that other women
were going to, therefore, have

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.350
equal opportunity.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.530
So we wouldn't make the argument
about sexism in those

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.030
countries just because they've
had female heads of state.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.690
And I would hope that we would
be able to see through the

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.070
argument about race as it
relates to this country.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.810
But it's very easy to get sucked
into that rhetoric of

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.890
post-raciality.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.180
And I think maybe it's more than
ever possible in a place

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.900
like Silicon Valley, where more
so than just about any

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.010
other sort of industrial
area of America, both

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.570
geographically and historically,
there is this

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.290
very widely accepted mythology
that this, more so than any

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.330
other part of the American
economy and any other part of

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.680
the geography of the country,
is this pure meritocracy.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.010
All those other industries,
no.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.080
They're not really
meritocratic.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.850
We know that there are
networks and there's

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.980
clubbiness and there's cultures
that get sort of

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.710
reestablished and resurrected
and passed on, but not here.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.930
There's no such thing as
clubbiness or insider

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.800
advantages or networks, or even
a criteria that might

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.250
itself not be all that

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.700
meritocratic in Silicon Valley.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.960
Well, the smirks on some your
faces at least suggest to me

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.870
that you've thought through this
a minute and realize that

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.360
some of that rhetoric
is quite well sold

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.830
but quite a bit overblown.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.570
Because ultimately, at the end
of the day, we do have to ask

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.570
ourselves one very
simple question.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.870
When people tell us that this
industry or that industry or

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.320
that this country or the
overall economy or this

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.710
particular company is
meritocratic, it then begs the

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.480
question, right?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.900
That if in fact this company
and the larger part of the

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.310
economy that it represents and
of which it is a part is truly

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.810
meritocratic, then you would
have to really ask yourself

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.690
some hard questions about what
that means in terms of who

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.490
possesses merit in this country
and who doesn't.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.550
Because if you have an entire
area, both of the economy and

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.510
a geographic region, this being
the Silicon Valley where

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.850
only about 6% of all the
employees in the various firms

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.690
and companies here are black and
Latino, and you believe at

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.590
the same time that this is a
pure meritocracy as a part of

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.870
the economy, then you would have
to actually come to some

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.990
very racist conclusions almost
by definition, right?

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.040
You would have to conclude
that only 6% of the best

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.200
people are represented by
African American and Latino

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.340
folk who collectively, in
the country, represent

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.090
approximately 30% of the
population and in this state,

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.280
quite a bit more than that.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.240
You would have to assume
that there was this

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.570
real dearth of ability.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.280
This real dearth of merit.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.790
This real dearth of interest in
having jobs in the growing

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.710
part of the economy.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.950
As if somehow black and brown
folks would prefer to stay in

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.800
embedded in parts of the economy
that are rapidly dying

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.390
and leave all the really great
jobs disproportionately to

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.540
those who were white and of
course, on a gender level and

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.600
sex level, those
who were male.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.180
You would also have to assume
some very sexist things.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.880
If you really buy into the
notion of Silicon Valley as a

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.320
pure meritocracy, you would have
to assume that men are

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.380
just that much damn smarter.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.380
And just that much better at
doing certain types of jobs.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.170
Now, there may or may not
be evidence for that.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.180
And you may believe there is.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.220
But certainly not to the
extent we see the

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.450
disproportionalities in not
only this sector of the

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.790
economy, but in old sectors
of the economy like

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.060
manufacturing, where the same
kind of thing was true.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.260
Is it really true that women
were only 1%, 1 and 1/2%, 2%

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.000
of the people qualified for jobs
in the old quote unquote

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.100
economy in certain companies,
firms, or industries.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.140
Well, probably not.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.970
But if you're going to accept
that premise, understand where

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.870
it leads you as we try to have
these conversations.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.850
If you're going to assume that
Silicon Valley or that Google

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.630
itself as an entity is a pure
meritocracy, you would have to

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.860
assume not only some very racist
and sexist things about

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.480
certain folks, which would then,
it seems to me, have an

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.940
impact on how you perceive even
your co-workers who are

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.920
women or who are people
of color, right?

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.360
Because if I actually look at
people and think they're part

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.290
of a culture or group of people
that are in general not

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.090
as good, that are in general
not as qualified, how do I

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.830
really relate to the one or two
that I actually work with?

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.970
Or the five or six that I
see on a regular basis?

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.340
How do I subdivide my
brain into the part

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.250
that says, oh, no.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.210
This person's just as good
as anybody else.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.600
But the group they're from
is really screwed up.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.360
Is that actually something
the human brain

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.320
is capable of doing?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.760
Saying on the one hand that
I believe this group to be

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.110
superior to this group, this
group to be harder working,

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.620
this group to be more
innovative, this group to be

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.670
better for this particular kind
of job, but there are a

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.080
handful of y'all that are OK and
I'll be able to keep that

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.380
in mind as I work with
you on a daily basis.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.550
And the psychological research
says that's not likely.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.510
So in fact, if we buy into the
stereotypes, we're likely to

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.440
perpetuate the very culture
that maintains those

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.420
inequalities, even if we don't
necessarily intend to do it.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.440
So how would we know if
we were a meritocracy?

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.930
How would we know if racism were
operating in a company or

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.610
in an industry?

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.390
How would we know
if sexism were?

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.480
Well, those seem like obvious
questions, but they don't

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.710
really have obvious answers.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.710
Because when you ask them, how
would you know if racism was

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.720
operating, you ask a hundred
people that, you're going to

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.970
have a lot of different
answers.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.730
One thing we know from history
is that if you're really

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.100
wanting to figure out if racism
is operating, the first

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.720
thing you don't want to do-- as
a general rule, with some

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.190
exceptions-- is ask
white people.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.290
Just being perfectly honest.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.470
Just like if you want to know
if sexism is operating, you

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.850
wouldn't start by asking men.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:11.750
Just wouldn't make sense.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.130
If you wanted to know if an
industry or a company were

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.690
discriminatory toward those
with disabilities, right?

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.220
On the basis of ablism, you
wouldn't ask the able-bodied.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.850
Because when you're a member of
a dominant group, whatever

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.310
that is-- whether it's race,
gender, sex, class, sexuality,

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.280
religion, educational
background, or

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.900
whatever it might be--

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.990
those individuals who are
members of dominant groups--

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.440
and we're all, in just about
every case, members of at

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.250
least one or two.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.350
Everyone I see in this room
has probably got a mix of

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.830
identities.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.790
Some of which make you a
dominant group in certain

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.400
categories.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.640
Others of which make you a
subordinate or potentially

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.680
targeted group for
mistreatment and

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.830
discrimination on the other.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.230
When you're dominant, why would
you be expected to know

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.580
what other people who
are not experience?

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.290
It would be sort of irrational,
wouldn't it, for

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.530
me as a man to actually have a
keen insight into what women

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.850
experience in terms of sexism.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.130
Now, I might know.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.140
I might know.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.440
And if I do, it's probably
because I listened to a woman

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.740
describe her reality and decided
to assume she was

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.100
actually sane and not
overwrought, not

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.600
overemotional, not hormonal.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.660
Because apparently a lot of
guys think only women have

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.180
hormones, which is
fascinating.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.730
Testosterone does
nothing to us.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.800
Estrogen is a killer.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.400
It'll totally jack you up.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.290
Men would not be the ones
for whom you would seek

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.590
information and insight
about sexism.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.610
Not because they can't know, but
the odds are, that's not

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.480
going to be your best bet.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.070
Same thing with race and
asking white folks.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.970
Or going to white folks are
asking them, do you think

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.300
there's racism in
Silicon Valley?

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.700
Well it seems to me it would
make more sense to start by

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.105
asking people of color about
their own experiences.

00:11:39.105 --> 00:11:41.160
And they're not all going to
have the same opinion on that,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.570
by the way.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.630
They're not all going to have
the very same experiences.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.860
But in general, it's probably
a safe bet to say that if we

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.340
want to know if a problem
exists, the people to whom you

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.810
would first turn are the people
who were most likely to

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.660
have to know the answer to that
question as a matter of

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.560
daily survival.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.840
If I want to know if racial
profiling happens in New York,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.050
I don't ask people
on Wall Street.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.040
Because even though they might
need to be racially profiled

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.240
based on their own past
criminal endeavors and

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.760
activities that have helped to
tank the economy in the last

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.860
six years, we know they're
not going to be.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.040
And if they spend their entire
time in Battery Park and they

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.960
spend their entire time on Wall
Street going to really

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.940
nice restaurants where the NYPD
never bothers them, and

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.860
you ask them if that's
happening, they're probably

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.610
not going to see it.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.940
And here's the thing.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.590
They're not going to see it even
if they're good people.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.110
And in fact, I'll go so far as
to say, they're not going to

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.050
see it precisely because they're
such good people in

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.590
many cases.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.980
And I mean that seriously.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.540
Like most people, I
think, are good.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.600
Most folks don't want
to oppress others.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.740
Most men don't actually wake up
in the morning seeking to

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.710
marginalize women.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.990
But we manage to do it even
though we didn't wake

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.040
up with that goal.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.060
White folks don't wake up with
the goal of reinscribing white

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.910
supremacy every single day and
subordinating people of color.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.380
But the evidence as we manage
to pull that off even if it

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.190
wasn't our intention.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:56.820
Why?

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.100
Because when you're a good
person, when you have all the

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.530
right sort of ideas and
ideologies and ways of

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.710
thinking and you think you're
very open minded, it's

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.740
oftentimes that precise person
who's the most dangerous.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.840
Because it's that person who
doesn't want to look at the

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.840
ugly, right?

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.640
And by that I mean, who doesn't
want to look at the

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.810
injustice that might be in their
community, whether it's

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.200
at a company or whether it's at
the school or whether it's

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.590
in a neighborhood or whether
it's some private club to

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.260
which you belong.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.170
Because if you're a good,
caring, compassionate person,

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.890
you look at the ugly and
then you realize

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:25.450
you're on the hook.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.260
You actually have to do
something about that.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.300
Because you're a good person,
now you feel like crap.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.250
If you were a sociopath, this
wouldn't be a problem, right?

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.310
And the good news is-- and there
is some-- we're mostly

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.240
not sociopaths.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.340
So make sure to write
that down.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:36.780
Tweet that.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.470
Whatever you need to do.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:41.030
It's like, we're not mostly
sociopathic, but because we're

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.610
not sociopathic, we look at the
pain of racism or sexism

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.960
or classism or homophobia and
heterosexism, and for people

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.870
who really are compassionate, we
turn away from it almost as

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.220
quickly as we turn towards it.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.200
Because to be reminded of it,
and to be reminded that we're

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.330
sort of in the midst of that,
is to put us on the hook.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.900
And we really don't like
to be on the hook.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.650
Because there's only 24 hours
in a day, seven days a week,

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.050
365 in most years.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.110
And so as a result, we just
don't have extra time to deal

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.140
with all the problems
that we have.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.830
And so we turn away from it.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.240
So I think the first lesson
when we have these

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.480
conversations is as glad as I
am to be here and as honored

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.480
as I am to be here-- and I'm
very happy to be able to speak

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.190
to you and to other folks
around the country.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.700
If we're really going to get to
a place where we know we've

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.960
created racial equity in a
company or in a community, or

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.430
gender equity in a company or
community or sexual equity in

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.740
a company or community, it's
really important that we get

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.480
to a place where we can hear all
the stuff that I'm saying

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.400
and I'm going to continue to
say for a few more minutes

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.540
from the people who
are the targets.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.530
It's fine for me as a straight
white male to stand up and

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.460
talk about this stuff.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.682
And upper middle class with
a college degree, and

00:14:45.682 --> 00:14:45.845
able-bodied.

00:14:45.845 --> 00:14:47.960
And here I embody all of these
privileged groups.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.120
But until we're able to also
hear women say it without

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.190
getting defensive as men and
getting pissed, right?

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.550
Until we're prepared to hear
people of color say it

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.290
without, as white folks,
getting pissed.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.160
Until we're prepared to hear
LGBT folks say it without

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.110
those of us who are straight
or cisgendered or gender

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.090
normative getting angry and
upset and pissed off.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.150
Then until that happens,
we're really not

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.550
in a place of equity.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.410
Part of the problem, I think,
when we have the conversation

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.230
is that we usually are coming
from very different places in

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.270
terms of how we're defining
the concepts that we're

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.110
discussing.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.000
So if you hear that there's
going to be a conversation,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.840
it's about racism, you
automatically have certain

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.730
assumptions about what we're
going to discuss

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.650
and what that means.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.560
And naturally, as good people,
we don't want to think that

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.890
we're implicated in racism.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.430
My god, if there's racism in
my company, then that means

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.040
that's on me.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.910
But we're thinking of racism in
a very sort of traditional

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.640
way when we use that term.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.000
And that's what gets
us in trouble.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.580
That's what, if we had heart
monitors on people, when you

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.820
say, we're going to have
a talk about racism.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.630
If you had heart monitors,
you'd see the

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.500
blood pressure spike.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.420
That's what the research--

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.750
people get very nervous when
they think we're going to talk

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.200
about this.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.110
And the reason is, they think
they're going to be called a

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.550
racist, right?

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.860
And that if they are somehow
called a racist, that we mean

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.620
they're got there Klan robes in
the closet and they brought

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.960
them in on the bus or the bike
or however the hell they got

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.730
to work today and they're going
to the neo-Nazi rally

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.010
and they are actually skinheads
in disguise.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.860
And people make those
assumptions.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.550
And so as a result, they
get very defensive.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.580
Nobody wants to be thought
of as that.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.550
If we had a different
understanding, though.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.640
If we had an understanding
that racism is

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.950
not principally that.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.700
That when we're talking about
racism in the modern era, it's

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.250
not that that stuff
isn't still there.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.860
It is, right?

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.080
And those of us who do this work
long enough, we get death

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.180
threats from folks like that.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.390
They still are around.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.240
They don't actually
ever go anywhere.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.080
You call them neo-Nazis, but
really there's nothing neo or

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.140
new about what they do.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.440
It's sort of paleolithic
or Jurassic Nazis.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.760
They're decidedly old school.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.150
But there's still around.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.340
But that's not really
the issue.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.300
And it's certainly not the issue
I assume that I need to

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.360
address in a corporate
setting.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.960
If it is, I'm screwed.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.980
I need to get the hell
out of here.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.250
And we're all wasting
our time.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.050
If we're actually in a place
where there's such overt

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.230
hostility and bigotry of the
nature of hate group activity,

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.620
then nothing that I can say in
45 minutes, or that anyone

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.350
could say, is going to
solve that problem.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.960
But if we understood that racism
is much more nuanced

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.310
than that, particularly in the
modern era-- it might have

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.930
always been more nuanced, but it
certainly is now-- then we

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.520
can have a much better talk
without the same levels of

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.180
defensiveness.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.619
So when I use the term racism
and I talk about racism as a

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:21.810
problem, I am not presuming in
this or any other company to

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.849
which I speak, or at any school
where I speak, or

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:27.130
community, that we are mostly
talking about malicious

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.370
individuals who are
deliberately

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.290
seeking to harm others.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.790
Though I know they're
there, that's not

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.610
what I'm talking about.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.610
And that's not what
I'm focused on.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.420
Likewise, you don't necessarily
have to assume a

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.750
direct intentional
victim or target.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:44.310
So neither the perpetrator of
racism nor the victim of

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.900
racism has to necessarily do
anything consciously to make

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.000
the injury take place or to
get in the way the injury.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.370
In fact, sometimes we talk about
racism, we're not really

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.960
talking about it in the overt
one-on-one I don't like you

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.470
therefore I mistreat
you kind of way.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.490
We're talking about in a much
more systemic sense.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:05.180
And just like any ism that you
can think of, just about, is

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.720
both an ideology and a system,
the same is true with racism.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.410
Think about that.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:10.080
Capitalism.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.650
Socialism.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.210
Communism.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.780
Fascism.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.670
Authoritarianism.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:13.170
What are these?

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.520
They're ideologies.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.480
They're also ways of organizing
a society.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.350
They're also systems, right?

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.980
And you can sometimes be in that
system even if you don't

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.880
accept the ideology.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.000
You can be in that system and
by virtue of your actions,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.640
perpetuate that system, even if
you don't buy the ideology.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.780
Materialism is a good
example of this.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.140
Materialism we understand.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.710
If I go to the store and I
engage in some impulse

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.610
purchase, right?

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:35.470
We understand what--

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.690
I mean, maybe in the
moment, I don't

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.520
understand what I'm doing.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.580
But later on, I think
about it.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.810
I'm like, why did I
buy the candy bar?

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.230
I didn't want chocolate.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.850
And I didn't go for the
"People" magazine.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.850
What the hell is
wrong with me?

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.390
But I picked up the "People"
magazine and I picked up the

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.720
candy bar because why?

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.530
Well, because the marketers
put it there.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.310
The people who actually stage
the stores put it there,

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.060
knowing that someone's going
to buy that and be part of

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.680
this larger system of
consumption and materialism.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.940
Of consumerism.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.930
They could have put
the chocolate on

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.130
the chocolate aisle.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:06.550
They could have.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.850
There's a candy aisle
in every grocery.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.280
But they didn't put all
the chocolate there.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.020
And it's not like they just had
some left at the end, and

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:12.870
then were like, I don't know.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.410
What the hell do we
do with this?

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.000
Oh I don't know.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Just put it up near the
place where they pay.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.090
Like that was some kind
of coincidence.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.510
It was very deliberate, knowing
that even though your

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.360
mentality--

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.690
you didn't wake up
and go, I am a

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.100
materialistic consumerist hack.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.950
I can't wait to go buy crap
I don't need today.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.260
Nobody does that.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.510
But you fall into it.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.580
And therefore, that's
why they continue to

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.400
keep the candy there.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.620
If everybody made a conscious
choice not to do that, they

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.840
might rethink.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.680
But they know that we can fall
into those cognitive traps

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.800
when they're trying
to sell us stuff.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.030
That's what companies spend
billions of dollars, including

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.730
this one, to market stuff.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.030
Google spends I don't
know how much.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.330
I know it's a lot, right?

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.270
To market stuff.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.000
And it works.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.700
If it didn't work, you'd
get new PR people.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.013
You'd change your whole
approach and

00:19:53.013 --> 00:19:53.880
you're whole strategy.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.980
People spend money to convince
people they need this.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.920
They need to think this.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.970
They need to act like this.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:59.710
Dress like this.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:00.430
Be like this.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.880
Own this piece of technology.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.770
Own this vehicle.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.020
Live in this neighborhood.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.300
Because it works.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.612
And if you can be convinced of
the kind of computer that you

00:20:08.612 --> 00:20:11.740
need to have, or if you can be
convinced of the kind of

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.950
smartphone that you need to
have, or if you can be

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.140
convinced of the kind of toilet
paper that you need to

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.760
use so as not to chafe,
because oh god, no.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.130
Downy, that'll never work.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.050
Or Angel Soft.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.820
No, I need Charmin.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.200
Charmin knows if they spend
enough dough that you'll maybe

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.690
fall into that.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.000
To the extent that they can sell
us products, commercial

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.280
products, with advertising.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.980
How much easier is it, you
think, to internalize over the

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.050
course of a lifetime all of the
commercials, if you will,

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.680
that we've been given about
race and racial others.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.540
All of the commercials that
we've been given and exposed

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.770
to about gendered
and sexual and

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.330
religious and class others.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.210
Because we've been seeing that
commercial since we were

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.850
children, so to speak.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:54.910
Over and over again.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.570
And people who are marketers
will tell you, and people that

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.880
are in marketing and advertising
will tell you, it

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.260
only takes about 12 commercials
for a particular

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.470
consumer product before all of
a sudden, you begin to see

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.700
brand loyalty and you begin
to see an uptick in sales.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.110
It's the law of 12.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.550
Some people call it
the law of 11.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.320
If they're really good,
they can do it in 11.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.220
But usually, it takes
a dozen commercials.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.480
And after a dozen, it's like,
damn, I need that product.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.960
And so ultimately, I guarantee
we've certainly been exposed

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.170
to racial stereotypes
more than 12 times.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.990
We've been exposed to gender
and class and sexual and

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.560
religious stereotypes
more than 12 times.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.410
Some of it, since we were
very, very young.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.680
And so the odds that somehow
that hasn't stuck to us or

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.330
that it stuck to all those
other people out

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.290
there, but not here.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.140
Not at this company.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.000
Not in this valley.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.310
Not in this industry.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.860
Incredibly unlikely.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.830
Not a very parsimonious
expectation.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.610
I would suggest that it's
probably the case that there's

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.910
not such rarefied air.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.220
I mean, I'm breathing it.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.650
It seems clean in here.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.350
You all filter your air very
well, from what I can tell.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.770
As opposed to the salt flats
as we were coming in, which

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.400
were not nearly as nice.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.040
But ultimately, the idea that
the rarefied air here is so

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.270
different that those things that
beset the mere mortals in

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.850
the outside world wouldn't
happen here,

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.610
pretty incredibly unlikely.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.970
So if we can let go of
our concern about

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.260
bigotry being the issue.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.690
If we can let go our sense that
to be accused of racism

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.890
is to be accused of being a bad
person, or to be accused

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.550
of perpetrating sexism is to
be accused of a bad person.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.930
Then, if we can let go of that,
we can have a real,

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.200
meaningful conversation.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.190
What are the ways, you think,
that we can perpetuate, if you

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.580
will, racism, sexism, other
isms, even without

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.350
intentionality.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.600
Because that's the stuff that
unless we think very

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.970
consciously about it, we'll
make mistakes and not even

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.290
realize that we've done it.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.610
The obvious stuff, the answer
is, just stop doing it.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.860
But the stuff that's so
subconscious you don't realize

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.540
you're doing it, or that's a
matter of systemic practice

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.320
and you never reflect on
it, is the stuff that

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.160
goes under the radar.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.230
So what are the ways that can
happen with racism, with

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.500
sexism, or any other ism?

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.320
I would suggest there
are three ways

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.080
with regard to race.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.730
One is this notion, this real
myth of objectivity.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.580
And now I mean this on
a personal level.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.280
This idea that we are actually
capable of objectively

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.780
evaluating the merit of
another human being.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.780
I know we like to believe that
we're capable of this.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.410
We really do.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.600
You'll hear people say
it all the time.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.020
Well, it's not racism,
we just hire the

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.060
most qualified person.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.250
As if somehow, there are 310
million Americans and it is

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:23.390
capable to rank them from one to
310 million, and then say,

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.920
well, you were 167,412.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.500
You've got the job.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.400
Or you were 2,000,307.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.860
Sorry, you don't quite
make the cut.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.840
Or you were 11.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.550
Hot damn.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.210
We have found the 11th most
wonderful human being on the

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.390
planet for this gig.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:37.470
That isn't rational.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.630
But we act as if somehow, we
can just take people's

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.810
resumes, take their background,
sit them down in

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.210
an interview for a few minutes,
and then we can be

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.900
the sort of perfect receptors
of information, whether it's

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.180
their background or the answers
they give us to the

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.310
questions that we ask.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.720
And that we can just filter it
out like a computer with no

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.350
biases whatsoever.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.240
And we believe this, in part,
because we want to.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.110
It's a lot nicer than to think
that we're incredibly flawed

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.600
and incapable of really
being objective.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.550
But what the evidence very
clearly tells us is that we're

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.440
not nearly as capable of it
as we'd like to believe.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.620
So that when we think about jobs
and hiring and promotions

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.070
and evaluation of existing
employees, in just about any

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.610
company this would be true.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.460
At any college in the
admissions office,

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.250
this would be true.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.130
At any graduate school, business
school, med school,

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.740
law school, same thing.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.970
The notions that often affect
who gets hired, who gets

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.860
promoted, who gets admitted,
what the evaluation of the

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.630
employee is, are affected by--
those things are affected by

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.730
the notion of fit.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.910
Who does and does not.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.390
The notion of qualifications, by
which we really are talking

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:42.660
about formal credentials, not
necessarily qualifications.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.710
Because qualifications can
be quite intangible.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.120
Credentials are very clear
and they're on paper.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.340
And some of them are probably
quite important.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.770
Others, maybe not
so objective.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.760
But we certainly utilize them.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.820
And those are really
the two things.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.250
There's not three.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.390
Just fit and credentials.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.850
And yet what the research tells
us is that the notion of

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.360
fit is incredibly subjective,
more so than just about any

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.120
other concept, perhaps,
in the workforce.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.130
Especially in an industrial
culture, in an economic

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.770
culture, that is its own sort
of the universe, right?

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.990
Which is true of tech, but
it's also true of heavy

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.200
manufacturing in the past.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.070
They created cultures,
did they not?

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.450
And the people that were seen
as fitting in with that

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.410
culture, they didn't
all look the same.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.220
They didn't all have
the same story.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.740
They didn't all have the same
education or background or

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.590
accent or religion.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.180
But there was a certain
continuity.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.200
Even with the diversity that
existed just in people's lives

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.980
and family backgrounds, there
was still a lot of similarity.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.160
There were certain expectations
about affect,

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.920
about dress, about style, about
your hobbies, about the

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.950
things that you would do.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.710
And if those things affected who
did and didn't get hired,

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.630
who did and didn't get promoted
in the auto industry,

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.360
for instance, or if it affected
who did and didn't

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.550
get promoted, who didn't
get the gig in--

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.520
forget manufacturing.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.550
Think about police departments
or fire departments, where no

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.840
doubt, the people who were
getting hired for most of

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.220
those jobs were probably
qualified for

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.370
them in some sense.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.710
The fire department was not
generally picking people who

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.980
were incapable of
fighting fires.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.450
But the idea that they were
actually capable of figuring

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.650
out who were the 20 best
firefighting human beings in

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.140
this community, pretty
unlikely.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.220
There was all this other
intangible stuff happening.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.900
And the research tells us that
the notion of fit is directly

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.410
affected and impacted by racial
bias, gender bias,

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.170
class bias, sexual bias, all
of those and a lot of other

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.750
types, too.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.710
And that we tend to see merit
more quickly in someone that

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.220
reminds us of ourselves.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.810
Whether that's in terms of our
background or in terms of our

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.280
interest or in terms-- it
could be something as

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.610
intangible as the music
that you like or

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.580
all kinds of things.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.210
Do you do cross fit
or something?

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.320
I mean, it could be anything.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.090
God forbid, right,
it could be that.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.980
But the point being that this
notion of fit isn't really

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.080
about objective evaluation.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.440
And to the extent that it can
be affected by racial bias,

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.900
gender bias, class bias, all
these things that the research

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.220
tells us we internalize from
the time that we're very

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.380
young, then even when we think
we're being purely objective

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.190
and fair minded in the hiring
process, the evaluation

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.190
process, the promotion process,
we're not really able

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.870
to do that.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.050
The second principle
way in which we can

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.260
maintain racial bias--

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.790
and this would be true
for other biases--

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:17.210
is that there's also this myth
of institutional objectivity.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.440
So it's not just that our
personal biases--

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.610
many of which are subconscious,

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.620
according to the research--

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.390
get in the way of how we
actually evaluate people.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.270
That's part of it.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.960
But this other part, which is
even more frightening, is even

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.370
if we were capable of being
perfect evaluators of other

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.790
people's merit, the problem is
the criteria we're using to

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.620
determine merit may
itself be flawed.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.680
May not be as objective
as we think.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.140
So even if we were objective,
the criteria might not be.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:41.930
What do I mean by that?

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.020
Well, you think about maybe the
most meritocratic merit

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.180
indicator that there is.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:46.720
What would it be?

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.590
If you're hiring, you would
think, well, it seems like the

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.060
best indicator is experience.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.860
That seems fair.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.900
That seems objective.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.370
That seems like a pretty
good merit indicator.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.950
But the problem is when we
determine whether someone does

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.420
or does not have as much
experience as makes them

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.130
qualified, we oftentimes set
incredibly arbitrary limits on

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:11.120
that or frames around that or
a particular definition of

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.960
what experience is that is not
really objectively arrived at.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.330
I've worked with companies
that--

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:16.520
I always make the
habit, usually.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.240
I didn't do it this time.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.140
But I usually make the habit
of going and looking at the

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.450
last, like, 10 job postings
that I can find for a

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.730
particular gig.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.170
Just to see what they're
asking for, right?

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.170
And you go and it'll say,
five to six years.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.200
Four to seven years.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.150
8 to 10 years.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.380
Two to three years.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.960
And I'll go and I'll ask the
folks I'm working with, like,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.370
OK, where did you
get that number?

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:35.430
Why four to six?

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.960
Why not three years,
four months, two

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.300
weeks, and an afternoon?

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:39.890
Why?

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.670
What was the actual objective?

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.230
Other than just picking a
nice, round number, what

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.370
evidence do you have
the four to six is

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:48.590
really what's necessary?

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.020
And that if you only had three
and a half, you'd be screwed

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.740
for another half a year?

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.450
No, you have to wait six more
months, and then come back and

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:56.400
it'll be fine.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.470
And every time I've asked that
question, why this criteria as

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:03.660
opposed to that one, without
exception there's never been

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.050
an objective evaluation.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:09.320
There's never been what's called
a reliability analysis

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.850
in this work done to determine
that this is really necessary

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.940
and without this, you're likely
to fail at this job.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.130
Usually it's because that's
what the last guy-- and it

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.780
usually is a guy--
had to have.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.900
So that's what-- by God, that's
what I had to have.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.650
And if I had to jump through
those hoops, you're going to

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:24.500
jump through those hoops.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.700
That's what's called
a positional good.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.020
It's something that I have, you
want it, and I'm going to

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.540
make damn sure that you have
go through all the same

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.880
troubles that I did in
order to get it.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.080
Now, the positional good may be
valuable as a criteria, or

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.360
it may be really strange.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.230
So for instance, most of the
time, college professors have

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.500
to have a Ph.D., certainly
to be tenure in most

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.830
institutions.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.590
And that might make sense.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.350
But then you have to actually
ask yourself, well, what makes

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.760
a person get a Ph.D.?

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.500
What you do to get a Ph.D.?

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.540
Because it seems objective.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.350
It seems fair.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:59.320
It's the highest level you can
get in most fields, unless you

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.570
get a J.D. or something, some
other type of specialized

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.520
professional degree.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.940
But is it really objective?

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.650
Well, let's think about it.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:06.530
How do you get a Ph.D.?

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.510
You get a Ph.D. usually writing
a dissertation, which

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.500
is you write a really
long paper on

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.440
a very narrow subject.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.370
It's not like you're doing
a survey of your

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:16.710
entire subject matter.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.780
You're picking a really
narrow, finite area.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:24.510
So Newt Gingrich, for example,
has a Ph.D. Now, I could end

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.850
the joke right there in some
regards, I suppose.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:27.780
But he has one.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.220
He has one, actually, from my
Alma mater, which I'm not

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.510
overwhelmingly happy about.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.460
But it is what it is.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.890
And he has his Ph.D.
in history.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.870
He got this Ph.D. in history
because he wrote a

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:37.530
dissertation.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.100
Fantastic.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.940
That's what you do.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.630
And because he has a Ph.D., if
Newt Gingrich wanted to be a

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.920
history professor at any college
in this country, he

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.590
could probably--

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.220
he probably also could do
that because he was the

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:46.860
Speaker of the House.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:47.830
So that probably would help.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.010
But even if he hadn't done that,
just the Ph.D. would

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.020
probably qualify him in the eyes
of most for being hired.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.625
And yet, what was
his Ph.D. in?

00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:56.530
Well, it was history.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.310
But how did he get it?

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.210
He wrote a dissertation.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:58.830
What was it about?

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.490
It was about Belgian
educational

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:03.030
policy in the Congo.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.295
Fascinating.

00:31:04.295 --> 00:31:06.790
And I suppose if you're a
historian of the Belgian

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.710
Congo, that is a very
important subject.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:12.080
And if you were going to teach a
class on Belgian educational

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.180
policy in the Congo, I don't
have any doubt, Newt Gingrich

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.700
is probably your guy.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.350
And that's actually arguable,
because when he did his Ph.D.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.560
in Belgian educational policy
in the Congo, he didn't

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.420
actually interview any black
folks from the Congo.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.240
He just interviewed
people in Belgium.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.640
So even then, you might
say, he's not really

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.490
that much of an expert.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.230
But we'll just cut him slack
for the sake of argument

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.510
because I'm feeling generous,
and we'll say that if you were

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.860
going to teach a class on that
subject, he probably knows

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.860
more about it than
a lot of people.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.550
But does that mean that he's
more qualified to teach, like,

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.870
a US history 1865 to the
present survey class?

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.040
Not necessarily.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.350
Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.490
So even a really seemingly
objective criteria like that

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.740
can get us in trouble unless
we dig deeper.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.040
And the same is true with
credentials generally, for one

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:56.860
very simple reason.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.550
How we get them isn't just about
a fair race in which

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.200
everyone has started at the very
same point and has the

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.980
finish line in front of them,
and then whoever is the

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.040
fastest runner gets there.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.580
We're talking about a larger
system of job networking and

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.370
job opportunities in which some
people have had three lap

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.460
head start in a eight lap race,
or five lab head starts,

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.360
or even just a half a lap
head start, right?

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.330
If I've had even a little bit
of a head start on you and

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.470
we're running a race, I'm
supposed to cross the finish

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.970
line first.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.010
That's sort of how that works.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.460
And in fact, if I have a head
start on you and I don't cross

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.020
the finish line first, there's
something wrong with me.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.080
I'm not as fast a runner.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.490
If I have a five lap head start
in a eight lap race and

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.990
when the race is over,
I'm only ahead by

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:39.860
three, I still won.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.270
But you're the faster runner.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.230
So if you were trying to pick
people for a track team, you

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:47.050
would want the person who made
up ground and closed the gap

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:49.060
in terms of achievement, rather
than the person who

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.100
just hit the tape first.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.010
When we talk about jobs, it's
not quite like a race.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.290
But it's not altogether
different either.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.460
Because none of us are sort of
just starting from scratch.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.330
Unless it's your very first job,
and even then you're not

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.440
starting from scratch because
you went to school somewhere.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.540
And even that wasn't scratch,
because you had a family and

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.330
they had a certain set of
opportunities or lack thereof.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.370
So in a sense, we're constantly
inheriting these

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.690
eight lap relay races.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.180
But we're not inheriting
the starting line at

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.100
the very same point.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.720
And so if we're going to
evaluate who's the most

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.120
qualified and we're looking only
at the tape at the end of

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.050
the race, which is what the
resume, in a sense,

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.150
represents.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.480
The resume, the job references,
the application

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.200
that you fill out, that's the
end result of whatever you've

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.930
done before, which is great.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:28.470
Just like the eighth lap.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.360
And the tape is the end
result of the race.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.880
But unless I know all the stuff
that happened in lap

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.990
seven, six, five, four, three,
two, and one-- or at least

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.660
some of the stuff.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.270
I'm not going to maybe
know all of it.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.140
But if I don't know any of it,
am I really likely to make a

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.560
really excellent, objective,
fair decision at the end about

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.320
who the most qualified
person is?

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.970
Well, I might get lucky.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:50.020
But I could also be horribly
wrong if what I'm seeing is

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.060
just the detritus of
an opportunity

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.280
structure that's unequal.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.480
Which is to say that both
ethically and practically, we

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.580
need to rethink the
notion of merit.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.510
Ethically, of course, because
that means a lot of people who

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.960
might be the best are being
left by the side.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.040
Not because they are any less
capable, but just because

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.360
maybe they don't know
the right people.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.190
They haven't been in the
pipeline as long so they don't

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:08.860
have the same credentials.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.670
But also because it hurts
institutional integrity.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.850
If a company's trying to
actually find the best people,

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:17.020
which I think makes sense as
long as we have an expansive

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.750
capacious understanding of what
"the best people" means,

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.080
then they would want, I would
think, to have a criteria that

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.150
was less likely to produce
outcome based decisions that

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.840
were the end of the
eighth lap.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.000
The tape at the end
of the race.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.850
That they would want to have as
expansive a notion of merit

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:33.580
as possible.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.139
And as holistic a way of
assessing merit so as to get

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:37.790
the best people.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:38.679
Not only to be fair.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:39.670
That's part of it.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.389
But also to make sure that they
actually do, in fact, get

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:44.040
the best people for the job.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:49.230
The final problem that
perpetuates injustice that

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.520
corporate folks need to think
about, educators need to think

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.190
about, and all of us, really, in
the country to think about,

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.290
is what I would suggest as color
blind formalism would be

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.500
the term that I guess
I would use.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.790
And what I mean by color blind
formalism is this very formal,

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:07.160
very formulaic way in which we
just don't talk about race and

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.190
we don't think about race.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.890
Or we act as if we
don't see it.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:12.000
So when we talk about racism,
that's what people will say as

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:12.980
their first line of defense.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.420
Well, I don't even see color.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.560
I don't think about color.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.730
Well, that may be the problem.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:19.490
If you don't think about color
in a world in which color

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.170
matters, ten you're going to
miss an awful lot of stuff.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:23.980
It'd be like saying, well,
I'm ability blind.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.770
I don't notice disability.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.040
Now, think about that.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.280
The Americans with
Disabilities Act

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.920
was passed in 1991.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.795
And if anyone said, well, our
goal is to be disability

00:35:31.795 --> 00:35:34.730
blind, well then how the hell
are you going to build a ramp?

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.340
You're not going to build a
ramp for folks in chairs

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.770
because I'm not noticing,
because I didn't even see you

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:39.950
were in a chair.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.890
Ergonomic workplaces,
what the hell?

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.820
I don't know anything
about that.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.270
You need a certain width
of the door?

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:46.900
I don't know.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.370
Why would I do that?

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.490
Elevators?

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.620
I'm not noticing that
you're disabled.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.640
All the different things that
come with disability.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.750
If I'm not noticing, then the
odds are I'm not going to take

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:00.200
the kind of steps that I need
to ensure that you actually

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.690
have equity of opportunity
in treatment.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.280
And then I'm going to pretend
that I've been really innocent

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.240
and kind and nice.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.490
Like, oh, but I didn't
even see you.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.230
Yes, exactly.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:10.410
And that's why you didn't make
the workspace more functional

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:11.600
for me and others like me.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.590
The same is true with
race or gender,

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.850
sexuality or anything else.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.680
If you're going to create real
equal opportunity, you have to

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:23.520
take a not color blind or gender
blind or sex blind or

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.260
sexuality blind or any
blind approach.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.440
You have to take a very color
conscious, gender conscious,

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.510
sex conscious approach that
actually looks at the way that

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:35.190
these dynamics oftentimes skew
our own judgments and skew the

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.640
very criteria that
we are using.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.880
To be blind to color, as Julian
Bond, civil rights

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.490
legend, puts it is to be blind
to the consequences of color.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.760
So if the consequences of color
are still quite real,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.020
being colorblind means we take
a very passive approach.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.040
We just take it as they come.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.720
Lots of times folks will say,
we'll hire whoever walks

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.940
through the door who's
most qualified.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.740
The problem being, if certain
people know the location of

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.960
that door and they know which
way the door turns and they

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.490
know the combination code to
get through that door, then

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:02.920
they're going to have
a much easier time.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.790
Or if somebody just simply
thinks that behind the door

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.660
will lie rejection, right?

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.000
So imagine if you're a member--
and like I said, all

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.150
of us in here are at some point
probably members of

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.930
dominate groups and also members
of subordinate groups.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:20.080
I've rarely met anyone who was
only a dominant group, that

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.800
every one of their identities
was dominant.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.560
And I've never met anyone
who's every

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.370
identity was non dominant.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.260
Could happen, but it's rare.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.570
So when you're a member of a
dominant group, if you think

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.250
about being anything but that,
what it would be like to go to

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.440
a place where you were so
incredibly under represented.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.560
And you're making assumptions
in you're own head about why

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.730
that might be.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.800
You're assuming, well, maybe
it's overt racism, sexism,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.850
classism, et cetera.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:43.670
Or maybe it's not.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.980
Maybe it's just subtle bias.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.090
Or maybe it's just the culture
of this institution is going

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:50.500
to be off putting and they don't
really think that I fit.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.570
So if they don't think I fit,
I'm not even going to try.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:54.920
Which gets to the heart
of the problem.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.700
Sometimes in Silicon Valley,
where people will say, well,

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:01.040
there's just not enough
qualified fill in the blank.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.020
Not enough qualified women
in this kind of work.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.230
Not enough qualified people of
color in this kind of work.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:09.740
A, that's oftentimes a dodge
and oftentimes inaccurate,

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.320
statistically speaking.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.310
Let's just for the sake of
argument say for the hell of

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:18.110
it that even if it's true,
what does it mean?

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.890
Let's just say, for the sake of
argument, that there really

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.800
aren't enough to dramatically
change the demographics of

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.000
Silicon Valley, at least
not right away.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.470
What, then, obligations do we
have to do something about it?

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.580
Do we just passively
go, oh well.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.030
It's not my fault.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.480
I didn't create that
imbalance.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.280
It sort of sucks.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.350
I wish it wasn't like that.

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.230
But I don't really have time
to think about that.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.580
Or do we think, well,
wait a minute now.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.450
We inherit this legacy for which
we're not to blame, but

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.000
we've inherited it and we sort
of have to be accountable to

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.520
and responsible for what
we do with that.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.170
That's what we do as
responsible people.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.720
I don't think any of us in
here are deliberately

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.310
responsible--

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.340
I hope not-- for poisoning the
water and the air and the soil

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.480
all around this planet.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.220
You didn't actually take your
own bucket of hazardous waste

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.900
and go inject it in a deep well
into the water outside

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.290
the back of your house.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.710
But it got in there.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.130
You didn't go and belch
smoke with toxic

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.290
chemicals into the air.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.530
But somebody did that, and now
you inherit the legacy.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.630
And as a responsible person,
not just as a citizen of a

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.060
country but a citizen of the
planet, you have an obligation

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.970
to deal with the stuff that
gets handed to you.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.640
So if we know that unfairness
and inequity has been handed

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.110
down to us, then we have to be
conscious about how we're

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:26.890
going to undo that.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.770
You can't do that passively.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.580
And ultimately, if you try,
you create incredible

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.440
dysfunctions.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.910
It's not a sustainable
model, ultimately.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.900
To be formally color blind.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.130
To not think about race.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:39.940
To not think about issues
of inequity.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.740
Or to not challenge our own
subjectivities, whether

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.060
they're personal or
institutional.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.720
Because here we are, in a state
that's already mostly

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.060
people of color, in a country
that's going to be roughly

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:54.480
50-50 white and people of color
within a mere 30, maybe

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.970
35, years at the most.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.660
Maybe as few as 25.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.770
So somewhere between 25 and 35
years from now, we're going to

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.890
be a half and half country
of white folks

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:02.560
and people of color.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.490
Unless you actually think, and
unless folks throughout

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.740
American and in Silicon Valley
in particular, think that it

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.770
is possible to maintain a tech
sector on the back of a

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.130
dwindling percentage of the
population, which is

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.230
incredibly unlikely and
it's a pretty risky

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:18.510
gamble, I would think.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.980
Unless we actually believe that
we'll just continue to be

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.660
able to cull 80, 85, and in
some cases even 90% of the

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.730
best talent from a group of
people that's shrinking in

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.540
terms of its size, then we'd
better think very seriously

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.940
about how we're not going to
just passively sit back and

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:33.860
say, oh well.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.550
We wish there were more of
them, but there aren't.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.760
But we're actually going
to go out and have

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.810
to create that pool.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.030
We're going to have
to actually go out

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.600
and seed that pool.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.120
Whether that means collaborating
with school

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.900
districts and individual schools
and mentoring folks at

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.260
a very young age when they're
actually thinking about what

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.820
they want to be and what they
want to do when they grow up.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.600
I remember doing that when I
was in third or fourth or

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.010
fifth grade.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.300
A lot of people don't
think about it

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.330
until quite a bit later.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:58.270
But if I never know that
you exist or that your

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.130
opportunities exist or what it
would even mean to work here.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.020
What it would even mean to
work in Silicon Valley

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.110
generally, at any institution.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.350
Then the odds are pretty
good, it's just not

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:07.290
going to be on my radar.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.550
If it's not on my radar, I'm not
likely to apply for a job

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.140
or seek a career in
the industry.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.840
And if I don't apply, then
I can't be actively

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.670
discriminated against, in which
case I can't sue and

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.680
nothing ever changes.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.540
I can't sue if you don't
actually mistreat me.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.370
And you can't even mistreat me
if I don't even know you exist

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:25.270
or know how to reach you.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.810
So we have to do that level of
very deliberate seed planting

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:30.340
in order to create a
different culture.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.510
Not only for the sake of
fairness, which I think is

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:35.230
important in its own right,
but also for the sake of

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:36.550
institutional continuity.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.370
Just like I would tell and I
have told prep schools all

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:42.420
around this country that have
been overwhelmingly white for

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.890
a very long time, that they're
going to have to think very

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.375
seriously about how long
they want to exist.

00:41:47.375 --> 00:41:48.940
If you're going to be a boarding
school and you've

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:53.110
been around for 100 years living
off of the presence of

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.910
affluent white folks in a
country where white folks are

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.980
dwindling as a percentage of the
population, you don't have

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.260
a very good long term
chance of survival.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.020
Ultimately, you're going to be
culling from a shrinking base.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.960
So you've got to think about
change not just for others,

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.810
but also for yourself.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.720
And so in this particular case,
I'm glad that there are

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.640
folks in the tech sector and
in Silicon Valley generally

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.060
who are willing to ask
these questions.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.130
I only hope that you continue
to ask them without fear or

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.640
recrimination or anxiety that
somehow people are going to

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.930
look at you or others with whom
you work as bad people.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:25.240
I'm sure there are such folks.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.900
I'm sure we all know
some of them.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.080
But the reality is that most of
us are good folks trying to

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:29.890
get it right.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:32.590
Unfortunately if we don't
understand all the various

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.310
ways that we get it wrong--

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.630
because of the cognitive traps
into which we fall, because of

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.400
our upbringing, because
of our conditioning--

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.250
then we can't solve them.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.390
The good news being the research
tells us very clearly

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.160
that if we are willing
to confront that--

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.110
if we are willing to own our own
biases and the extent to

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.920
which we've been conditioned to
see certain people as more

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.450
meritorious than
other people--

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:53.590
the research says that if we're
willing to do that, we

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:56.360
actually can check the bias
before it becomes

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.730
discriminatory behavior.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:59.800
So you actually can interrupt
the thought before

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.685
it becomes the deed.

00:43:00.685 --> 00:43:02.235
And ultimately, that's
what's important.

00:43:02.235 --> 00:43:04.810
I don't know a lot of people of
color who are too worried

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:06.000
what white folks think
about them.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.180
It's how white folks
treat them.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.940
I don't know too many women who
are really that worried

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.790
about what men think
about them.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:12.950
It's how they get treated
as women.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:15.610
So ultimately, if we can
interrupt the thought before

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.380
it becomes the deed, then harm,
the damage, of racism,

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.750
of sexism, of all these isms,
can be if not undone, at least

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.660
interrupted and diminished in
terms of its ability to harm

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.830
others and, really, to
harm the society upon

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:27.890
which we all depend.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:28.990
Thank you all so much
for being here.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.630
I appreciate it.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.800
I will take any questions that
you have in the time

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.360
that we have left.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.040
Thank you very much.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.380
Appreciate it.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:41.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.780
TIM WISE: Yes.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.170
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:47.320
So at least in the realm of
sexism, I think there has been

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.840
some basic acknowledgement
that we are not--

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.450
that this is a major problem
in the tech industry and in

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:56.860
Silicon Valley with kind of
the rise of the brogrammer

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.650
culture in mainstream media.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:02.030
How do you take from
acknowledgment of the

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:07.940
existence of this kind of
culture and get past the point

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.740
where, right now, it seems
like it's a preference.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.820
Like you have a brogrammer
company or one

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.280
that is less so.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.230
And it seems right now like it's
interpreted as a matter

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.960
of preference.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.480
Like, oh, I prefer
to work here.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.860
Not like, this shit
is unacceptable.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.580
How do we stop it?

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.370
How do we move forward
from there?

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.660
TIM WISE: Right.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.720
Well, I think it's
a good question.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.460
Because obviously, we can
acknowledge it and not

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.310
problematize it.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.740
And I think that's what
we tend to do.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.570
We acknowledge certain things,
but we don't ultimately

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.370
problematize them.

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.000
Like we will acknowledge that
people tell racist jokes or

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.850
sexist jokes, whether it's in
the workplace or in the school

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:40.470
or in the neighborhood.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.110
And then we will rationalize
that or not make a big deal

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.400
out of that or act like
it's not a problem.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.810
So clearly, one does not

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:47.010
automatically lead to the other.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.460
The good news is that
if we create--

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.550
and sometimes the critical mass
needed for this, and I

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:54.480
don't mean critical mass of
women in a male-dominated

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.290
sector or of people of color in
a white-dominated sector so

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:59.950
much as I mean a critical
mass of whomever

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.050
willing to push back.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.990
And it might be in a certain
unit of a certain company or a

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.610
certain industry, just
a handful of

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:06.550
really committed people.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.190
It could be several dozen.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.930
It could be hundreds.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:09.980
It might take more than that.

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.940
It's never clear, depending
on where you are.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.020
But what the research find
is, and my own experience

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.570
confirms, that when you push
back, and when a handful of

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:22.500
people begin to push back
against the sort of unspoken

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.320
norms of the culture, and begin
to just question them

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.110
and to problem-- and to ask
questions really more so than

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.610
even make demonstrative
statements.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.100
Because it's one thing to stand
up and say, this shit is

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:32.940
unacceptable.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.820
And I'm all for that
a lot of times.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.020
Like, there are times when you
just have to say it that way.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.010
And then there are other times
when the approach,

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:42.520
particularly when folks are
really dug in on their denial

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.060
that there's a problem going
on, is to ask a series of

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.310
questions of them which leaves
very little possible

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:51.320
conclusion other than this
shit is unacceptable.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.860
But it's different if I tell you
that or if you think of it

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:54.550
yourself, right?

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:55.580
It's like with my
own children.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.750
If I want my children to do
something, there are two

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:58.560
approaches, right?

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.640
I can either say, like, in the
morning if it's time for

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.160
school, I can say, get upstairs
and brush your teeth.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.560
We're going to be late.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.860
Now, that works about
60% of the time.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.720
Maybe a little bit better than
flipping a coin, but not much.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.850
Or I can come up with a much
more inventive approach.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:12.970
I can ask my daughter.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.050
Usually it's just one of them.

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:16.930
The other one is a little bit
quicker on the draw with this.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:18.246
But I'll ask what are
you supposed to

00:46:18.246 --> 00:46:20.380
be doing right now?

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.540
Now, I know the answer is
brushing your damn teeth.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.350
That's the point, right?

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:24.320
I could have just
told you that.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.240
And you know it's that.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.410
But if I tell you brush your
teeth, there's that part of

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:29.406
you that just, whether your a
kid or an adult and somebody

00:46:29.406 --> 00:46:32.380
tells you to do something that
might be dug in and not doing

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.040
it and resisted.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.490
But if I ask you and you say,
oh-- and she will-- brushing

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:37.130
my teeth, right?

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.100
And I go, exactly.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.360
That's awesome.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.370
Then all of a sudden, she
thinks she's a genius.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:43.970
She thought up the problem
on her own.

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.910
She now came up with the
solution on her own.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:50.430
So if I'm trying to get people
to really question the culture

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.740
of an institution with regard to
race or gender or class or

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.600
sexuality, sometimes asking
those kind of questions and

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.110
getting a handful of people who
are prepared to step up as

00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:59.920
allies and ask those
questions.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.070
And when I say, as allies,
I mean specifically this

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.730
requires that it's not just
people of color who are

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:08.060
raising this subject in a
white-dominated institution.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.930
It's not just women who are
raising this issue in a

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:12.070
male-dominated institution.

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.170
It means that some of us who
are male and some of us who

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:16.620
are white and especially if
we're both, and some of us who

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.830
are straight and some of us are
working class background

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.920
or whatever it is where these
issues come into play.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.890
We've also got to be prepared to
stand up and to challenge.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.980
And what's really interesting
in the research is that when

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.620
that happens, you end up
discovering a lot of times--

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.480
not all the time, but a lot of
times-- that there are lots of

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.170
other people in the
institutional space who also

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:37.780
were thinking, this shit
is unacceptable.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.710
But they didn't want
to go first.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.030
Part of this is not that we're
ignorant or we don't

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:43.210
understand the problem.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.240
Sometimes that's it.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.490
But sometimes it's just, I
sort of know the problem.

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:48.250
I don't want to put
my neck out first.

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:49.040
I don't want to go first.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.010
Nobody wants to go first,
because there's that chance

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.870
that you're going to get your
hand slapped or your neck

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:54.860
chopped off or whatever.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.240
So you sort of hold
back and wait.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.610
And as soon as someone else does
it, as soon as someone

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.510
else raises the issue, that's
when you'll start to see

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.430
people go, yeah.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:02.340
I was thinking about that.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.570
Now they don't feel
they're alone.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.450
And so I think in a sense,
that's an important piece.

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.370
And it's also important to put
yourself in the middle of the

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:09.680
problem when you're
discussing it.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.750
To say, it's not just
that the culture

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.240
generically is this way.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.100
It's that I'm a part of it.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.050
And I've imbibed it.

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:17.990
And I've taken part in it.

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:19.140
And I've contributed to it.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.300
And I realize that
that's a problem.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.800
Because just that level of
honesty and transparency makes

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.490
it easier for someone else to
be honest and transparent.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:28.300
Otherwise, what it sounds like
is, this shit is unacceptable.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.130
I'm good, but this shit is
unacceptable, right?

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:33.420
As opposed to saying, no,
actually, this shit is

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.150
unacceptable, but I also
am part of the

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:37.580
stuff that's not OK.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:39.950
And the minute you allow
yourself to be part of the

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.830
problem, then other people
are willing to own

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.300
their piece of it too.

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.930
Other questions?

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:47.300
AUDIENCE: So once you all have
this shit is unacceptable

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.580
moment and then we support
people so you start to have

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.290
women in the brogrammer culture
or more African

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:56.450
Americans going to college, et
cetera, how do we support them

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:57.720
once they're there?

00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.570
TIM WISE: Well, I think the
key to that is you have to

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:04.410
actively continue to work with
and collaborate with people.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.880
And with as opposed to for.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.640
I was a community organizer for
about a year and a half in

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.530
the mid '90s, and one of the
things that I learned just

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:16.150
doing that work was if I was
going to work with communities

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.510
that were marginalized both
racially economically and

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.880
really just culturally oppressed
and dominated and

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.130
targeted and often times
devastated communities.

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:29.350
The only way I was really going
to be of any use as a

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:33.270
white man who had a college
degree-- and so in every way,

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:36.010
I had all the privileges and
advantages that most of the

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.950
people in that space didn't,
because not only were they

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:40.670
folks of color, not only were
they poor and usually not with

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.360
college educations, they were
also disproportionately women

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.760
in public housing, et cetera.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.020
The only way that I could really
be of any use to them

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:50.730
in the long run was to start by
listening to what they said

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:52.080
they needed.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.750
Not asking them in a voyeuristic
way, like, how can

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:55.610
I help you?

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:56.640
Because that gets old.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.430
Like people who are constantly
being crapped on really don't

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.150
need you to say, how
can I help you?

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:03.710
Because you can help them by
not crapping on them, first

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:04.220
and foremost.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.230
And so we just have to be
prepared to listen.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.160
So I would go into the community
and I would listen

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.450
very carefully to what
was being said.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.800
Not necessarily to me in
response to a direct question,

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.210
but just what were they
talking about?

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.590
What were the things
on their mind?

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.320
What were the things that
they needed to see

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.570
change in that community?

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:21.800
So that when I then got involved
in a campaign to do

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.050
x, y, or z, I knew I was
following their lead.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:26.330
And the same is true in a
corporate setting or in a

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:26.970
school setting.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.520
If you listen carefully to
what folks of color are

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.300
saying, or what women as women
are saying, and sometimes that

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.080
requires just keeping
your ears open.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.010
Other times it might
really require--

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.120
and I think in the best
of cases, it does--

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.070
getting to know individuals
and creating

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.010
relationship with them.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:43.520
Because if I do get to know you
on a one-on-one level and

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.280
I can hear your story and you
can hear mine and I can share

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.800
it with you, then I might be
able to figure out some way in

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.710
which I can assist you in
navigating a culture which

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.890
maybe was not set up for you,
but which I see as important

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:56.980
for you to succeed in.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.940
And also, there's some
reciprocity involved.

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.900
Because even if, as a dominant
group member, I was in there

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.800
working with these
communities--

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.930
not for them, but with them--

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:07.450
I was still getting something
out of it.

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:09.220
It wasn't all a one-way
street.

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:12.230
It wasn't just that I was going
in and giving them the

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:15.680
technical assistance that they
needed to fight for a

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.050
particular piece
of legislation.

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:18.650
I wasn't just giving
them information.

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:20.400
I was also taking
something away.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.850
What I was taking away was the
insight and the wisdom that

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:26.090
otherwise usually was totally
untapped and un-listened to.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.700
And then I could take that and
take that out and talk to

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.710
other people about it in a way
that the people in the

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.560
community sometimes couldn't,
because they didn't have the

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.310
microphone.

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:36.260
So if I'm going to work with and
mentor folks who are being

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.980
marginalized on the basis of
some identity that, let's say,

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.860
I don't share, I'm able to
listen very carefully and not

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.570
only then maybe direct my
actions in a way that will

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:48.100
really help them, but more
importantly, I'm able to then

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.990
go and talk to other people,
maybe of my own identity.

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:54.480
Maybe I can go talk to other men
and challenge men around

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.240
sexism after listening to women
talk about what it is

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.560
that they need to see happen
in that regard.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.070
Or as a white person, I can
challenge other white folks

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.950
perhaps in a way that people of
color also try to challenge

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:06.100
white folks, but oftentimes
aren't heard.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:10.350
So I can take the wisdom and
then amplify that wisdom,

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:13.330
giving credit to the wisdom
where credit is due, not

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.700
assuming that it's mine.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.570
But saying, hey, this is
the stuff that I'm

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:17.760
hearing from folks.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.710
And I tend to start with the
assumption that they know

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:20.610
their needs.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:22.610
And so I think we all should
start with that assumption.

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:26.330
So there are ways of amplifying,
ways of listening,

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.300
ways of subordinating sort of
your own assumptions about

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.410
what people need to what
they actually are

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:32.540
saying that they need.

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.880
A lot of times we might assume
that people need

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.080
a particular resource.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.890
And that may be the one that
this person needs.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:39.330
But it might not be the
one this person needs.

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:40.600
This person might
need this very

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.300
formal mentoring structure.

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.360
This other person might just
need one individual to whom

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.460
they can relate on a very
personal, not even

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.510
professional, level, in order to
feel comfortable when they

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.970
come to work.

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:52.710
So you have to learn to listen
and create connection with the

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:56.240
people whom you're trying to
move into the space where

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.750
maybe they're not normative
for the space.

00:52:58.750 --> 00:52:59.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:05.140
Do you have any concrete things
that somebody can do on

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:11.060
any given day to challenge
somebody who just refuses to

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.120
see anything or hear anything?

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.270
TIM WISE: Well, I mean there's
no silver bullet for that.

00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:18.490
And obviously, the people who
are truly dug in and refuse to

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.120
see things are usually
people--

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.230
they are movable.

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:25.030
Most people are not completely
immovable.

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:27.860
But the odds that you'll be
able, by virtue of some really

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:31.770
well-placed argument or fact
or even story, to dislodge

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:33.310
them when they're that dug in.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:34.120
You might be able to do it.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.140
But the amount of time you're
going to have to spend to make

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.950
that happen may very well not
be worth the energy that it

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:40.000
takes even if it works.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.010
Those are the kind of people
that normally sort of have to

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:43.850
have their little come to Jesus
moments, where something

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:45.910
happens and the clouds part and
they're like, holy shit.

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:48.340
I need to change everything
I think about the world.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:49.760
You're not likely to
give them that.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.350
You might be able to, if you're
really persuasive.

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.220
But the odds are, they're going
to have to come to that

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:54.660
on their own.

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.510
So what does that mean?

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:56.520
Do we go throw up our hands?

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:56.750
No.

00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:01.000
What it means is that
fundamentally, you start not

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.320
with the hardest cases
like that.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.750
You're trying to
build a certain

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:05.680
amount of energy, right?

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:09.000
You're trying to build a
certain inertia towards

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.340
justice and toward equity.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.300
So if you're starting with the
people who are not those folks

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.360
that you're describing.

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.330
But folks who say all the right
stuff and for the most

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:20.130
part, you can assess that they
mean it, at least in theory.

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:22.400
That they actually want
to do right by folks.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.030
That they really do want equity
and justice, and they

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:26.520
know that these things
might be problems.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.490
But they may not actually
be involved in

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:29.430
trying to change anything.

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:30.100
They know it here.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.640
They're not necessarily
working on it in

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.270
an effective way.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.080
Then you start to build a
certain sense of capacity.

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.980
Again, it's not just that people
don't want to go first.

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.380
It's that until they see
movement, they may not do

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:41.100
anything at all.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.360
What I learned in public housing
projects when I worked

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.790
there as an organizer was the
thing that the people they are

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:48.640
needed more than anything, more
than me, they just needed

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.420
to know that they could win
a couple of things.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.340
And if they knew they could
win a couple-- and I mean,

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:53.300
really minor stuff.

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.190
Not like major victories.

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:57.380
Just minor things, to give
them a sense of their own

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.980
power and their own capacity.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.690
And then they start to do
the work on their own.

00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:03.340
And they start to change the
dynamics in the community,

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.130
even though there are people
in much more powerful

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:07.430
positions that don't want
anything to change.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:09.750
I remember going in, very
first week that I was an

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:12.220
organizer, and talking to
somebody about what are you

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:12.890
all fighting for?

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:13.830
What are you working on?

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:16.090
Because I was going to hit the
ground, be really excited and

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:17.170
interested in this.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:22.120
And I figured he was going to
answer, well, we're fighting

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:24.450
to smash white supremacy,
because that's why I was

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:25.200
there, by god.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.780
And we're going to smash
economic injustice.

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.510
Well, I mean all that
stuff is true.

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:30.770
That's their long-term goal.

00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:33.170
But instead of telling me that,
he looked at me and

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:35.980
said, we're trying to get
a stoplight right there.

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:37.670
And I remember going, what?

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:38.620
A stoplight?

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:39.350
At a corner?

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:40.560
Like, what's that?

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.790
I mean, I know what it is,
but why is that such

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:43.910
an important thing.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:45.470
And he said, well,
a couple reasons.

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:47.670
One is like four kids have
been hit on their bikes

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:48.860
because there's no stoplight.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.740
So we need a stop light so kids
will not get hit on their

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.130
bikes because cars will stop.

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:55.630
So that's the most
obvious answer.

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:57.690
He said secondly, though, it's
more important, the reason

00:55:57.690 --> 00:55:58.790
we're fighting for
the stop light is

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:00.910
because we can get it.

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:01.570
We can get it.

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:02.060
We'll win.

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.730
If we fight hard enough on this,
we'll get-- it won't

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:04.760
even be that hard.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.900
We'll get the stop light.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.770
And yeah, it doesn't
change anything

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:08.770
about the larger structure.

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:11.960
But it gives the community a
sense that there's something

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.040
possible in their actions.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.670
That they can, in fact, fight
and occasionally get the

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:17.910
outcomes that they want.

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:19.960
That's what any group that's
subordinated--

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.910
whether it's economically,
racially, religiously,

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:24.310
culturally, terms of gender,
sex, sexuality--

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:27.980
needs is to know that it's
not a wasted struggle.

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.640
And the more that they know
that, the more they're

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.080
invested in the sense that they
actually have efficacy

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.100
and they have agency that
can be effective.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.560
The more that they're going to
want to work with others.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.040
They're going to be
less exhausted.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.030
Less burned out.

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.410
They're going to be physically
healthier.

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:41.940
Because they know that even
though it's not going to

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.510
happen quickly, it can happen.

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:45.830
And therefore, you end up doing
an end run around some

00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:47.850
of these really hard cases.

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:49.440
Ultimately, some of
them might change.

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.030
But the thing that will
change the most is not

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:54.040
anything that you say.

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.060
Not any story that you tell or
statistic that you offer or

00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.110
fact that you give them.

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:01.100
But simply the example of people
on the move trying to

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:02.490
change the institution.

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:06.000
Because most people who are
really dug in like that also

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.330
tend to be very--

00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:09.210
they just tend to be more
compliant people.

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:11.340
That's why they don't want to
think outside their existing

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:11.940
world view.

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.930
Because they tend to just exceed
to what they already

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:14.860
assume it's normative.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.120
Well, if you start to create
change, right?

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:17.990
With or without them.

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:19.280
Now, that becomes normative.

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.480
And now that person that's very
compliant gets on board.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.390
In fact, they'll get on board
and say they were down with it

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:25.230
all the time.

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:26.220
Like, oh my god.

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:28.020
It's like people will tell you
they marched with Dr. King.

00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.180
Oh yeah, shit, I was
at every march.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.700
I was right there next to him.

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:34.100
This person was like seven when
King was killed, but they

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:36.760
have added 20 years to their
age just to make you think

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.860
that they were at some rally.

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:40.540
That person or their parents
might have been horribly

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.220
opposed to the civil
rights movement.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:45.230
But now, 30, 40, 50 years later,
they're like, oh yeah,

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:46.760
I was there.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.720
I was at Woodstock.

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:47.995
No.

00:57:47.995 --> 00:57:48.980
No, you weren't.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.580
No.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.290
You weren't there.

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:53.920
And so ultimately, you just
create this energy, this

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.810
movement, that other people
end up feeling--

00:57:56.810 --> 00:58:00.610
not all of them, but enough of
them-- feel compelled to glom

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.390
onto, even if it's for
the wrong reasons.

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:05.220
Their reasons for wanting to
jump on that bus may not be

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:07.430
the same as other people's,
but if they get on the bus

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:11.965
ultimately and take that trip
to whatever location justice

00:58:11.965 --> 00:58:14.530
is to be found, then
they'll get there.

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:16.900
They may get there with a very
different purpose and a very

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.070
different level of intent, but
at the end of the day, if

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:20.960
they're there, then you've
sort of got them.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.870
And so I wouldn't be my head
against the wall on the

00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:24.030
hardest cases first.

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:25.610
I'd save that until--

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:27.882
unless you just feel really
persuasive and energetic and

00:58:27.882 --> 00:58:30.120
you've got nothing else to
do with the five hours.

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.810
But ultimately, I think that,
for the most part, the thing

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:37.470
that gets folks like that is a
sense of inevitability, right?

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:39.240
That's certainly what got
civil rights laws.

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.840
It wasn't that Lyndon Johnson
woke up and said, oh my god.

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.300
I've been a stone asshole all
of my life and didn't even

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.000
vote for anti-lynching
legislation.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.550
Oh my god, I'm a terrible
person.

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:51.460
It's like Nixon didn't wake up
and say, we've been bombing

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.420
and killing millions of
southeast Asians.

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:54.470
What the hell is
wrong with me?

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:55.740
I should stop this.

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:56.570
That's not what happened.

00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:58.520
Ultimately, these individuals
felt that they

00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.240
had no other choice.

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.040
You could've gotten somebody
more dug in on race, in a lot

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.470
of ways, than someone like
Johnson had been

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:04.390
early in his career.

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:06.880
You couldn't get anybody more
dug in on cold war mentality

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.910
stuff than Nixon.

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:11.880
And yet when they felt that they
had no choice, they ended

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.020
up making decisions they might
not even have wanted to make,

00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:15.160
but they had to make them.

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.790
And that's the power of
movement activity.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:20.440
That's the power of the
inevitable inertia that you

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.940
can create your own energy,
with or without those

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:23.990
individuals.

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.970
Thank you all so much.

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:25.870
I appreciate you being here.

00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:30.555
