00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.740
 I was touched from behind 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.890
 meant that was under my dress 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.120
 packed in that so at my law me 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.650
 somehow I still tried to 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.530
 fight back my arm 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.270
 I have thrown the stairs 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.550
 even fallen down almost for that reason 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.500
 because just so many people were there 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.190
 that you can no longer control yourself 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.190
 had himself 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.350

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.679

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.409
 we know that data from a group 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.380
 have been committed by boys 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.240
 Men between the ages of 18 and 40 30 die 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.859
 visually from the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:40.649
 North African from that now to 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:43.079
 to make a topic about generalizations 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.609
 and connect with that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.429
 refugee issue is nothing more than 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.110
 an instrumentalization 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.119
 now it's about the facts 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.750
 enlighten and from it also the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.750
 necessary conclusions
