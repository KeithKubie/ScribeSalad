00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.500
So, maybe you can see a pattern here. For the quiz,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.180
I'm going to see if you can figure out how many times we'll

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.480
need to evaluate Fibonacci 30. Evaluate fibo 30 when we're evaluating fibo

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.140
36. See if you can figure this out without drawing out the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.000
whole thing and counting it, that's going to be a lot of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.810
work. But if you think about what we've seen so far, maybe

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.360
you see a pattern here, and you can figure out the result

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.590
for how many calls there would be to fibo 30 without doing

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.020
all that work. So see if you can

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.739
figure out the answer without working out every step.
