MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.443
My name is not Reto Meier, and
welcome to this week in Android

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:14.654
Development, on Monday,
November 11, 2013.

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:17.070
Since our last episode of this
week in Android Development

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.780
aired, we've launched the
Android 4,4, our KitKat.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.280
And if you haven't,
you should watch

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.810
the What's New in
Android Videos that we've

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.820
been recording in many
different languages.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.970
We might even have a
recording in American

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.490
if we ever get around to it.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.150
In addition to
what's new in KitKat,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.930
there's a lot of awesome
DevBytes that we've recorded.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.690
They're in one
convenient playlist

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.740
that you should watch as
well to get an idea of what's

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.050
new and improved in Android 4.4.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.579
This week, the DEVOXX conference
is in session in Belgium,

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.870
where a few people from the
Android Developer Relations

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.111
team will be presenting.

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:47.860
Now, if you're on this
side of the planet,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.130
Reto Meier will be
the keynote speaker

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.890
at AnDevCon in San
Francisco this Wednesday.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.150
That's all for this week
in Android Development.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.950
