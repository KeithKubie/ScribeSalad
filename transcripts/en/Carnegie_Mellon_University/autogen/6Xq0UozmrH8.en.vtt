graph is showing and I've pointed out to

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
graph is showing and I've pointed out to
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.599

a point where five turbines being buckle

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609
a point where five turbines being buckle

20 year period so as I said there

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239
20 year period so as I said there
 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.420
20 year period so as I said there
there's a four percent probability that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430
there's a four percent probability that
 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.640
there's a four percent probability that
more than five turbines are destroyed

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650
more than five turbines are destroyed
 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.839
more than five turbines are destroyed
during this 20-year period so that also

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849
during this 20-year period so that also
 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.479
during this 20-year period so that also
means there's a ninety-six percent

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489
means there's a ninety-six percent
 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.360
means there's a ninety-six percent
probability that less than five turbines

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370
probability that less than five turbines
 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.440
probability that less than five turbines
buckle in this 20-year period the same

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450
buckle in this 20-year period the same
 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.929
buckle in this 20-year period the same
example but with a higher number you

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939
example but with a higher number you
 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.690
example but with a higher number you
have a probability of only one percent

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700
have a probability of only one percent
 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.929
have a probability of only one percent
of losing more than 25 or half of your

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939
of losing more than 25 or half of your
 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.229
of losing more than 25 or half of your
turbines in this 20-year period the

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239
turbines in this 20-year period the
 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.869
turbines in this 20-year period the
other case we looked at was looking at

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879
other case we looked at was looking at
 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.909
other case we looked at was looking at
regional development so we looked at a

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919
regional development so we looked at a
 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.300
regional development so we looked at a

case where we installed 86 gigawatts of
 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.210
case where we installed 86 gigawatts of
capacity on offshore Texas so what I'm

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220
capacity on offshore Texas so what I'm
 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.780

showing in this graph is the cumulative

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790
showing in this graph is the cumulative

30-year curve so what we're showing
 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.309
30-year curve so what we're showing
there is that in that specifically

installed capacity that also means that

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760
installed capacity that also means that
 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.810

there's a lower probability of Lou
 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.290
there's a lower probability of Lou
into too much capacity because this is

what we suggested that if we want to

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.070
what we suggested that if we want to
 

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.970
what we suggested that if we want to
develop offshore wind wind we can start

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:23.980
develop offshore wind wind we can start
 

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.220
develop offshore wind wind we can start
developing inside where the risk of

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:26.230
developing inside where the risk of
 

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:31.080
developing inside where the risk of
hurricanes is lower and that's the end

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.090
hurricanes is lower and that's the end
 

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.780
hurricanes is lower and that's the end
