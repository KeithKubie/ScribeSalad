00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.880
Have you ever wanted to see a perfectly replicated
model of your insides, in stunningly

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.210
realistic 3D?

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.790
Yeah...me neither.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.450
Regardless, 3D body scanning is here, and
it’s got some surprising applications.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.849
But do people actually want to use it?

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.650
There’s been a sudden growth spurt in the
market of 3D body-scanning technologies.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.060
They use a set of cameras to capture a 360-degree
view of your body and then produce a visual

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.060
model.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.570
There’s an obvious possibility here to create
a replica of your body for a computer game,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.190
but this capability is also being leveraged
by companies for several other more real-world

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.609
uses
On the digital retail front, 3D scans of a

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.389
customer’s body could be used to help them
virtually ‘try on’ items of clothing.

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:45.969
Amazon reportedly just a bought New York-based
start-up called Body Labs, maybe to allow

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.829
customers to find better-fitting clothes when
browsing Amazon’s fashion section

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.909
Things are a little further along in the fitness
sector.

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.530
For a hefty price, you can buy a 3D body scanner
from Naked Labs that will report your metrics,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.260
like body fat and lean muscle mass, and gives
you a perfect 360 view of yourself as a little

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.210
avatar on your phone.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.471
The funny thing here is that this body scanner
doesn’t ever look at the inside of your

00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:10.471
body.

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.750
It’s only taking pictures of the outside,
and measuring your weight.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.010
To produce your report, it compares your data
to a large database of pre-existing body-composition

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.010
scans.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.800
Based on this comparison, Naked Labs’ algorithm
projects what your body composition probably

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800
is.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.000
Naked Labs is marketing this product as something
that can help you see your fitness progress

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.920
in minute detail...but can we go even deeper?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.920
Yes.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.000
With 3D x-rays.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.860
MARS Bio-imaging can take highly-detailed
3D scans of the inside your body.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.530
CT scans are a kind of imaging that make use
of x-rays, and the fact that MARS is providing

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.300
a 3D cross-sectional view isn’t new, all
CT scans do that.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.000
But this new kind of scanner uses more specialized
detectors to differentiate the x-rays’ frequency

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.950
as they pass through parts of your body, resulting
in an image that gives a much clearer distinction

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.300
between materials, like muscle and blood and
skin--and in incredible detail, all the way

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.840
down to the microstructure of the bone.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.180
Hopefully, this advancement can improve the
diagnosis and treatment of myriad diseases

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.819
and bodily issues.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.000
But despite the many applications of 3D body
scanning, the questions remains...will people

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.639
actually use it?

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.829
The new 3D CT scans seem to make a lot of
people pretty squeamish.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.939
Our brains are hard-wired to dislike seeing
the insides of people because that could be

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.189
an indication of disease or injury, and our
brain sees as a threat.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.549
But this doesn’t necessarily pose a problem
for medical practitioners, who kinda need

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.689
to be resistant to that kind of squeamishness...it’s
in the job description.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.370
What about personal use of 3D body scanning
for fitness, though?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.920
A recent study revealed that people felt ‘dejected
and dissatisfied with their body’ after

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.510
participating in a body scan study, potentially
because the image they were shown didn’t

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.989
match up with the idea they had of themselves
inside their head, something called self-discrepancy

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.049
theory.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.890
Naked Labs’ app even greys out the avatar
it creates for you supposedly so that you

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.129
can look at it as ‘objectively’ as possible
and to try to get you to let go of any ‘emotional

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.879
attachment’ you may have to the model of
your body.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.629
So even they recognize that our relationships
to our bodies can sometimes be fraught, and

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.680
that this may be an issue in implementation.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.749
So we’ll see if this becomes a new consumer
tech staple, or if it falls flat.

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:33.989
Gathering data about body metrics is definitely
trendy, but also a necessity for extreme athletes

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.870
like Ben Lecomte as he swims across the Pacific.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.779
Ben and his team aboard the Seeker Vessel
are using a heart monitor to track Ben’s

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:41.779
cardiovascular health.

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:44.159
