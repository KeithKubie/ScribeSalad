00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.330
I'd really like to give big hugs
to all the people who made this

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.430
course possible.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.800
That of course includes the whole
production team, especially Amanda,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.710
Catherine, and Morgan,
as well as Charlie and Robert for

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.790
their work on the mini projects.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.570
All these good people deserve credit for
the really good parts of the class, and

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.290
none of the blame for the less good
parts, which of course falls on moi.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.940
And finally, I want to thank
serial computers everywhere for

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.730
their patience and understanding.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.514
[SOUND] Especially when
I was staying up way

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:35.280
past everyone's bedtime,
keeping the lights on.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.143
So with that, I'm out of here, toodles!

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:41.821
Lights out!

00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:42.680
Cut.

00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:49.887
[MUSIC]

00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:53.950
Viva la HPC!

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.866
Viva la HPC!

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:59.012
Viva la HPC!

00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:00.510
Viva la HPC!

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.007
Viva la HPC!
