BRIAN KINDLER: Hi everybody.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.120
Thank you for coming
to the second event

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.610
in our Burma Series.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.710
My name is Brian Kindler.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.940
I'm the creator of Burma Series,
along with Google

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.050
Ideas, who has generously
sponsored this event.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.500
Today, we're lucky to have
with us Doctor Robert H.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.990
Lieberman, a physicist from
Cornell University, whose 50

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.270
year career has included the
creation of six novels, and

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.700
almost as many films, the latest
of which, "They Call it

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.720
Myanmar," was screened the other
night here at Google.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.030
Dr. Lieberman is going to be
speaking with us today about

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.480
contemporary Burma, and
answering questions.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.255
Please join with me to welcome
Dr. Robert Lieberman.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.850
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: I'm going
to run this like I run

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.960
my physics class.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.740
Basically, I'm going to start
assuming nothing, and so it's

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.720
better to find out where
students are and take them

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.140
along, as opposed to--

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140
how many of you have seen the
film "They Call it Myanmar"?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.110
So some haven't.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.270
You can stream it now.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.530
It's on all major digital
platforms, you know, Netflix,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.754
iTunes, and we have a website,
theycallitmyanmar.com.

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:16.110
And anyhow, so Brian wanted me
to tell you about myself a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.950
little bit, so let me
introduce myself.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.880
I have a number of careers.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.210
I teach physics at Cornell.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.280
I've been on the faculty there
for about 30 years.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.120
I've been writing novels for
even longer than that, and

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.045
short stories, and
I make movies.

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:31.870
And I make movies because
we're really in the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.400
post-literate generation, so
I've done fiction films, I've

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.740
done a comedy called "Green
Lights," and I've done a film

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.160
in Ethiopia during the
famine, various films

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.240
Anyhow, I'd like to talk to you
about Burma today, and I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.430
have some notes, but I probably,
knowing myself,

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.680
won't use them.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.930
You know, I would like to look
at Burma as a Martian would

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.970
look at it, or better yet, I'd
like to use Google Earth and

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.020
sort of zoom in on Burma.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.670
And if you do that, and you're
sort of looking at Southeast

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.229
Asia, if you look at the
countries surrounding Burma,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.940
it's kind of interesting,
because none of them really

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.550
are a beacon of democracy.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.380
There's Vietnam.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.800
If you talk out against the
government, you're in trouble.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.550
Laos is a communist country.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.520
I just got back from Cambodia.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.900
Hun Sen, who's the Prime
Minister, was put in place by

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.935
the Vietnamese after the
Pol Pot slaughter

00:02:29.935 --> 00:02:32.840
of 3 million people.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.370
Thailand, although it's
nominally a democracy, say

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.110
something bad about the king--

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.150
somebody wrote a novel
mentioning something about the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.470
king they didn't like, they
threw them in jail.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.030
And corruption is rampant in
all of these countries, so

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.650
that's kind of the setting.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.620
Burma is different
in many respects.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.420
Burma is kind of a unique
country, and I find it very

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.370
different from the rest
of Southeast Asia.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.950
And if you look at Burma from
above, if you start in the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.120
north, you're in the foothills
of the Himalayas, and it's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.200
snow covered.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.840
You start moving down south
and you hit jungle.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.580
Then you hit sort of the arid
lands, and finally you're in

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.710
the delta, the rice growing
area, which is the lowlands.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.320
This is a very, very
rich country.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.030
It has enormous gas reserves,
which, in

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.400
fact, are being tapped.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.396
Their offshore wells, they're
selling to all

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:33.640
the neighboring countries.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.450
So they have gas, oil,
gems, rubies, jade,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.150
lots of other minerals.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.620
They have teak forests, and
they have agriculture.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.000
Burma at one point was really
one of the richest countries

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.600
in Southeast Asia.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.960
It was a big exporter of rice.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.210
It had the best universities.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.850
It was sort of a shining
example, and 50 years of

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.260
military rule have caused it
just to tumble to the bottom.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.620
If there's a list of countries
and the poorest countries,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.570
it's down there near
Egypt somewhere.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.190
So I'd like to talk about
Burma sort of-- it's

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.500
very hard to do.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.050
Frankly, this is very difficult
for me because of

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.649
the complexities of
this country.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.985
It's a country of 130
plus languages.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.490
There are nine major ethnic
groups, but really those break

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.740
up into subgroups.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.330
The primary religion,
I think 85% of the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.960
population are Buddhists.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.900
I'm an electrical engineer.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.150
I think we just got feedback.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.880
But there are Christians,
there are Animists--

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.780
I may show you the Animists--

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.050
and there are Muslims.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.910
And so this is a incredibly
diverse country, and I don't

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.460
know really what to do in
terms of presenting the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.720
country to you, because there
are two complete visions.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.070
There are the optimists, and
there are the skeptics, and I

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.650
don't know where the truth lies
in the realm of this.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.200
And I don't know where the
country is going, frankly, and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.090
anybody who tells you they
know is probably lying.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.080
This is a country of 60 million
people, and the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.620
question of course, is why--

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.770
when I did this film,
there was really a

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.870
high level of fear.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.860
People were afraid to talk.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.330
They were terrified, beatings,
torture, imprisonment.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.930
I had one guy who is one of the
narrators in the film, and

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.595
he talks about what solitary
confinement, or was.

00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:43.450
It was essentially, they put you
into a concrete tube, all

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.080
right, and the tube is so
small that you couldn't

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.230
stretch out, you couldn't
stand up, and

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.690
they closed the end.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.090
That's solitary confinement, and
I think I could do about a

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.760
minute and a half, and so this
gives you an idea of what they

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.550
were capable of.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.180
He mentions they put a bag over
his head with hungry mice

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.340
in it, and the mice were trying
to bite him, and he had

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.410
to bite the mice.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.700
It's really Orwellian, which
is kind of interesting,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.910
because George Orwell
spent time in Burma.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.760
So there's a sort of the
before and after.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.380
I've been there repeatedly,
and I was there for the

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.860
release of political prisoners,
and there was a

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.760
massive release.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.940
But there still are political
prisoners in jail, and they're

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.190
not political prisoners,
because they are in for

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.590
criminal violations.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.240
And it's very hard to separate
those criminal charges were

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.980
used essentially for
political reasons.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.260
The country's changing, and the
question is, I think-- and

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.100
by way, feel free to interrupt
and ask questions, in fact, I

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.070
prefer that--

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.650
why did this country change?

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.200
You're aware that Aung San Suu
Kyi was in 15 years of house

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.830
arrest, and suddenly
she's released.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.100
And why did this happen?

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.630
Well, I think it happened
because

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.400
of a number of reasons.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.770
I think it's economic, I think
the military was interested in

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.390
doing business with the West,
and I think the West was dying

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.140
to do business with Burma.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.960
Before, Burma's main trading
partner with China, also

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.290
Thailand and India, but Burma
has a 1,200 mile border with

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.660
China, and so Western
companies have been

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.850
essentially drooling now
trying to get in.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.910
They've got their sights set on
60 million people who are

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.890
going to buy toothpaste, and

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.600
television sets, and computers.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.600
I think also the Burmese
military was nervous about the

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.720
Chinese influence.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.150
I think also that the generals
wanted to be free to travel,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.410
and I think the generals wanted
to send their kids to

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:53.340
Cornell, so it's a combination
of all these factors that

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.960
caused, essentially,
the opening up.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.290
And when I was there in the
beginning, there was

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.400
essentially one internet portal,
you know, and it could

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.270
be pulled at any time.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.830
I couldn't get onto the Cornell

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.360
server to get my email.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.330
Interestingly enough, Google
Mail worked, Gmail worked.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.390
I don't know why.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.420
It was really an exception.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.100
And if you wanted to go to an
internet cafe, if you were

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.170
Burmese you had to register, you
had to give them your home

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.180
address, the name of
your school, the

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.880
name of your teacher.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.890
But what's interesting is that,
and there were walls

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.470
everywhere, but the kids
understood about proxy

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.049
servers, and so they were
downloading country and

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.049
Western music.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:41.659
In other words, the wall was
porous, information was coming

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.420
in, so this is not
North Korea.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.680
This is, you know, somewhere
between the West, and

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.850
somewhere between North
Korea, potentially.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.560
So there was internet, and
of course now it's

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.580
really opening up.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.660
So there's these two views, by
the way, of where is the

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.380
country going.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.830
Is it moving to democracy, or
is it essentially still

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.650
controlled by the military.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:09.470
Well, there was a draft
constitution that was rammed

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.510
through at the time of Nargis,
this cyclone that hit, and

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.450
150,000 people were killed.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:21.770
And the draft constitution
reserved 25% of the seats for

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.630
the military.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.180
In addition to that, the USDA,
which is not the United States

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.060
Department of Agriculture, but
actually a political party,

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.140
many of those people are also
former military, so the

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.760
parliament is very heavily
weighted towards the military.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.560
And Suu Kyi-- there was an
election now, a by-election--

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.640
she only won, in a landslide,
7% of the seats.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.190
And the question really
is, can Aung San

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.980
Suu Kyi affect change?

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.050
The skeptics feel like the
military is still in control.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.860
The optimists feel like
they're on the

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.430
cusp of major democracy.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.380
Suu Kyi cannot become president,
because first of

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:11.270
all, if you have any relative,
if you or any relative have a

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:16.900
British passport, then you can't
run for the presidency.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.210
So there are a big election
coming in 2015, but the real

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.200
question is can Aung San Suu
Kyi run for that president.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.180
I assume you all know who
Aung San Suu Kyi is.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.720
You do?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.550
OK, she's one of the narrators
of our film, and I keep

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.440
running into her.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.510
There was a Film Festival in
Yangon, and I ran into her,

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.090
and I always say, hi,
do you remember me?

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.420
And she says, yes, and then I
ran into her in the plaza.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.550
They were giving an award
to her, and I

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.960
said, hi, how are you?

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.540
And I think she's at this point
now where she thinks I'm

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.370
stalking her, but you have
to admire the woman.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.710
But there are people who really
don't like Suu Kyi, and

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.710
there are American scholars--

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.250
I showed this film at a meeting
of Burmese scholars,

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.740
and there were some
very upset people.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.240
And they're upset because they
feel that Suu Kyi is sort of

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.450
stealing the show, that she's
getting all these awards.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.600
She went to Bangkok before the
president Thein Sein went, and

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.260
he had to cancel his trip.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.050
She's in the United States she's
at the UN, and on the

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.310
other hand, you have to really
admire this woman.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.570
She gave up her family.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.700
She was on house arrest, her
husband was dying, and she had

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.490
to make a choice.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.250
Was she going to leave the
country and see her husband,

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:45.390
or once she left, she
could never go back.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.620
Does she stay, does she go,
and of course she stayed.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.910
She also gave up her children,
essentially, at a very tender

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:57.050
age, so this woman has made
enormous sacrifices.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.830
You know, when I filmed her,
she had just been released.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.270
Our film was just about
finished, and I was furious at

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.950
my editor, because he
was going so slow.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.240
We were working two years on the
editing of this film, and

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.260
I've never worked out
long in a film.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.160
And I was ready to strangle
David Kossack our editor, and

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.310
fortunately I didn't, because
she was released.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.050
Then I flew back, and I had a
rare chance to sit with her

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.500
and interview her.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.480
And I was determined not to
fawn over her, because

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.780
journalists in general tend
to fawn over her,

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.780
and so I didn't fawn.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.650
But I went back later and I
looked at the rushes, and then

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.330
I started fawning.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.670
This woman is very,
very smart.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.150
Unlike most politicians--

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.300
if you interview George Bush
and you ask him A, he'll

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.020
answer with Z, his
prepared thing.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.440
It doesn't matter if it answers
the question or not.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.680
Suu Kyi is very, very smart,
and she's always listening.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.780
And I think I surprised her
a bit, because I asked her

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.940
questions that she didn't
expect, because I

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.500
knew what we needed.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.760
So I started off, for instance,
saying like, tell me

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.460
a little bit about Burma.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.380
And she said, what?

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.650
Yeah, I said, tell me
about the country.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.390
I said, I know you can't
do that in 10 minutes.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.420
She says, I can't do
that in 10 hours.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:19.170
Well, I said, tell me about the
diversity of the country,

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.500
and so actually I knew where we
were going, and fortunately

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.970
we were able to cut her in.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.880
And it almost looks like we shot
her, and then we shot the

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.780
film around her, and of course
that's not the case, but I

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.550
think you have to
be the judge.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.560
She integrates into the film.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.350
Anyhow, she is very
impressive.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.120
She's super smart, and she's
super articulate, and so I

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.930
find it hard to dump
on her, frankly.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.710
But there are real issues in
Burma, and the issues are the

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.570
minority issues.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.620
I don't know if you're
following the news.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.300
There is a war going on with the
Kachin in the north west.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.440
It's a fighting war.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.810
The president has called for a
ceasefire, and said they will

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:01.840
not attack any more.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.740
In the meanwhile, gunships are
going in, and attacking the

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.640
Kachin, and so it shows you the
military is running the

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.530
show, not the president.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.200
There has been a major problem
with the Rohingya in the

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.330
Rakhine state, and the Rakhine
state is sort of over here.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.560
The Kachin are up here,
and the Rakhine are

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.920
somewhere over there.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:29.980
And in the Rakhine state there's
a minority called the

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:36.390
Rohingya, and they are Muslims,
and a Burmese woman

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.180
was raped by six Muslims.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:45.290
And this started a massive
retaliation on both sides, and

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.020
the net result has been tens of

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.650
thousands of Rohingya displaced.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.590
The Burmese, interestingly
enough, do not think of the

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.560
Rohingya as Burmese, or
Myanmar, residents.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.180
They originally came from
Bangladesh, and some of them

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.110
have been there for
hundreds of years.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:10.100
They are actually stateless,
and they cannot send their

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.910
children to school, they can't
own land, and here's where we

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.660
start to come into one
of the real problems.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.690
A friend of mine who runs an
NGO, or did a big one in

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.570
Burma, said that Suu Kyi had a
choice, and she could have

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:31.150
either been sort of a moral
force, like Bishop Tutu, or a

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:36.350
politician, and she chose
to become a politician.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.530
And as a result of that, you
know you get dirty when you're

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.490
a politician, and you're
making compromises.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.320
Suu Kyi has asked about the
Rohingya, and she has really

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.320
not commented on them at all.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.470
Here is a woman who has really
fought for human rights, but

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.310
has steered clear of this,
because it's a hot potato.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.230
The Burmese, there's this
enormous hatred for the

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:04.060
Rohingya, and this is a case
where she wants to run for

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.160
office, and run for president
potentially, and if she makes

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.720
a statement about the Rohingya,
she's going to lose

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.860
a part of the electorate.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:17.240
So she could have stayed above
the fray, and she decided to

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.890
get into it, and I think now
you're seeing sort of the

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.140
fissures that are occurring.

00:16:24.816 --> 00:16:27.000
There have been a number
of minority wars.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.110
The longest civil war on earth
was with the Karen, which are

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.320
a Christian group, essentially
in the eastern part of Burma,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.550
and there is a ceasefire now.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.750
But in 1949, General Aung San,
the father of Aung San Suu

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:47.670
Kyi, managed to pull most of
the minorities together at

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.250
this Panglong conference.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:55.820
And they agreed that they would
work for independence

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.020
from the Brits, and later on,
you know, they would form a

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.750
federation.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.220
The question really is now
whether Aung San Suu Kyi can

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.280
hold this country together
with its 130 languages.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:08.839
It's amazing.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:14.010
If you go up towards the Golden
Triangle in the north,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.150
in the-- have to just check my
directions here-- in the

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.920
northeast, you can be dealing
with a tribal group, and go

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.960
over the hill and they speak a
totally different language.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.900
They can't even speak
to one another.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.140
How do you hold a country like
this together is probably the

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.290
big question.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.410
When you speak about the
military, by the way, the

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.520
tendency is to think of it as
being monolithic, but the

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.230
truth of the matter is it is not
monolithic, that there are

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.740
some very progressive
generals.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:51.040
So there are fissures within the
military also, so although

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.290
the military does control
things, it is

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.060
not a single body.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:59.800
And one of the problems, of
course, with the opening up

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.060
is, essentially, resources.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.650
The resources are controlled by
the military and by their

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.930
cronies, and one wonders
what's going to

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.260
happen in the future.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.410
In other words, if you owned
all these resources, or you

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:21.670
had control, would you be
prepared to give it up, and I

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.290
think I know the
answer to that.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.800
Yes, a good question.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.410
I think you're talking about the
cyclone in August that hit

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.800
in 2008, right?

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.360
What effect did that have on
the country opening up?

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.470
I don't know, but I heard that
the-- this is hearsay--

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.980
that Thein Sein, who became
president, was down there at

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:49.390
the time, and people say for
him it was life changing,

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:54.350
seeing the situation where
150,000 people died.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:59.150
At the time of the cyclone, the
military would not let in

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.580
relief supplies, which were
right there, essentially, in

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.070
Thailand, and the United States
wanted to offload

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.030
ships, and they wouldn't
let anybody in.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.990
I don't know.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.750
The military is not
transparent.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.800
You just don't know what
they're thinking.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.900
They do not share any
information whatsoever, so a

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.550
lot of what goes on is really
conjecture about where their

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.320
heads are at.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.240
AUDIENCE: Do these state
boundaries correspond to the

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.060
ancient kingdoms?

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.840
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN:
Oh my god.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.900
That's a hard question,
because there

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.370
were ancient kingdoms.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.230
There is one kingdom that went
not just here, but it went all

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.630
the way to Ayutthaya
in Thailand.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:41.210
I think that actually this
boundary is, and any historian

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:46.300
can correct me, it is not Iraq
that was put together,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.450
essentially, by the British.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:51.450
I think these are sort of
natural boundaries.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:52.790
Any other questions, done?

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.180
Yes?

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.290
You'll have to walk.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.490
Good.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.935
AUDIENCE: So I watched
the film the other

00:19:59.935 --> 00:20:01.700
day, and it was amazing.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.730
I know that some people's faces
were blurred out because

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.150
of concerns for their safety,
but other people's weren't, so

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.200
I was just wondering.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.820
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: Well the
ones that weren't blurred out

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.640
are all now in jail or dead.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.890
I'm joking.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.790
Well, I blurred out the ones
that I thought were at risk.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.630
For instance, people on the
street, if you just shoot them

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.490
it's fine, children are
basically innocent.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:32.150
You know, when I've done films
before, I like to have stars,

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.270
as I call them.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.490
In other words, I wanted
follow a family.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.440
I couldn't follow a family,
because whoever I followed

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.710
would end up being arrested,
so this was a very

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.150
hard film to do.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.230
In other words, how do
you do a film and not

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.420
have stars in it?

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.100
And what we decided is that
the country was the star,

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.860
basically, and I was very, very
worried about the people

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.580
who worked with me,
who helped me.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.040
You saw in the film, I got in
trouble in a number of cases,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.750
and I was worried about the
Burmese who were actually

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.310
working with me and
helping me.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.450
I was teaching film there.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.270
I was working with young film
directors, and when I would go

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.120
to film, I would make it a point
of always asking them to

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.570
disappear, and then
meet them later.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.650
I was standing on the street--

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.550
I like to shoot crowds coming
at me, so I wanted people

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.190
ebbing around me, so I planted
myself on a busy street and

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.600
started shooting.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.020
And then some woman passed me,
and tapped me three times on

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.990
the shoulder and disappeared,
and then I knew I was in

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.580
trouble, so I quickly wrapped
up and just took off.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.010
Nowadays, you can go in
and you can film,

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.150
crews are going in.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.360
But at that time--

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.570
I got in trouble for
filming vegetables.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.540
I mean, it's bizarre.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.200
I got in trouble for filming the
National Library, and as

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.940
you see in the film, this guy
keeps asking me to identify

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.450
myself, and we wanted to know
my name, and want to have my

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.300
name card, and what's your name,
what's your name, and he

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.970
kept going.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.300
And I finally told him my name,
it's Shel Frequolm, and

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.230
I come from Stockholm, Sweden,
and I'm staying in the Park

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.450
View Summit, which was the other
of town, and I took off.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.040
So I think they'll still looking
for Shel Frequolm.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.090
I think that the big question is
like, what's the future of

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.840
the country now?

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.360
Where is it going to go?

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.505
Is consumerism going
to take off?

00:22:28.505 --> 00:22:30.930
Are these people going to
lose their culture?

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.700
Is it going to become sort of
Bangkok, or is there really a

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.410
sense of culture and history
where they can

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.780
preserve all that.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.460
Yes, question?

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.360
AUDIENCE: Would you be
safe going back to

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.780
Myanmar to do more?

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.190
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: Would
I be safe going back?

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.090
I don't know.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:50.090
I tried to show the film at the
American Center, and the

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.590
Americans did not
want to show it.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.250
They were very nervous, and this
is after the opening up,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.280
so I showed it at the British
Council, which is part of the

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.600
British embassy, and I showed
it one night, and the place

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.650
was packed with Burmese.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.140
And I left the next morning at
6:00 AM, and I haven't been

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.220
back, so I can't answer
that question.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.670
But I did meet Thein Sein's
personal representative in the

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.900
United States, and I gave him
a DVD, and I didn't even in

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.955
charge him the $29.95,
so I don't know.

00:23:17.955 --> 00:23:19.090
Yeah, I don't know.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.590
AUDIENCE: Could you imagine
update the movie?

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.860
Would that make any sense?

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.770
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN:
Yeah, updating.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:23.980
I've thought about it.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.116
Are you willing to fund it?

00:23:26.116 --> 00:23:26.580
AUDIENCE: Google will.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.260
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN:
Google will fund it.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.800
I'm headed to North Korea.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.190
That's my next film.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.340
Seriously if I could
do that, yeah.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.850
I did the second most isolated
country, and I think that

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:40.260
there's a need to have some
sort of perspective on the

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.420
situation in North Korea.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.380
It's gotten a little hysterical,
as you're probably

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.040
aware, and so I feel like,
oh, that would be a

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.790
neat place to go.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:52.490
There are real environmental
problems that exist in Burma.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.340
First of all, the timber
is being cut.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.240
These are the last of the
great teak forests, and

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.130
they're being cut down, and it's
not sustainable, and the

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.980
logging is illegal.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.980
Inle Lake, you'll see this
beautiful lake in the movie,

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.440
and they grow tomatoes on it.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.460
They have floating vegetable
gardens.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.140
Essentially, the detritus
washes down from the

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.180
mountains, and it floats, and
they have tomato plants, and

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.920
you get to them with a boat,
and you can work on them.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.480
The trouble, it's all beautiful,
but they're using

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.440
pesticides, and the lake is
seriously polluted, so that's

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.150
one environmental concern.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.920
There's a big project
in the works.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.560
There is a Thai-Italian company
that is prepared to

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.490
develop Dawei.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.320
It is going to be a development
which is four

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.710
times the size of Manhattan.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.530
It's petrochemical.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:58.030
There are going to be roads
linking Dawei with Thailand.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.790
The Chinese are building a
railroad, which will go from

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.000
Dawei up into Yenon.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.410
Dawei is situated in such a
place where boats coming can

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.080
avoid the Straits of Malacca.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.730
It's a fast run to China, and
so why are they doing this.

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:18.020
Why are the Thais involved
building Dawei?

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.770
Well, because of pollution
controls in Thailand.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.180
They can get away with much
more than they could in

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.790
Thailand, and if you've been
in Thailand, then you

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:27.350
understand.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.790
Been in Bangkok and know what
the pollution is like there,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:35.590
you can see that this is just
a disaster in the making.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.950
The Chinese are building
dams on--

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.360
there was a big project, the
Myitsone dam, which was going

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.070
to be built by the Chinese, and
it has been put on hold.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.050
Or I don't know if it's been
canceled or not, but there are

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.590
other dams going in.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.290
There's been really popular
uprising against these dams.

00:25:56.005 --> 00:25:57.500
What's the future
of the country?

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.240
Well, the country really needs
experts, and not just Western

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.070
experts, but it needs Burmese
who know what's going on, and

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.760
can speak the language.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.230
And there are huge Burmese
communities here

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.170
in the United States.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.150
The people there are educated.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:21.900
They know banking, they know
medicine, but the question is,

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.830
will they come back?

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:29.570
The military has a get out of
jail for free card, but the

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.170
dissidents don't.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.280
And the dissidents who've
lived here in the United

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:38.970
States, and the Burmese who
have fled here for asylum,

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.760
they have families, they have
children, they have houses and

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.360
cars, the kids go to school.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.370
Are they prepared to give up
that and return, so that's a

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:47.370
big question mark.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.820
The whole country really,
as I see it, is a

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.640
big question mark.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.340
I'd like to show you some
outtakes which didn't make it

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.740
into the film.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.580
If you decide to go during the
rainy season, this is what it

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.610
looks like.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.760
When it rains in Burma
it pours, literally.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.990
This is just an ordinary
rainfall, and the rainy season

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.020
runs from essentially--

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.885
I think it starts in June
and runs up to the fall.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.925
I think you get the idea.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.380
Do you want to go
to orphanages?

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.580
All right, so where are
we going, tell me.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.870
You're my driver today, huh?

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.015
I have a high class driver.

00:27:46.015 --> 00:27:46.360
DRIVER: Yeah.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.940
We are heading to the outskirts
of Rangoon, south of

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.620
Rangoon, the city called
[? Kyauktan. ?]

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.060
[? Kyauktan ?] is a southern
district of the Rangoon.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:59.740
It has also been ravished by
the storms, cyclone Nargis,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.490
that this area.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:04.000
But our idea is to go
to the orphanage.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.420
This orphanage is run by a
Buddhist monk, and they told

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.730
me that they have 300
orphans there.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.910
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN:
This is really uncut

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:17.860
footage, in a sense.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.140
It's not the polished.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.910
DRIVER: Some are from the
southern Shan state, some are

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.730
from the Kachin state,
some are Kayin state.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.690
They have been orphaned by
various reason, because their

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:38.760
mothers have died, or they have
been starved, of there's

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.125
nobody to care for them.

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:28:50.235 --> 00:28:52.170
TRANSLATOR: Mostly we
have battles in

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.024
the border line area.

00:28:55.024 --> 00:28:59.227
That's one of the reasons that
we come to an orphanage.

00:28:59.227 --> 00:29:01.050
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: Are the
mothers killed too, or just

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:01.527
the fathers?

In other words, they

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.145
raise their own food.

00:29:39.145 --> 00:29:39.640

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.630

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:41.125
That's right.

00:29:41.125 --> 00:29:42.470
Right, right, right.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.020
Sometimes, some of the foods
have been donated by the local

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.080
community there, but
it is not enough.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.240
For that amount of children, you
need some donations from

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.560

from foreign countries.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.620

working in the fields
to get their food.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.000
So they have to go into the

plantations and bean
plantations.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.960

DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: So one
of the themes that you keep

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:41.260
running into, of course, is
education, and the education

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.880
system was wrecked.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.490
Originally, Burma had
the top universities

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:48.640
in Southeast Asia.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.650
Everybody came to
Burma to study.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.370
I went to dinner with somebody,
and we were talking,

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:59.610
and I kept on having to
say what, what, what.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.420
You know, I just couldn't
understand what they were

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.800
saying, and finally I said, by
the way, what do you do for a

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.610
living, and he said,
I teach English.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.820
And as you see in the movie,
the educational system is

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.250
rote, basically, and the people
teaching in the schools

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.955
English don't speak English.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.790
Probably the most pressing thing
for Burma right now is

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:24.950
essentially rebuilding the
educational system.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.230
I think it's almost more
important than food at this

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:32.460
point, so--

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:32.900
pardon?

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.800

DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN:
Yeah, please.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.050
AUDIENCE: The education system
was actually stopped at one

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.200
point in the '80s, where all
the schools were stopped.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.470
I have cousins and stuff that
were on their last year

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.640
graduating with master's in
computer science and stuff,

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.650
and they literally had to drop
out of school, had nowhere to

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:53.040
go, and joined shipping
companies, climbing 100 foot

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.550
poles to make ends meet.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.580
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: My
understanding is that from

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.940
what my Burmese friends
at the university,

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.320
bribery gets you there.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.270
And also at the high school, the
teachers supposedly teach,

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.502
but then you have to hire
them after school.

00:34:10.502 --> 00:34:13.185
AUDIENCE: I was just
there in January.

00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:17.500
I was there for new year, and
Yangon felt like it was--

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.020
I mean, the only infrastructure
there was built

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.560
by the British, otherwise there
wasn't infrastructure.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.440
So, I mean, to what extent they
invested, that's what's

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.900
in the country.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.190
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: Yeah, but
I think it's very limited

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.850
what they did.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.190
I mean, there's some buildings
in Yangon that are built by

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.170
the British, but generally if
you travel around the country,

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.440
the British didn't
do that much.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.840
AUDIENCE: And then I remember
taking the highway down from--

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.310
what is it--

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.270
Mandalay, right from Yangon.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.380
What is the story behind
the highway, exactly?

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.080
I heard numerous facts, but that
it was financed by the

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.400
US, and no-one's ever on it, so
it's like kind of this huge

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.810
piece of infrastructure and but
the Burmese kind of don't

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:58.250
use it or can't use it
because of the tolls.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.770
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: I can't
answer that question, but I

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:03.760
know there's a superhighway
that goes from Yangon, or

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.450
Rangoon, to Naypyidaw, which
is the new capital.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.540
By the way, the Burmese
government took all civil

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.630
servants and moved them to
Naypyidaw, which is sort of

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.240
the Brasilia of Myanmar.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.080
And people think that's bizarre,
but if you look at

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.560
the history of the kings, what
they did is when a new king

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.260
came, they left the old city
and built a new city.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.680
And I think the military must
be thinking of themselves as

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.860
sort of the new kings, and the
military, if you talk to them,

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.000
they feel like they're doing
the right thing.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.650
They're helping the country.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.970
There are holding it together.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.120
Yeah, question.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.480
AUDIENCE: What do you think is
responsible for the density of

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.720
linguistic diversity in Burma?

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.520
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: Oh wow.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:56.996
Well, I'm probably not the guy
to answer it, but I mean,

00:35:56.996 --> 00:35:59.020
there were the original
indigenous

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.210
populations that were--

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.130
whoops, the map is gone.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.980
Anyhow, there was also,
essentially, from Tibet

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.070
populations came down.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.400
There was all this mixing.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.920
I don't really know.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.500
I'm not a linguist.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:17.000
Yeah, anyhow, I'm afraid to
answer that question.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.550
I'm always amazed that
people speak

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.900
different languages, right.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.610
And children growing up invent
their own words, right,

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.200
because we're hardwired
for language somehow.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.920
BRIAN KINDLER: You've got a
pretty interesting audience

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.280
here at Google and on YouTube
who are going to be watching

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.750
this, so where do you think we
could make the biggest impact?

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.780
And I'm not talking like
philanthropy or volunteering,

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:46.680
I'm talking in terms of how we
make, and create, and develop

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.710
our products?

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.540
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: The
Burmese are enormously hungry

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.960
for the outside world.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.330
When I was first there, I was
one of the few Americans in

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.830
the country, and--

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:00.310
oh, I want to show
you something.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.850
Do we have a minute?

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:03.670
Where are you from?

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:06.720
Here, let me show
you something.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.980
Apropos this.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.980
Where are you from, is that--

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.110
BRIAN KINDLER: Where
am I from?

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.600
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: No,
there's one called, well--

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.620
BRIAN KINDLER: Rural
life tribes.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.000
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: Oh,
we don't have it.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.770
BRIAN KINDLER: We
don't have it.

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.820
DR. ROBERT LIEBERMAN: One of the
questions that people kept

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.460
asking me, where are you from,
and I would say, well, where

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.710
do you think I'm from?

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:27.920
And they would say, Germany,
no, Switzerland, no, Italy,

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.740
no, and it would go on and on,
and finally I'd say America,

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.680
and it was like, oh,
from America.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.850
And there just were very, very
few Americans in Burma.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.650
Of course this has completely
changed, right.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.390
By the way, there are
some problems.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.020
Tourists are pouring in faster,
essentially, than the

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.720
country can absorb them.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:54.652
And also, aid money is coming in
almost too fast to be used,

00:37:54.652 --> 00:37:57.780
and all the Western companies
are looking at Burma and

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.050
preparing investments, and so
there's this enormous--

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.040
it's like a cauldron,
essentially it's all just

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.160
bubbling, and the future
is the big mystery.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.830
And I think that information
is empowerment, as I

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:14.530
mentioned, and perhaps Google
can somehow penetrate Burma.
