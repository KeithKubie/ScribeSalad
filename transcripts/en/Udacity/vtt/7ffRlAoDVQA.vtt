00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.730
We just found ourselves considering
the running time of the composition

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.270
of two turning machines.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.010
Think carefully, and give the most
appropriate bound for the running time

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:17.626
of the composition of m, which runs in
time q with N, which runs in time p.

00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:21.880
You can assume that both N and
M read all of their input
