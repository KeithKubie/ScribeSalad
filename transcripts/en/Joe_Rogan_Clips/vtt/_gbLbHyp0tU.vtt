1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.720
What will happen,
the Joe Rogan experience.
And it does seem that a,

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.310
that there is a particular model,

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.850
I want to say condemnation of male energy.

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.990
Do you think you can comes from a misunderstanding?

5
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.290
<v 1>Yeah.
And I also think it comes from a big generalization to yeah,</v>

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.500
it's easy to do,
right?

7
00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:20.140
And if you're a woman who's had negative experiences with men,

8
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.370
maybe have dated man that had been physically abusive or maybe known men that

9
00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:28.960
had been physically abusive and you,
you're around that and you just,
uh,
it's,

10
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.250
it's very convenient and very easy to just generalize and decide that all men

11
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:37.870
are negative,
masculine energy is negative and especially white males.

12
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.920
And if he say that you'll get props online,
people go like,
yes,
girl,
yes,
clap,

13
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:45.490
clap,
clap.
People get excited.
But those are also people that are shortsighted.

14
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.010
Like you want to make as many people,
your allies.
You can,

15
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.900
you want to make as many people,
your friend as you can.

16
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.600
And you have to understand that there's some people that are just wired

17
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:53.680
different than you.
There's some,

18
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.670
there's some girly girls and there's some really feminine men.

19
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.270
And then there's some masculine men and then it,

20
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.600
but everybody is okay as long as they respect you and they're kind to each
other.

21
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.340
But the problem is we associate certain behaviors and characteristics with

22
00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:14.341
either negativity or hedonism or a toxic masculinity or someone being a bitch as

23
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:19.420
a man.
And that's,

24
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.460
these generalizations are often way more harmful and just it's just too

25
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.530
convenient and easy and lazy.

26
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.030
<v 0>Yeah,
there is no simple way.</v>

27
00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:30.700
And when I think about my own attitudes in this area,

28
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:33.370
there is a degree of complexity because I've got young daughters,

29
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:38.200
I've got a two year old and a one year old,
right.
And there,
you know,
daughters,

30
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.220
so like,
but when they have a day,
um,
cause I'm staying in Los Angeles,
Gabby,

31
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:43.580
she's Mexican.
She used to be,

32
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:46.720
when I first moved out here and lived in my entourage lifestyle,

33
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:50.500
she used to look after the house and she used to think,
oh my baby,
my baby,

34
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:51.790
she loved me.
So,
and I'm like,

35
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:54.310
I'll take a matriarchal figure wherever I can find one.

36
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:56.320
And Gabby used to look after me,
she adored me and stuff.

37
00:01:56.321 --> 00:02:00.460
I stayed friends with her yesterday.
She come around,
she bought like a like,

38
00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:04.460
well I can only describe as a bikini for light.
My baby daughter,
I like that.

39
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.130
What a two year old that doesn't need like a,
like a bikini like top and I,

40
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:11.830
excuse me burping on the mic.
I like it.
For me,

41
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:14.110
I felt like I don't want to put my daughter in that,

42
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:19.111
that sort of in a way sexualizing the like that child and like coverage and also

43
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:23.530
a lot of the time like with my daughter,
I don't live with my wife,

44
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.620
particularly if our first child I'm like don't dress her up in little dresses

45
00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:29.500
and stuff because she won't be out of like run around.
And I thought my God,

46
00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:29.741
I'm not,

47
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:34.740
that's not that different from like the cliche of a male parent that wanted his

48
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.030
son and I didn't want to sign.
There would be no in particular.

49
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.610
I've loved this kid.
I love this kid regard.
You know,

50
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.800
it doesn't mean I love having the door adore her,

51
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.160
but like I am aware that these things of like dress a child this way,

52
00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:48.640
dress a girl this way.

53
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.930
Our constructs fervor to what we were talking about again before about Michelle

54
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.500
Foodco we've got a lot done before we went live man.

55
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.300
But when we were talking about Michelle Fuoco,

56
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.330
what he exposes a lot is that there and a delusion guilt to lose is that a lot

57
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:04.540
of things that we take for granted as being normal or actually constructs and

58
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.640
when I say a child's bikini,

59
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.810
but there's no reason for at any child of any sex or gender to be wearing a

60
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:11.750
bloody bacchanal.

61
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.130
So a child with tits is a terrifying idea per for all but a very small and

62
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.780
terrifying percentage of the population.

63
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.910
So like that is an example of the external feminization of a child.

64
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:27.940
Like say when there's an argument of feminist argument of you know,

65
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.680
gender is a construct.
I can see,
oh yeah.
To a point is there is,

66
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.340
there are constructs cannot,
like my opinion is you can't argue with biology.

67
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:40.500
Chromosomes are doing what they're doing in the physical realm.
But like a,
I,

68
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.811
you know,

69
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:45.811
like being a father to a daughter has made me feel like I don't obviously,

70
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.570
and I know you have daughters or at least they thought three,
three doors.

71
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.330
Like I like,
I'm certainly very aware of,

72
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.960
I don't want to push them down some culturally prescribed avenue,

73
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:59.290
whether it's about their dress,
their sexuality or anything.
So I've got,
you know,

74
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.360
where do I,
where am I on that dial?
You know?

75
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.241
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:07.241
You got to just not put any pressure on them and let them enjoy their life and

77
00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:11.000
let them find their path.
That's what,
it's weird.
It's weird,
right?

78
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:14.870
It's like I see people,
they're,
you know,
they're getting their,

79
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.640
their daughters to dress very,

80
00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:20.690
very feminine with a little mini skirts and stuff when they're five years old

81
00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:23.630
and high heel shoes.
I've seen little kids with high heel shoes.

82
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.300
It was very strange to me.
I don't like it.

83
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.790
<v 0>Yeah.
What,
so you know,</v>

84
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.340
but for me that is being sourced from like of we can extrapolate that to then

85
00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:35.100
why should a 20 year old woman wear high heels?

86
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.950
I mean I've read cultural analysis,
I'm sure you have of law.

87
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.660
Well the lipstick is to emphasize the lips because it's rather than of the

88
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:43.494
vagina.

89
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.090
The high heels is to make a woman see more vulnerable and to accentuate aspects

90
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:50.010
of body shape.
And then this can be,
you know,

91
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:53.670
seen as evidence of the influence of Patriarchy that there's loads of areas

92
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:56.700
where I feel like,
why are we looking for shit to argue about in this area?

93
00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:58.320
We're just human beings.
Most of us,

94
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.990
the most important people in our life up of the,

95
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.840
of the diff or a different gender or sex to us.
You know,

96
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.000
why we look for arguments,
but I can,

97
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.100
you can see the influence of cultural forces that are,
you

98
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.550
<v 1>know,
not neutral.
Yeah,
you certainly can.</v>

99
00:05:13.551 --> 00:05:16.970
But I think it should be up to the choice of the person once they're an adult.

100
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.090
The real problem is putting pressure on them to dress one way or another.

101
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.780
And not letting them find their place.
But if a woman becomes,
you know,

102
00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:27.560
whatever age you decide and she wants to wear high heels and a skirt because she

103
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:30.450
likes the way it looks like,
there's nothing wrong with that either.
And are,

104
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.850
are the demonization of sexuality is also a problem.
You know the,

105
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:36.470
yeah,

106
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.470
it is almost as much of a problem as people who will pray upon vulnerable

107
00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:44.780
people.
The,
the p people,

108
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.620
people that think there's something wrong with being sexually attractive or

109
00:05:48.621 --> 00:05:51.860
something wrong with being desirable or wanting to be desirable.

110
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.260
There's nothing wrong with that either.
And that kind of suppression,

111
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.430
the suppression of these feelings that you and this desire that you have,

112
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.510
it's very unhealthy as well.
It's a normal thing to want to be sexual.

113
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.900
It's a normal thing to want to look good.
If a girl looks good in a skirt,

114
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.570
a skirt,
and high heels and she likes to dress like that,

115
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.690
who the fuck is anyone to say there's anything wrong with that?

116
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.380
There's nothing wrong with it.
It's,
if that's what she likes,
that's fine.

117
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.660
Which isn't what's interesting to me is particularly um,

118
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.040
in really progressive ideology.

119
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.550
They look down upon women who wear short skirts and high heels and a lot of

120
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:31.280
makeup and you know,

121
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.610
open tops that show their boobs because they think that it's,

122
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:39.410
they're playing into the patriarchy or that there's somehow or another falling

123
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:41.030
into these gender traps,

124
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.370
but yet they celebrate that in transgender people they celebrate that and Trans

125
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.600
men that transitioned to women and then they,
they,
they really doll it up.

126
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.950
Then they're like,
you go girl.

127
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.490
Then they're celebrating the fact that this person is embracing these

128
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:59.590
traditional aspects of womanhood.
Will you see that a lot with,
you know,

129
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.430
people that are celebrating Trans Women.
So I find very fascinating

130
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.430
<v 0>the aesthetics of a,</v>

131
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:11.431
that sort of what would be perhaps could be referred to as sexualized dress or

132
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.020
like a it I suppose in males express expression,
expressive or Garish clothing,

133
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.120
jewelry,
tattoos in.

134
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.650
I understand in British culture that these are often indicators of class that

135
00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:28.651
like that it's typically the lower down the clown class structure you are,

136
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:33.901
the more likely you are to dress in a way to exhibit if or like you know women

137
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.040
from a blue collar background dress in ways that are exposing reveal in men have

138
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:42.030
Larry cars and lots of tattoos and jewelry,

139
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.590
expressive ways of demonstrating wealth.

140
00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:46.510
The higher you go up the class the more subtle,

141
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:49.810
the more dressed down you know labels or that sort of stuff.
You know.

142
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.710
So in British culture there's a different system of like a different system for

143
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:54.371
referencing it.

144
00:07:54.371 --> 00:07:58.510
I wonder how that works in American culture with its sort of like it's evident

145
00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:02.170
and much discuss racial divisions let certain things,

146
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:07.290
it seems like a subtle way of condemning particular types of womanhood that may

147
00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:11.710
not just be sourced from dress this way for the male gaze.

148
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.220
It can also be a way of saying dressing that way as an indication of a lower

149
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:19.860
class background or of a particular type of ethnicity if there.

150
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.220
But there's also,
so

151
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.760
<v 1>the reality of males and females is there's a lot of fucking jealous people and</v>

152
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:30.320
there's a lot of women that just don't have the type of physical body that looks

153
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:34.220
good in a short skirt with high heels and you know,

154
00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:38.960
a low cut shirt and they don't like when they see it in other women because they

155
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:40.860
don't,
they're not comfortable with their own bodies there.

156
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.710
That there's a reality of that.
I mean,

157
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:45.950
women get as much or more hate from women as they ever do for men.

158
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.250
And particularly if women find you to be too overtly sexual with the way you

159
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:56.970
dress or behave,
that you're,
you're,
you know,
you're damaging male,

160
00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:01.110
female relationships,
you're damaging the dynamic particular office dynamics.

161
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.440
If there's one girl in the office that likes to tramp it up,
you know,

162
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:07.440
and she's a,
and all the guys are paying attention to her,

163
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:08.400
women will get mad at her.

164
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.700
<v 0>I,
um,</v>

165
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.530
did an interview a while ago where I sort of talks about like pet parent in our

166
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:17.020
kids,
me and my wife have a parent,
our kids.
And I said like,
uh,
you know,

167
00:09:17.021 --> 00:09:21.090
it goes well,
I'll have to be a nice,
my wife is much the more dominant parent,

168
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.240
she's much more practical than I am.
Right.
And like,

169
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:27.590
stuff that got that got like really negatively written about poops set your

170
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:31.670
black coco.
She changes more diapers than I do and stuff.
Right?
I say,
look,

171
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.250
I don't change diapers or wherever.
It's just my wife,
you know,

172
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.200
regardless of our respective sexy is the more efficient dominant parents.

173
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:44.250
She's much more likely with like with me,
if my dog goes,
I want that chocolate.

174
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.500
The answer to for me is,
okay,
all right.
You know,
like,
I can't bear to see the,

175
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.470
the resistance,
the emotional exposure,
not concede much too early.

176
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.530
I tap out very quickly with,
with my two year old,

177
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.020
my wife is much more know that it's played a long game.

178
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.900
Let's bring up a child that's not governed by impulses like you.

179
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:04.350
And I spoke in fact to that gap or Matt Ada expert on addiction.
He's amazing.

180
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.460
And he says,
because of your own anxiety and pain from your own childhood,

181
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.860
with no disrespect to my magnificent parents,
uh,

182
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.370
like you can't handle seeing your kid suffer.

183
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:17.880
So you'd like straight away you bail and do what she wants and stuff.

184
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:18.511
Now they have like,

185
00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:23.511
so there's so much complexity in the reality of our personal little domestic

186
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:24.510
relationship.

187
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.050
I'm certainly will not saying and everyone else should run their households in

188
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:31.980
that manner as well.
So help me God,
any man that changes it up,
you know?

189
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.870
But the way it was reported is like,

190
00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:37.380
that's what happens I think in modern media is they change what you say,

191
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:41.130
then you have to defend what they said.
You sit and you feel that in white men,

192
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.010
I'd like,
you know,
I'm not saying that that because my wife is a woman,

193
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.480
she should take more domestic.
Gee,

194
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.270
I'm just saying that in our household she seems to have a set of attributes and

195
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:52.620
characteristics that make her take control of that aspect of parenting.

196
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.080
And it's like the,
the desire to judge,

197
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:59.580
condemn an object is the priority as opposed to,
yeah,

198
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:02.480
no one's looking to go on.
Yeah.
Who cares or what,
yeah.
