00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.130
Well, thank you so much fine

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.559
It's certainly an honor for me to give a talk here at the Royal institution. I'm well aware of the

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.090
many

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.349
fantastic

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.349
lectures that you've had here going back to

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.189
Faraday in

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.209
1856 so it's an honor for me to be here

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.529
And thank Martin very much for his

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.649
Introduction I can say that

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.128
working with Martin has been one of the great privileges of my life and

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.399
And so it's a particular

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:58.259
Pleasure for me that he's able to be here today and as you'll see Martin plays an important role in the story

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.670
I'm going to tell tonight. It's a story about the cold war it's a story about a high school science project and

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.979
It's a story about how a generation of astronomers both theoreticians and observers together finally one

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.670
hard-Won

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.670
understanding of how the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.830
Galaxies in the universe are arranged what the architecture of the universe is and this story starts with

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.879
Edwin Hubble, and this is a picture of the

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.679
Rosette Nebula, this is a gas cloud in our own galaxy

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.209
It's five thousand light years away, so lights them coming to us at

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.820
300,000 kilometers a second

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.390
For five thousand years. It's forming stars here in the middle. I put the eclipsed Moon here in the foreground

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.110
It doesn't go anywhere near this but I just put this in the foreground to show you the angular scale of this you say

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600
Why didn't I notice this thing in the sky?

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.079
Bigger than the moon well, it's very very faint as an answer, okay next. Oh

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.359
This is another nebula. This is the andromeda Nebula

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.348
It's also bigger than the moon in the sky you can see this with your naked eye

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.499
Is the Central brightest portions in a really dark night?

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.250
this many people thought this might be a

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.940
just another gas cloud in our galaxy, but

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.209
hubble found very Faint variable stars of A known types if it variables in this galaxy

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.029
Which proved that it was very very far away?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.340
much further away

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.780
So that it was outside of our own galaxy and in fact

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.320
Given its angular size and the distance of it

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.740
It was actually similar in size to our own galaxy

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.770
So this was no little gas cloud this was an entire Galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.479
Just like our own, and it has two satellite galaxies as well, so this opened our

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.709
eyes to the to the world of galaxies

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:12.479
and there was of course other other spiral nebulae like this that were smaller an angler size it must be further and farther away, so

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:21.510
hubble started measuring and this is this is our best picture today taken with a hubble space telescope named after him and

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.299
this is the hubble Ultra deep field and

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.139
again superimposed the Moon and Mars

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.749
And saturn in front of him. So what a tiny region of the sky we're looking at here

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.040
And this whole ultra deep field is about ten thousand galaxies in it

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.690
everything you see in here is a

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.940
Galaxy and the little Faint ones the tiny ones here these are about 13 billion light years away, and

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.380
So the if you multiply the area of the sky that we're seeing here

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.229
To cover the whole sky you can see that the within the range of the hubble space telescope

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:07.079
Are about a hundred and thirty billion other galaxies and the question is will hire those galaxies

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.760
arranged

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.849
Now hubble was not finished he discovered something else he discovered that

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.089
the further away galaxies were

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.899
the faster they were moving away from us and

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.479
You can tell the velocity of a galaxy by looking at the shift of its spectral lines if it's moving away

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.509
Those lines are going to be redshifted you can measure that and you could determine the velocity?

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.509
So he found that the red ships he found that the red shifts of these

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.769
Galaxies were getting larger and larger as he was going further and further away and in fact me and Humiston in 1931

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:51.819
found

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.819
galaxies moving away from us at

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.599
20,000 kilometers a second which is an extraordinarily high speed. This is a uniform expansion

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.069
it's like

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:11.069
Raisins raisin bread baking in the oven as the bread gets bigger the raisins move further apart and a more distant raisin

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.979
From your raisin is going to be moving away from you faster, because there's more bread in between the two of you

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.169
So this is a linear homogeneous

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.520
Expansion that hubble has discovered and it's this figure in

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.969
1931 that caused Einstein convinced Einstein that the universe was really

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.060
expanding

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.779
Now there was a ready explanation for this at the time

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.909
in 1922

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.210
Friedman had published a solution of exact solution of Einstein's

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.749
equations of General relativity his theory of

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.269
Curved space-time to Explain gravity and this was a universe model

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.639
It looked like a football and it started with a big bang at the bottom and then

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.599
we're plotting one dimension of time this way and

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:11.399
Space is one dimension around the circumference of this and the only thing that's real here is the pigskin itself

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.430
Forget the outside and forget the inside

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.139
This is a curved surface and the galaxies world lines are going to follow the seams in the football

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.979
they're going as straight as they can in this curved surface and

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:33.779
Their mass is causing the curvature in the football shape and it's causing them to slow down and eventually

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:37.889
Collapse of the big crunch you do not want to be around this to big crunch

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.440
But we'd be living here in this model where the universe is expanding and so

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.799
This is because the space is stretching. It's not expanding into anything, but it's just getting

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.500
bigger

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.880
George Gamow in 1948

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.820
Pointed out that

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:04.649
If you extrapolated this back to the past the universe would become very dense and very hot and there's hot

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.759
radiation should still be bouncing around in the universe today and

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.469
He and his students Herrmann and Alf Herrmann and alpher

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.750
so said that you should still be able to see it today and

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.310
this in fact was discovered by penzias and Wilson in

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.070
1965 and it proved that the universe started with the early hot big bang

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:34.769
and I worked for penzias and Wilson as a graduate student and I got to run the

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
telescope that detected this

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.639
Background radiation and found its temperature to be two point seven degrees

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.599
And so I would run the telescope at night by myself

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:48.179
And I would occasionally go and look at the moon

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:55.409
And I could see I could see the thermal radiation coming from the moon I could measure the temperature of the moon so the this

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:58.139
discovery of the Microwave background radiation

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.929
really proved that we started with a

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.260
with a hot big bang model

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.510
now

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.959
How are the galaxies arranged in space well people knew that they were in?

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.029
Clusters and here's fritz ZWicky I knew him at Caltech

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23.039
he's probably the premiere investigator of clusters of Galaxies and

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:28.139
This is his catalog of clusters of galaxies

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:36.270
he was quite a character as maybe you've guessed and I would tell you that when the

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.419
Colloquium speakers came to caltech there were there were two people in the audience they feared

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.080
one was Richard Feynman and the other was fritz zWicky

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:54.739
Simon might raise his hand at the end of the can say oh, but that's all its energy conservation doesn't it

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.470
and as lucky as

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:05.749
Lucky would might raise his hand and say I did this already in a paper in 1934 and here's the reference and you know and

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.859
You'd go look up that paper, and he did your paper on that

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.500
1934 so

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.769
Ricky studied the Coma cluster

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.600
this is a

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.799
Every point. This is Likies own drawing. This is

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:28.369
Every point in here is a galaxy. It's a centrally condensed relaxed cluster of galaxies

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.140
It looks rather like a global, er

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:37.790
Cluster of stars this whole cluster is moving away from us at several thousand kilometers a second part of the expansion of the universe

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.850
but there are differences in velocities between

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.069
Galaxies here due to their and measures looking measured by the doppler shift

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:54.020
To show you their orbital motions around the center of mass of the cluster and from this he could determine the mass of the cluster

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.150
And he found to his surprise

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:01.819
That it was several times larger than the mass that could be accounted for by the galaxies

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.680
So he called this extra

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:10.460
Mass Dark matter and we know today that this dark matter must be made of not

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.670
Ordinary Materials Ordinary Matters made of Protons neutrons and electrons and

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:23.540
This has to be made of something else some new form of elementary particle. We haven't yet detected and

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:29.509
we know it's there because we can see it in the mass of the cluster of Galaxies and

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.090
we can also detect it by its gravitational lensing properties of

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.580
background galaxies, and you know zWicky wrote a paper on that in 1937

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:47.059
So we know that dark matter is there and Ricky discovered that in?

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.760
1933

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:55.309
So how is so so here is a cluster of galaxies?

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.040
This is a picture from the sloan digital sky survey

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:03.290
The perseus cluster of galaxies, so we know galaxies are in clusters

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:10.260
This is a picture. How do they form this is actually a picture from Martins and my paper

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.350
1975 and

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.400
it's in the book and

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.350
this is the

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.830
This is what's going on you have a slight density perturbation in the early universe

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:30.359
Tiny fluctuation, and there's excess density because there are excess density in the fluctuation

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:36.869
It's going to it's going to be more gravitational attraction and average in the universe so it's going to decelerate

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:42.030
More than the whole universe does that would be out here out here

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.560
So it's going to be start expanding slower than they do and therefore

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.090
It's going to get denser still than the rest of the universe eventually it's going to turn around

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:59.700
stop expanding collapse back down and relax and form a cluster and then later stuff will fall in and fall and make the

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.659
Envelope this is time going up this way and spaced this way

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:09.180
And then it's very late times even at the present day you may see something falling in now

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:15.479
And this is exactly what andromeda is doing. We live in a local group a small cluster and

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:22.710
and drama has been decelerated by our galaxy and the two of them are falling back together, so this is a

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.670
coming back here

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:32.430
so Galaxy clusters can form from small fluctuations in the early universe and the American school of

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.850
cosmology

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.410
Led by Jim Peebles

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:43.230
So this is what's happening clusters are forming a first galaxies formed by the same mechanism of fluctuation forms

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.839
decelerates collapses and then a

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:52.530
Galaxies will cluster into clusters and then clusters themselves will cluster into Super clusters

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.939
So you have this hierarchical pattern of clustering and so this is like

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.780
meatballs in a low density soup and

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:08.789
and then these are stacked like vacuum cleaners drawing additional material in so you get this meatball soup a

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.040
picture of how the

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:17.820
Of how the galaxies are clustered and this was the this is the picture that the Americans was entertaining

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.900
Meanwhile over in the soviet Union

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:29.129
Zell dovish and his colleagues were spending a completely different picture

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.670
Zold Ovitch

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.949
Said okay well if you had a perfectly spherical reason that could collapse and form a cluster

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.670
But suppose it was irregular suppose suppose. It was a flattened

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:49.019
Sort of a flattened sphere here, how would it collapse it would collapse into pancake first, and he believed that as a gas

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.639
Collapsed into a pancake the density would go way up and as it

00:13:54.190 --> 00:14:00.749
Dissipated energy you could trigger Galaxy formation so he believed that galaxies were formed in

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:07.079
pancakes that you formed the structures first and then the galaxies in the pancake and

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.709
And so how would the pancakes be arranged in space?

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:18.600
geometrically well they would form a giant honeycomb Pattern here there'd be big empty voids here and

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.850
in fact

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.080
Bob Kirchner and his colleagues had found a

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:32.249
Big we're finding a big empty void in the constellation bootes, so so though

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.710
It's believed that galaxies formed on these pancakes

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:41.189
there'd be denser filaments in the edges and then the clusters would be at the at the

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:49.499
corners of these were several of these plates came together and so this was the picture that the

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.110
soviet School

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.130
had

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.240
now

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.060
Why did - why did two schools develop, okay? Well?

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.230
even with Modern

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.030
communications

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.030
the the

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:13.230
Sometimes you just have to travel and pour your ideas right into the other person's ear to convince

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.950
and so

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:22.350
Zukie I mean I was looking but zell dovish was was not able to travel outside the soviet union

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:29.550
Because he'd worked on the nuclear program there and soviet scientists in general did not get to travel outside

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.300
Reunion so you develop these two schools now?

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.360
however

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.610
Martin rees did travel back and forth he was so like Marco polo

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.170
to me and and and so when he invited me to come over to

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:49.379
Cambridge University as a postdoc he told me excitedly all the things that the

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:55.050
Russian school of Cosmology were were coming up with and in our paper

00:15:55.150 --> 00:16:01.800
We tried to marry some of those best ideas from the Russian school and the American school

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.800
Together that's what we were trying to do

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.839
So this is the this is the opposing school now in

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.370
1983

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.860
Though dovish and shunned on and an astro road this important paper

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.660
they let me go back and show you this if you take a

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.629
Of this universe you're expected to show a cellular structure

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:35.460
Okay, and and let me mention that of course. This is in a way exactly the opposite of the American school

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:43.739
In this picture the high-density regions where the galaxies live you'll notice are all in one connected piece

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:50.580
The Honeycomb, but the Voids now are the ones that are that are isolated from each other, so there's one

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.190
High-Density region in many

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.380
isolated loW-density regions

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:02.910
So it's the exact opposite of the American view so here's a slice of two slices that in a still made

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:10.739
Of this observational data here's clusters of galaxies here and and you know you can see the cell

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:17.520
Here and so oh when people looked at this. This was a big support for the

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.480
for the

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:27.240
This picture and so though which also noted that our own virgo Supercluster nearby seemed to have a sort of pancake

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.839
geometry so this was the the picture of the

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.480
from the Russian school

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.720
Now at this time a new theory came along

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.869
This was a guth proposed the theory of inflation

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:47.820
And he proposed that instead of starting with a singularity at the beginning of the universe that was the big bang

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:55.320
He wanted to start it off with a with a brief period Of accelerated expansion which he called

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.460
inflation and

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.300
This gave you a little extra time in here

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.440
for different regions to get in causal contact with each other over what the big bang could offer and

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:15.209
and when the universe was tiny so different regions could communicate with each other and this helped to explain did explain the

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:20.249
Uniformity of the temperature of the microwave background we see when we look in different directions

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.989
something the big bang wasn't able to do in a natural way, so

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:33.420
This this period of accelerators could start it with a very small circumference here. Maybe 10 to the minus 27

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.709
centimeters, and then it had this very rapid accelerated expansion

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.370
this was powered by something we call vacuum a

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.070
high degree of vacuum energy

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.010
What's vacuum energy um?

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.790
a vacuum is

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:49.450
when

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:50.320
you take

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.429
We take first all the people out of the room then we take all the ar out then we take all the light beans going

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.430
Through the room and we just have totally empty space here you

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.329
would figure that that would have a zero density

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.419
But we've discovered now the Higgs particle

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:11.099
Which is associated with a higgs field and the Higgs field permeates

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:19.199
all of space it's what gives particles their mass and the higgs field is capable of producing a

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.329
Nonzero vacuum energy as well as other fields are capable of producing a

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.329
Vacuum energy we sometimes call this dark energy today, so um

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:36.989
The the vacuum itself might have a Nonzero positive energy density

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.810
now in special relativity

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.960
One of the properties you wanted for the vacuum was that it had no unique standard of rest

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:52.410
So if you had two rocket ships going through this vacuum state at different speeds

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:58.409
It would be nice if the rocket ships measured equal energy density so you couldn't tell the difference

00:19:58.409 --> 00:20:02.218
you couldn't tell anything about whether you were at rest or moving or not, so

00:20:02.889 --> 00:20:08.699
but if that's true by the logic of special relativity the only way that that would be possible for

00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:14.578
rockets moving at different speeds to measure the same amount of energy density would be if

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:22.319
The Energy Density was accompanied by a negative pressure of the same magnitude but but opposite inside

00:20:22.899 --> 00:20:26.848
Now this negative pressure is sort of like a universal suction

00:20:27.369 --> 00:20:29.909
But it's uniform so it produces no

00:20:30.609 --> 00:20:36.899
Hydrodynamic effects as you know it takes pressure differences to make the wind blow and knock you over

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:39.059
So we have in this room

00:20:39.399 --> 00:20:45.569
15 pounds per square inch of air pressure, but we don't notice it because it's uniform

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:50.099
and so it has no hydrodynamic effects, but

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:57.838
according to Einstein's equations pressure has a gravitational effect as well as energy density and

00:20:58.119 --> 00:21:00.009
So it's a negative pressure

00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:06.779
So it is a negative or repulsive gravitational effect and it operates in three dimensions

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:12.478
two horizontal dimensions front back left right and the vertical dimension up down

00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:17.549
So the pressure is operating three dimensions the energy density

00:21:18.429 --> 00:21:23.548
therefore is the the repulsive effect of the negative pressure the

00:21:23.889 --> 00:21:28.919
gravitational repulsive effect of the negative pressure is three times as potent as the

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:36.989
gravitational attractive effect of the energy density so the overall effect of this dark Energy is

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:45.299
Repulsive and it causes the universe to start to expand so even if you started it statically it would start to

00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:52.858
Expand and it doubles and doubles and doubles in size once every 10 to the minus 38 seconds or so

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.499
So you know how that goes 1 2 4 8 16 32 64?

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.849
128

00:22:00.849 --> 00:22:02.849
512 1024

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.440
if I did that again

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:11.730
We'd be up to a million so the universe expands by an extremely large factor in a very short period of time

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:17.279
this can explain why the universe is so big it's one of the attractions of the

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.070
inflation theory, so

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:25.499
inflation was a theory that could explain lots of things and

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.450
We we believed in inflation because it explains very well

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.280
the fluctuations that we see in the cosmic microwave background and

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:43.679
We also believe in inflation because we can see a low grade inflation starting to occur at the present epoch

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.680
two teams of astronomers

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.070
discovered that the the

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.970
expansion of the Universe is accelerating today and

00:22:54.490 --> 00:23:01.770
It's accelerating such that it's doubling in size it was going to be doubling in size about once every 12

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.300
12.2 billion years, so this is a very low grade inflation

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.100
There's a very low amount of vacuum energy and in fact it's about

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.180
Corresponds to about

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.310
7 times 10 to the minus 30 grams per cubic centimeter

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.379
it's tiny but it's not enough to have this dynamical effect and

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.769
that we can measure and they won the

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:32.550
Nobel prize in physics for this so we see a low grading form of inflation going on right now

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:40.950
Now now I realized that the theory of inflation one of the other nice things that it has is that

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.890
Things are so small

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.429
First let me mention though let me mention a problem that guth had to solve

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:57.359
Guth wanted the inflation to and right here

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.100
uniformly and and then turned that energy into

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.509
thermal particles to start a hot big bang

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.639
So what he wanted to have happen here was like you have this

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:17.549
Inflating see high density inflating see it's like you'd like to put the pot on the stove

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:23.189
And have it turn to steam all at once. It's the whole pot turn to steam and that would make our big bang

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:30.599
I'm universe that we saw, but he knew that what would happen instead was just what happens when you put your

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:38.609
Your pot on the stove that you you will form bubbles of steam in the in the expanding sea

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.740
So it would form

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:46.290
Bubbles of steam and a uniform high density see this was a highly

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.030
non-Uniform distribution

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:55.920
Not what we thought the universe would look like so that was a problem that needed to be solved in inflation

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.519
And so I wrote a paper in 1982

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.050
saying that

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:08.430
The solution of this problem was that we lived in one of the bubbles and if our whole universe

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:16.710
Were a bubble universe that we lived in then seen from inside one of the bubbles remember you're looking back in time

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.960
You've just seen the uniform

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.539
inflating fee that occurred before that

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.649
from inside one of the bubbles your view was

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.930
Uniform and so this would solve a goose problem

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.290
Very shortly after my paper appeared

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:42.030
There was a paper by linda and an independent Paper by Linda and another independent Paper by Albrecht and Stein art

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.629
proposing basically the same thing and they

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.670
Had a detailed particle physics scenarios that could make this work

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:55.739
And this was called new inflation, and it solved a goose

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:03.359
Problem so let me show you this this is a space-time picture of how this would work

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:09.059
Time is going this way you start with a tiny inflating region here

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.450
It's inflating seeing that bubbles are forming in this

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:17.729
You know these are bubble universes and then the galaxies world lines are going to fan out

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:23.969
Here these bubbles are going to expand forever and the whole thing is going to keeps expanding forever

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:31.620
And we're living in one of these bubble universes and the space between us, and other bubble universe is stretching

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:36.300
so fast that the light from them is not getting over to us, so

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.660
this is a

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.660
picture that we have of

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:47.080
What we now call the multiverse and so while we can't see these other bubble universes

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:54.580
It seems that we've got a lot of evidence in favor of inflation, and it seems like almost an inevitable

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.900
consequence of inflation that you would form a

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:06.549
Multiverse at the end so this could go on forever, and you create an infinite number of these bubble universes

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.720
now I

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.180
realized that

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.709
One of the nice things that inflation did for you was that?

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.619
It started off so small and so

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.140
rapidly expanding that the

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:30.039
uncertainty principle told you that you would have random quantum fluctuations and these could start the

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.440
fluctuations that were going to eventually

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.940
grow up into clusters of galaxies by the present day, so

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:44.169
Inflation predicted though that these were random quantum fluctuations that meant that that you just put random

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:51.159
what uncorrelated waves through the universe and you could put these on your computer with a random number generator and

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.709
here's the thing if you if you had a series

00:27:53.710 --> 00:28:00.970
just imagine sine waves going every which lengths uncorrelated with each other different different wavelengths and things and

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.599
The thing it was true about this was if you had a positive

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.210
fluctuation over here and a negative

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:12.339
Fluctuation over here this would be above average in density. This would be below average in density

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.410
if you simply flip the sign

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:21.820
of your random number generator at the beginning that you told the computer to use it would switch all the

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.780
negative density

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:31.239
Fluctuations from positive density ones and so it would just reverse the two reasons this part would now be the high density part and that

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:36.880
Part would be below average density so one thing that must be true with random

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.320
Fluctuations which inflation predicted was that the initial conditions?

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:47.709
The high the regions that were above average in density and the reasons that below average in Density had to be

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:54.849
Geometrically similar had to be geometrically changeable with each other this was not true in the American

00:28:55.159 --> 00:29:01.419
Model we had isolated clusters in one low density part it was not true in the Russian model

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:09.340
Where he had one high density part and many isolated low density parts. They were both cases geometrically dissimilar

00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:12.669
well, I knew there was a third way a

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.990
Sponge-like Topology because I had done a

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:20.679
High-school Science project

00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:27.939
Now here are the five regular polyhedron?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.870
These have been known since the time of the ancient Greeks

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:37.089
And they're the only ones that you can have that are regular faces and all the vertices look the same

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.990
So so here's one. Here's the cube it's

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.299
You'll notice that it's three squares arranged around the point

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:52.210
You can think of this as a surface made of squares. I mean, I don't have anything inside here

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.210
this is just made out of squares, so

00:29:54.289 --> 00:30:01.419
The there's a 90 degree angle here and here and here where the top and the two sides need so you've got three ninety degree

00:30:01.419 --> 00:30:04.388
Angles so the Angles around this point are

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:11.979
270 degrees that's less than the 360 degrees you expect in a plane so all of these

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:19.419
Polyhedrons have less than 360 degree angle around a vertex. Here's another one

00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:23.768
This is an octahedron. It is four triangles around the point

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:29.949
So that's four times sixty degrees. That's also less than

00:30:31.309 --> 00:30:33.139
360 degrees

00:30:33.139 --> 00:30:37.508
These are and so so this is a property that all of these have

00:30:37.759 --> 00:30:41.679
And this is the only way you can do it three triangles around 2.45

00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:46.749
Triangles around the point and three pentagon's around the point those are the only possibilities

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:48.679
But Mr.

00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:49.940
Kepler the

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.139
Man, who?

00:30:51.139 --> 00:30:58.449
Invented the laws of Planet planetary motion which are so helpful to Newton he thought that you could also count as regular polyhedron

00:30:58.809 --> 00:31:02.918
the Well-known three regular planar networks these were

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:10.569
Surfaces met regular Sir is made of polygons there were just as good as a polyhedron it just had an infinite number of faces

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:17.649
Okay, so here's here's the checkerboard it is four squares around a point that is

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:23.650
360 degrees here is the six triangles around the point that's

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:28.719
360 degrees and Here's three hexagons around the point that's

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:33.730
360 degrees, so if you broaden your definition of a regular polyhedron

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.260
You could get this

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.059
You could get this

00:31:38.059 --> 00:31:39.920
three additional

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.920
regular Polygon Networks

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.900
now this is a

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:50.530
Illustration from my high school science project I submitted to the west now science talent search

00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:53.319
The science Town search still goes on today

00:31:53.540 --> 00:32:01.119
It's run by regenerated said Several sponsors over the years, but then it was sponsored by Westinghouse it was

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.700
one of the most prestigious

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:11.439
Science contests for high school students in the United States and my project was on relating

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.090
space-Filling

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:15.620
packings of

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:22.209
Polyhedrons, this is a this is a semi-regular polyhedron. It's a truncated octahedron

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:27.160
You just cut the corners off the octahedron, and it has square faces here

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.999
And it has hexagons here two different kinds of faces. This is a

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:37.689
Truncated Octahedron roll box and you stack them here and you get this space filling

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:45.640
Body centered cubic pattern you can fill up a whole warehouse of these and so my my project was on

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.920
relating these

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:50.679
stockings of polyhedrons to

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:54.489
the different Crystal structures in this case

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.480
metallic

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.270
Crystals and this was like the metallic crystal structure you got for sodium

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:06.729
So that that was my science project for the western half and it it

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.780
went on to win the second place in that contest that year and

00:33:12.919 --> 00:33:15.459
Glenn Seaborg was one of my judges

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:23.840
he was of course as element named after him sabor game as well as winning two nobel prize, so this was a

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.510
quite exciting for me

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:30.380
Many years later I was asked to be the chair

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:36.650
of the judges for this contest and so I served in that capacity for 14 years and

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.010
the

00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:48.139
Well, I think the best science project. I saw into my 14 years in that contest was by

00:33:48.809 --> 00:33:54.319
Jacob Lorry it was a math project. What was the number one winner that year and

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.119
This was on surreal numbers. It was really amazing project and

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.770
He went on to

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:08.119
recently quite recently when the three million Dollar breakthrough prize in Mathematics

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:16.729
The most famous person to go through the contest in my years is no doubt Natalie portman. She was

00:34:17.369 --> 00:34:21.649
one of the 300 semi-finalists in the contest that year and

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:30.559
It was it was it was my job as chair of the judges to take a ranked list of the 300 best

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:32.839
projects that have been selected as

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.030
semi-finalists by a team of

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:42.019
evaluators and to winnow that list down to 120 to go on to the next stage of judging and

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:47.359
I actually remember her project because I really really liked it

00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:54.709
It was a project about how you might get an enzyme to digest waste paper and Produce hydrogen fuel

00:34:54.710 --> 00:35:00.379
So it had this environmental thing going on, and I really liked it and I put it in Susie asta

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.890
cle into the top hundred and Twenty pile, so

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.550
She's known for being one of the 300

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.740
semi-finalists, but actually she did two and a half times better than and

00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:17.269
When they published her paper on the internet, I had no idea she was an actress

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:23.479
I remember it was a it was it was a woman's project from New York, but I had no idea of

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.820
that she was an actor sir who she was so it was judged entirely on its scientific merit and

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:38.300
Later her paper was published on the internet, and I recognized it immediately this project that I actually particularly liked

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.550
so um

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.520
Instead of winning a nobel prize she wanted oscars

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.250
She turned out all right

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:51.770
so it was it was a thrill for me to work with all these fantastic students during the years and

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.450
I think contests like this are very important because they encourage people to

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.139
try Scientific research early in their

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:02.810
early in their career see if they

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.020
like it

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:11.060
Now the the I won the second place of scholarship has paid for half of my harvard education

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:17.899
but the most important thing to happen was something I noticed when I looked at the plastic model of

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.159
This that I was building I had I had made a lot of Plexiglas

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:27.500
hexagons and and I was gluing them together, and I noticed that there was a

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.090
full

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:37.399
butterfly Pattern of four hexagons that came together around the point which you can see there and I've

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.750
Replicated this here today. This is what they looked like and

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:48.919
I've got four hexagons around the point. How can you do that? Well? Is it? It's a saddle shaped surface

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.889
This is a negatively curved surface in

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:59.659
mathematics and these are positively curved surfaces like the sphere and the plane is in between so these have more than

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.800
360 degrees around the point and and not only that

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.150
whether this one configuration

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:13.580
but it can be it could be continued and in fact I noticed that if I just took all my squares and

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.930
threw them away

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:20.659
The boxes would all open up, and I would have one continuous

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.830
Sponge-like

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.009
Pattern of Hexagons that was all

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.899
related and the divided space into two equal parts and so

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.460
this was a

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.270
a different polyhedron that was had more than

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:43.589
360 degrees around the point this is my high school science project for that which I entered in the

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.209
National Science Fair international at the time this is now the

00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:57.749
International science and engineering fair you can enter that from Britain and countries around the world and these I made models of these

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:02.160
Polyhedrons that I had found and here's a close-up of them

00:38:03.099 --> 00:38:07.588
Here's your squares six around the point here's pentagon's five around the point

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.259
These are ones that I had found and when I got to harvard I submitted this

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.739
into the American Mathematical monthly and

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:24.539
The referee pointed out that the three of these had been discovered by Petry and coxeter in

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.470
1926

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:30.300
but these four were new so it was publishable and

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:36.570
and since my paper came out a crystallographer names well as

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:43.259
Discovered as discovered three three three more of these so these are sponge-like networks

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:48.690
Well now years and years later when I was confronting this problem in astronomy

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:54.030
I knew that there was something that would divide space into two equal parts of sponge

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.380
so here's a picture that squares six around the point and

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:05.609
It divides space into could be a high density part here and a low density part here that are

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:09.510
interlocking and so if you have a marine sponge

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.190
Here's your Marine sponge

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:17.849
it has it has water passages going through it bringing nutriments tall insides of the sponge and

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.849
if you poured concrete in those passages

00:39:21.609 --> 00:39:25.079
You could that could solidify and then if you took acid?

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.909
And you dissolved away the poor sponge then then that would be gone

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:33.720
and you'd be left with a concrete sponge, so

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:41.129
That also would have air passages going through it so the insides and the outsides of a sponge

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:47.189
Can be the same and so this is just what the initial conditions and inflation should like?

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.059
interlocking sponge like Topology

00:39:51.579 --> 00:39:56.999
So I got together with Millat who was a n-body simulator and Dickinson who was an observer?

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.919
and we wrote a paper called a sponge like Topology of large-scale structure and

00:40:03.549 --> 00:40:07.649
Millat made a simulation. This is initial conditions based on

00:40:08.289 --> 00:40:15.268
inflationary initial conditions, so these are slight density fluctuations their ever so slightly above average and

00:40:16.269 --> 00:40:22.259
The the above-average regions of these random initial conditions look like a sponge you can see the holes here

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:27.659
And you can see this all in one piece and here's the other half of this cube

00:40:27.819 --> 00:40:31.558
This is the low-density parts and these are

00:40:32.319 --> 00:40:38.129
Also a sponge you can see the holes over here, and this is all in one piece as well

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.440
So that was our initial conditions

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:46.289
Then we evolved it on the computer up to the present epoch and then we're going to smooth this

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.710
Data because we don't care that the Galaxy's are individual points

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:55.829
We want a census of galaxies like you take I want to know how the population goes on the scale of counties

00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:59.249
so you can hear so we smooth the data on a

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:02.909
distance of 24 Million Light-Years and

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:10.619
then we counted the density of galaxies and and so this is the how the regions look today, the

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.900
Contrast has been greatly enhanced

00:41:13.089 --> 00:41:19.528
But you'll notice that this we took the median density contour that would divide space into two equal

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.169
volumes and you'll notice that the high density

00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:27.568
Parts here are exactly where the low the high density parts were in the initial conditions

00:41:27.569 --> 00:41:33.268
They've just grown up and become higher and higher density and the low density parts also are

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:40.019
Mimicking what they had in the initial conditions small scale fluctuations will grow in place

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:48.539
becoming bigger and bigger without moving in the standard picture, so we discovered that if you looked at the

00:41:49.059 --> 00:41:54.419
Universe today, and you smooth bit you could get this is also smooth with the same smoothing length

00:41:54.730 --> 00:42:01.770
You could you could get a picture of what the initial conditions look like and see whether they resemble a sponge which

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:09.209
Inflation would predict so here's an observational sample that we looked at a tiny one and here's the earth here

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.020
Here's the Virgo Supercluster

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:17.729
Up here and the high density reasons all in one piece and here's the low density region

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:25.079
It's all in one piece here, and this is that you can see a hole over here. We measured it these these have sponge-like

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:27.870
Topology

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:33.270
This is what a honeycomb would look like we do that. We smooth the data

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:37.380
We looked at one of these old overage honeycombs and and it

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:42.839
The high Density region is all in one piece this looks exactly like swiss cheese

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:46.050
We call this a swiss cheese

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:53.190
Universal equivalent the Honeycomb and the isolated voice if you look at the low dense they have of this picture

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.260
You can see them. They look like

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.610
You can see them

00:42:56.610 --> 00:43:04.589
They're separated from each other as happens the isolated regions with with positive Curvature on them on those surfaces

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:12.660
So so this is looking quite different for example as to what we're actually seeing in that even that first

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:15.150
observational sample

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:18.210
So here. I am with David weinberg who worked on this project

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.479
There I am another I worked on time travelers a little time travel to the past for me

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.450
so as I looked then

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.880
And we're looking at some of this data

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:37.199
And we used the stereo glasses you know that we made were red blue stereo pictures

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.200
So we look like we're looking at some old

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:41.790
science fiction movies

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:43.810
and

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:48.390
About this time they'll operon geller and hooke reproduce this picture

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:55.620
This is a slice picture of the universe it has the earth here. You're looking into narrow slice

00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:02.640
they're measuring distances out here by using the doppler shifts of the galaxies and hubble's expansion law and

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.310
this is a complete sample, so there's no question about you're missing any galaxies and

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:12.900
They found these incredible structures you can see cells

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:19.050
here and this looked quite like the Anasta picture only more spectacular and

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.810
many people looked at this picture and

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:28.709
And said this this is like the the honeycomb picture and in fact geller and hooker

00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:33.929
Described this as a froth of bubbles which is geometrically equivalent to honeycomb

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:41.129
isolated bubbles with the walls all connected so this picture looked like it favored the

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.720
picture of

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.720
the Russian School

00:44:46.089 --> 00:44:50.578
now they kept taking data and they made a thicker slice a

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:55.409
Thicker slice put together three slices here and one of these filaments here

00:44:56.109 --> 00:45:03.509
Became more prominent they call this the great wall because it reminded them of the great wall of China, and this was about

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:08.939
750 million light Years long it was an extraordinary of large

00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:11.849
structure

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.950
now

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.950
Park and I did a simulation

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:22.679
This is parks. Thesis. He did the simulation. I told him to make them sequencing

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:26.079
so

00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:28.829
What he did was to make a simulation

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.980
that that had a

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:36.869
4 million particles in it to simulate for the first time a

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:41.759
region as large as the as is this

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:46.109
observational Sample by of a geller and hooker and so

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.660
this was made using

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.300
people's new idea of

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:54.690
What's called cold Dark matter?

00:45:55.510 --> 00:46:00.239
so people's proposed that there was that the dark matter of

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:05.189
Ricci was made up of weakly interacting massive

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.900
particles and

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.560
that the the nice thing that and also

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:12.819
blumenthal

00:46:12.819 --> 00:46:17.669
bagels and premack produced the same idea around the same time independently and

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:25.409
the wonderful thing that this did for you was that the the normal matter was coupled to the

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:29.190
hot thermal radiation because in early days

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:35.130
The atoms are ionized and we had positive and elem negatively charged particles

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:40.319
So they were stuck to the radiation which had a pressure which resisted collapse

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.620
But the cold Dark Matter could start growing

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:51.510
Earlier than the matter could and this helped you in particularly its small scales this helped to be able to make galaxies

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:59.009
early and so it helps people to make the galaxies first which he wanted to do and this was quite a breakthrough and

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:06.900
a park simulation is based on the on the cold dark matter model of

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:13.650
Jim people's and when we first looked at this cube that he made and there was a giant

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.849
Filament in it and so he just made a slice of that and

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:20.670
the agreement

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:27.029
this is just what's extraordinarily like the stuff that that geller and hooker were seen and

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:33.479
these long fill in life is it proved that cold dark matter could make structures as big as this and

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:40.290
It also proved that it can make things that look like this, but we knew for a fact that

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:45.479
This simulation had a sponge-like topology because we could see it in 3D

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:52.440
So we knew that a simulation whether sponge-like Topology could look like the geller hooker sample

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:57.870
Meanwhile, but we had to wait until they got a complete 3D sample of that

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:04.650
Meanwhile we were looking to other 3D samples that were complete. This is the Juvenalian Haynes

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:10.920
Observations this is the high density half this is the low density half of their survey

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:17.580
This is the perseus cluster in here. Which I showed you this is the perseus pisces super cluster

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.579
which is a giant filament of Galaxies and

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:25.440
You can see the hole here the high density part is all in one piece

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:31.620
This is the complimentary low-density part and you can see the holes here, and you can see that

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:37.319
This is all in one connected piece, so this is a sponge-like Topology Juvenalian hain

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:43.770
Now later when the the governor had completed their 3D survey

00:48:45.279 --> 00:48:51.599
By any more and more slices. This is their final results the earth is here. This is the Northern hemisphere

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:58.169
This is the this is the great wall in here. This is the southern hemisphere which they added to their survey and

00:48:59.559 --> 00:49:02.849
Here you can see that the great wall is

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.990
Actually a filament

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.930
connecting clusters of Galaxies

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:13.319
And you can you can swim from this void around into that void and so this is a sponge-like

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.089
Topology in a sponge-like Topology the great clusters of

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.920
Galaxies are connected to filaments by filaments to make one connected piece

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:28.619
At the high density part of the sponge and then the the voids are connected by Tunnels

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:30.789
to form the

00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:36.778
Complementary piece so this is indeed a sponge-like topology. You look at it over here

00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:41.099
We've smoothed it at a larger scale a low lower resolution version

00:49:41.099 --> 00:49:48.149
You can clearly see here that the the great wall is the filament connecting clusters of galaxies?

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:54.329
There's there's a hole in the distribution here. I want to looking closely at this part of the survey

00:49:54.329 --> 00:49:56.699
we're going to turn it upside down and

00:49:58.059 --> 00:50:01.379
Here it is and Michael boldly who's working on this

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:04.240
This is the Earth here

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:12.059
There's a big void in here, and you put a light in this here, and you can see the red light shining through

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.900
Tunnels to other Voids through two other tunnels

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.349
This is the high Density part

00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:21.028
It's all in one piece and here's the low density part

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:28.559
And there you can see this big void here, and you can see the tunnels leading through to the other

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.200
Void so this is sponge-like

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:36.029
where this is a paper by bond in

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.309
1995

00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:41.309
They showed this computer simulation

00:50:41.859 --> 00:50:47.489
His colleague and there were colleagues here too. They showed a computer simulation bun by clipping

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:55.720
They studied something different they studied the velocity flows in the initial conditions

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.050
and if you have if you have a filament like this connecting

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.870
Filament like this in the initial conditions

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:07.870
Then there'll be velocity it'll pull stuff toward it with velocity flows that are coming in from two

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:13.330
Directions here if it was a pancake. It'd only be pulling things in from

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.830
along one axis here

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:21.340
So they analyze these velocity flows and they were getting flows that that were

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:24.489
produced by filaments in the initial conditions

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.989
Characteristically and so this confirmed what we've said all along

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:33.669
Which was that the filaments are present in the initial conditions?

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:38.740
They're part of the sponge like nature of the initial random conditions

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:45.310
And of course what happens is that after the filament is formed then gravity continues to pull it together?

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:47.860
So by by

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:55.060
late times you're going to get it's going to be narrower filaments connecting these clusters of

00:51:55.370 --> 00:52:03.069
Galaxies, and so it looks like a web they call this the cosmic web. This is the first paper to use that word and

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:10.330
And that word has stuck to describe this structure, so this confirmed what we were saying earlier

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:15.070
Later we've done the sloan digital sky survey

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.429
and Mario Yurich and I

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.340
found this large

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.020
Filament here

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:30.909
Which we called the sloan great wall and we measured its length to be one point three seven billion light-years

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:37.780
It was about twice the size of the great wall of geller and hooker

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.329
We were looking at a bigger volume of space

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.320
This got Mario Eurasian myself

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:52.539
Into the guinness book of world records, and we didn't even have to eat a teapot dogs in ten minutes

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:54.890
the

00:52:54.890 --> 00:53:01.559
But let me speak up for this record because there's a lot of largest things in the guinness book of world records

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.700
There's the largest Ball of twine

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.199
There's the largest there's a largest

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.890
building

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:12.300
But of although, this is the largest structure in the universe

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:17.339
We through the previous record-Holder was the great wall of gallon hooker um?

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:23.460
Of all the largest things in that book, this is the largest of the largest

00:53:24.609 --> 00:53:28.529
Okay, so so anyway, we're continued to find

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:31.060
Filaments

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.609
Let me go back to this picture

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:38.549
This is I'm going to show you a close-up of this end of the sloan great wall

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:42.479
And this is a picture made by my student Lauren hofstetter

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:50.608
And what he's done here is we put the actual pictures of the galaxies from the survey at exactly the right

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:56.459
Locations or right distances from the Earth in the picture and and and you can see all these

00:53:56.710 --> 00:54:02.220
Galaxies here in this rich Eastern and uh but they're fifty times enlarged

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:10.169
So you could see them in other words if the galaxies were this size this picture should be fifty times larger

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:16.470
Showing you the vast distances between these galaxies and the tremendous size of this

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:19.260
sloan Great wall

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:23.520
now in the in about

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:30.119
2005 of the the Europeans, Led by Springle

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.300
did a giant computer simulation of

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:35.890
structure formation in this

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:38.849
inflationary Big bang model with coal Dark matter and

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:46.139
They used a ten billion particles that shows how computer simulations had gone

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:49.020
since the time part did his and

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:55.199
They found this wonderful picture of the sponge-like

00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:00.569
Topology with with all these filaments connecting the clusters of galaxies

00:55:02.619 --> 00:55:04.569
beautiful pictures

00:55:04.569 --> 00:55:06.130
now

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.310
They also did slices

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:15.540
Of their survey to compare with various observational ones so here's here's the the to

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.589
sloane great wall and the Great wall geller and hooker

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:26.220
They made a slice just like this and their observational set and they found this great wall here

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:29.280
Which is quite as long as the one that we're seeing here

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:36.359
And then one that looked quite like the closer one that we see of geller and hookers, so these

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.880
simulations were able to

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:42.300
Reproduce as we've Gotten bigger and bigger simulations

00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:50.010
They've been actually better and better able to agree with the bigger and bigger observational samples that we're seen which

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:52.530
Indicates that maybe we're on the right track

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.240
here's how the

00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:01.619
Beast things have progressed the first little cube. I showed you was this tiny thing and this is the

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.889
great wall of Geller and Hooker here in

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:11.490
1994 and then in 2006 We made this is to large survey regions from the

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:14.530
sloan Digital sky survey

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:21.060
The great wall the sloan great wall is down here, and you can clearly see this as this is the habitants

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.060
They have this is a sponge-like

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:31.530
Structure so every survey that we've done is shown a a sponge-like structure of the high density region

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:39.869
We invented a statistic called the genes-- here - which measures the number of holes - the number of isolated

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:42.150
regions and in that

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.120
Density contour Surface, and

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:52.380
we were seeing about 50 60 70 about 80 holes in this sample and

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.959
the the Jagged Line is the

00:56:55.390 --> 00:57:02.190
Observations here and the the the dashed line, which follows it so closely is the twelve

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:07.829
Catalogs that we made from N-body simulation that used the exact

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:11.879
random initial conditions an entire spectrum of

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:14.999
fluctuations you expected from inflation and

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:21.599
This fit perfectly explained the number of holes and these are different density contours

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:26.949
Now this is the medium density condor these are higher and lower density condors

00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:31.089
It's it's that all the density contours. This is quite a spectacular

00:57:32.839 --> 00:57:34.839
affirmation of the

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.150
inflationary predictions

00:57:37.819 --> 00:57:39.819
This is the cosmic microwave background

00:57:40.099 --> 00:57:44.169
It's a tall sky picture taken from the w maps satellite

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:51.279
I bought a model of this when we're at the center of this sphere. We're looking out in space

00:57:51.279 --> 00:57:52.220
no Matter which Direction

00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:59.439
We look we see the cosmic microwave background coming in from all directions in the sky all like from all over a big sphere

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.819
We're looking out in space and back in time

00:58:04.339 --> 00:58:08.859
So this is we're seeing this is 13.8 billion years ago

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.000
just

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
380,000 Years after the Big bang

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:19.720
We're and and and that means that the the radius here the the so-called look-back time

00:58:20.359 --> 00:58:22.508
Distance out to this that we're seeing is

00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:25.329
13.8 Billion

00:58:25.369 --> 00:58:31.929
13.8 billion Light-years, and so this is the cosmic microwave background that we're seeing and we're seeing

00:58:32.599 --> 00:58:36.758
fluctuations in this of one part in a hundred thousand

00:58:37.279 --> 00:58:43.569
and and this is these are the fluctuations that are going to grow up to form the structure that we see and

00:58:44.869 --> 00:58:46.869
Here is a picture from Planck

00:58:46.869 --> 00:58:50.409
This is a graph of the amount of power in

00:58:50.599 --> 00:58:56.288
this in different angular sizes so a lot of spots you see are like it one degree and

00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:04.449
And the the red dots here are the experimental data from the Planck Satellite and the Green line?

00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:10.629
The Green band here is the predictions of the standard the standard now

00:59:11.119 --> 00:59:14.528
inflationary Big bang model and the agreement is just

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:23.019
outstanding and and these these peaks here represent acoustic waves in the early universe and you can even

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:27.189
look at the amplitudes of these and figure out the ratio of

00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:35.169
Dark matter and normal matter and so forth so this is a spectacular result

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:42.890
now I mentioned acoustic waves if you take a

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:51.890
Place where there's going to be an extra lump of ordinary matter here to make it's going to end up making a galaxy

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.740
that's like dropping a

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:59.930
It's like dropping a rock in a pond the sound waves will go out here

00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:05.810
They'll produce a ripple out here and this freezes in when the when the atoms

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:14.870
When the electrons and protons recombine to form hydrogen and so you there's an extra

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.030
normal matter here

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.650
And you expect this to give you a slight excess chance of finding?

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:29.989
Galaxies in this in this at this distance from where you find your starting galaxies so we can look this is our

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:36.529
Telescope here for the sloan digital sky survey here's a picture of a typical galaxy that we use in here

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:43.249
so if you locate on a galaxy you ask yourself a question is there an extra little bump in the number of

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:45.410
galaxies when you get to this special

01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:49.819
radius that you can that you can calculate and the answer is that

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.410
Eisenstein found this extra bump in the data

01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.460
and and so this is a ruler of that you can apply to the Cosmic web and

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.000
the Cosmic Web Expands every time the universe

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:11.329
expands by a certain factor the Cosmic web stretches and expands by that factor so you can use this as a

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:15.709
Ruler to tell you about the expansion history of the universe

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:25.309
Now as I said the accelerating expansion that we're observing today which was discovered by

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:29.689
Supernova Absorb servation, we call this dark energy and

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:33.439
We can we can use this detailed

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.339
measurement of the expansion history of the universe

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:45.680
which comes from Supernovae comes from this sloan digital sky survey from these measurements of this so a bump and

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.320
from the Cosmic microwave background

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:54.449
And from gravitational lensing data. Thank you again for to Azuki and

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.240
you can put this all together and

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:01.440
student of Mine Zag Slip ian Found A

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:08.699
Nice sitting formula to fit this data, and we can measure then the ratio of the pressure

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:13.739
to the energy density in this dark energy which makes up about

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:20.040
70% of the stuff of the universe today and we've got about 4%

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:27.000
Ordinary Matter and like 26 percent dark matter and but we can measure

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:31.980
Actually the pressure and energy ratio by using Einsteins field equations

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:39.030
And so the answer that the best answer that we've gotten using a combining all this data these groups of people

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:46.409
Combine teams of large number of people using this fitting formula the value. We find is minus

01:02:47.619 --> 01:02:48.790
1.008

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:54.479
plus or minus 0.06 eight so within the errors of the

01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:01.230
Observation this is equal to minus one now einstein would be very pleased with this

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.840
Because he invented early on

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:12.330
so a term to add to his field equations called the cosmological constant and this was to in the hope of producing a

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.420
static Universe Model

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.880
but then in

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:25.139
1934 a La Mantra found that if you move this constant from one side of the equations to the other

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:32.009
It could represent a vacuum energy with a negative vacuum pressure

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.979
And so this is what we think we're looking at today

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:41.609
it's not a constant for all time, but it's something that can actually vary through the history of the universe as

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:48.720
the physics changes in the early universe we expect that some of the forces reunited and

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:56.699
That therefore we had a high vacuum energy we have a low vacuum energy today, so this looks like

01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:02.189
If this stays one the vacuum energy in the universe is going to stay constant

01:04:02.819 --> 01:04:08.758
The universe is going to expand forever doubling in size every 12.2 billion years and eventually

01:04:10.119 --> 01:04:15.659
There will be we're talking more than 10 to 138 years from now

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:23.549
But but maybe less than 10 to the 10 to the 34 years from math long time in the future eventually

01:04:23.709 --> 01:04:29.069
We expect to see bubbles of lower density vacuum occurring like like

01:04:29.619 --> 01:04:33.389
bubbles in an eternally fizzing champagne

01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:38.369
So this is the our view of the cosmic web today

01:04:38.859 --> 01:04:45.688
This was taken in the infrared by the 2mass survey and this is an all-sky view again

01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:52.319
Like the Cosmic microwave background picture. I showed you we're looking here toward the center of our galaxy

01:04:52.719 --> 01:04:55.019
you can see it looks quite similar to

01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:57.249
andromeda

01:04:57.249 --> 01:05:03.119
This is where we're in the plane of the Galaxy. So we're looking at the center. This is in the foreground and

01:05:03.969 --> 01:05:09.208
These dots here are all galaxies and the colors are indicating. How far away

01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:15.779
They are and so you can see the the filaments here connecting the the clusters of great

01:05:16.569 --> 01:05:24.538
Galaxies in this sponge-like Pattern and so you should realize when you look at this picture that you're seeing

01:05:24.819 --> 01:05:26.819
the fingerprint of

01:05:27.159 --> 01:05:31.589
Inflation you're seeing some of the largest things in the universe

01:05:31.809 --> 01:05:39.119
But you're also seeing the oldest things in the universe because these began as small vacuum

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:47.489
Fluctuations made in the first 10 to the minus 35 seconds of the universe and by studying this cosmic web

01:05:47.769 --> 01:05:52.438
we therefore can learn something about the very early universe and

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:57.688
Also by measuring it we can find out something about the future dynamics of the universe

01:05:58.239 --> 01:06:01.349
Over the next trillion years as well. Thank you

01:06:02.779 --> 01:06:04.779
you
