00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.350
Here are a couple of examples. I'm sure

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.650
that you may have thought of other examples

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.060
as well. But packet filter is one thing

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.190
that I mentioned already to you. And this

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.390
is something that may be a critical component

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.920
of performance for any operating system. And therefore,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.690
it might install a packet filter for demultiplexing

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.300
incoming network packets so that exokernel can hand packets

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.040
intended for a particular library operating system by

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.030
running this code on behalf of the library

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.260
operating system. A second example would be things

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.920
that a library would like exokernel to do on

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.360
its behalf, even when it is not currently

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.350
scheduled. For instance, a garbage collection mechanism for an

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.360
application is something that a library operating system

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.100
may want to be run on behalf of it.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.050
And that's something that can be installed as a

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.410
code that is downloaded into exokernel and executed on behalf

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.220
of that library operating system. So these are all

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.490
examples, you may have thought of other examples as well.
