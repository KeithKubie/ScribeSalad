00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:43.820
facing right now
 

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.430
facing right now
is that we have these weaknesses and

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440
is that we have these weaknesses and
 

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.840
is that we have these weaknesses and
dangerous currents are coming through

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:49.850
dangerous currents are coming through
 

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.090
dangerous currents are coming through
those weaknesses and I believe we're at

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:52.100
those weaknesses and I believe we're at
 

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.490
those weaknesses and I believe we're at
a very dangerous moment globally but I

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:54.500
a very dangerous moment globally but I
 

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.569
a very dangerous moment globally but I
feel like we're almost lucky that the in

00:12:58.569 --> 00:12:58.579
feel like we're almost lucky that the in
 

00:12:58.579 --> 00:13:01.990
feel like we're almost lucky that the in
the case the u.s. we have a reality TV

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000
the case the u.s. we have a reality TV
 

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.210
the case the u.s. we have a reality TV
star that got elected you know we can

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:04.220
star that got elected you know we can
 

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.129
star that got elected you know we can
probably survive this moment because we

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:06.139
probably survive this moment because we
 

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:08.800
probably survive this moment because we
have institutions but if we do not fix

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:08.810
have institutions but if we do not fix
 

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.210
have institutions but if we do not fix
I think accountability transparency

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:12.220
I think accountability transparency
 

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.130
I think accountability transparency
gaining trust how do we do right by the

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:15.140
gaining trust how do we do right by the
 

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.070
gaining trust how do we do right by the
people in a way that makes sense

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.080
people in a way that makes sense
 

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.900
people in a way that makes sense
for the people I feel like we're just

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:18.910
for the people I feel like we're just
 

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.400
for the people I feel like we're just
gonna live through this again and again

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.410
gonna live through this again and again
 

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.790
gonna live through this again and again
what's more dangerous once coming again

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800
what's more dangerous once coming again
 

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.260
what's more dangerous once coming again
and I think we should really be

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:25.270
and I think we should really be
 

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.860
and I think we should really be
discussing that as much as discussing

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:27.870
discussing that as much as discussing
 

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.030
discussing that as much as discussing
you know what does Donald Trump get

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040
you know what does Donald Trump get
 

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.010
you know what does Donald Trump get
wrong so what you're saying is that this

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:32.020
wrong so what you're saying is that this
 

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.080
wrong so what you're saying is that this
moment is a result of something and of

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.090
moment is a result of something and of
 

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.450

the connection between trust and

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:41.140
the connection between trust and
 

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.190
the connection between trust and
economic inequality and kind of the

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:44.200
economic inequality and kind of the

political truths and one of the reasons
that I think there's been the loss of

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:55.960
that I think there's been the loss of
 

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.390
that I think there's been the loss of
trust is that for a third of a century

00:13:59.390 --> 00:13:59.400
trust is that for a third of a century
 

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.070
trust is that for a third of a century
we've had political leaders who said

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:02.080
we've had political leaders who said
 

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.750
we've had political leaders who said
that globalization dances and Technology

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:06.760
that globalization dances and Technology
 

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.820
that globalization dances and Technology
were going to lead everybody to be

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:08.830
were going to lead everybody to be
 

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.370
were going to lead everybody to be
better off and so you you you had a

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:11.380
better off and so you you you had a
 

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.860
better off and so you you you had a
strong agenda and even under Obama they

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:13.870
strong agenda and even under Obama they
 

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.630
strong agenda and even under Obama they
were saying TPP was going to new trade

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:18.640

agreement with across the Pacific was
 

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.540
agreement with across the Pacific was
going to increase have enormous benefits

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:24.550
going to increase have enormous benefits
 

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.550
going to increase have enormous benefits
and what people were experiencing was

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560
and what people were experiencing was
 

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.320
and what people were experiencing was
just the opposite and I think a critical

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:31.330
just the opposite and I think a critical
 

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:36.270
just the opposite and I think a critical
point as mentioned was the 2008 prices

point as mentioned was the 2008 prices
 

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.610
point as mentioned was the 2008 prices
and why was critical was it was at that

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:38.620
and why was critical was it was at that
 

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.960
and why was critical was it was at that
moment that you saw that things had not

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:42.970

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.940

would benefit everybody the banks were
engaged in predatory lending and then

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:51.520
engaged in predatory lending and then
 

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.060
engaged in predatory lending and then

accountability much less accountability
 

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.720
accountability much less accountability
than happened after the much smaller

and night 19 in the 1989 so there's a

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:23.769
and night 19 in the 1989 so there's a
 

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:28.559
and night 19 in the 1989 so there's a
sense that the system does it it has no

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:28.569
sense that the system does it it has no
 

00:15:28.569 --> 00:15:31.199
sense that the system does it it has no
system of accountability and then in one

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:31.209
system of accountability and then in one
 

00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:33.929
system of accountability and then in one
sense making it one sense worse is we

00:15:33.929 --> 00:15:33.939
sense making it one sense worse is we
 

00:15:33.939 --> 00:15:36.290

elected on a platform of change you

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:39.670
elected on a platform of change you
 

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.300
elected on a platform of change you
could believe in and continued with the

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.310
could believe in and continued with the
 

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.030

going to be very important I think it's
very important for other countries not

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800
very important for other countries not
 

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:07.220
very important for other countries not
to give in and to say as it is and it's

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:07.230
to give in and to say as it is and it's
 

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:09.590
to give in and to say as it is and it's
uncomfortable you know everybody wants

to cooperate with the United States and

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040
to cooperate with the United States and
 

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:18.050
to cooperate with the United States and
the answers we cooperate where it is but

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060
the answers we cooperate where it is but
 

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.700
the answers we cooperate where it is but
where what you're saying is reasonable

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:19.710
where what you're saying is reasonable
 

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.170
where what you're saying is reasonable
but if you're saying something that's

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180
but if you're saying something that's
 

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.450
but if you're saying something that's
unreasonable we're not going to
