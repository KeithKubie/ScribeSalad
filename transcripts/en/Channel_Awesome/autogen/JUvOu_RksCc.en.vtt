through<00:01:19.920><c> it</c><00:01:20.100><c> it</c><00:01:20.280><c> make</c><00:01:20.430><c> it</c><00:01:20.580><c> way</c><00:01:20.759><c> more</c><00:01:20.790><c> conflict</c>

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 align:start position:0%
through it it make it way more conflict
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.999 align:start position:0%
through it it make it way more conflict
I<00:01:21.720><c> didn't</c><00:01:21.990><c> get</c><00:01:22.080><c> that</c><00:01:22.259><c> a</c><00:01:22.290><c> lot</c><00:01:22.439><c> more</c><00:01:22.619><c> complicated</c>

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 align:start position:0%
I didn't get that a lot more complicated
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't get that a lot more complicated
but<00:01:23.460><c> now</c><00:01:23.640><c> that's</c><00:01:23.909><c> really</c><00:01:24.330><c> is</c><00:01:24.689><c> and</c><00:01:24.930><c> this</c><00:01:24.990><c> is</c>

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 align:start position:0%
but now that's really is and this is
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.060 align:start position:0%
but now that's really is and this is
definitely<00:01:25.380><c> a</c><00:01:25.619><c> movie</c><00:01:26.009><c> where</c><00:01:27.049><c> it's</c><00:01:28.049><c> the</c><00:01:28.229><c> in</c>

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 align:start position:0%

force<00:01:36.570><c> awakens</c><00:01:37.020><c> I</c><00:01:37.110><c> thought</c><00:01:37.259><c> the</c><00:01:37.350><c> first</c><00:01:37.530><c> half</c>

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 align:start position:0%

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
force awakens I thought the first half
was<00:01:37.950><c> actually</c><00:01:38.280><c> pretty</c><00:01:38.490><c> strong</c><00:01:38.880><c> and</c><00:01:39.290><c> then</c><00:01:40.290><c> the</c>

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 align:start position:0%
was actually pretty strong and then the
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 align:start position:0%

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
and it's really awesome to watch and
 

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.470 align:start position:0%
and it's really awesome to watch and
they<00:10:16.680><c> do</c><00:10:17.070><c> things</c><00:10:17.550><c> where</c><00:10:17.790><c> they</c><00:10:18.060><c> attach</c>

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
they do things where they attach
 

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.230 align:start position:0%
they do things where they attach
basically<00:10:19.110><c> but</c><00:10:19.380><c> I</c><00:10:19.620><c> mean</c><00:10:20.070><c> it's</c><00:10:20.220><c> CGI</c><00:10:20.610><c> but</c><00:10:21.000><c> what</c>

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
basically but I mean it's CGI but what
 

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
basically but I mean it's CGI but what
would<00:10:21.480><c> be</c><00:10:21.510><c> the</c><00:10:21.630><c> camera</c><00:10:22.140><c> to</c><00:10:22.320><c> the</c><00:10:22.350><c> back</c><00:10:22.590><c> of</c><00:10:22.800><c> the</c>

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:22.890 align:start position:0%
would be the camera to the back of the
 

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.830 align:start position:0%
would be the camera to the back of the
x-wings<00:10:23.340><c> they</c><00:10:23.610><c> follow</c><00:10:23.880><c> the</c><00:10:24.090><c> x-wing</c><00:10:24.450><c> doing</c><00:10:24.720><c> all</c>

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
x-wings they follow the x-wing doing all
 

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.650 align:start position:0%
x-wings they follow the x-wing doing all
these<00:10:25.040><c> maneuvers</c><00:10:26.040><c> and</c><00:10:26.310><c> it</c><00:10:26.430><c> really</c><00:10:27.090><c> feels</c><00:10:27.450><c> like</c>

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
these maneuvers and it really feels like
 

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.630 align:start position:0%
these maneuvers and it really feels like
classic<00:10:28.410><c> Star</c><00:10:28.680><c> Wars</c><00:10:28.920><c> space</c><00:10:29.190><c> battles</c><00:10:29.520><c> I've</c>
