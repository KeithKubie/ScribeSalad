New England my question for you is do

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639
New England my question for you is do
 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.480
New England my question for you is do
you believe that is a space expanse it

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
you believe that is a space expanse it
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.970
you believe that is a space expanse it
starts moving at a faster and less can

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
starts moving at a faster and less can
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.790
starts moving at a faster and less can
less controlled rate I've always wanted

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
less controlled rate I've always wanted
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.429
less controlled rate I've always wanted
this given our ancestors had such a

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
this given our ancestors had such a
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.590
this given our ancestors had such a
closer view of time and space than we

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
closer view of time and space than we
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.589
closer view of time and space than we
have now and it seems to have moving

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
have now and it seems to have moving
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.070
have now and it seems to have moving
pretty much faster away from us then as

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080
pretty much faster away from us then as
 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.749
pretty much faster away from us then as
they had such a huge view of the

they had such a huge view of the
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030
they had such a huge view of the
galaxies and what they've written and

Marty Marty Marty so you're asking a
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.720
Marty Marty Marty so you're asking a
great question keep in mind that in my

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730
great question keep in mind that in my
 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.270
great question keep in mind that in my
grandfather's time it was believed by a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
grandfather's time it was believed by a
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.459
grandfather's time it was believed by a
great many people that the universe was

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
great many people that the universe was
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.010
great many people that the universe was
static that it just is the way it's

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
static that it just is the way it's
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.830
static that it just is the way it's
always been it's this it's big some

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
always been it's this it's big some
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.979
always been it's this it's big some
extraordinarily huge size and it had it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
extraordinarily huge size and it had it
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680
extraordinarily huge size and it had it
had always been that way then in my

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
had always been that way then in my
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.640
had always been that way then in my
father's time relativity was discovered

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
father's time relativity was discovered
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.300
father's time relativity was discovered
and furthermore the expanding universe

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
and furthermore the expanding universe
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520
and furthermore the expanding universe
was discovered this discovered nominally

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
was discovered this discovered nominally
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.950
was discovered this discovered nominally
or largely credited to Edwin Hubble and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
or largely credited to Edwin Hubble and
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.899
or largely credited to Edwin Hubble and
that's why we named the Space Telescope

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
that's why we named the Space Telescope
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.200
that's why we named the Space Telescope
after Hubble because he was looking at

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
after Hubble because he was looking at
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.830
after Hubble because he was looking at
the Stars

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
the Stars
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.410

he was an astronomer studying various

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
he was an astronomer studying various
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.170
he was an astronomer studying various
types of stars and he could identify

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180
types of stars and he could identify
 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.060
types of stars and he could identify
different types of stars and then

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
different types of stars and then
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.910
different types of stars and then
realized that all of them of a certain

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
realized that all of them of a certain
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.569
realized that all of them of a certain
type were moving farther away fast at a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
type were moving farther away fast at a
 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.330
type were moving farther away fast at a
very high speed and he determined this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
very high speed and he determined this
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760
very high speed and he determined this
through this famous expression the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
through this famous expression the
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.469
through this famous expression the
redshift he noticed that the stars were

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
redshift he noticed that the stars were
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.120
redshift he noticed that the stars were
slightly redder than he would have

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
slightly redder than he would have
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.910
slightly redder than he would have
expected and this he attributed to their

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
expected and this he attributed to their
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010
expected and this he attributed to their
speed stretching the wavelengths of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
speed stretching the wavelengths of
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.859
speed stretching the wavelengths of
light out it's amazing and this was

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
light out it's amazing and this was
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.580
light out it's amazing and this was
around 1927 nine 28:29 Hubble realized

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
around 1927 nine 28:29 Hubble realized
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.080
around 1927 nine 28:29 Hubble realized
the universe was expanding and this was

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090
the universe was expanding and this was
 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.160
the universe was expanding and this was
consistent with certain aspects of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
consistent with certain aspects of
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.620

then in your lifetime Artie people

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
then in your lifetime Artie people
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.260
then in your lifetime Artie people
discovered that the universe is not only

expanded that space itself is expanding
it's a hard idea if you're not troubled

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
it's a hard idea if you're not troubled
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.990
it's a hard idea if you're not troubled
by this idea you're I don't know you're

they discover is universe is

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
they discover is universe is
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.610
they discover is universe is
accelerating and you know why it's

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
accelerating and you know why it's
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.690
accelerating and you know why it's
accelerating nobody knows why Marty and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
accelerating nobody knows why Marty and
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.300

this is the fascination this is a source

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310
this is the fascination this is a source

this is the fascination this is a source
it just makes us all crazy in a good way

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709
it just makes us all crazy in a good way
 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.860
it just makes us all crazy in a good way
and so in this mix now it's been

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
and so in this mix now it's been
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.080
and so in this mix now it's been
discovered that there is about five

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090
discovered that there is about five
 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.410
discovered that there is about five

that we can't see which is come to be
 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.050
that we can't see which is come to be
called dark matter and it's about five

called dark matter and it's about five
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.180
called dark matter and it's about five
times as much of that as there is of the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.300
basic research because these discoveries
are important to us that's why it's how

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310
are important to us that's why it's how
 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.349
are important to us that's why it's how
we have nuclear power plants it's how we

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
we have nuclear power plants it's how we
 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.909
we have nuclear power plants it's how we
have the internet is understanding this

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
have the internet is understanding this
 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.310
have the internet is understanding this
physics

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320
physics
 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.130
physics
of subatomic particles and how they

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140
of subatomic particles and how they
 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.530
of subatomic particles and how they
relate to the physics of the cosmos our

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540
relate to the physics of the cosmos our
 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.680
relate to the physics of the cosmos our
place in space and so who knows what the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690
place in space and so who knows what the
 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.990
place in space and so who knows what the
next great discovery will lead to but

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000
next great discovery will lead to but
 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.690
next great discovery will lead to but
it's worth pursuing because we all want

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700
it's worth pursuing because we all want
 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.000
it's worth pursuing because we all want
to know where we came from we want to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010
to know where we came from we want to
 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.010
to know where we came from we want to
know where we fit in the cosmos our

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020
know where we fit in the cosmos our
 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.350
know where we fit in the cosmos our
place in space cool question

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360
place in space cool question
 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.780
place in space cool question
carry on
