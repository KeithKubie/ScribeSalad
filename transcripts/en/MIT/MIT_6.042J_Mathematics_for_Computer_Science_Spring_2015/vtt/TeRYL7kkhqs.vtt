00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.920
PROFESSOR: The elements
that have inverses modulo

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.580
and will be particularly
important to us.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.820
And so the first
question is how many of

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.770
them are there, which is what
Euler's function tells us.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.540
So the definition of
Euler's function, phi of n,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.520
is it's the number of
integers in the remainder

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.240
interval from 0
to n minus 1 such

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.350
that k is relatively prime to n.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.890
So remember, there's the
notation for the remainder

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.030
interval that includes
0 and excludes n.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.500
And another way to say
relatively prime to n

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.170
is to say the gcd
of k and n is 1.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.460
So let's define
that set of numbers

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.460
that we're interested
in-- gcd1 of n [? be ?]

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.020
those numbers that
have a gcd of 1 with n.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.920
That is, the numbers that have
inverses and the numbers that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.660
are cancellable modulo n.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.710
So what it means
is that phi of n

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.690
is precisely equal to
the size of gcd1 of n.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.300
Now, some authors
call gcd1 n star.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.210
I didn't find that a
very informative notation

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.220
and so I'm not using it.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.700
phi of n is also, for
your information, called

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.500
Euler's totient
function, but we'll just

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.760
stick to calling it
phi or Euler's phi.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.280
So let's look at an
example-- gcd1 of 7.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.170
The numbers that are
relatively prime to 7

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.000
are all the positive numbers
less than 7 because 7 is prime.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.120
So it's the set
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.970
gcd1 of 12 is the
numbers that have

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.080
no factor in common with 12.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.510
They are the numbers
in green below.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.710
And the other red
numbers do have

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.220
a number in common with 12-- do
have a prime in common with 12.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.880
The pattern here
is not so apparent.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.810
Anyway, phi of 7 is the
size of gcd1 of 7-- namely

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.180
the size of the set 1
through 6, which is 6.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.390
gcd 12 determines
phi of 12. phi of 12

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.830
is the number of green
elements, which is 4.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.960
OK.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.760
A simple rule for
calculating phi.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.880
When phi is prime we've
already indicated,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.880
namely, everything--
every positive number

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.610
less than p is
relatively prime to p.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.480
And so phi of p is
simply p minus 1.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.910
Let's look at a more
important example,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.880
or illustrative example--
namely, phi of 9.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.260
Well, OK.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.470
So there are the
candidate numbers from 0

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.250
through 8, and which ones
are relatively prime to 9?

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.120
Well, it's relatively
prime to 9 if and only

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.280
if it's relatively prime to 3.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.980
Now, which numbers
in this interval

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.520
are relatively prime to--
are relatively prime to 3,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.060
or, rather, are not
relatively prime to 3?

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.100
Well, it's every third
number that's divisible by 3.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.710
So, those are the bad ones.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.550
If we subtract the bad ones,
we're left with the good ones--

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.580
the ones that are
relatively prime.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.240
So a phi of 9 is simply
the set of all the numbers

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.400
minus 1/3 of 9, which is the
bad one-- bad one's namely 6.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.990
This generalizes to
a power of a prime.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.680
If k is a positive
integer then phi of p

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.250
to the k-- the reasoning is
that a number is relatively

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.130
prime to the p to
the k if and only

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.090
if it's relatively prime to p.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.870
p divides every pth
number, so one pth

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.020
of the numbers in
the interval are bad,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:45.260
which means that phi of p is
the good ones minus 1 pth of p

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.360
to the k.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.810
Namely, phi of p to the k is
p to the k minus p to the k

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.370
over p, which can
also be expressed

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.020
in a more standard
form-- p to the k

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.650
minus p to the power k minus 1.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.610
And that knocks off
the story of phi

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.199
to the p for powers of primes.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.240
Well, suppose you're
dealing with a number that's

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.960
not a power of a prime.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.900
And there's one very elegant
little fact about phi

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.200
that explains how to deal
with non powers of primes.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.300
Namely, if a and b
are relatively prime,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.070
then phi of a b is simply
gotten by computing phi of a

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.010
and multiplying it by phi of b.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.100
This property of phi is called
multiplicativity, by the way.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.050
It comes up a lot
in number theory.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.600
A function is
multiplicative when

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.750
its value at a product of
relatively prime numbers

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.980
is the product of the
values at those two

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.130
relatively prime numbers.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.390
So phi is multiplicative.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:54.010
Now, the proof of that-- one
proof is on problem set 5,

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.050
and there's another proof that
we'll see in a couple of weeks

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.110
when we get into counting the
inclusion-exclusion principle.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.920
Let's just use this
fact about phi--

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.040
the multiplicity of phi--
multiplicativity of phi

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.170
to see how it lets us calculate
phi of an arbitrary number.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.910
So, in particular, phi of
12-- which looked complicated

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.900
earlier-- well, 12 is 3 times 4.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.990
So that means that phi of 12
is phi of 3 times phi of 4.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.310
But now I'm in great
shape because 3

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.940
is a power of a prime,
namely 3 to the 1.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.700
And 4 is a power of a
prime, namely 2 squared.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.890
So applying the power of prime
formulas, I get that phi of 3

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.690
is 3 times 1 times 2 squared
minus 2 to the 2 minus 1,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.110
which simplifies to 4, which is
the answer that we saw before.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.200
And the punchline for
why we're examining phi

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.440
is Euler's theorem,
which tells us

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.890
how powers of numbers
in gcd1 of n behave.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.670
Namely, that if k is
relatively prime to n, then

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.220
if you raise k to
the power phi of n,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.136
it's congruent to 1 mod n.

00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:05.140
And that will lead us.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.480
In the next section we
will look at the proof

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.960
of Euler's theorem.
