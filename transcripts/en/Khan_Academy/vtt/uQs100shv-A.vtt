00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.700
We're asked to use
the drop-downs to form

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.330
a linear equation
with no solutions.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.990
So a linear equation
with no solutions

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.520
is going to be one where I don't
care how you manipulate it,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.160
the thing on the
left can never be

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.494
equal to the thing on the right.

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:16.284
And so let's see what
options they give us.

00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:18.440
One, they want us to-- we
can pick the coefficient

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.840
on the x term and then
we can pick the constant.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.000
So if we made this
negative 11x, so now

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.420
we have a negative
11x on both sides.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.380
Here on the left hand side,
we have negative 11x plus 4.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.159
If we do something other
than 4 here, so if we did

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.160
say negative 11x minus
11, then here we're

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.810
not going to have any solutions.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.120
And you say, hey, Sal how
did you come up with that?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.620
Well think about
it right over here.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.109
We have a negative 11x here,
we have a negative 11x there.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.900
If you wanted to solve
it algebraically you

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.550
could add 11x to both sides
and both of these terms

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.430
will cancel out with each other
and all you would be left with

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.010
is a 4 is equal to
a negative 11, which

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.840
is not possible for
any x that you pick.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.920
Another way that you
think about it is here we

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.880
have negative 11
times some number

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.005
and we're adding 4
to it, and here we're

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.130
taking negative 11 times
that same number and we're

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.860
subtracting 11 from it.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.850
So if you take a negative
11 times some number

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.820
and on one side you add four,
and on the other side you

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.120
subtract 11, there's no way, it
doesn't matter what x you pick.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.020
There's no x for which
that is going to be true.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.830
But let's check our
answer right over here.
