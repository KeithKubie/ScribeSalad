As you all know, the
Opposition Media Network

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.305
is the leader in exposing the
lies that exist all around us.

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:09.575
But I can't do all the exposing
by myself here at this desk.

don't believe in anything,

to be paid to show up.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.008
