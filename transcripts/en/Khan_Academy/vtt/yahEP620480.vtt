00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.036
Inflation - and when most people talk about inflation, they talk

00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:11.703
about price inflation. And that's just the increase in general level of prices for goods and services.

00:00:11.703 --> 00:00:15.395
And you probably have a sense of that. That every year in kind of a normal

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:18.228
economy things seem to a little bit more expensive, although not

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:20.944
everything does. Especially if you look at something like

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:25.403
healthcare, cost of education, you definitely see things getting

00:00:25.403 --> 00:00:29.443
more expensive. One interesting question is how do you

00:00:29.443 --> 00:00:33.692
measure it? How do you measure inflation? And what the

00:00:33.692 --> 00:00:37.082
Bureau of Labor Statistics does - this is actually the most used

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:39.288
measurement of inflation. They create something called a

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:43.003
Consumer Price Index. And the way they do it is they define a

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:46.858
basket of goods - actually a basket of goods and services.

00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:49.946
So what they do is go and look at the average urban consumer

00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:53.731
and they say "what do they need in their life?". "They may need some

00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:58.073
housing, they might need some fuel - natural gas for their home

00:00:58.073 --> 00:01:03.205
they need gasoline for their cars, energy in other ways. They might need

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:09.265
some type of services - they might need transportation". And they try to come up

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:14.211
with a basket of all of the things that the average consumer in

00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:17.926
an urban environment might need. And they figure out how much

00:01:17.926 --> 00:01:21.734
that would cost them in year One. And let's say that in year One,

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:26.076
that it costs them a hundred dollars - the actual basket CPI constructs would not

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:29.258
cost a hundred dollars. But I am going to do this for the sake of

00:01:29.258 --> 00:01:33.019
simplicity. And they will weight these based on how much - what percentage they think

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:35.457
people spend on housing vs. fuel vs. services vs. transportation.

00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:40.728
Then, they will look at the same basket each year after that.

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:43.886
So then they will do the same things - Housing, fuel, services,

00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:50.527
transportation. And this will be in year Two now. And let's say

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:55.775
the same basket costs one hundred and two dollars. Well, then they

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:59.374
will say the general level of price and services for this consumer

00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:02.207
went up by two dollars or went up by more important

00:02:02.207 --> 00:02:06.874
thing is by the percentage - by two percent. So, based on this

00:02:06.874 --> 00:02:12.098
measure, based on this basket of goods, prices went up by two percent.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:15.117
Or you'll hear the people on news say this "Inflation rate went

00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:21.293
up by two percent". Now, I want to clarify - what inflation - sometimes talks to inflation

00:02:21.293 --> 00:02:24.916
in the money supply. People talk about there's more money being

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:28.538
printed. And often increase in money supply is one of the factors

00:02:28.538 --> 00:02:33.020
that is driving price inflation. When most people talk

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.876
about inflation, they are talking about price inflation. They are

00:02:35.876 --> 00:02:40.009
talking about increase in prices. They are not directly talking about

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.538
the increase in the money supply. Now this seems like a pretty

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.232
simple thing to do - but it is not as simple as you might first

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:51.340
think. Because think about something like TV sets or especially anything

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.052
that is technological. Do you look at the same TV set that is getting probably cheaper every year or do you look at the average

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:59.351
TV Set that the American household is having. Do you look

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:03.484
at the same computer that is getting significantly cheaper every

00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:06.874
year or you look at the average computer every year? Then you

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:09.475
would actually be looking at a different product. So there's actually a lot

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.866
of things to think about and a lot of things how can weight this.

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:16.023
And there's been a lot of controversy in when the weightings

00:03:16.023 --> 00:03:18.577
change in different periods of time. But this is the general idea

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:22.199
and it is really just the best attempt to figure out on average

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:27.192
how much more expensive or how much purchasing power are

00:03:27.192 --> 99:59:59.999
we loosing from one year to the next.
