00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:08.401
We live in a society

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.336
obsessed with music.

00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:12.323
We use music to worship,

00:00:12.323 --> 00:00:13.621
tell stories,

00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:14.738
to celebrate,

00:00:14.738 --> 00:00:16.180
to work,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.543
exercise,

00:00:17.543 --> 00:00:19.514
declare our love

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:21.270
and sometimes our hatred,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.710
and, arguably most importantly,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.453
to dance.

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:27.380
And, of course, we play music ourselves

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.021
because, well, it's a pleasant thing to do.

00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:33.026
Thousands of years ago 
in Ancient Greece,

00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:34.306
when it came to music,

00:00:34.306 --> 00:00:36.779
things weren't much different.

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:39.020
They might have had lyres and tunics

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.261
instead of MP3 players and jeans,

00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:43.182
but the Ancient Greeks 
were just as obsessed

00:00:43.182 --> 00:00:45.019
with music as we are today.

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.236
In fact, music was such 
an important part

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:48.686
of Ancient Greek society

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:51.718
that it makes us seem 
tame by comparison.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.305
To really understand just 
how integral music was

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:55.686
to the Ancient Greeks,

00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:57.329
let's begin by acquainting ourselves

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.658
with a bit of their mythology.

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:01.265
In Ancient Greek mythology,

00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:03.543
it was believed that human creativity

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.929
was the result of divine inspiration

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.963
from a group of goddesses 
known as the Muses.

00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:11.266
While scholars have argued 
over the years

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.308
that there are anything 
between 3 and 13 Muses,

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:17.315
the standard number accepted today is 9.

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:19.960
Each Muse oversees her own specific area

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.714
of artistic expertise,

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.464
ranging from song and dance

00:01:23.464 --> 00:01:26.048
to history and astronomy.

00:01:26.048 --> 00:01:27.714
It might seem strange to categorize

00:01:27.714 --> 00:01:29.900
history and astronomy 
as creative pursuits,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.729
but the Ancient Greeks 
saw these disciplines

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.943
as more than just school subjects.

00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:37.191
These were the hallmarks of civilization

00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.681
in what, to their eyes,

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.847
was a pretty barbaric world.

00:01:40.847 --> 00:01:42.909
An educated, civilized person

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.711
was expected to be proficient

00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:46.423
in all aspects of creative thought

00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:48.009
inspired by the Muses,

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.057
and the common medium

00:01:49.057 --> 00:01:50.529
through which these 
disciplines were taught,

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:51.274
studied,

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.297
and disseminated

00:01:52.297 --> 00:01:54.520
was music.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.340
You see, it's no coincidence

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.584
that the word Muse is very similar

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:00.227
to the word music.

00:02:00.227 --> 00:02:02.320
It's where the word originates.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.148
Poetry, be it a love poem

00:02:04.148 --> 00:02:07.184
or an epic poem about 
a dragon-slaying hero,

00:02:07.184 --> 00:02:09.692
was sung with a musical accompaniment.

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:11.741
Dancing and singing, obviously,

00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:13.494
were accompanied by music.

00:02:13.494 --> 00:02:15.602
Theater was always a combination

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.036
of spoken word and music.

00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:20.749
History was recounted through song.

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.296
Even the study of astronomy

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:24.038
was linked to the same physical principles

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:25.383
as musical harmony,

00:02:25.383 --> 00:02:27.553
such as the belief held 
by many Greek thinkers

00:02:27.553 --> 00:02:29.602
that each of the planets and stars

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:31.305
created their own unique sound

00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:32.757
as they traveled through the cosmos,

00:02:32.757 --> 00:02:35.105
thrumming like 
an enormous guitar string

00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:36.971
light-years long.

00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.558
However, music pervaded 
more aspects of their lives

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:41.141
than just education.

00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:42.639
Ancient Greeks considered music

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.439
to be the basis for understanding

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.479
the fundamental interconnectedness

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.857
of all things in the universe.

00:02:48.857 --> 00:02:50.569
This concept of connectivity

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.940
is known as harmonia,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.515
and it's where we get the word harmony.

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.580
Music was used as a form of medicine

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.605
to treat illnesses and physical complaints,

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:01.804
as a vital accompaniment 
to sporting contests,

00:03:01.804 --> 00:03:03.702
and as a means to keep workers in time

00:03:03.702 --> 00:03:08.522
as they toiled away on 
monotonous or menial tasks.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.127
One of the most important applications

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:12.211
of music in Ancient Greek society

00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:13.173
is found in the belief

00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:16.355
that music can affect a person's ethos.

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:17.935
A word we still use today,

00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:19.551
ethos is a person's guiding beliefs

00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:20.859
or personal ethics,

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.307
the way that one behaves

00:03:22.307 --> 00:03:24.437
towards oneself and others.

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:25.851
The Greek philosopher Plato,

00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:27.105
one of the most famous

00:03:27.105 --> 00:03:29.102
and influential Greek 
thinkers of the time,

00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:31.399
asserted that music had a direct effect

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.328
on a person's ethos.

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:34.520
Certain kinds of music

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.104
could incite a person to violence

00:03:36.104 --> 00:03:38.024
while others could placate a person

00:03:38.024 --> 00:03:40.791
into a benign, unthinking stupor.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:42.880
According to Plato,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.629
only very specific types of music

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.398
were beneficial to a person's ethos.

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:49.021
One should only listen to music

00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:50.582
that promotes intelligence,

00:03:50.582 --> 00:03:51.378
self-discipline,

00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:52.517
and courage,

00:03:52.517 --> 00:03:56.259
and all other kinds 
of music must be avoided.

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.350
Furthermore, Plato fervently denounced

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.190
any music that deviated

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.682
from established musical conventions,

00:04:01.682 --> 00:04:03.160
fearing that doing so

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.806
would lead to the degradation

00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:06.603
of the standards of civilization,

00:04:06.603 --> 00:04:07.896
the corruption of youth,

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:12.274
and eventually complete 
and utter anarchy.

00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:14.604
While Plato's fears can seem extreme,

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:16.780
this argument has appeared 
in modern times

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.938
to condemn musical trends

00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:20.492
such as jazz or punk or rap.

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:21.999
What do you think Plato would say

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.888
about the music you listen to?

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.183
Is it beneficial to your ethos,

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.615
or will it degenerate you

00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:30.801
into a gibbering, amoral barbarian?
