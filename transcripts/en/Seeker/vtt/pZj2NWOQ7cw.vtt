00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.050
Down syndrome occurs is the leading genetic
disorder in the world, and a new study might

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.800
have found a way to reverse it.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:16.299
Hey everyone, Trace here for DNews with some
interesting new breakthroughs concerning Down

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.299
syndrome.

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:22.370
The genetic disorder is caused by an improper
replication of chromosomes with the 21st having

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.690
a little extra.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.100
A comprehensive distinction was created by
John Langdon Down in 1866...

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.210
He, rather insensitively, called people with
Down syndrome "mongoloids."

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.899
Arguably an upgrade from the term "idiot"
which they'd previously been associated.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.149
// People were really mean in history!

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.949
// By the 1950s we knew it was a chromosomal
genetic condition, but it wasn't until the

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.730
2000s that we really figured this thing out.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.510
Down syndrome can be diagnosed in the womb,
and manifests outwardly with an upward slant

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.059
to almond-shaped eyes, a flatter face structure,
small ears, hands, feet, neck and overall

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.219
stature, low muscle tone and a crease across
the palm.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:09.020
Doctors, however, are focusing on the INTERNAL
genetic changes -- namely those in the brain.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.829
People with Down have a smaller cerebellum
-- the part of the brain associated with motor

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.750
control -- and a smaller hippocampus thought
to work with memory and understanding of space.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.409
A study published in Science Translational
Medicine claims a new drug may reverse the

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.990
cerebellum's abnormality!

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.939
The cerebellum in someone with Down is 40
percent smaller than the average brain.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.789
Mice genetically engineered to have Down were
given a drug on the day they were born designed

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.299
to stimulate the growth of the cerebellum.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.719
The Sonic Hedgehog protein affects the signals
for embryonic cell development in bilateral

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.850
brain animals -- Yes.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.170
It was named after Sega's mascot.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.780
The drug they injected was called the "sonic
hedgehog pathway antagonist," you can't make

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.780
this stuff up.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.780
I love science.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.469
Not only did it work, restoring the cerebellum
to 100 percent normal, but the mice's learning

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.139
and memory improved too -- even though the
hippocampus remained unchanged!

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:13.230
The Down mice who'd been treated with the
sonic hedgehog pathway antagonist performed

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.010
JUST AS WELL as the normal mice without the
chromosomal engineering.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.620
This was shocking.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.810
The researchers aren't sure HOW this treatment
helps the brain perform normally, but they

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.150
assume the regular-sized cerebellum must be
able to better communicate with the hippocampus?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.100
They know they need more study, either way.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.819
There are 6,000 Down syndrome babies born
every year in the U.S. and thanks to medical

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.280
science, the lifespan of someone with the
disorder has skyrocketed from 9 years in 1910,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.689
and only 25 in 1980.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.590
Today, it's 60.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.040
When this study was released, many websites
claimed it was a QUOTE "single dose cure,"

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.099
but we've got a lot more to do.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.659
People with Down syndrome won't be cured by
this drug, but it's a HUGE step in the right

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.739
direction for understanding potential treatments!

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:00.739
Go get a degree in science and help!

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.709
Do you know another genetic disorder you'd
like to know more about?

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.390
Maybe that you'd like to see a cure for?
