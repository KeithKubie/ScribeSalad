00:00:00.364 --> 00:00:02.442
- So I have a very simple
equation written here

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:06.366
a plus b is equal to c and
what I want to think about

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.443
if we know that a is an
integer, so let's say that this

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:14.443
is the set of all integers
right over here. Integers.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:18.997
We know that a is an integer
so let's say that's a there.

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:21.841
We also know that b is an
integer, could be the same integer

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.002
but I'll draw it so it
looks like it's another one,

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.322
it doesn't have to be but they
could be the same integer.

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:27.599
B is an integer.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.341
If we're adding these two integers,

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.989
are we definitely going
to get another integer?

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.120
Do we know that c is
going to be an integer?

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.722
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it.

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:39.940
And when you've thought
about it, you might have

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.858
come up with some cases.

00:00:40.858 --> 00:00:41.925
Well, what if a and b are both one,

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:43.981
then for sure, c is going to be two.

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.046
And c is going to be an integer.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.206
Well is that always going to be the case?

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:50.040
Well, it is. There are ways to prove it.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.257
I'm not going to go into
it now but when you have

00:00:52.257 --> 00:00:53.720
a situation like this, when you're able

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.927
to take two members of
a set, in this case,

00:00:55.927 --> 00:00:58.665
two members of a set and
perform an operation on it,

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:02.380
and always get another member
of the set and it could be

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.038
a or b again or it could
be another distinct member

00:01:06.038 --> 00:01:08.684
of the set, I'll draw it
as another distinct member

00:01:08.684 --> 00:01:11.377
of the set, whenever you have this,

00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:14.362
so you have some operation,
in this case, it is addition.

00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:16.944
So when you're performing
the addition operation

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:20.542
on two members of the set,
you get, you stay in the set.

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:23.550
C is also going to be a member of that set

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.964
so one way to think about it, we're going,

00:01:25.964 --> 00:01:27.623
we're going like this and we are

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:29.969
performing this addition operation.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.279
Whenever you see a circumstance like this,

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.518
we call, we say that this set,

00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:39.083
the set of integers is
closed under addition.

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:40.282
Let me write that down.

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:45.282
So this means that the
set of integers, integers

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:52.405
is closed under, under addition.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.265
So once again, you're
going to hear this idea

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:58.482
of closure, it's the general term

00:01:58.482 --> 00:02:00.340
that we're talking about is closure

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.476
when you take some, especially in higher

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:03.764
mathematics course but
you might even hear it

00:02:03.764 --> 00:02:05.598
some of your high school courses

00:02:05.598 --> 00:02:08.478
and it might seem like
this really advanced thing

00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:10.603
but all it's saying is you have a set,

00:02:10.603 --> 00:02:12.356
you have some operation
that you can perform

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:14.154
on members of the set and if every time

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.023
you perform that operation
on members of the set

00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:18.903
you get, you stay in
the set, the result is

00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:22.317
a member of the set, then you
say that the set is closed

00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:26.078
under that operation, the
set is closed, in this case,

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.934
the operation is addition, you say

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:31.197
the set is closed under addition
and we can ask ourselves

00:02:31.197 --> 00:02:32.636
that same question about other things.

00:02:32.636 --> 00:02:37.636
Is the set of, is the set
of integers closed under,

00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:44.788
closed under, actually,
let's take some examples.

00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:49.788
Is it closed under
multiplication, multi-plication.

00:02:50.272 --> 00:02:53.418
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it.

00:02:53.418 --> 00:02:56.738
And then think about, is
it closed under division?

00:02:56.738 --> 00:03:01.738
Is it closed under division?
Is it closed under subtraction?

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:05.300
Is it closed under subtraction?

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.908
I encourage you to think about

00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:07.568
all these different operations.

00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:09.119
Let's take it one by one. Multiplication.

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:11.836
If you take two integers
and you were to multiply it,

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:14.552
you actually always
will get another integer

00:03:14.552 --> 00:03:19.115
so the set of integers is
closed under multiplication.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:20.554
Now, what about division?

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:22.319
Well, it's very easy to
prove a case, in which,

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.370
I'm dividing two integers and
not getting another integer.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.677
For example, I could say, let's
just do a very simple one.

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:34.382
One divided by two. One
and two are both integers

00:03:34.382 --> 00:03:35.855
but what's that going to give me?

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:39.918
That's going to give me 1/2
which is not, another integer.

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:42.136
This is a rational number but
not an integer so if we were

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.318
to extend our sets right over here.

00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:46.036
All integers are also rational but

00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:48.885
all rationals are not integers necessarily

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:52.344
so this is rational,
rational numbers here.

00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:56.234
This case of one divided
by two so that's one

00:03:56.234 --> 00:03:59.066
and this is two when
we performed division,

00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:02.363
we went out of the set, so
when we performed division,

00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:05.288
we out of that set to
something that's not an integer

00:04:05.288 --> 00:04:08.051
but it is a rational number
so the set of integers

00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:12.428
is not closed under
division. Subtraction? Sure!

00:04:12.428 --> 00:04:13.925
And once again, I'm
not going to rigorously

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:16.108
prove it here but take any two integers,

00:04:16.108 --> 00:04:19.209
you indeed are going to get another,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.137
you are going to get another integer.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.320
So the whole idea here is to just give you

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.930
a brief introduction to
the notion of closure.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.100
The idea that if you have
a set and if you perform

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.119
an operation on members of that set

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:36.033
and you always get a
member of your original set

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:40.375
then that set is closed
under that operation.

00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:42.171
What matters is that the set
that you're talking about

00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:43.949
in this case, we talked
a lot about integers

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.492
and we talked about
addition, multiplication,

00:04:45.492 --> 00:04:46.966
division, subtraction but you could think

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:50.042
about the set of polynomials
and whether they are

00:04:50.042 --> 00:04:52.899
closed under addition,
which they actually are

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:55.778
or the set of rational numbers.

00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:59.284
Are they closed under exponentiation?

00:04:59.284 --> 00:05:00.979
There's all sorts of
things we can think about

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.268
but hopefully, this gives you a good sense

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:05.019
of what we mean when we say closure

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:08.003
or for a set being closed
under some operation.
