00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.600
So I want you to fill out this report card, which says, how well is

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.930
AFS doing as a secure system. And I want you to think about

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.870
some of the challenges that a secure system

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.890
has to face. The first one is mutual suspicion.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.010
Meaning can I trust the server. Can the server trust the client? Can I trust my

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.950
fellow users in the community? Is that challenge

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.759
addressed by AFS? I want you to give a

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.290
binary answer, yes or no. The second attribute I

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.630
want you to evaluate the Andrew file system on

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.920
is whether the users are protected from the system,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.290
or in other words, can the system do something

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.280
bad to the users? So that's the second attribute

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.270
I want you to evaluate. Once again, a binary

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.380
answer, yes or no. And the third attribute is confinement of resource

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.500
usage. In other words, does the system ensure that no

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.380
particular user can overuse resources available

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.420
in the system. The resources could be network bandwidth and so on. Again, binary

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.645
answer. The fourth thing that I want you to evaluate the AFS system is

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:20.420
on authentication. Whether it provides authentication in

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.370
both ways. Both authenticating the server to

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.560
the client and the client to the server. The last attribute is the integrity of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.660
the server itself, meaning can the server be compromised in any fashion. That is

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.170
the last attribute I want you to evaluate. Once again binary answer, yes or no.
