WEBVTT

1
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.600
So let me just start with,
um,
father,

2
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.580
and this is a really interesting image of foreigner in Japan.

3
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:22.280
We know their partners so much associated with,
um,
Oxford,
Mississippi.

4
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.360
Um,
but he actually a travel quite a bit.
Um,

5
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.410
under the sponsorship of the State Department.
He was there because he,

6
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.490
the State Department asked them to,
uh,
travel around and um,

7
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.350
to give talks.
Um,
and what's interesting about Faulkner in Japan,

8
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.040
um,

9
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.040
is that some of the most interesting things that he says about his own novels.

10
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.580
Um,
we're actually set when he was in Japan,
um,

11
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.800
in the course of the [inaudible] seminar,

12
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.370
1955.
Um,
and this is really what he's asked about.
Um,

13
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.980
the sound of fury.
This is how the book grew.

14
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.210
That is,
I wrote the same story four times.

15
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.280
None of them were right,

16
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.090
but I had anguish so much that I could not throw any of it away and start over.

17
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.720
So I printed it in the four sections.
I mean,
there's obviously tongue in cheek.

18
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.880
He was saying that,
you know,
he's written so much in four different ways,

19
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.650
um,
that he can bear to get rid of any of it.

20
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:39.480
So in it's keeping all four and it's the same story told four times,

21
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.430
um,
tongue in cheek,
but there's an element of truth in it.
Um,

22
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.980
so,
uh,
less,
uh,

23
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.240
try out follow Faulkner in that thought.

24
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.270
Um,
and thing of the sound,
the fury,

25
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.450
the four sections of the sound and the fury as theme and variation.

26
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.360
Right.
So,
you know,
it was a very interesting musical structure,

27
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:05.890
theme and variation,
um,

28
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.650
basically is really the same story but told from four different points of view

29
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.770
using four different narrative techniques,
um,

30
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.500
and so producing different effects,

31
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.860
but really they are all rooted in the same phenomenon,
which makes sense.

32
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.350
It's really the same story.
Um,
and other way to think about this,
um,

33
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.290
and this is really a kind of adding on to,
um,

34
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:31.800
have a sense that this is theme and variation,
um,
is the notion of kinship.

35
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:36.660
And this is really closer to our thematic understanding of the novel,
um,

36
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.200
that,
um,
the three brothers,
each,
uh,

37
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.710
guests to tell his story in one section.

38
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:48.100
And then the fourth section is Toby.
Uh,
just an admonition,
uh,

39
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.830
narrators.
So,
but the first resections are two of other three concen brothers.

40
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.780
So there is a kinship among them.
Um,

41
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.800
and we'll think about,
uh,
the extend to which,
um,
they are brothers,

42
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.860
um,
the kin in both a biological science,
uh,

43
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.540
but perhaps also in something,
uh,

44
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.800
in more than just a biological sense.
So,
um,

45
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.700
let me just lay out the three ways in which,
um,

46
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.750
Benji and Quentin my be seen as kin.

47
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.830
Um,
and this is very much using the street analytic,
uh,

48
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.430
registers that we've been using all the way through.
Um,

49
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.020
the three analytics scales,
the largest scale to share macro history.

50
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.030
This is common sensical.
They live in the United States after the civil war,

51
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:46.450
so that is the common ground between them.
Um,
and in fact,

52
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.680
it doesn't take brothers to have that common ground.
Um,
and,
um,

53
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.300
especially thinking about race relations and the tomorrow of race,

54
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.330
thinking back to that line from my best in five f fives in five.

55
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.480
Um,
so that's the largest,
um,
you know,

56
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.220
ground for kinship between them.
Um,
and then there's another round for Kensho,

57
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.250
which has to do obviously with Walkman is narrative experimentation and the

58
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.770
traumatic loss of Cali that we saw last time.

59
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:21.010
This being repeated in the in section.
Uh,

60
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.040
likewise the incomplete syntax that is so striking and Benji will also be

61
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.680
repeated.
And Quentin.
Um,

62
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.410
and finally the important of the sense of smell of that is in Benji,
uh,

63
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.380
would also be repeated.
And Quentin,
uh,

64
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.270
we'll look at the kinship first and then we'll look at,

65
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.110
um,
uh,
variation.
You know,
even though they're brothers,
they're different as well.

66
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.580
So basically today's lecture is about kinship and variation,

67
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.600
but let's start with a kinship.
And I want to talk a little bit,
um,

68
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.760
about race after the civil war,

69
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.940
especially Faulkner's understanding of that.

70
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.670
So in is,
um,

71
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.870
not in 56 interview with the London Sunday Times.

72
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.870
Faulkner has this very interesting thing to say.

73
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.740
And in the ro one come out on top because anything to do with race,

74
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.720
but because he has always gotten by without scope,

75
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.650
when they'd giving skull,
they use it fully.

76
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.520
They are trained to do more than a white men can do with the same limitations.

77
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.153
<v 1>So</v>

78
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.260
this will be fine.

79
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.160
<v 0>Um,
so,
um,</v>

80
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.420
oh,
so,
um,
this is,
um,
the,
um,
the,
the way that I'll be like,

81
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.500
the thing about race is by going back to minutes Beth,

82
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.790
since five f five,
scene five.
And um,

83
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.940
the first line Ashley after Beth,
um,

84
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.770
[inaudible] I've seen five is tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.
Um,

85
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.480
and thinking that mapping that onto raised relations,
uh,

86
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.330
we see that,
uh,
Benji's 33 years or,
um,

87
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.840
what kinds of future does he have?
Um,

88
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.140
and what kind of future,
um,

89
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.920
do the other black characters have.
Uh,

90
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.520
so let's look at Benji first and thinking about what future,

91
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.150
what tomorrow holds for Benjamin.
And um,

92
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.940
this is very early on,
the opening of the Benji section.

93
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.980
Listen at you now.

94
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.030
Lust to set into something there in three years or going on that way after I'd

95
00:06:52.991 --> 00:06:55.990
done when all the way to town to buy you that cake,

96
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.230
hush up that morning.
Integral in to help me find that quarter.

97
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.860
So I can go to the show tonight.
Um,

98
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.310
Benji can talk obviously.
Um,

99
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.330
so luster is the one who was doing all the talking.

100
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:12.440
Um,

101
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.440
but I think the Faulkner's seems almost to the emphasizing that luster is the

102
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:24.440
player in the present and he's going to be the player in the future.

103
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.880
And everything that has been done by Benji is being done by luster and doc to

104
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:37.190
some extent the two black characters.
It's mother isn't doing anything for him.

105
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.130
Quentin,
the stead Kelly is gone.
Um,
so,

106
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.940
um,

107
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.940
luster is Benji's only significant other at this point.

108
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.740
Um,
and if for no other reason,
um,

109
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:59.050
the future belongs Benji to the extent that Benji could have a future and their

110
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:03.800
future can come only from luster.

111
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.160
So it's a really interesting way to think about the future of as being raised,

112
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.880
mediated and raised.
Dependent.
Ng is completely helpless,

113
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.510
overly luster,
can give him the future.
Um,
and lost is doing that.
Um,

114
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.860
all the things that catty used to do lustre is doing.

115
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.950
Um,
he's telling Benji to hush.

116
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.470
He's gone all the way to town to buy a birthday cake for Benji because Benji is

117
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:37.010
33 that day.
Um,

118
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.980
and so in that sense,
he's a very good,

119
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:42.890
significant other to Benji,

120
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.760
but more than that we see that lasted Ashley has alive apart from Benji.

121
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.670
The last sentence of that passage,

122
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.300
Angel going to help me find a quarter so I can go to the show tonight.

123
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.010
Um,
less than wants to go to the show completely independent of Benji.

124
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.310
Um,
he has his own desires.
He has a life,
um,

125
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.390
apart from Benjy and Benjy is really just an Osi as appendage and this case,

126
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.260
someone who should help them to find that quarter so we can go to the shop,

127
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.420
pay for the show and go to a show.
Um,

128
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.480
so all of this is to suggest that the playing field has been re configurated.

129
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.500
Um,
and who is at the center,
who is the main play?

130
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:32.820
Who's the protagonist in this drama that is unfolding into the future?

131
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.900
That really is an open question and this is a strong suggestion that the playing

132
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:41.901
field has been so reconstituted that black heritage would be the protagonists.

133
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.420
Um,
so let's,
um,

134
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.360
think more about the tomorrow of race.
Um,

135
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.580
but in this going off in a slightly different direction and this is the very,

136
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.060
and towards the very end of the Benji session book.

137
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.600
So basically we are looking at the two moments that bracket the Benji section.

138
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.370
Once again,
Benji is with his significant other luster.

139
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.470
He put my gown on,

140
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.640
I hush and then to stop his head to what?

141
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:15.390
The window that he went to the window and look out.

142
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.220
He came back and took my arm.
Here she come.
He said,

143
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.910
be quiet now.
We went to the window and looked out.

144
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.460
It came out over Quentin's window and climbed across into the tree.

145
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.140
We wash the tree shaking,
the shaking,
went down the tree.

146
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.730
Then it came out and we watched it go across the grass.

147
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.670
Then we couldn't see it.
Come on,

148
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:44.730
Lester said they are now hear them horns.

149
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.800
You get in that bed where my foot's behaves okay is completely ungrammatical and

150
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:51.900
that's just fine.
Um,

151
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.830
the future can belong to people who don't speak standard English is not a

152
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:56.990
problem.
Uh,

153
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:02.090
but what is interesting here is that we're seeing something that only one person

154
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.380
understands.
We are actually in exactly the same position as Benji.

155
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:10.770
We have no idea what's going on.
Um,

156
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.700
the meaning of what they're watching,
whatever it is,

157
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:18.640
they've coming out of Quentin's window and this is the female went and the

158
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.640
daughter of Catty,
um,
whatever's happening,

159
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:28.080
whatever's coming out of [inaudible] window was going to come after that.

160
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.200
What occasions that movement,
that window,

161
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.950
all this will not be disclosed to us until section three when we get to the

162
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.410
Jason Section.
Um,

163
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:45.470
so this was really interesting digital wrench or of knowledge in this moment.

164
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.270
Um,
Benji obviously doesn't know what's going on.

165
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.280
We,
the readers also don't know what's going on.

166
00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:00.270
The only person who is fully in command of the requisite knowledge is last year.

167
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.250
Um,
I think that this is very deliberately set up by far,
um,

168
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:10.060
to highlight the extent to which black characters have knowledge in agency.

169
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.810
Um,
so,
um,
so much for Benji and obviously Benji is a part,

170
00:12:15.811 --> 00:12:19.540
you know,
of the black world.
Um,
I think that,
you know,

171
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.590
we maybe we should even suspend,
you know,

172
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:27.550
I mean Benji looks white,
he's pleased,
he actually,
um,

173
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.840
but we can think of him as really part and parcel of the black world and his

174
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:36.460
wellbeing is completely dependent and offer piece with the wellbeing of the

175
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:40.120
black wall.
Um,
but that is not the case with Quentin,

176
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.910
although Clinton also has very important,
uh,

177
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.300
non trivial relations,
two black characters.
Um,

178
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.360
and one black character who was following him around is the Deacon,

179
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.460
right?
So this is a black man in Massachusetts.
Um,

180
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.650
and this is what the Deacon says to Quentin.
Yes sir.
Right.
This way,

181
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:07.540
young master here way is taking your bags from then on until he had you

182
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:09.280
completely subjugated.

183
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.820
He was always in and out of your room,

184
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.610
ubiquitous and gorillas.

185
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.960
There was manner gradually move northward as his Raymond improve until at last

186
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.770
when they had bled you until you began to learn better and it was called you

187
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.750
Quinten.
Um,

188
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.780
so this is a black man who is definitely not the same as the lusters [inaudible]

189
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.470
who have stayed on in Mississippi.

190
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.800
This is a black man who has moved north and here is important to um,

191
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.370
have some sense of the historical background,
um,

192
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.690
that Faulkner is alluding to.
A black man going north.

193
00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.670
This turns out to be one of the key at Osos in African American history,

194
00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:04.360
which is the great migration if that happens in several ways.

195
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.040
What we are seeing here is the first wave of the great migration.
Uh,

196
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:14.100
from 19 around roughly from 1910 to 1930 2 million African Americans went out to

197
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.430
south to the north,
to the Midwest and West.
Um,

198
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.240
and here's one image of the great migration.

199
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:29.170
The train station almost completely filled with,
uh,
blacks.

200
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.340
And um,

201
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.840
here's the wonderful painting by the pain of Jacob Lawrence.

202
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.830
Um,
if you are in these,

203
00:14:36.831 --> 00:14:41.290
the make sure to go to the Philips collection,
um,

204
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.810
is a,
is a really interesting collection.

205
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.590
It's just a private collection that great paintings.
Um,

206
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.030
and they have the Jacob Lawrence are the great migration series,
um,

207
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.330
almost 50 or 40 or 50 drawings.

208
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:59.570
So it's really a wonderful thing that they have.

209
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.510
And so check this out when,
when you're in Washington DC.
Um,

210
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.320
so as you can see,
um,

211
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.670
the people are going to Chicago and New York and Saint Louis,

212
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:15.170
but some of them also ended up in Boston as it uses and the Deacon ended up in

213
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:18.950
Boston,
Massachusetts.
Um,
and once again,
you know,

214
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:21.810
he starts out sounding,
uh,

215
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:26.150
not only black but um,
southern black,
um,

216
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.930
calling Quentin young master.
Uh,
but then you know,

217
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:32.990
you actually in the course of one conversation,

218
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.990
he can actually metaphorically,
uh,

219
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.880
move north just in this space of that one conversation.
So,
um,

220
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.550
here is um,

221
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.540
something else that happens between uh,

222
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.740
Quenton and the Deacon.
Um,

223
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.210
and this is actually very obviously a,

224
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.460
a backward illusion.
Took my bath of five in five.
Um,

225
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.540
cause the word tomorrow is just a repeated about eight times in this little

226
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:08.270
passage.
Um,
this is something that happens,
um,

227
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.190
that when Clinton is thinking about his future and this will know that he has no

228
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:14.990
future.
Right.
Um,

229
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:20.020
so this is someone with no future talking to someone with a future.

230
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.390
Take this around to my room tomorrow and give it to Shreve who have something

231
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:29.330
for you.
But Nadia tomorrow my,

232
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.950
he told the leather and examined it is still down.
Yes.

233
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.450
And it's written within.
Not good until tomorrow.
My,

234
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.320
he was looking at me now to envelope weight in his black hand in the sign.

235
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.770
His eyes were soft and I restless and Brown and suddenly I saw Roscoe's is

236
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:57.341
watching me from behind all his wife folks clap trap of uniforms and politics

237
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:04.240
and Harvard man are deferred and secret in articulate and sad.

238
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.370
Wayne playing a joke on the old Negro as you,
you know,
I'm not,

239
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.960
did any southern ever play a joke on you?
You're right.

240
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.050
They find the folks that you can live with them.

241
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.660
Did you ever try as that?
The rascals was gone once more.

242
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:24.980
He was that self.

243
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.320
He had long since taught himself to where in the world's eye.

244
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.000
Pompousness spurious and quite not quite gross.

245
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.350
I'll confirm to your wishes.
My boy.

246
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.470
None until tomorrow.
Remember.

247
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.950
So the leather's not going to be delivered to shri until Quentin is no more.

248
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.950
Um,
and

249
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.430
the Deacon obviously will still be there and to reap the benefit of delivering

250
00:17:56.431 --> 00:17:57.264
that ladder.

251
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.610
What is interesting here is the fairly compressed time,

252
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:03.510
um,

253
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:08.510
time scale that is pat into this low exchange in the course of one conversation

254
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:12.260
that you can,
can slide back into someone just like Ross,

255
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.010
cause I'm still in Mississippi.
Um,
from some time back,

256
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.000
uh,
with the manner and the diffidence and the fear really,
uh,
and uh,

257
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.360
lack of self assurance.
Um,

258
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.960
from some time pass he can slip back into it,

259
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.500
but his secure enough in the present,

260
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.090
in the presence in Boston,
Massachusetts that he can get out of.

261
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:41.090
And just also in that space of one conversation and it is not.

262
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:46.080
So the great migration is not just geographical migration,

263
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:49.770
but also psychological migration as well.
Um,

264
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.490
that in his own mind,
the deacon can move very,

265
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:56.760
very fast from the south to the north.
Um,

266
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:01.790
and that agility of movement is partly what gives him a future.

267
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.220
And there's nothing else about the sort of slightly ungrammatical are not quite

268
00:19:07.221 --> 00:19:09.630
perfect command of English.
Um,

269
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.510
I'll confer to your wishes.

270
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.720
He means to say I'll defer to your wishes.
Um,

271
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.920
but actually confer is the Mo is a more appropriate word because he's not

272
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:25.830
actually deferring to Quentin any more.

273
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.420
Deference is a thing of the past,
a thing of the geographical self.

274
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.510
And because he's in Massachusetts,
um,

275
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.490
he's actually conferring something.

276
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:40.790
It is up to him to be the Asian and to confer something on Quanton.

277
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.100
So the recomposition of the playing field,

278
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.340
this dramatize in some sense through that into perfect command of the English

279
00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:53.220
language.
Um,
and so in this sense,

280
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:56.430
this Faulkner is also a rewriting,
um,

281
00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.600
both the future of rays but also the future of the history of the United States.

282
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.480
Um,
so in,
in both this ways,

283
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:08.760
Benji and Quentin a really can they have a lot in common,
um,

284
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.830
in the varying facts,
uh,

285
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.490
relations to black Harrison learners.
Um,

286
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.510
and then other very,
um,
just the thing that is something that you already know,

287
00:20:18.511 --> 00:20:23.010
but I just want to refresh your memory.
Um,
they also,
uh,
can,

288
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:23.640
um,

289
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.640
in the very traumatic reaction to this loss of innocence on caddies part.

290
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:34.110
So this is something that we looked at last time.
Uh,
Benji,
uh,

291
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.140
the moment when Katty can no longer go to the bathroom and wash yourself clean.

292
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.470
We were in the hall,
caddy was still looking at me.

293
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.950
Her hand was against the mouth and I saw her eyes and I'd cry.

294
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.990
We went up the stairs,

295
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.730
she stopped again against a wall looking at me and I cry.

296
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.830
And she went on and I came on crying and she just ran against the wall looking

297
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:02.410
at me.
She opened the door to the room,

298
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.090
but I pulled at her dress and we went into the bathroom and she stood against

299
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:11.380
the door looking at me that she put her arm across her face.

300
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.600
And I pushed her cry.
So we remember this very well,
um,

301
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.800
moment when suddenly teddy is not putting her arms around Benji but across it on

302
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.580
face.
And it is,

303
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:29.610
I'm telling that it is almost completely reproduced.

304
00:21:29.701 --> 00:21:32.800
Some repeated in Quentin section.

305
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.810
One minute she was standing in the door,
the next minute she was,

306
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.960
he was pulling on her dress and bellowing his voice hammered back and forth

307
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.010
between the wars in ways and choose shrinking against the war,

308
00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.670
getting smaller and smaller with a white face.

309
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:57.060
Her eyes like thumbs that into it until he pushed her out of the room.

310
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.340
His voice hammering back and forth as though it's all momentum would not let us

311
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:07.840
stop as though there were no place for it in silence.

312
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.250
Bellowing,
um,

313
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.300
is exactly the same episode except that now all of a sudden we hear that sound

314
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.710
that bad.
The way they Benji is making them of course,

315
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:24.880
is invisible and in all level,
when Benji is telling the story,

316
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.130
we always gladly what that sound is doing.
Um,

317
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.080
Kelly seems to be a shrunken.

318
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:35.530
She's getting smaller and smaller as you are so pushed around by Benji.
Um,

319
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.640
there's just getting smaller and smaller until she was no place to go.
Um,

320
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.560
and we really haven't thought of Benji as being aggressive,

321
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.240
but that's really what he is,
you know,

322
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.930
innocence is aggressive and is the man that the world should completely conform

323
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.740
to his dictates.
And Benji is,

324
00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:01.770
we learned this in demanding that catty should conform to his tapes.

325
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.910
Um,

326
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.910
and the balancing is the weapon that he uses to make sure that she does that and

327
00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:13.150
when she cannot,
um,
he just keeps on doing that.
Um,

328
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.580
so we from Quentin,

329
00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:19.870
we have this added perspective of what Benji is doing to patty.

330
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:20.740
Um,

331
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.740
but otherwise it's exactly the same moment that same candidate occupied the

332
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:28.670
emotional center.
Um,

333
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.560
and it's an unbearable please for the her two brothers to be,

334
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.443
um,

335
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.780
it's not surprising then that the consequence of that traumatic loss should be

336
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.480
articulated in the same way in Benji.

337
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.190
There's articulated as incomplete syntax and the consequences of that in

338
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.100
complete sentence.

339
00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:53.120
I was trying to say and I caught her trying to say as your screen that I was

340
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:57.450
trying to say and the Australian can,
I would come after that.
Um,

341
00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.390
he is Quentin,
um,
exhibiting the same symptom,

342
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.190
uh,
the same reaction to the laws of,
of catty.

343
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.970
And it is surprising because,
you know,
we can say that,
uh,

344
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.390
Manju has an incomplete syntax because he's an idiot.

345
00:24:14.391 --> 00:24:18.890
He's clinically a retarding.
Quentin is not retarded.
Um,

346
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:23.950
but he also doesn't speak in complete sentences when he's very agitated because

347
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:29.260
women so delicate,
so mysterious fathers,

348
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:34.270
that delicate equilibrium of periodic filled between the two worlds balance

349
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.270
moons,
he said four and yellow as hard as wounds,
the hips,

350
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:45.710
eyes,
Lci,
Lci with them always,

351
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.740
but yellow feed.

352
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.570
So it was with walking in like the,
no,
that's on their,

353
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:57.650
that are those mysterious and imperious concealed with ardor inside of their own

354
00:24:58.910 --> 00:24:59.730
shapes.

355
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:04.730
And our suavity waiting for a touch to liquid putrefaction like drums and things

356
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.060
floating like Powell,
rubber,
flowery filled,

357
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.390
getting the order of honeysuckle all mixed up.

358
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.270
It really is stream of consciousness,
um,

359
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.280
is completely internal to Quentin.
Um,

360
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.310
and the logic of association is also the cure,
Linda random.

361
00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:30.500
So it would be very hard for us to understand completely.

362
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.920
All we can say is that this is both a point of commonality between Quentin and

363
00:25:36.861 --> 00:25:41.861
Benji and also the pine point of departure or deviation from Benji.

364
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:48.080
We never get the sense that women are filled there,
um,

365
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.140
that there's something really repulsive and abominable about women,

366
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.080
um,
that just having,
uh,

367
00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:01.130
the menstrual cycle that in itself is kind of filtering.
Um,
and,

368
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.900
but this is really what Quentin is fixated on is this,

369
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.510
um,
kind of revulsion,
uh,

370
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.250
by female sexuality in this most elemental form,

371
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.850
um,

372
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:18.850
in the sense that it doesn't really take any action just in a state as female is

373
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.650
the sun,
something repulsive about them.
Um,
so this is,
um,

374
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:27.480
we,
um,
this stream of consciousness,
um,

375
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.560
is farmer's way of getting us to get into your mind and is very different in

376
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:39.980
some sense as different from us as Benji's mine ears.
Um,

377
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.880
and so let's,
um,
think about,
um,
also,

378
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:45.180
uh,

379
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:50.180
by way of the one thread that Faulkner is giving us.

380
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.240
Uh,
in the case of Benji,
uh,
we see that the guy,
um,

381
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.000
that is taking us through the various,
uh,
uh,

382
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:03.350
salient moments in band Bangi is the phrase catty smell like trees.

383
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.030
And in the case of Quentin,

384
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:11.420
the phrase that will perform a comparable function is getting the older of

385
00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:14.670
honeysuckle or mixed up,
right.
We see that,

386
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:19.620
that's the last sentence in that,
um,
various strange passage.

387
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.730
Um,

388
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.730
and that phrase would appear again and again in the same manner as catty smelled

389
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:27.720
like trees.
Um,

390
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:32.810
so let's use that as a way to try to understand Quentin.

391
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.910
Um,
I don't think that we have a will to really,
uh,

392
00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.320
and that Molly is a good thing.
That's really what fuck no best effect.

393
00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:42.300
The farmer wants to collaborate.
Um,

394
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:47.340
and this is so this is moving away from kinship to thinking about variation,

395
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:50.550
the ways in which Quenten is different from Benji.

396
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:56.150
And one way in which Quentin is different from Benji is that sister is basically

397
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:00.960
very,
very clear,
very straightforward.

398
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.900
You live vocal meaning for Vanji,

399
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:07.070
it only has one meaning caddies smell like trees.
Um,

400
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:12.110
she's the source of everything that is wonderful and comforting and good for

401
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.400
Benji.
Um,

402
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.440
sister there were sister has a much more complicated meaning for Quentin,

403
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.830
so we can think of it instead of just as one word,

404
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:30.750
as a very calm,
relaxed semantic feel.
And,
uh,

405
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:35.751
well I like to do today is to follow the trajectory of that were sister and the

406
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:41.040
phrase honeysuckle all mixed up.
Um,
follow that,
um,

407
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:46.070
to try to get us from the beginning of Quentin's chapter,

408
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.370
but not quite as linear as,
um,
as I would like.

409
00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.400
But I was trying to get us from the beginning,
uh,

410
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.880
Quentin section to the end of Quentin's section.

411
00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.250
And I think that we all know that he killed himself,
right?

412
00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:03.780
Kills himself by jumping into the Charles River in Cambridge.
Um,

413
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.730
and so how does he get from is just one day to space with that one day?

414
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.130
How does he get from the beginning of that day,

415
00:29:11.131 --> 00:29:13.530
that morning to the end of that day?

416
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.160
And we'll begin at a point when Quentin is closest to Benji and then the way

417
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.360
other ways in which he gradually moves away from [inaudible].

418
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.490
But this is a Lowman,
uh,
when we certain know why it is,

419
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:34.490
uh,
we've learning more about why it is that uh,

420
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:39.530
Kelly's laws of sexuality is so traumatic to Quentin catty you them don't you to

421
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:45.850
move my hand up against her throat.

422
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:51.320
Ohad was hammering their pool.
Quentin who face,

423
00:29:51.321 --> 00:29:53.500
look at the sky,
it was low,

424
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:58.501
so low that all smells and sounds and I seem to have been crowded down like

425
00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:02.890
under a slap tend especially the honeysuckle.

426
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.200
And I got into my breathing.

427
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:09.310
It was on her face and throat like pain.

428
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.130
I had to pan to get any air at all.

429
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:16.870
Oh there they gray honey cycle.
Yes.
I hate him.

430
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.730
I would die for him.
I've already dive.

431
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.230
I dive in over and over again every time.
Discos

432
00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:30.550
and
it's a weird moment.

433
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:36.170
Kelly is the one who is going to be pregnant because I've got this out of

434
00:30:39.431 --> 00:30:43.900
wedlock or fear,
um,
with men.
Um,

435
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:48.730
and with someone that really,
she doesn't even know who the father is.
Um,

436
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:54.330
so she's the last person to be in a position to say poor Quentin.

437
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.060
Um,

438
00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:03.060
but farmers understanding of the situation is that even though caddy is in the,

439
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:06.814
sorry,

440
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.970
isn't a dire situation at this moment and it's a much worse thing back in the

441
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:14.440
20s,
um,

442
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.060
for young lady to be president of Red Long.

443
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.110
Um,
but in spite of that dire situation,

444
00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.210
Kelly still has a better life than Quentin.

445
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.440
Um,

446
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.440
and it has to do with the complete incomprehension of Quentin four caddies

447
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:37.821
lives.

448
00:31:37.821 --> 00:31:42.821
So in lesson two we can say this is the common ground between Benji and Quentin.

449
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.210
Benji doesn't understand quantitative,
sorry,

450
00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.180
Benji between bedroom kind of just doesn't understand if,

451
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.530
because he's doesn't have the mental capacity for it.

452
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:59.220
And Quentin doesn't understand Kelly because he's never had that experience and

453
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:03.530
we know about it.
And the session to the,

454
00:32:03.531 --> 00:32:07.120
he never will have that experience was it,

455
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:12.150
what does it mean to have that particular sensation and to have gone through

456
00:32:12.791 --> 00:32:15.550
that even though the,
the consequences are terrible.

457
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.060
So we can see another way in which,
um,

458
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.410
there's actually a point of intersection between,
uh,

459
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.930
the sound of fury and the great Gatsby.

460
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.960
And there's really a lot in common between Quentin and Gaspe as well.

461
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.600
The intense desire for the love object to deny that she has any relation to

462
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:39.800
anyone other than yourself.
Right.

463
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:44.801
This is what in Nice Quentin and Gatsby Gatsby can stand thought that dosing

464
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:51.140
might've been in love with Tom.
Um,
at one point.
And,

465
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.880
um,
Clinton Kent's then the thought that cutting Lashley be in love just at that

466
00:32:55.881 --> 00:33:00.590
moment was just having sex with this guy.
He can stand that thought.
Um,

467
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:05.650
and that in the ability to stand that dawn says something about a lack in

468
00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:11.960
Quentin's life.
Um,
if he had had that experience,

469
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.790
he wouldn't have hated it so much.
He wouldn't have been so unbearable for him.

470
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:21.140
So that,
and Kennedy completely understands that.

471
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:26.230
So that's the background for that repeated phrase who went and,

472
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:31.250
um,
and so this is the point where,
um,

473
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.410
with Benji and Quentin a really as one,

474
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.420
the two brothers are as one and now we begin to move away from that one of unity

475
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:48.670
between Benji and Clinton because we also know that in fact a caddy is very

476
00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:56.540
fleeting presence.
And when in the acquaintance section,
um,

477
00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.830
the person who was there a lot,
it's actually a little Italian girl.

478
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.700
Um,

479
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.700
so that's a very odd choice on thoughtless bought that for a good part of the

480
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:10.340
quanton section.

481
00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:15.100
Quentin is actually walking around with a little Italian girl that he calls his

482
00:34:15.101 --> 00:34:16.730
sister.
So this is,

483
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:20.990
we decided to get the different permutations of the worst sister in this very

484
00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:24.800
complex semantic feel.
Hello sister.

485
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.320
She extended the fist.

486
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.120
It uncalled around and they go moist and dirty.

487
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.900
Moise do it rich into her flesh.

488
00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:40.670
I handed the buns to logo,
the fingers closed about them,

489
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.740
Dan and hot,
but worms,
I went on,

490
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.870
then I look back,
she was behind me under my elbows sort of eating.

491
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.640
We went on,
it was quiet.
Holly.

492
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:57.860
Anyone about getting the order of honeysuckle or mixed,

493
00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:03.110
she lived,
told me not to let me sit there on the steps.
Hearing the door,

494
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.880
twilight slamming,
hearing Benji still crying suburb.

495
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.530
She will have to come down and getting honeysuckle all mixed up in it.

496
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:17.450
So here we study together the conflation of the two sisters,
right?

497
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.400
So there's the,
the in the Italics is going back to that dramatic moments.

498
00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:25.130
Still caddy not being able to wash yourself,

499
00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:28.130
clean Benji bellowing doors,

500
00:35:28.131 --> 00:35:32.330
slamming caddies threw up in her room.
So still that moment.

501
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:33.320
Um,

502
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.320
but that moment it's bleeding into that moment from the past is bleeding into

503
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:45.770
Quentin's current walk with the little Italian girl and that accounts for the

504
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:52.780
images of dirt and filled that that'd be improved.

505
00:35:52.781 --> 00:35:57.210
Acted onto the boat.
Italian goes just as a little girl,
um,
you know,

506
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.060
getting punked.
Um,

507
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:04.100
but the images of her actually have a much older woman,

508
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.240
moisture and dirt rich into flash.

509
00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:10.620
Um,

510
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.620
so at the very least we can say that Quinton's experience of the entire world is

511
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.600
channeled through,

512
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.900
mediated by and contaminated by his stance of the laws of sexual innocence.

513
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.940
On the pilot cavity so that every single woman that he's going to encounter is

514
00:36:33.481 --> 00:36:38.481
going to carry some attributes of the candidate who is lost or sexual innocence.

515
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:39.810
Um,

516
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:44.580
and there was sister also carries the weight of that contamination.

517
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:49.800
Um,
but there are other interesting permutations afterwards,

518
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.380
sister.
Um,
and I just want to go back,

519
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:57.060
take us back now to the very opening of the Quentin section.
Um,

520
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.170
and this is,
um,

521
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:03.140
something that is once again very peculiar,
um,

522
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:07.890
a kind of logical association,
not entirely clarify for us.

523
00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:13.610
I don't suppose anybody ever to liberal label listen to watch or clock.

524
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.083
You don't have to.

525
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.780
You can be oblivious to the sound for long while then in the second of taking it

526
00:37:21.361 --> 00:37:23.840
can create in the mind unbroken,

527
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:28.080
the long diminishing the rate of time.
You didn't hear,

528
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.180
like father said,
download long and lonely like race.

529
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.400
You might see Jesus walking like,
and the goose in France,

530
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.530
they said the little sister that the never had a sister,

531
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:45.143
um,

532
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:50.270
is making no sense to us on page 76 and it's probably still not making a whole

533
00:37:50.521 --> 00:37:55.200
lot of sense to you right now.
Um,
we know though that,

534
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.360
uh,
the watch is very important.

535
00:37:57.361 --> 00:38:01.140
He steps on a watch and bricks the face of the watch.

536
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:04.260
So He seems to have some quarrel with that watch.

537
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:09.290
And we'll come back to this implant detail at the end of the Quentin section.

538
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:14.730
Uh,
what is it?
Why is it that he's so angry at the watch?
But for now,

539
00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:18.750
let's think about that last line.

540
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.960
And the good thing Francis,

541
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:25.530
they said little sister death than ever had assistance.

542
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.520
So we've just seen the mapping afterwards,

543
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:33.530
sister onto the Lelo Italian girl and now we're sister is mapped onto death.

544
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.210
Okay.

545
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:41.440
So what is it then enables that mapping to take place?

546
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:46.450
And here I should say something about,
um,
the way of reading.
Father on the whole,

547
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.840
I don't really think that we need to do a lot of research,
um,

548
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.220
to understand Fatima.
You know,
he's hard to understand,

549
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:59.050
but actually it takes more reading than,
than doing a lot of outside research.

550
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.290
But here is one moment when Ashley,
um,

551
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.500
some outside research with castle lite on this particular logic of association.

552
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:14.050
So,
um,
I just want to bring up this very strange,
um,
uh,

553
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.640
passable,
uh,
reference for Forkner.
Um,
and that is,

554
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.950
um,
it has to do with Saint Francis.

555
00:39:20.951 --> 00:39:24.940
And he's telling us that Saint Francis is important to him for some reason.
Um,

556
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.640
this is the Saint Francis Canticle of the sun,

557
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:32.970
which turns out to be pivoted on the word sister.

558
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.080
Praise being my Lord for system,
Moon and for the stars.

559
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.371
Praise me,

560
00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:47.371
my law for system water who is very serviceable and to us and humble and

561
00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:53.440
pressures and clean,
praise me,
my Lord,

562
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:58.710
for our sister and the death of the body from whom no man living can escape.

563
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.590
So,

564
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:07.590
at the very least we can say that those different mappings that we're seeing in

565
00:40:07.601 --> 00:40:12.601
Quentin seem to bear a very close charisma handlers to this particular logic of

566
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:18.550
association from,
um,
that we see in Saint Francis.
Um,

567
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.720
honestly,
you know,
even though the two logics are similar,

568
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:28.290
it's for a different reason that Quentin would have that kind of clustering of

569
00:40:29.231 --> 00:40:30.040
terms.

570
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.040
So let's move on now to see what sister water means for Quentin.

571
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.030
Um,
and this is once again going back to caddy,

572
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:44.330
but suddenly water is coming into play.
Um,

573
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:48.940
in his relation to caddy gotten married.
Somebody,

574
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:54.430
have they been very many caddy?
I don't know too many.

575
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.740
You look after Benji and father,

576
00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:02.170
you don't know who it is then does he know?
Don't touch me.

577
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.210
When you look after the NGN fodder,

578
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:10.030
I began to feel the water because I came before I came to the bridge.

579
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.720
The bridge was a grazed on mission that was slow moisture with a fungus crab

580
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:23.400
been even the water was clear and still in the shadow whispering and clucking

581
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:29.580
about a stone in fading swirls of Spinning Sky Kelly that I've gotten to marry

582
00:41:31.661 --> 00:41:32.494
somebody.

583
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.680
So the most obvious,

584
00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.600
clearest back is that Kelly is pregnant and then she needs to marry somebody

585
00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:45.380
energies about America's somebody.
Right?
So this is about the only thing we know.

586
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.460
Uh,

587
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:51.460
but what is interesting here is that when she's about to get the married and

588
00:41:53.661 --> 00:41:53.991
will be,

589
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:58.991
if the consen house was [inaudible] to Quentin is where you look after Benji and

590
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:01.934
father.

591
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:07.300
It is something that someone who's about to leave for say someone who was about

592
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:09.140
to get married and leave was that,

593
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.580
but it could also be sad by someone who's about to kill herself.

594
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.550
Right.
You know,
I'm going to be gone.

595
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.410
The two hospital meetings for look after father and Benji,

596
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.340
someone who's no longer going to be over around anymore and it's by someone

597
00:42:28.341 --> 00:42:33.341
who's not going to be a rush in the two different ways in which catty could be

598
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.350
not around anymore.
Right now she's going,

599
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.960
going to do the marriage option best the way in which is not going to be around

600
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.113
anymore.

601
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:49.630
But in Quentin's mind there's already that [inaudible] rude that he's toying

602
00:42:53.001 --> 00:42:53.834
with.

603
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.900
It would be very nice if caddy were to kill herself by drowning himself.

604
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:04.790
It would be one way.
It would be the water.

605
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.070
This time is not something in the bathroom.

606
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.500
It would be this gigantic body of water,

607
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:14.030
but she was indeed wash yourself clean in that body of water.

608
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:19.090
So this is one way in which sister and water constitute a potential mapping in

609
00:43:21.051 --> 00:43:25.670
Quentin's mind.
But Kathy is not going to do it.

610
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.880
She's just going to get married.
It's just going to be alive.
So

611
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:35.500
this is the problem for Quentin is that Kelly is not going to clean herself by

612
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:39.800
killing herself,
by jumping into the water.
Um,

613
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.740
and he's furious and the world is not.

614
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.960
Nothing is right when she refuses to clean herself as he demands her to be

615
00:43:47.961 --> 00:43:48.794
clean.

616
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.980
So this is his conversation with his father and father said is because you are

617
00:43:54.471 --> 00:43:58.840
version,
don't you see women on their versions period.

618
00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:03.930
Here is the negative state and therefore are contrary to nature is nature is

619
00:44:05.181 --> 00:44:09.350
hurting you,
not catty.
And I said,
that's just worse.
And he said,

620
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:13.750
so his virginity and I said,
you don't know.
You can't know.

621
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:19.420
And he said yes on the instance when we came to realize that tragedy is second

622
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:26.090
hand.
So it would have been the right kind of tragic rating.

623
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.630
If caddy had just killed herself by jumping into the water,

624
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.990
it would have been appropriate cleansing kind of tragedy.

625
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:39.360
And is that she's not killing herself.
Somebody has to kill himself,

626
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:44.310
uh,
you know,
to,
uh,
perform that needed action.

627
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:49.560
Um,
and Quentin's father is completely,
um,

628
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:55.170
um,
disapproving and in fact,
uh,
making fun of that whole operation.

629
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.780
Um,
that is right.
The caddies shouldn't be too upset about her pregnancy.

630
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.430
Women who never version to begin with,
never,

631
00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:06.230
they never versions interesting interpretation of virginity.
Um,

632
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:10.440
but I think that it really is,
uh,
an interesting,
um,

633
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.550
observation,
um,

634
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.590
that the person who is both on the part of Mr. Thompson but also in the policy

635
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.820
softener,
um,
the,

636
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:22.650
the person who ought to be most upset by all of this is actually not the most

637
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:24.010
upset of valley.
Um,

638
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:29.090
and what happens when tragedy becomes second hand comes by Terry tragedy.

639
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:34.170
Quentin is reacting to this tragedy on the part of his sister and making it his

640
00:45:34.171 --> 00:45:36.120
own tragedy because in some sense,

641
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.840
that's really the only thing that he can call his own.

642
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:46.310
So the problem with secondhand tragedy is that it really is somebody else's

643
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:49.950
tragedy.

644
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:54.420
It is not Quinton's on tragedy at the moment.

645
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:58.650
He's been devastated by it and he likes to be devastated and who likes to be

646
00:45:58.651 --> 00:46:03.651
heroic and devastated and to be devastated on behalf of his sister and to feel

647
00:46:04.351 --> 00:46:07.980
that,
that he's the one who's going to make everything right.
Um,

648
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:13.040
but there's always the danger that a second hand tragedy will very soon fade out

649
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.890
and become a non tragedy.

650
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.050
And that's why the word temporary is such an unbearable for Quentin to

651
00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:27.051
contemplate and I temporary and he Mr. Thompson,

652
00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:28.970
his father and he,

653
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:34.070
you cannot bear to think that someday it will no longer hurt you like this now

654
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.350
and I temporary and he it is hot.

655
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:45.620
Believing to thing that I love or sorrow is a bond purchase without design and

656
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:51.990
Wishman tours willy nilly and as recall without wanting to be replace by

657
00:46:53.191 --> 00:46:58.191
whatever issue the gods happened to be floating at the moment and I temporary

658
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.340
and he was the sad as word of law.

659
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:07.700
There is nothing else in the world is not despair until time is not even time

660
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:13.730
until it was so the tragedy isn't even that caddy is pregnant.

661
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:15.870
That's really nothing.

662
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:21.770
The tragedy is that the fact that Quentin is devastated now that wouldn't keep

663
00:47:23.251 --> 00:47:26.460
forever,
is going to,
he's going to lose.

664
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:31.700
He won't be able to hold on forever to that sense of devastation and that is the

665
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:36.781
tragedy that he's going to find to put them and to claim once and for all by

666
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.520
doing what he does at the end of the novel.

667
00:47:42.521 --> 00:47:45.790
And this is where he jumped off.
Um,
from that,

668
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:50.290
this is the bridge that he jumped off from,
um,
in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

669
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.680
And it just so happens that it seems that some breathers reader had gone there,

670
00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:01.350
you know,
sprayers because of the spelling of the word older.
Um,

671
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:06.540
but at that bridge is actually a plaque saying Quentin Thompson drown in the

672
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:13.240
older of honeysuckle one to 1910.

673
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.430
So this is a very,

674
00:48:14.431 --> 00:48:19.431
very good reader of fog and knowing exactly when is central infarct as mine.
