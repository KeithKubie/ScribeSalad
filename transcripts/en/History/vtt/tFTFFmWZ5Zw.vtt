00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.830
NARRATOR: The
Mediterranean Sea, 2000,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.710
a group of divers working
off the Egyptian coast

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.170
near Alexandria discovered the
submerged ruins of statues and

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.040
even entire temple complexes.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.500
One instance of the discovery
of something that we thought

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.790
was legendary was the
discovery of Heracleion,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.420
Thonis, near Alexandria.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.670
We had read about this in
Greek myth and Greek histories.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.540
We had no evidence
for it, and then

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.750
one day, it gets discovered.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.670
NARRATOR: Dating back
to the 7th century

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.000
BC, Thonis, or Heracleion as
it was known to the Greeks,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.080
was cited in ancient
myths as a major trading

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.040
post for the region.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.710
For a long time, Heracleion
in Egypt was in many stories

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.750
but had not been found
until the year 2000.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.250
In India, in the year 2001,
something similar happened.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.080
The Mahabharata
tells of the time

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.040
Lord Krishna built a great
fortified city, Dwarka,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.210
but was thought to be
an imaginary place,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.460
and then it was discovered.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.420
NARRATOR: But of all the places
on earth that were thought

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.120
to be mythological, the one
that has inspired the most

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.790
fascination and has
proven the most elusive

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.880
is not a city but an
entire continent, Atlantis.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.620
As described by Plato in
the fourth century AD,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.790
Atlantis was the home of a
highly advanced civilization

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.460
which mysteriously
disappeared into the ocean

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.120
thousands of years ago.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.670
While mainstream scholars
continue to dismiss Atlantis

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.620
as nothing more than
a fanciful myth,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.120
there are many who
believe Plato's account

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.960
was based on a very real place.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.670
But if Atlantis, like other
formerly mythical locations,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.500
were discovered,
would it offer proof

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.460
of extraterrestrial
contact with early humans?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.830
Dunedin, New Zealand,
February, 2017,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.420
scientists at New Zealand's
top geological Institute GNS

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.920
Science announced the
discovery of a lost continent,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.460
one that sunk into the
ocean millions of years ago.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.000
They dubbed the land mass
Zealandia, as it extends

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.960
directly under New Zealand.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.540
Although it is almost
entirely underwater,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.960
it fits the definition
of a continent,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.040
as it consists of an
intact piece of crust that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.040
is distinctly different
from the ocean floor

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.210
and clearly separated
from Australia.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.170
This was a shocking
discovery, because they

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.380
thought the number of
continents on earth

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.710
had been basically fixed.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.210
Now, this one looks
like it could have been

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.500
another continent, where
perhaps human beings dwelt,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.580
and if it was, this
could certainly

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.380
rewrite a lot of history books.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.920
NARRATOR: Could this be the
lost continent of Atlantis?

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.250
Ancient astronaut
theorists say that it

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.920
is a distinct possibility.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.750
There is an ongoing
bias among scientists

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.580
that anything from
the ancient past

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.920
must therefore be a made
up fake story, a myth,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.920
and yet these scientists
have to look at the reality,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.920
that archaeological
discoveries are

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.920
verifying that the actual
stories have merit.
