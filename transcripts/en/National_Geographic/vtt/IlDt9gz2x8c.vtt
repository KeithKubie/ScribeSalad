00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.633
[music playing]

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.300
MAN (OVER RADIO):
[inaudible] 200 meters.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.834
Pisces V, K OK, do you copy?

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:16.600
Roger, hatch is shut, ready
to dive, dive, dive, over.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.033
MAN (OVER RADIO):
Roger, hatch is shut,

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:20.033
ready to dive, dive, dive.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.100
NARRATOR: Sylvia last dived
here nearly four decades ago,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.633
using a special diving
suit called JIM.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:29.433
REPORTER: There is a
new tool in the sea.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.700
It moves with the
ponderous rhythms

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.333
of a mechanical monster.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.633
Her question, can scientists
use the JIM suit for dives

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.700
beyond 1,000 feet?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.433
If successful, she will be the
first woman to walk the sea

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:48.000
floor beyond 1,000 feet.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
SYLVIA EARLE: I see it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.300
Oh, it's the bottom!

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.233
NARRATOR: Sylvia is looking
for signs of change.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:57.900
When you're up
near the surface,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.767
it's kind of light blue.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:03.033
But as you go down, you see
the pretty shades of blue.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.800
And the blue gets
darker and darker.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.834
Then it get pitch black.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.633
It's like a different world.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:28.300
Yeah.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.867
SYLVIA EARLE: Actually, our
world is a different world.

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:31.700
This is normal.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:42.333
NARRATOR: New life
comes to light.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.800
An unknown coral.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.867
Chris doesn't even know
what species this thing is.

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:48.233
CHRIS: is the only place I've
really seen it this color.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.367
I've seen some in
northwestern Hawaiian islands.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:51.734
Oh yeah, just scattered.

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:53.166
It's everywhere.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.100
This is like a magic carpet.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.166
Oh, my goodness.

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.100
Beautiful.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.667
Except it's better
than any old carpet.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:04.467
It's alive.

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:08.166
It's a live flying carpet.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.433
Sylvia never stopped
looking out the window.

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:14.300
She's just excited to see things
that hadn't seen in so long.

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.333
SYLVIA EARLE: Swimming
right under the ray.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.800
FINN KENNEDY: The ray
just ate something.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.066
He just trapped some of
those little fish under his.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.433
That's unbelievable, he did.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.467
He got one of those polymixia.

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.867
MAN (OVER RADIO): Pisces
V, Pisces IV, do you copy?

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:38.600
We just watched these
two rays eat polymixia.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.233
SYLVIA EARLE: Here
comes the ray.

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:41.400
MAN (OVER RADIO): OK,
that's the first observation

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.800
I've heard anybody say that.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.066
That's really interesting.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:45.800
SYLVIA EARLE: Took a
kid with fresh eyes

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.200
to notice something that has
been happening all along.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.467
Because after Finn
pointed it out,

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:53.934
we looked and we saw it
happening all around us.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.300
That little eel
just swam under.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.533
Oh, did you see?

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:57.767
FINN KENNEDY: Yeah,
I got it on film.

00:02:57.767 --> 00:02:59.300
Oh.
