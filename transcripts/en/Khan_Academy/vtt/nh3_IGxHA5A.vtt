00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.420
We are asked to
graph the function

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.370
f of x is equal to
negative 3x squared plus 8.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.420
So we'll do this by essentially
trying out different points

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.400
for x, and seeing what
we get for f of x,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.720
and then graphing it.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.410
But the first question
I have for you

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.810
is, just looking at
this function definition

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.690
for f of x, what type
of graph will this be?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.710
Will just be a line?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.970
Will this be a parabola?

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.580
Will this be something else,
a circle, something else,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.220
maybe something else
bizarre or strange?

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.180
Well, this is pretty clearly
going to be a parabola here.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.400
You have the
function is defined,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.090
it's negative 3x squared, so
you have this second degree

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.130
term here.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.880
You don't have any x thirds or
x to the fourths or anything

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.084
else bizarre, so this is
going to be a parabola.

00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, the other thing
that we could think about

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.770
is whether the parabola is
going to open up like that

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.966
or whether it's going
to open down like that.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.840
And just looking at this
function definition,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.660
do you have any intuition of
whether it's going to open up

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.680
or it's going to open down?

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.180
Well, if you look
at the coefficient

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.300
on the x squared
term, the negative 3,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.930
that tells you that this
parabola is going to open down.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.550
It's going to open down.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.240
So with that
intuition now that we

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.330
know it's going
to be a parabola,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.288
we know it's going to
open down, let's actually

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:21.160
try to graph the thing.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.220
And let me draw some axes here.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.340
So let's say that this is my
x-axis, so that's my x-axis.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.317
And then let's make this right
over here, this is my y-axis.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.220
And let me make
a table of values

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.000
and see what values
f of x takes on.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.640
So on one column, I'm
going to do my values

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.770
for x and over on
the right I'm going

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.354
to do my values for f of x.

00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:54.770
And then we can
plot these things.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.728
And actually I want to
take all of these values

00:01:56.728 --> 00:01:58.860
before I draw the
scale on these axes,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.650
so I know what might be
an appropriate scale.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.790
So I'm just going to
try a bunch of values.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.690
So let's try first what happens
when x is equal to negative 2.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.155
So when x is equal
to negative 2--

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:12.530
and I'm just
picking numbers that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.140
will be relatively
easy to compute.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.170
When x is equal to
negative 2 what's f of x?

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.850
Well, f of x is going
to be negative 3,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.700
this negative 3,
times negative 2

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.230
squared plus 8, which is going
to be equal to, let's see.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.800
Negative 2 squared
is 4, positive 4,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.040
then we multiply that times
a negative 3, which gives us

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.060
negative 12 plus 8,
gives us negative 4.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.510
Let's try another point.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.830
Let's see what happens when
x is equal to negative 1.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.920
What do we get for f of x then?

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.820
Well, f of x is going to be
negative 3 times negative 1

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.430
squared plus 8.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.160
So that's going to be-- see
negative 1 squared is just 1,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.040
and then that times
negative 3 is negative 3.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.880
Negative 3 plus 8 is 5.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.410
Now, what does f of x
equal when x is equal to 0?

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.540
Well, this is pretty
easy to compute.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.510
When x is equal to
0, you get negative 3

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.820
times 0 squared,
which is equal to--

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.420
and we could write that
either way-- negative 3 times

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.880
0 squared plus 8.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.560
Well, this just simplifies to 0,
and so you're just left with 8.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.480
Now, let's see what happens
when x is equal to 1.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.090
What do we get for f of x?

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.520
Well, it's going to be negative
3 times 1 squared plus 8.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.840
So 1 squared is just 1,
negative 3 plus 8 is equal to 5.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.987
And then finally, what do we get
when x is equal to positive 2?

00:03:58.987 --> 00:04:01.070
What does f of x equal,
or another way of thinking

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.592
about it, what is f of 2?

00:04:03.592 --> 00:04:05.080
Well, let's think about it.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.820
You get negative 3
times 2 squared plus 8.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.740
2 squared is 4, times
negative 3 is negative 12,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.320
plus 8 is equal to negative 4.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.019
So let's see if
we can plot this.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.680
So the x values that I picked go
from negative 2 to positive 2.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.505
So let's make this
negative 2, negative 1.

00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:27.080
This is 0.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.210
This is positive 1, and
that could be positive 2.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.330
And then our f of x values,
or we are essentially

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.890
graphing y is equal to f of x,
so I can even say this is going

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.610
to be the graph of y
is equal to f of x.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.750
Our f of x values take on
things between negative 4

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.120
and positive 8.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.970
Let me try to draw that.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:56.150
So if this is positive 8, that's
positive 8, that is positive 4,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.640
and this is negative 4.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.770
This is negative 4.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.110
And if that's positive 4,
then this is positive 6,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.840
and then that right
there is 5, that is 7,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.820
this would be 2 that would be
3, and then that would be 1.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.210
Now, let's graph the points.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.370
When x is negative 2,
f of x is negative 4.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.840
And actually I
could say, this is

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.260
the y is equal to f of x-axis.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.470
I'm going to plot f of x.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.360
I'm graphing, and
this is going to be

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.380
the graph of y is
equal to this function.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.390
So let's graph
negative 2, negative 4.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.620
So that gets us,
when x is negative 2,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.905
f of x is negative 4.

00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:38.900
It's right over there.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:46.570
When x is equal to negative
1, f of x is equal to 5.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.360
And we're saying that y is
equal to f of x in this context.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.400
When x is 0, f of x or y-- I
could even write over here,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.210
I could say, y is
equal to f of x.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.080
When x is equal to
0, our f of x is 8.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.370
x is 0, f of x is 8.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.060
When x is 1, f of x is 5.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.090
When x is 1, y
equals f of x is 5.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.100
And then finally, when
x is equal to 2, f of x

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.890
is equal to negative 4.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.290
So 2, negative 4,
gets us right there.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.760
And now we can connect the dots.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.160
We know this is going
to be a parabola.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.760
And I will do it in blue.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.730
So my best attempt-- I like
to draw it as a dotted line,

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.750
just because it's
easier to not mess up--

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.910
so it would look
something like that.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.536
And it keeps on
going just like that,

00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:46.180
and then I can actually make the
line a little bit more solid.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.890
So we see that we
definitely got a parabola,

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.930
and just as our
intuition told us,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.660
our ability to inspect
the coefficient

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.500
on the x-squared term told us,
that our parabola is indeed

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.473
opening downwards.
