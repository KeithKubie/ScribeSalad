00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.850
The formula for the
area of a triangle

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.800
is A is equal to 1/2 b times
h, where A is equal to area,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800
b is equal to
length of the base,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.440
and h is equal to the
length of the height.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.600
So area is equal to
1/2 times the length

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.760
of the base times the
length of the height.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.370
Solve this formula
for the height.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.080
So just to visualize
this a little bit,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.140
let me draw a triangle here.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.540
Let me draw a triangle just
so we know what b and h are.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.050
b would be the
length of the base.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.760
So this distance
right over here is b.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.000
And then this distance
right here is our height.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580
That is the height
of the triangle--

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.538
let me do that at a lower
case h because that's

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:44.150
how we wrote it in the formula.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.820
Now, they want us to solve
this formula for the height.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.370
So the formula is area is
equal to 1/2 base times height.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.075
And we want to solve for h.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.575
We essentially want
to isolate the h

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.140
on one side of the equation.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.670
It's already on the
right-hand side.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.600
So let's get rid of everything
else on the right-hand side.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.140
So we can do it-- well, I'll
do it one step at a time.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.270
We could kind of skip
steps if we wanted to.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.550
But let's see if we can
get rid of this 1/2.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.820
So the best way to get
rid of a 1/2 that's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.820
being multiplied by
h is if we multiply

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.290
both sides of the equation
by its reciprocal.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.170
If we multiply both sides of
the equation by 2/1 or by 2.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.170
So let's do that.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.711
So let's multiply--
remember anything

00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:23.610
you do to one side
of the equation,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.790
you also have to do to the
other side of the equation.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.120
Now, what did this do?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.480
Well, the whole point
behind multiplying by 2

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.630
is 2 times 1/2 is 1.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.670
So on the right-hand
side of the equation,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.530
we're just going to have a bh.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.280
And on the left-hand side of
the equation, we have a 2A.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.190
And we're almost there, we
have a b multiplying by an h.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.275
If we want to just
isolate the h,

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:51.630
we could divide both sides
of this equation by b.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.380
We're just dividing both sides.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.150
You can almost view b as
the coefficient on the h.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.740
We're just dividing
both sides by b.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.790
And then what do we get?

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.780
Well, the right-hand
side, the b's cancel out.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.590
On the left-hand side, we're
just left with 2A over b.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.860
So we get h-- and I'm just
swapping the sides here.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.020
h is equal to 2A over b.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.600
And we're done.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.635
We have solved this
formula for the height.

00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:19.010
And I guess this
could be useful.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.931
If someone just gave
you a bunch of areas

00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:23.680
and a bunch of base
lengths, and they said

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.875
keep giving me the
height for those values,

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:28.260
or for those triangles.
