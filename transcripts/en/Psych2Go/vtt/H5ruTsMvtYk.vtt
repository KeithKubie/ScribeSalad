00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.360
How to deal with manipulative people.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.000
Imagine you have a friend,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.020
you love your friend, but you realize a few things.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.520
They always get what they want,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.080
tear down your confidence and always play the victim.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480
What does this mean?

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.800
It might mean your friend is an emotional manipulator.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.580
So what do you do?

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.480
Well, lucky for you, we've provided some tips to make sure you don't get played

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.160
and can hopefully help them in the end.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.460
Number one:

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.720
Stopping the victimhood.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.860
Maybe you notice that your friend always plays the victim, no matter what happens.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.180
Sometimes they might actually not know what they're doing wrong and thus don't assume responsibility for their actions.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.360
Sometimes they're doing it on purpose.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.300
This is when the behavior is manipulative.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.540
What you do in this case is to keep things light and positive.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.960
Slowly let them know that it's okay to make a mistake

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.900
so they can start to accept responsibility for their actions.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.860
Leveling the playing field.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.200
If you tell this friend you had a bad day

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.800
they'll brush it off and tell you about the time they experienced a monsoon and an alien invasion in the same day.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.480
These manipulators get their confidence by putting others down and belittling other people's issues and successes.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.820
What you have to do here is to be honest.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.280
You tell them "Hey, I appreciate you telling me your story,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.160
and I'm glad you can empathize,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.880
but I just need some advice or comfort or someone to listen."

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.300
By accepting what the manipulator is doing you've taken away their power to hurt you.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.900
Lessening the load.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.160
These people pretend to be helpless and always put you on a pedestal which puts all the pressure on you.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.640
The way you can combat this is to slowly put them into positions of decision-making or power.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.260
Tell them that you're uncomfortable with the weight they put on your shoulders by making you the leader all the time.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.140
At first they might be mad,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.340
but slowly they may appreciate, feel equal, and enjoy taking action.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.740
Talk about it.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.760
The classic emotional manipulator is known as a triangulate

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.800
They'll say anything to get someone on their side.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.240
They'll break relationships, and even families by pitting people against each other.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.380
The more support they have, the more power they feel they have.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.180
The best way to stop this, is to open channels of communications.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.840
Keep talking to your friends and family no matter what the triangulator is saying.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.820
This way you're all on the same page, no matter what the manipulator says.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.060
Stand your ground.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.620
This is difficult if you're dealing with a manipulator that steamrolls everything and everyone.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.280
Like the Hulk, manipulators can sometimes use anger and even violence to blast you out of an argument.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.860
You can't ask questions because they yell and yell.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.720
It might be scary but, keep calm, stand your ground and don't be pushed over.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.700
Wait for them to get tired of yelling and then have a proper discussion.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.700
It also works to walk away from the manipulator,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.000
especially if you feel that you're in physical danger.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.440
Healthy skepticism.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.200
If your manipulator always has to make it seem they and their life is perfect, don't buy it.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.860
If they say something wrong call it out.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.940
Don't point out all their flaws, but call out that bull.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.240
Nobody's perfect and knowing our flaws is the only way we can grow

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.280
Change your language.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.340
There's always going to be miscommunication in relationships,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.920
but if you're always to blame for getting the message wrong or delivering it wrong,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.440
it could be a sign that you're being manipulated.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.140
Over time this treatment can make you afraid to speak up.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.660
What do you do to prevent this?

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.840
Speak in "I feel" sentences, so they can't twist your feelings easily.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.800
For example, "I feel grossed out by all the old dishes in the sink",

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.340
not "you gross me out by not cleaning the dishes."

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.500
Know what you want.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.180
Flirting is fun, most of us do it and usually like experiencing it.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.660
However, if someone is using flirtation to have everyone admire them with disregard to everyone's feeling,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.040
this is a sign it's being used as a manipulation tactic.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.260
These manipulators use their charm and sexuality to get everything they want.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.980
To block them out, don't fall for their wit and charm.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.460
Know what you want, and know what they're saying or asking for.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.280
Don't get swept away by their flirtatious attitude.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.480
Stand up, emotionally.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.520
Manipulators that are harsh, heavy, and bash people down to get what they want,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.800
are often dealing with insecurities themselves.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.400
With these people, you need to stand up to them and hold your ground.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.760
Know who you are, don't let them drag you down into insecurity.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.720
And finally, sometimes your manipulator just won't stop.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.720
In that case, we recommend you cut them out completely.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.200
If they're too important to you to let go of, or if you feel you might be physically unsafe

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.740
talk to someone in a position of authority.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.160
Sometimes you might need some help to deal with manipulators

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.540
We hope that by using all the tips we just taught you,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.700
