00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.640
While the question of hamsters powering homes
may seem a bit farcical, it should be noted

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.200
that at one point humans did specifically
breed a certain type of dog for the sole purpose

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.070
of it just walking along at a steady pace
on a giant wheel…

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.730
(See our article The Curious Tale of Turnspit
Dogs.)

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.519
Now, to begin with, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration (EIA), the

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:43.400
average American household uses about 901
kWh per month, which for the sake of simplicity

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.480
we’re going to round down to 900 kWh.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.970
A single kWh is equal to 3.6 Megajoules.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.930
This means in any given month, an average
American household uses about 3,240 Megajoules

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.930
of energy.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.220
In a given year, that would be about 38,880
Megajoules.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.470
The amount of power produced by your typical
hamster running as fast as it can on its little

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.830
wheel is understandably much more difficult
to nail down.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.140
However, it appears that a properly motivated
little ball of fluff can reliably produce

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.400
somewhere in the ballpark of 0.5 joules per
second while running.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.910
Now the number of seconds in a year is approximately
31,540,000 (give or take depending on leap

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.560
year and the like).

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.659
Thus, a hamster with infinite stamina and
no need to sleep could produce about 15,770,000

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.440
joules or 15.77 Megajoules per year.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.280
This means it would take approximately 2,465
such hamsters to provide the needed electricity

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.620
to power a typical American home for a year.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.030
Of course, hamsters with infinite stamina
and with no need to sleep do not exist, so

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.960
what about using real hamsters?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.610
It’s estimated that a typical hamster will
spend about 5% of their time exercising.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.470
Thus, instead of around 15.77 Megajoules per
year, we can reasonably expect about 0.8 Megajoules

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.739
per year per hamster, unless you wanted to
selectively breed some super hamster or something,

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.920
FOR SCIENCE, which we could totally get behind.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.930
But barring that, we’ll go with the currently
existing real world variety.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.290
Thus, it would take in the ballpark of 486,000
hamsters running on wheels connected to generators

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.439
to produce enough electricity for an average
American home for a year.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.010
And for further reference, given the 3 year
lifespan of a typical hamster kept in captivity,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.719
to power a home for the average amount of
time a typical homeowner lives in it (13 years

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.690
according to National Association of Home
Builders), you’d need well over 2.1 million

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.180
hamsters, with a little excess to account
for baby and elderly hamsters not pulling

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.290
their own weight.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.659
Now to the second part of the question- would
hamster power be cheaper than coal power?

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.239
A typical hamster costs anywhere between $4
and $20 dollars, depending on the pet store

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.290
you buy it from, the breed and coloration.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.950
Thus, you’d be looking at spending around
$10 million over that 13 years just on the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.150
cost of hamster alone, even at the $4 price.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.730
However, given you’d have more than enough
hamsters around to breed your own after some

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.959
first starter batch, we’re prepared to say
that the price of acquiring your hamster stock

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.469
wouldn’t actually be anywhere close to that
$10 million figure.

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:35.099
For reference, a female hamster can breed
at a rate of about 5 baby hamsters, give or

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.459
take, every 3 weeks or so, and then ready
to go again, sometimes within just 24 hours

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.719
of giving birth.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:47.379
Further, as with many species and politicians,
the males are both willing and able to get

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.760
it on even multiple times per day with multiple
partners if the females will let them.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.000
On top of that, hamsters become sexually mature
at around 4-6 weeks.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.309
So if you started with just 1000 hamsters,
with a large percentage female, purchased

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:05.590
at a bulk discount of, say, a dollar or two
a hamster, you could feasible very cheaply

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.459
ramp up to the needed half million or so hamsters
with controlled breeding in under 6 months.

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.299
But we’re not done because there are a lot
of ancillary expenses here.

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.320
To begin with, all of those hamsters need
cages- an additional expense of around $30

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.680
dollars per hamster cage.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.669
If you wanted to have one hamster per cage,
you’ll need about 500,000 cages or so- a

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.150
steal at just $15 million dollars.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.720
Now, you could put multiple hamsters in a
cage (assuming you aren’t using a breed

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.030
like the common Syrian hamster that cannot
be kept together lest they murder each other).

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.250
But if you did this, you’d definitely want
to put in place some sort of breeding control

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.770
unless you had in mind to sell excess hamsters
for profit.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.370
But either way, according to the Humane Society,
hamsters need about two square feet of cage

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.830
per hamster for a happy little life- and as
we all know, a happy worker is a good worker.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.860
So doubling up or more would just mean bigger
cages and thus the cost benefit might not

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.240
really be all that much unless you’re just
a cruel person caring only for electricity

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.020
to power your iPhone and not for any creatures
you have to step on to get it.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.020
(#Hamsterlivesmatter)

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.510
The real savings here with regard to cages
might simply just be in economy of scale.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.030
If you called up a hamster cage making company
and said you wanted to place an order for

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.030
500,000 hamster cages, we’re pretty sure
that after doing a little happy dance, they’d

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.630
be willing to cut the price down pretty markedly.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.030
How much is impossible to say, of course,
as no hamster cage maker we could find lists

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.222
the type of discount they’d give on an order
of 500,000 hamster cages.

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:31.580
However, based on what we found from large
scale hamster cage maker’s wholesale bulk

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.349
pricing (when purchasing hundreds of units
at a time), it would seem you can get an adequately

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:39.690
sized hamster cage setup for $3-$5 per unit,
cutting the price for cages down to roughly

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.990
$2 million.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.350
But wait, there’s more.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.340
You’ll also need food for the hamsters.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.870
A 2lb bag of hamster food can last around
a month and will cost you about $5 if bought

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.870
in bulk.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.129
(Or, at least, given current bulk prices of
pre-packaged hamster food grain mixes.)

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.590
This means that feeding about a half million
hamsters will cost about $30 million per year.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.659
Now normally we might say that some government
subsidies might kick in here similar to what

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.680
coal power enjoys, but in this case probably
not.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.940
You see, about 30% of the electricity generated
in the U.S. comes from coal power.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.280
Thus, if the power companies all decided to
switch to hamster power from coal, this would

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.289
result in a required grain mix food supply
of about 400 trillion pounds per year for

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.150
the approximately 16 trillion hamsters needed.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.330
Unfortunately, this eclipses the annual world-wide
production of grain which currently sits at

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.620
about 6 trillion pounds per year.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.759
So we’re going to go ahead and assume given
it would only be possible for a very small

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.460
percentage of the population to benefit from
hamster power and that it wouldn’t ever

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.120
scale beyond that, until Big Hamster inevitably
starts to line the pockets of politicians,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.290
no such subsidies will exist.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.830
That said, on the one-house scale, we’ll
go ahead and allow for a pretty substantial

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.419
discount given the massive bulk orders one
would be placing annually here.

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.979
And from a little googling around on what
granaries in the U.S. tend to sell various

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.030
grains for by the ton, it would seem the actual
price of the hamster food annually would be

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.789
about $1 million per year, give or take a
few hundred thousand dollars.

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:07.310
Of course, hamsters running on a wheel won’t
do you much good unless there is some sort

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.050
of electricity generating device hooked up
to them.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.520
So what will that cost?

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.720
At the high end, electric motors that can
generate 0.5 joules per second each at around

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.009
a ballpark RPM rate needed here would run
in the range of $3 million without bulk discounting.

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.530
Unfortunately we were not able to find a supplier
that would give us a quote for what a half

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.430
a million of such motors would cost with discounting
applied.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.629
But from much smaller scale bulk discounts
we did observe, we’re willing to bet one

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:31.719
could probably cut the price in half.

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:34.750
So we’ll just go ahead and estimate those
little motors would cost around $1.5 million…

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.080
Work with us here people.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.150
But we’re not done.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.520
Your hamster power plant will take up a significant
amount of floor space.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.999
If you take into account the size of a small
cage and the accompanying food stores and

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:49.370
aren’t being Hitler to the Hamsters, this
would maximally take around a million square

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.610
feet of warehouse space.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.629
However, this can be substantially reduced
via stacking the cages up as far as their

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:56.169
structural integrity could take.

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:00.029
For the sake of argument, let’s say you
stacked the cages 10 high and spaced the rows

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:01.699
about two feet apart for access.

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:05.249
Now, the exact number of rows needed would
depend partially on the design of cages and

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:09.999
warehouse layout, but we’ll ballpark it
and say you’d need roughly 300 rows, meaning

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:17.509
a warehouse roughly 600 ft by 320 ft or around
192,000 square feet of space.

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:24.439
Adding in space for food storage and the like,
and 200,000 square feet (about 450 feet by

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:27.340
450 feet) seems like a reasonable estimate.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:34.320
Now, the co-author of this piece, Karl Smallwood
of FactFiend fame, actually went ahead and

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:40.010
contacted a real estate agent leasing a similarly
size warehouse as would be needed here and

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.950
was informed that for a long term rental the
price could be negotiated down.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.463
But unfortunately he was rebuffed when they
asked what we’d be using the space for and

00:08:46.463 --> 00:08:47.950
he started talking about hamsters.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.510
So, bottom line, we never got an official
estimate of how much the price on the space

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.310
could be negotiated down too.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.370
Thus, instead we went with the average rental
cost of large warehouse space per square foot

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.280
in the U.S. which is about $4.80.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.980
This would create an additional cost of $960,000
every year.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.590
Now, a typical hamster can poop quite a bit,
but we had a really hard time tracking down

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.510
a figure on exact daily pooping rates of hamsters.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.170
However, after observing a friend’s hamster
for an hour and spending some time on hamster-owner

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.850
message boards, we concluded that they probably
poop about 20 times a day, give or take.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.110
Multiplying this by the amount of hamsters
you, our fictitious burgeoning mad genius

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:32.110
will own, this means you’ll have to deal
with about 10 million tiny hamster turds per

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.110
day.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.640
Estimating that each adorable little piece
of fecal matter weighs about a gram, you’ll

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:43.271
have to somehow clean up 10,000 kilos of poop
every day- the cost of which varies depending

00:09:43.271 --> 00:09:45.130
on how you plan on disposing of it.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.910
However, we’re prepared to write off the
cost of disposal completely given the potential

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.820
here to make the poop, composted with the
soiled wood shavings, a money maker if used

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.010
for fertilizer or things of this nature.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:02.080
And, in fact, using biogas recovery systems
similar to ones developed for generating electricity

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.070
via cow-poop, there’s even potential for
some electricity generation this way to offset

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.870
the cost before moving on to the fertilizer
stage.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.080
So, again, we’re going to go ahead and summarily
call the poop and wood shaving disposal cost

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.080
a wash.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.130
Rounding out the potential major costs includes
things like climate control, wood shavings

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.940
for flooring for your little hamster army,
water, and caretakers.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.340
We’re prepared to think you could automate
the feeding and watering easily and cheaply

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.870
enough (at least relative to the other costs),
and thus wouldn’t actually need that terribly

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.040
many workers excepting to clean the cages.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.900
As for this, it would appear based on a surprising
number of forum posts around the interwebs

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.840
discussing the length of time it takes to
clean a hamster cage, that a laymen would

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.680
be looking at about 20 minutes per complete
cleaning done weekly and only a few minutes

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.130
for spot cleaning done daily.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:50.750
However, we’re guessing a pro-cleaner could
cut those times at least in half and one could

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.380
probably skip the spot cleaning without too
negatively impacting the hamsters.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.190
Thus, you’d require roughly 350,000 man
hours per month to keep the cages clean, likely

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.190
making up the majority of cost of labor here.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.310
This would be a little over 2,000 or so full
time workers operating the facility.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.830
As this is pretty low skilled work, we’re
going to assign the average salary here to

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.140
be equivalent to the average McDonald’s
worker, and thus bringing your labor cost

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.140
to around $40 million per year…

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.140
Of course, you could always save money here
by employing for free an army of children

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.140
who claim they want a hamster and are willing
to take care of it if given one.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.140
Or, given the pretty steep price tag for non-child
labor, we’re pretty confident you could

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.450
just invest some money into largely automating
the cleaning process as this seems to be an

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.175
easily solvable problem that no one has yet
addressed owing to kids needing to learn responsibility.

00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:23.990
But how much the upfront cost would be on
cage modifications and the like to automate

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.520
the process is impossible to estimate even
with the types of large error bars we’re

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.290
already dealing with, so we’ll leave that
estimate to you, dear reader.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.200
Going back to the daily water requirements,
this would only be in the realm of 10,000

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.490
liters per day (2600 gallons).

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.890
Thus, this cost is going to be negligible
given the average cost of water in the U.S.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:47.290
per gallon from a utility is only about $1.50
per 1000 gallons.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.050
Though, maybe don’t set up your operation
in Southern California…

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.290
As for the wood shavings, as noted, these
need replaced roughly once a week to keep

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:01.060
a healthy, happy hamster, and would maximally
cost about $34 million per year.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.130
However, upon searching, we found a company
that sells baled wood shavings by the semi-truck

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.230
load of the grade and type needed for a cost
of approximately 1/50th of the price of bulk

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.230
hamster bed shavings found at pet stores.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.180
This brings the price down to only around
$600,000 per year.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.320
Moving on to climate control, this would vary
based on climate, but in general most types

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.390
of hamster, despite being desert animals by
nature, tend to prefer temperatures in the

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:26.000
range of 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit or 18-24
degrees Celsius, similar to humans.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.880
So in order to avoid having to use more energy
than the hamsters are generating to climate

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.200
control the facility, you’d probably want
to go ahead and pick a pretty mild to cool

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.200
climate area for your home and hamster power
farm.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.960
You see, it turns out your half a million
hamsters generate quite a bit of heat, so

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.640
with decent insulation and a controllable
heat exchanger system for the warehouse to

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.170
get fresh air coming in while regulating temperature
appropriately, you should have very little

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.790
trouble keeping the warehouse warm enough
in winter.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.600
You can even use some of this warm air to
directly heat your house, cutting out the

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.120
middle man, assuming you want your house to
smell like a mix of hamster, urine, pine,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.730
and feces.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.420
On the other end, so long as you lived in
a region with mild summers and you had ability

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.950
to open the warehouse up to significant natural
air circulation, the summers shouldn’t cost

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.250
you much of anything either.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.000
Pick the wrong climate, however, and this
would be a very different story.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.350
For your reference here, the average cost
of heating or cooling a warehouse space in

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.820
the U.S. is approximately 30 cents per square
foot per year, which would put the hamster

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.310
power plant at around $60,000 per year for
climate control.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.950
This finally brings us to wiring.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.540
Luckily you wouldn’t need very thick wiring
to carry the kind of currents needed here

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.540
to some central power management unit.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.230
And even with the vast length needed, with
the bulk discounting numbers we’re seeing,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:37.310
this cost would be negligible compared to
the cost of the other major factors, at under

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.310
$50,000.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.850
While there certainly would be other costs
associated with rigging up such a setup, including

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:46.060
battery storage, power regulators, etc., given
the cost of the most expensive bits, we can

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.890
safely assume they likewise wouldn’t affect
the overall ballpark figure that much when

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.670
talking about powering a single home.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.540
Thus, to sum up the cost of enough hamster
power to run one home, with the aforementioned

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.070
bulk discounting applied and some reasonable
sized error bars, it would appear we’re

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:06.680
looking at around $6 million the first year
(including setup costs) and roughly $2.5-$3

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.570
million every year thereafter, plus cost of
labor which, depending on the level of automation

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.290
you come up with and/or free child labor,
would likely range from a few million dollars

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.070
per year up to around $40 million.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.010
So what does coal power cost?

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.930
According to Lazard’s Levelized Cost of
Energy Analysis, unsubsidized coal power used

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:29.470
to power one average American home for a year
would cost approximately $1,200, though it’s

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:34.280
noted they don’t take into account external
environmental and health impact costs and

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.280
the like- simply attempting to strip away
more direct subsidies.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.280
But either way, very unfortunately, even if
you wanted to create a breed of Lance Armstrong-esk

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.280
hamsters (though maybe with both balls to
maximize virility, but otherwise do go ahead

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.190
and pump them full of steroids), then go the
insanely inhumane route to cut down on infrastructure

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.620
costs and force long running times, and then
have Big Hamster push hard for government

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.700
subsidies, coal power’s still going to win
this one hands down- humorously probably even

00:14:50.700 --> 00:15:47.660
on environmental impact, all things considered.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:16:21.980
Researchers in 2009 actually found a way of
creating electricity from hamsters, outfitting

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.850
them with tiny jackets that converted their
every movement they made into usable AC energy.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.060
Utilising flexible nanowires made of zinc
oxide that produce electricity every time

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.050
they are flexed, bent or otherwise moved,
the small jackets allowed a single hamster

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.710
to produce about 1 twentieth the energy released
by a AA battery while running.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.320
The idea is to eventually use this technology
to produce clothes that charge our phones

00:16:43.320 --> 00:17:15.020
or other technology such as medical devices
during ordinary movement.
