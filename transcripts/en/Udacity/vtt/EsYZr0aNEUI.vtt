00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.012
Psilocybin is a naturally occurring tryptamine alkaloid. It's the principal

00:00:06.012 --> 00:00:10.800
psychoactive component of so-called magic mushrooms, psilocybe genus of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.930
mushrooms. About 100 species of those mushrooms had been identified, and

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.550
they've been used for, literally for thousands of years within some cultures,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.686
for structured manners and for divinatory and religious purposes. So, recently,

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:35.406
research has been reinitiated with psilocybin as a classic hallucinogen and

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:43.810
exploring some of its potential for therapeutic application. And this work

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.150
points back to research done in the 1950s and 60s for two different kinds of

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.258
indications. One was in cancer patients, primarily terminally ill and the other

00:00:55.258 --> 00:01:01.867
was in addictions area, primarily alcoholism. And we currently have studies in

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:07.860
both those areas going on at Johns Hopkins. So, in the cancer patients, we're

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.060
investigating the effects of a single psilocybin session on the existential

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.180
anxiety or depressed mood that some patients experience as a consequence of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.585
their cancer diagnosis. So, as you may appreciate any terminal diagnosis can be

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:33.169
very psychologically disruptive. And a fairly good percentage of people

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:38.911
confronted with such a diagnosis, really end up, in despair and and reduced

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:47.546
quality of life. We bring those individual in. They're very carefully screened

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:54.138
prior to participation. And if they qualify for the, for the study, then we'd

00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:59.728
give them an opportunity to have a guided and supported psilocybin session in

00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:08.352
our laboratory. The context is that people lay down on a couch, they had

00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:15.304
headphones and eye shades. They're asked to turn their attention in on their

00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:22.303
inner experience. They're in the presence of two guides or monitors with whom

00:02:22.303 --> 00:02:30.676
they've already developed a secure and supportive relationship. And those

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:34.768
people are there for the eight-hour session just to provide a context of safety

00:02:34.768 --> 00:02:41.655
and support. Under these conditions, with very high probability as we've seen

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:46.814
in both cancer patients and other studies that we've run in healthy volunteers,

00:02:46.814 --> 00:02:51.434
the majority of people have what we call a transcendent or mystical type

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:59.881
experience. These are experiences that have actually been well-characterized in

00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:06.676
the general research literature on religion, they occur naturally. And they're

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:12.127
transformative and that they can alter very dramatically someone's entire sense

00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:19.340
of self and attitudes towards life and meaning. The characteristics of these

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.380
experiences include a sense of unity or a sense of the interconnectedness of

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.304
all people and things. A sense of sacredness, reverence noetic sense that there

00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:35.208
is something more true and more real about this experience than every day

00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:41.929
waking consciousness. A positive mood often accompanies these experiences,

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:49.088
often experienced a deep gratitude or sometimes universal love. A transcendence

00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:55.822
of time and space occurs, the time collapses into the present moment. There's

00:03:55.822 --> 00:04:02.050
no past, there's no future, it's being this now. Finally, these experiences are

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.708
said to be ineffable. People, the first thing they say about this kind of

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:11.627
experience is, you know, I can't even put it into words. But with these kinds

00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:17.390
of experiences come, can come great psychological healing. There's been one

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.225
recent published pilot study out of UCLA. We have this trial going at Johns

00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:28.837
Hopkins currently. NYU also has a cancer trial going, and we're really quite

00:04:28.837 --> 00:04:33.853
hopeful that very systematic application of psilocybin in this context could

00:04:33.853 --> 00:04:38.793
transform end of life care, not only for cancer patients but ultimately for us

00:04:38.793 --> 00:04:42.015
all.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:46.367
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For the cancer patients, did they report it helping their relationship with

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:50.719
their family or do their families report that the person was ready to pass on,

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:55.425
or was there any family input on that?

00:04:55.425 --> 00:05:00.097
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, so with the cancer patients, one of the really interesting outcomes is

00:05:00.097 --> 00:05:07.526
their relationship to family and their caregivers. People come through these

00:05:07.526 --> 00:05:11.558
kinds of experiences with a altered core sense of self and their beingness in

00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:18.034
the world. It gives them deep inner strength. And what's really remarkable and

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:24.274
touching is when then that deep inner strength is communicated to their

00:05:24.274 --> 00:05:32.950
caretakers. So people can come through this kind of experience and, and be able

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:40.565
to say, clear-eyed, and emotionally open, you know? I'm dying and, and it's sad

00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:45.429
and I, I am upset to be leaving and, and leaving you, but it's also okay, and

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:50.141
there, and there's something beautiful about this and there's something

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:56.246
absolutely okay, and I want you to know that.

00:05:56.246 --> 00:05:58.222
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And [LAUGH]

00:05:58.222 --> 00:06:03.649
and when that's, it actually gets to me just describing it. But, but when

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:09.021
someone can say that to their loved ones, it has remarkable healing direction

00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.190
both ways.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.120
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I can imagine.
