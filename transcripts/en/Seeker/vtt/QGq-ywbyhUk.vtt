00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.811
Spacesuits are basically personal, wearable
spacecraft that not only keep you alive, but

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:13.670
feed you, let you communicate and yes, you
can pee and poo in them.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.330
If it weren’t for the pressure of our atmosphere
we’d be dead.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.039
Atmospheric pressure compresses our bodies,
keeping fluids in a liquid state and the concentration

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.359
of oxygen high enough that there’s plenty
for us to breathe.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.089
As you go higher into the atmosphere and the
pressure drops off, you run the risk of not

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.809
having enough oxygen and having fluids boiling
out of your body; this starts happening around

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.649
the 40,000 foot mark.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.120
Enter the pressure suit.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.670
Pilots and balloonists started wearing what
are called partial pressure suits in the 1940s.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.359
These were, in essence, tight fitting suits
that physically compressed a pilot’s body

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.440
mimicking atmospheric pressure.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.670
These became the basis of NASA’s first spacesuits
worn by the Mercury astronauts in the early

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.140
1960s.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.780
These were were relatively simple Earth orbital
missions during which the pilot didn’t leave

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.390
the safety of his pressurized spacecraft,
so the suit was there to protect him from

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.729
a sudden loss of pressure: the suits contained
a small amount of trapped gas that would expand

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.740
to inflate the suit if the cabin depressurized,
saving the astronaut.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.100
But NASA soon had bigger plans and wanted
to send their astronauts on spacewalks.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.350
So, the spacesuit needed to change.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.890
The Gemini suits were full pressure suits
with airflow and communications coming in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.680
through an umbilical connecting it to the
spacecraft, but otherwise gave the astronauts

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.780
portable, wearable little atmospheres.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.660
Because, they were walking in space where
there is no atmosphere.But these suits only

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.040
allowed astronauts to go on short spacewalks.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.420
When they got to the Moon, Apollo astronauts
needed suits that would keep them alive for

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.829
hours at a time.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.140
They also had to protect astronauts from the
Moon’s extreme environment — like the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.310
obvious lack of atmosphere, but also the 400
degrees difference between light and shadow,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.950
micrometeoroids, and the rocky terrain — while
still allowing them to walk, pick up rocks,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.260
carry instruments, and sit in a lunar rover.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.329
It was a fully functioning suit that kind
of acted as a personal spacecraft.

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.060
. And it was basically made up of three parts.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.159
First, a diaper which is self explanatory.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.590
Next, a three-layer liquid cooled garment
that circulated cold water to keep their body

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.860
temperature down.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.160
And over those two the astronauts wore the
one-piece, 22-layered, bulky and cumbersome

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.930
suit with built in boots, a drink pouch in
the helmet so they wouldn’t get dehydrated,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.080
and a full communications system.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.370
So, basically a personal spacecraft.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.670
And as the space program grew, spacesuits
evolved.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.700
They were no longer custom made.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.760
Which would have been a problem for me.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.350
Instead, they were assembled from interchangeable
parts: the upper and lower torsos arms, gloves,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.870
boots, and helmets.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.630
Extravehicular Mobility Units were designed
to keep astronauts safe during spacewalks,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.110
and let them go out for 8.5 hours at a time.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.410
They’re pressurized with 100 percent oxygen
to about 1/3 of atmospheric pressure so there’s

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.850
plenty of oxygen to breathe, and sometimes
a little piece of velcro on the inside of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.310
the helmet to facilite a little nose scratch.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.569
And unlike the Apollo lunar suits that are
largely in museums now, these suits were returned

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.480
and reused after a mission.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.450
Looking ahead at missions to Mars, NASA is
going with an entirely new design that focuses

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.230
on mobility and ease, and takes advantage
of Mars having an atmosphere, even though

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.030
it’s an extremely rare one.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.230
One prototype called the Z-2 suit uses new
composites to make a suit that is lightweight

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.250
but still durable enough to stand up to Mars’
environment.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.319
And other suits ditch the bulky look for something
more streamlined.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.379
the “space activity suit” is basically
a skin-tight leotard that could provide enough

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.610
pressure on Mars to make big bulky hard spacesuits
a thing of the past.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.909
But there will probably always be diapers
involved.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.319
And speaking of diapers, how exactly do astronauts
poo in space?

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.620
It’s actually more complicated than you’d
think!

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.610
I chronicled the awkward history of fecal
containment over on my own channel, Vintage

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:47.680
Space, where I look into all kinds of space
history questions!

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.880
I have a soft spot for the iconic Apollo suits,
but what do you think is the most interesting

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880
space suit that’s ever flown?
