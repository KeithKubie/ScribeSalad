him<00:07:39.540><c> at</c><00:07:39.960><c> all</c><00:07:40.200><c> but</c><00:07:40.770><c> I</c><00:07:40.830><c> think</c><00:07:41.040><c> that's</c><00:07:41.190><c> kind</c><00:07:41.460><c> of</c>

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.490 align:start position:0%
him at all but I think that's kind of
 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
him at all but I think that's kind of
the<00:07:41.610><c> point</c><00:07:41.820><c> is</c><00:07:42.090><c> that</c><00:07:42.440><c> it's</c><00:07:43.440><c> done</c><00:07:43.650><c> and</c><00:07:43.800><c> over</c>

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:43.890 align:start position:0%
the point is that it's done and over
 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.010 align:start position:0%
the point is that it's done and over
with<00:07:44.040><c> he</c><00:07:44.550><c> was</c><00:07:44.670><c> hurt</c><00:07:45.030><c> and</c><00:07:45.240><c> he</c><00:07:45.300><c> was</c><00:07:45.360><c> like</c><00:07:45.540><c> okay</c>
