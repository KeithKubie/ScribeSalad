STEPHANIE LIU: Hi everybody.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.660
Welcome to Women Techmakers.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.180
This is Episode 3.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.810
For those of you just tuning in,
this is a series that we

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.910
started back in Google I/O
this year and with Susan

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.590
Wojcicki's senior leadership
here at Google.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.810
And it was really well
received, so

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.880
we're expanding it.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.360
We're really excited to
bring on some really

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.680
fabulous guests today.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.290
And I'll be one of your hosts.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.420
I'm Stephanie Liu.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.790
I work on the Developer
Relations team.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.260
Our team is a team of
engineers that helps

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.750
third-party developers
be successful in

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.690
our developer platforms.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.760
And we're also the team that
helps bring you Google I/O as

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.240
well as well Google
Developers Live.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:49.260
MARY GROVE: Great.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.890
Hi everyone.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.910
My name is Mary Grove, and
I'm the head of Global

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.890
Entrepreneurship Outreach
at Google.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.620
Our team runs the Google for
Entrepreneurs program, which

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.060
basically includes all of
Google's programs and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.480
partnerships to support startups
and entrepreneurs

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.240
around the world.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.590
We have about 50 different
efforts live in over 30

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.130
countries, and we're always
looking for ways to get more

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.690
engaged and help foster
entrepreneurship in local

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.150
communities.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.170
So we're delighted
today to have two

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.220
wonderful guests with us.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.760
I'd like to turn it over to let
them introduce themselves.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.100
First is Angela Benton, the
CEO of NewME Accelerator.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.410
ANGELA BENTON: Hi.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.100
I'm Angela Benton.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.820
And as Mary stated, I'm the
CEO of NewME Accelerator,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.350
which is a technology
accelerator/incubator for

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.930
underrepresented minorities.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.100
We specifically focus on
African Americans,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.190
Latinos, and women.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.580
And our mission is really just
to accelerate the growth and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.330
the success of those
entrepreneurs.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.240
MARY GROVE: Next we're delighted
to have Stephanie

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.380
Palmeri of SoftTech
VC with us today.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.160
Steph, welcome.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.910
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Thank you.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.010
Hi everyone.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.780
I'm Stephanie Palmeri.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.200
I'm a venture capitalist
with SoftTech VC.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.860
We are an early stage micro
venture capital fund.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.940
Our current fund is our third
fund and it has $55 million

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.100
under management.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.330
And we focus on investing
in early-stage startups,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.000
primarily in consumer,
web, and mobile.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.370
Some of our larger investments
and more well known

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.790
investments include companies
like Eventbrite,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.500
fab.com, and Fitbit.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.010
And actually a few months ago,
one of our companies founded

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.550
by a female founder, Victoria
Ransom, was actually acquired

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.130
by Google and that's Wildfire
Interactive.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.300
I focus specifically on our
next-gen commerce and a lot of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.730
our ed-tech investments, but the
fund really works across a

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.940
number of sectors, including
next-generation commerce,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.090
marketplaces, the next wave of
e-commerce, SaaS, and then

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.850
mobile services and
infrastructure.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.300
MARY GROVE: Fantastic.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.525
So thanks for kicking us off.

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:47.600
Stephanie, we'd love to explore
a bit about your

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.510
career path and journey and
sort of what was your

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.100
background experience that led
you into venture capital?

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.440
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Sure.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.110
I have--

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.330
well, I don't think there's any
one path into venture, and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.740
I have a relatively
nontraditional path.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.140
I actually spent the previous 10
years living and working in

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.170
New York City.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.960
And I began my career at
Accenture as a consultant

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.600
working with the market
data practice.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.180
And then I wanted to gain
operational experience.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.760
I thought that would actually
be really important.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.840
I enjoyed the advisory service
role, but I really wanted to

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.910
get my hands dirty
as an operator.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.980
And I ended up having the
opportunity to join Estee

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.200
Lauder in their marketing
department for Clinique,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.110
working really closely with
sales and retail.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.540
And so I spent a few years there
and realized I was not

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.600
cut out for large companies.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600
And in fact, I really
liked working

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.420
with smaller companies.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.650
And I then jumped over to an
early startup in New York

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.000
building applications for sales
and marketing teams,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.280
essentially enterprise suites
to enable sales forces and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.460
marketing teams to communicate
better and to distribute

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.330
content globally.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.980
So I worked really closely
with companies

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.920
like SAP and Diageo.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.510
And at that point, I spent
about two years there and

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.970
decided to go back to get
my MBA at Columbia

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.790
Thought I was going to stay in
New York the rest of my life,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.490
spent two years heavily involved
in the New York scene

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.290
and the startup community there
while getting my MBA,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.610
and worked with a seed fund
called NYC Seed, helped them

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.830
run an early incubator
in New York City.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.360
And worked with a women-led
high-growth

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.620
accelerator called Astia.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.019
And then finally worked at
Lot18, which was an e-commerce

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.070
start-up, all while
getting my degree.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.040
And finished up and decided to
move out to California with

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.130
just two suitcases.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.200
So ended landing in a role with
SoftTech after quite a

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.700
long journey and about two
years of networking and

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.570
getting to people
in this space.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.580
And have really had the
opportunity to leverage my

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.855
background as both a marketer
but also as a consultant and

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:40.850
someone that had to jump in and
figure out how to solve

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.370
problems really quickly
and get to the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.380
heart of a story quickly.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.030
So it's been quite a journey.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.040
MARY GROVE: We're really
glad to have you

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.300
out on the West Coast.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.830
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Yeah,
I'm glad to be here.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.100
STEPHANIE LIU: Angela, do you
want to tell us a little bit

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.800
about your journey and how you
ended up founding NewMe

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.070
Accelerator?

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.500
ANGELA BENTON: Sure.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.490
I think it's actually--

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.470
ANGELA BENTON: --really similar
to Stephanie's.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.850
I mean, there's no kind of like
direct way that you end

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.800
up starting an accelerator.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800
Actually my background is in
design, so I actually started

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.240
out in this industry that
is print publishing

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.110
that's around still.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.350
But at the time I was laying out
magazines and everyone was

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.060
saying, oh, we're not
going to have any

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.640
jobs if you're a designer.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.470
The internet is going to like
kill all of our jobs, and so

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.110
you better teach yourself
how to code.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.980
So I taught myself how to code,
and I ended up getting

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.880
jobs after that basically
as a front-end engineer.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.550
And I did a lot of side projects
and I worked a lot of

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.020
different startups, and I
eventually ended up working at

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.100
IAC, which is InterActiveCorp,
for several of their

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.120
businesses, lendingtree.com,
realestate.com, And Then also

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.130
several different startups
actually within their emerging

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.980
businesses unit.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.190
Which is interesting because
it is similar to a startup,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.660
but it's like working at a
very well-funded startup.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.930
ANGELA BENTON: So that was
quite interesting.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.070
And while I was doing that,
I actually launched a site

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.730
called Black Web 2.0 mainly
because I noticed there was

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.130
just no coverage of what African
Americans were doing

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.290
in the technology space.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.900
And I just started writing
about it from a design

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.420
background.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.570
And that site gained community
kind of on its own, and Wayne

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.380
and I ended up doing
NewME Accelerator.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.190
That kind of birthed out
of NewME Conference.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.730
And it's been a great,
great journey.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.670
It's kind of one of--

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.890
I guess when you think about
kind of what your passion is

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.430
and how you got there, I'm
like I would have never

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.081
guessed I would have
ended up here.

00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:44.090
But it's been great so far.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.700
MARY GROVE: And along those
lines, Angela, you and I first

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.520
met almost two years ago now,
and you had just launched

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.650
NewMe Accelerator and the
program was just kicking off.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.840
Google's been really proud to
be a supporter and a sponsor

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.230
for all three cycles.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.070
How has the reception or the
perception of NewMe changed

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.390
over the last three cycles, and
what has the welcome been

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.970
both from members of the
community in Silicon Valley

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.420
and also nationally
and globally?

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.100
ANGELA BENTON: Sure.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.140
It's been overwhelmingly
positive.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.250
I was surprised mainly because I
did not know what to expect.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.390
And especially when you see
something that doesn't exist,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.510
you're like well, why
doesn't it exist?

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.070
Is it because people
aren't open to it?

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.270
And when Wayne and I started
reaching out to people about

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.430
what we wanted to do
it was so amazing.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.320
Everyone was like, yes, I'm
in, yes, I'll mentor, yes,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.810
I'll speak.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.260
And so we were able to
build off a lot of

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.730
momentum from that end.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.680
Then, of course, we're in the
CNN documentary last year, and

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.100
that was amazing.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.900
And I was talking to someone
the other day, and that

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.210
exposure really kind of
accelerated our own growth,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.330
whether we like it or not.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.840
But it's been great because now
we have people literally

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.480
not just in the States that
are interested in kind of

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.390
self-organizing under our brand
and building community

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.080
around it, but we have people
in other countries that are.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.480
And so that's been an
amazing journey.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.980
I'm glad that we've been able to
have you guys on board from

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.180
start to now, and I'm looking
forward to continuing that.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:16.630
STEPHANIE LIU: Yeah.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.760
So me and Mary do a lot of work
with startups and the

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.610
startup community as well.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.730
And I think we were just talking
outside about how

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.910
amazing it's been the last three
or four years has been

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.270
so much interest.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.950
Like from governments to all
these accelerators popping up,

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.780
and people wanting to get
involved, mentors and

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.669
everything else.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.260
So let's bring it back to the
election because I know much

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.039
of our US audience, even our
international audience , is

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.080
aware that yesterday you
know we re-elected

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.929
President Barack Obama.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.140
And so what's the role of
government in entrepreneurship

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.310
and what are the opportunities
there?

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.450
Steph, do you want to give
some of your thoughts?

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.440
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Yeah, so were
just talking about this

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.950
before we walked in, and I
think there's a really

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.200
interesting opportunity
right now.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.040
So let's talk about
two things.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.970
First I'd say consumer health,
and a lot of the regulation--

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.700
the fact that Obamacare is going
to be around now, and we

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.870
know that, is going to really
change the face of how we can

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.430
begin to bring more towards
consumerizing health.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.490
I think we're going to see a
lot of opportunity there.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.080
But just broadly speaking
in general around

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.390
entrepreneurship and fostering
that within our communities, I

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.350
see a lot of things happening
on the ground.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.410
The combination of the JOBS Act,
the proliferation now of

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.850
crowdfunding platforms here
within the U.S. Are really

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.900
enabling everyday people
to be entrepreneurs.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.040
Not necessarily for high-growth
ventures, but you

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.900
can become a small business in
and of yourself a lot more

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.130
quickly and to have
access to capital.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.460
And on top of that, we're seeing
this movement in the

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.240
maker community and the ability
to produce physical

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.870
product again relatively
cheaply and at scale.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.080
And so I think we're going to
see a lot of companies that

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.410
are going to be emerging
to provide services and

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.001
infrastructure to support this
next wave of entrepreneurship

00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:59.290
in the U.S. And I think
it's really exciting.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:09:59.490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.110
MARY GROVE: I couldn't
agree more.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.860
I think that this is happening
around the world.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.660
We're seeing a lot of
governments asking us, as

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.290
Google, what are recommendations
for what

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.740
governments.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.410
What are the best practices
for how we create an

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.960
environment that is really
conducive to startups,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.720
encouraging them to get off the
ground and really helping

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.290
them scale.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.780
And we've run a number of pilots
over the last year in

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.660
trying to learn from them.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.510
So in Korea, for example we,
launched something called

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.130
Korea Goes Global, which is a
partnership with the Korean

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.680
government.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.350
And they've run a competition
and selected the 30 top

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.930
companies who've just
gotten started.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.670
They've been incubated in Korea
for three months, and

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.370
they're currently spending a
week in London in our Campus

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.330
London project and coming out
here to Silicon Valley next

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.020
week for a week.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.100
So figuring out how can we
actually pilot some new models

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.880
that might be effective and then
use those as examples to

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.050
really set the tone for
what's effective.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.350
ANGELA BENTON: Yeah, I'd
actually piggyback off of what

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.010
Mary's saying.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:54.610
I'm seeing that too just here
locally in the States, but

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.670
when you're talking about local

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.820
governments, it's really global.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.910
I mean in how each governments
can actually

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.380
work with each other.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.310
I was talking to someone in
Israel, and they're interested

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.830
in learning from Silicon Valley
but also bringing

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.260
entrepreneurs from Atlanta and
Detroit there as well.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.140
And so I think if we can
continue to foster that kind

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.360
of communication and that global
sense of community

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.470
around entrepreneurship, it can
help all local ecosystems.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.580
STEPHANIE LIU: So have you see
anything with crowdfunding,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.020
for example?

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.890
You're more at a the very early
stage with Accelerator.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.130
Has that affected anything with
your companies and how

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.920
they're approaching funding
versus traditional VCs?

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.440
MARY GROVE: Sure.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.710
So not as of yet.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.450
However, there are several
crowdfunding platforms that

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.410
continually reach
out to us and--

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:46.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.040
MARY GROVE: --want to start
these kind of huge platforms

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.330
for our founders that
are coming through.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.600
We only have, I think, a couple
of startups that have

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.940
actually tried to use
crowdfunding, but not

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.090
necessarily with too
much success yet.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.930
And so many of them are going
the traditional route, if you

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.660
could call it that.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.940
STEPHANIE LIU: You still
got a job, Steph.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.685
Don't worry about that.

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:08.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.170
STEPHANIE PALMERI: You do.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.020
But you know, interestingly
enough, I was going to say,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.350
one of the most recent deals
we've done at SoftTech, and

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.930
I'm taking the board seat on
the company, is a company

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.070
called Ubooly.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.210
And it's actually a
smartphone-enabled toy.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.550
And it originally began as
a Kickstarter project.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.680
And then later went and joined
the TechStars Boulder class

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.800
this summer, and we actually
funded the company coming out

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.970
of TechStars Boulder.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.060
So I do you think from time
to time we will see these

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.050
projects that will gain traction
and will offer a

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.120
broader opportunity where
there's potentially a platform

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.500
that goes along with the
physical product of the play.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.140
So it can be a great source of
deal flow, really early deal

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.330
flow for us to pay attention
to what's going on.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.460
And then, more broadly, I think
you've got a lot of

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.415
products and companies that are
launching after that and

00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:54.210
they're going to need
distribution once they go

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.730
beyond the crowdfunding
platform.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.360
So I'm starting to see a lot
of early rumblings in the

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.816
market around people thinking
through that problem too.

00:13:01.816 --> 00:13:02.260
STEPHANIE LIU: Interesting.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.420
MARY GROVE: Very interesting.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.310
So last week we hosted NewMe
Accelerator's Demo Day and

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.090
their graduation of their most
class, and we were in the

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.700
process of helping them prepare
for their pitches.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.520
I wanted to ask you both what
advice do you have for these

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.780
entrepreneurs who are
just getting off the

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.600
ground in terms of--

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.770
so maybe Stephanie--

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.530
what are the key attributes that
you really look for in a

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.860
great pitch, a great team?

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.700
STEPHANIE PALMERI: I
hope I can say this

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.530
word on Google TV.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.290
At SoftTech we have this rule.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.030
It's called the "Three

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.000
Asses Rule." [LAUGHTER]

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.870
STEPHANIE PALMERI: It's on the
back of our business card and

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.460
we're pretty liberal with
cursing a bit at work, so

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.360
anyhow let me tell you a little
about the Three Asses.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.320
And it's kind of how we go
about thinking about

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.410
deals we look at.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.220
So the most important
of the Three Asses

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.140
is a smart-ass team.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.460
And the reality is early stage
investing is really just a

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.150
founder, maybe a co-founder,
and potentially a few other

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.500
team members.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.450
And that team is the core team
that's going to get that

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.140
product and that idea off the
ground during the seed phase

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.800
and move on to hopefully Series
A and beyond funding.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.490
So really, at the heart of it,
we're investing in a team.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.860
And what we look for in those
teams are people that have a

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.380
combination of vision and
insight into the market that

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.640
they want to get into,
potentially some practical

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.010
experience, and I'd say at the
end of the day the ability to

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.080
walk through walls.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.290
It's founders that just have a
tremendous amount of passion

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.220
and gumption and the ability to
execute and make sure they

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.440
can make things happen even in
the face of huge obstacles.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.980
The second thing we look for
is a kick-ass product.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.300
A kick-ass is a product that
ideally when companies come to

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.900
us they have got at least a
working prototype if not a

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.480
launched product, some
customers, even if it's just

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.420
people that have played around
with it a little bit, or maybe

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.570
even people that are paying
to use the product.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.400
That's awesome.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.960
Doesn't happen a lot,
but it's awesome.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.766
STEPHANIE LIU: Revenue's
always great.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.260
STEPHANIE PALMERI:
Revenue's great.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.410
Never going to complain
when I see a company--

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.600
STEPHANIE LIU: [INAUDIBLE] says
there's no problem that

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.565
can't be solved with
more revenue.

00:14:56.565 --> 00:14:57.750
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Definitely.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.260
Exactly.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.130
So a kick-ass product.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.020
And then the final thing look
for is the big-ass market.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.570
And rule of thumb, it's a
billion-dollar market.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.310
And we don't expect our
companies to capture 100% of a

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.390
market, and so therefore if you
capture 10% of a big-ass

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.930
billion-dollar market, you've
got $100 million in run rate

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.760
somewhere down the road,
a few years down the

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.560
road, from seed funding.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.330
And so we ask ourselves how
does a company get to a

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.060
million in run rate?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.650
Are they going after a large
enough opportunity?

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.620
And then I'd say the other
things we think about right

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.680
now are what's competition
in that space look like?

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.370
So are there other players?

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.110
Are they well-funded?

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.230
How deep are the pockets?

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.220
Or is there still a lot of
opportunity to come in and

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.980
capture a substantial share
of that market?

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.020
And early stage, we think it
takes about 18 to 24 months of

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.140
capital if you're going to raise
a proper seed round to

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.090
really make that happen if
you're going after a

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.340
venture-backable business.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.850
ANGELA BENTON: So some of the
things we look for, though we

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.535
don't have the Three Asses--

00:15:56.535 --> 00:15:59.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.160
MARY GROVE: --we do look for
a team that's resourceful.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.230
And so we have a set of 10 core
values that we use to

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.360
hire for our team internally,
but it actually extends to the

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.530
people that we want in
the program as well.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.950
And being creative and
resourceful is

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.180
definitely one of them.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.190
We're not too particular on,
oh, we only want to see

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.370
technical founders.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.720
That's always great because you
can actually execute on

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.740
your idea, but even if you're
not technical, if you're a

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.400
business founder, we are hoping
that you learn the

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.870
skill to recruit a
technical team.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.660
Generally, we try to make
sure that they're

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.430
coming in further along.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.450
Initially we had several
companies that were kind of

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:45.550
just in idea phase, but now we
actually have teams that are

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.040
executing well before
they come in.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.390
And then we are basically
helping them refine throughout

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.230
the program, which
is a lot of fun.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.970
We do look at markets and things
like that too, but

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.650
where we really are focused on
making sure that we get the

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.819
right type of entrepreneur
that's for our program.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:11.079
And then I guess chief among all
the things that we look at

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:15.720
is we want someone who's
comfortable in their own skin.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.319
STEPHANIE LIU: So especially
for the Accelerator aspect,

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.240
how much are you-- you know,
you're looking for this

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.410
gumption, right, this like
X-factor or whatever.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.660
So what do you hope
to teach them?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.320
You see somebody and
you're like, OK, I

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.880
can teach you this.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.620
I can see that you
have the passion.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.050
MARY GROVE: Yeah.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.930
So we're looking for people
who are coachable.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.560
And one of the things
I've learned is

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.910
not everybody's coachable.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:43.690
But yes, so people who are open
to actually learning and

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.300
thinking about things
a different way.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.450
Our program is actually
residential, so people live

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.050
and work together
for 12 weeks.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.710
It's very, very intense.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:54.280
STEPHANIE LIU: Like
a reality show.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:54.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.750
MARY GROVE: It is.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.210
It's very, very intense.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.270
And throughout that whole time,
I mean, there's not a

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.530
lot of time for personal time.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.460
You're talking to mentors
basically all day, every day.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.860
You're getting so much advice.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.410
One of the great things that I
love about being based in the

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.150
Bay Area is so many smart people
condensed in one area.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.000
So you get a lot of really great
information, but we're

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.770
looking for people who can take
that information and not

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.410
necessarily have it change
totally what they're doing but

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.110
that they can make an
educated decision.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.920
Like, this is my long-term goal,
this is where I want to

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.210
get to, and this thing that this
person said might apply

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.020
to it and so I'm going to
take this into account.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.190
But this person over here
maybe not so much.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.030
So I think that's one of the
things that's hard to do, and

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.860
so we're looking for someone
who's open to that but still

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:48.560
is very kind of secure in
what they want to do.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.550
MARY GROVE: Wonderful.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.340
So we talked a lot about
mentorship and the importance

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.080
of a network of mentors who have
failed and succeeded and

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.900
can sort of help walk
you through that.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.740
For both of you very
accomplished entrepreneurs in

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.920
your own right, what are some
of the best pieces of advice

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.490
that you've received
from your mentors?

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.130
STEPHANIE LIU: I like the
Three Asses thing.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.082
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:08.082 --> 00:19:08.558
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:08.558 --> 00:19:10.940
MARY GROVE: Three Asses Thing.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.770
ANGELA BENTON: And that will
probably be a recurring theme

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:13.535
that comes up throughout
this session.

00:19:13.535 --> 00:19:14.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.651
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:16.040
ANGELA BENTON: Yes.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.770
One of the best pieces of
advice I've gotten in my

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:25.520
career as a whole is, you know,
I have three kids and I

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.410
wanted to try my hand at
entrepreneurship but that's a

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.370
scary thing to do.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.040
That's a big risk to take.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.330
And I was talking to someone
about it and the only advice

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.110
they said, they were like--
well, I was kind of not

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.570
feeling sorry for myself but
like oh, this would be so hard

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.880
if I took a leap and did this.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.530
And they were like, so what?

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:46.710
Just do it.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.260
And like that was it.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.500
So what do you say after that?

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.050
I'm like, yeah, that's right.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.930
So that's probably my biggest
piece of advice.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.050
STEPHANIE PALMERI: I'd say,
similarly, I had a professor

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:02.340
who was an adjunct at Columbia
who, as I was pursuing venture

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:07.150
after graduation, he was pivotal
in my decision to keep

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:07.860
pursuing that.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.290
And he said to me, look
Stephanie,-- and I think that

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.560
the advice holds true for
founders, too-- there will be

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.220
many, many people who won't
understand your background and

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.280
won't want to take the time to
get to know your story, but it

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.640
just takes one.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.950
And the reality is you just
have to believe enough in

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.940
yourself to keep going, and I
think constantly reassess

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.280
whether or not you're on target
and you're on track,

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.430
and take each bit of feedback
you get as one data point.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.070
But ultimately, if you believe
in yourself and you believe

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.080
enough in your story it does
just take one person to begin

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:38.890
to believe in you.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.730
And I found that in my own job
search process and as I kind

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.950
of move along in my career
at SoftTech.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.030
It just takes one person to
believe in your idea or to

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.280
believe in you as an individual,
and then the next

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.190
person believes and the
next person believes.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.800
So I think it's you've just got
to take that leap of faith

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.461
and believe in yourself.

00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:58.110
MARY GROVE: I love that.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.510
I was reflecting on the
question myself.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.330
And for me I think it's about
mission, defining mission, as

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.130
well as defining non-goals
for oneself.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:05.960
Right?

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.170
Both for myself and then for the
effort that we're building

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.740
here at Google around
entrepreneurship, that's been

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.790
really important to have that
laser focus on the mission,

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.500
which is very broad, right, to
empower entrepreneurs all over

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.530
the world by partnering with
great organizations, by

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.220
creating your own programs, but
then also defining what

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.580
we're not trying to do.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.300
For example, we're not trying
to create our own incubators

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.540
or accelerator programs
at Google.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.200
We're trying to be a platform
that supports and

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:28.990
partners with them.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.240
So equally this is--

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.810
my dream is very big, but my
focus is extremely precise.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:36.940
STEPHANIE PALMERI: We
tell that to our

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.660
founders all the time.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.810
Early stage founders have so
many things that they want to

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:41.840
try with their companies.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.670
And they get capital in there
and they want to go in a bunch

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.140
of different directions.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.480
The reality is there's usually
one or two key things you have

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.840
time to focus on in that first
year or two, and laser focus

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.750
gets you to the next phase.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.360
And then you can begin
to do more.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.920
So even if--and it's great
to hear that at large

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.230
organizations, you think
the same way.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:59.720
The laser focus is really what
I think moves the needle.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.340
MARY GROVE: Absolutely.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.741
STEPHANIE LIU: I mean, Mary's
team is basically a startup, I

00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:03.346
think, too.

00:22:03.346 --> 00:22:03.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:04.560
STEPHANIE LIU: She's doing
the whole world

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.446
with like three people.

00:22:05.446 --> 00:22:06.378
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:06.378 --> 00:22:08.710
STEPHANIE LIU: So you've still
got to focus, for sure.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:09.380
MARY GROVE: Trying to
be lean and scrappy.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.470
STEPHANIE LIU: So we're talking
about mentorship, and

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.740
so what do you think is the
most important lesson-- is

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.210
that also the most important
lesson you've

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.120
imparted on your companies?

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.280
Do you find that you're saying
the same things over and over?

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.130
Or is every case a little bit
different when you go in?

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:32.010
And like I'm going to build this
up in you, so this is the

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.740
background I can bring here.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.800
STEPHANIE PALMERI: I mean,
each founder's a unique

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.010
snowflake, right?

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.700
So each company and each founder
is slightly different,

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.440
but there are a lot of
repeatable patterns that you

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.400
begin to see.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.690
And so I can look at a subset
of founders and say these

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.330
founders are really great at
doing X, Y, and Z, and

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.220
potentially their businesses
would improve by

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.420
pulling this lever.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:58.820
But the reality is that you try
to customize your advice

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.430
and the relationships you help
those founders build to each

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.550
unique case.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.130
But I think the way in which a
firm like mine scales is that

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.960
we do begin to recognize
those patterns.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.500
We do one to two deals a month,
right, so we're 40

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.390
deals into our current fund.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.420
We'll do another 20, 25.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.470
And so in three years' time,
we'll really begin to

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:21.390
recognize patterns out of that
cohort of companies.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.570
So yeah, you customize what
you're saying, but I think you

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.915
begin to recognize these
patterns over

00:23:26.915 --> 00:23:28.300
and over again, too.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.970
STEPHANIE LIU: So just to shift
gears a little bit.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.660
Angela, you coming from
a design background.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.430
You have a marketing background,
like kind of a

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.500
different background than like
tech, what you might think of

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.020
as a tech background, right?

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.700
I think something that came out
of the original panel back

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.880
around Google I/O was Susan was
saying that what brought

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.120
her to tech was the deep
creativity that

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.180
was available here.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.670
And that deep creativity you
had, the freedom you had, to

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.910
just build something.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:01.940
And I think that a lot of women
are sort of put off by

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.960
tech because they see it as
maybe too sterile or they

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.400
don't identify with
the culture.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.790
So I guess I wanted your guys's
thoughts on the role of

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.340
creativity in entrepreneurship
and technology.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.940
And maybe talk to some of these
women and tell them like

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.180
what kind of experience
you're having here.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.770
ANGELA BENTON: Yeah, so one of
the biggest things that I tend

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.290
to tell people about the
technology industry is I

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.790
really just think it's like
an image problem.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:32.470
ANGELA BENTON: Like people think
that you're like a nerdy

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:37.240
white guy in a room or in a
basement coding and that's it.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.840
And that's what technology
looks like.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.350
But it's really creative.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.190
You do get your hands dirty.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:48.060
I love what I do because I not
only get to build NewMe as its

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.590
own startup, but I
get to help other

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.180
people with their startups.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.500
And it's a lot of
tangible work.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.830
I mean, my design background,
while I don't design as much

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.790
and I don't code as much
anymore, a lot of the way how

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.770
I think is kind of
design thinking.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:04.790
You know what I mean?

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.420
And so really like how we're
thinking about executing on

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:12.020
the next cycle or how we're
thinking about scaling, all of

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.930
that really kind of goes back
into the creativity that I

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:20.330
learned like in Design
Theory 101.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.150
STEPHANIE PALMERI:
I totally agree.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.550
It's a little bit of
an image problem.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.830
Not only is it creative, but
I think the reality is the

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.790
stereotypes we have around tech
are, again, sitting in

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.550
that room, dark, working
alone and solo.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.070
And what we don't talk
enough about is

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.230
that it's about teams.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.500
And it's about teams working
together to create and build

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.830
products and to test
and try ideas.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.840
And that as you move up within
that team, there's opportunity

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.510
to take on leadership roles
and management roles.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.280
And you're potentially not in
the daily grind of writing

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:48.910
code anymore.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.710
Now suddenly you're
a leader as well.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.530
And you can be a leader on a
small team or a large team,

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.110
but I think the reality is we
don't talk enough about the

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.480
progression of what those
careers look like.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.400
And then how you can take
something in that career and

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.060
apply it towards something
that's potentially not as

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.120
technical but more
management-related.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:06.820
Right?

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.860
So I've always been
interested in the

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.080
intersection between the two.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.510
You know, I studied management
information systems and

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.570
marketing in college and so kind
of continued to always

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.510
find a way to merge technology
and marketing

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.810
throughout my career.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:24.180
And I'd agree that I don't think
it's talked enough about

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.040
about what career diversity
looks like.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.200
And you think about oh, an
engineer or a computer science

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.785
major does X, Y, and Z and sits
in that dark room and

00:26:31.785 --> 00:26:32.880
they really don't.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.590
ANGELA BENTON: Yeah particularly
as it relates to

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.890
entrepreneurship, though.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.510
It's like there's all of this
training and activity around

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.100
building the product, finding
out who the customer is,

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.280
launching, scaling.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.900
There's not enough information
around actually developing

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.960
leadership skills.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.440
And I didn't realize that until
we started to get a lot

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.540
of alumni out of the program,
and they're coming back to us

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.480
with questions and they're
really management and

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.450
leadership questions.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.620
MARY GROVE: Very interesting.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.350
So the other spin on the
question of diversity and the

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.400
importance of diversity in teams
or in the ecosystem, the

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.200
industry in general.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.650
I would love to get both
of your thoughts.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:12.560
Clearly, Angela, your program is
to foster female founders,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.090
African American,
Latino founders.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.460
And Stephanie, you talked about
investing in startups

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.400
that have female founders
as well.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.330
So talk to us about the state of
the landscape, and how has

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.290
it evolved over the
last few years.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:27.550
What do you think are effective
mechanisms to really

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.980
help foster diversity among
teams and within companies?

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.030
ANGELA BENTON: Sure.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:36.730
Well there's been so
much activity.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.990
For me I think back to 2007,
when I couldn't find anything

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.880
and it's like I just started
this little blog.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.530
So for me I'm like, whoa, it's
all of this stuff now.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:45.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.890
ANGELA BENTON: And so that's
really, really great.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:50.200
That's really great to see.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.620
I'm hoping what the
future landscape

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.440
includes is kind of--

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.800
I guess to piggyback off of what
I just said, there seems

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.190
to be this sequential number
of steps that need to be

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.390
integrated where maybe you're
in a pre-incubator and then

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:09.500
you go to an accelerator and
then you get funded.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.940
But I feel like all the activity
is great, but it

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.730
needs to be a little bit more
kind of cohesive so that we're

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:19.210
really making the kind
of impact to change

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.886
what things look like.

00:28:21.886 --> 00:28:23.030
STEPHANIE PALMERI: All right,
let me see if-- can you repeat

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.700
the question again?

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.050
MARY GROVE: Sure.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.480
I guess we were talking
about diversity.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.580
And then so there's
diversity--

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.880
STEPHANIE PALMERI: We see a
lot of diversity, right?

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.266
MARY GROVE: You do.

00:28:30.266 --> 00:28:30.652
I'd love to--

00:28:30.652 --> 00:28:31.040
STEPHANIE PALMERI: We do.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.270
MARY GROVE: So among the
startups that you've met, for

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.355
example, have you noticed any
noticeable trends in teams

00:28:36.355 --> 00:28:37.480
that are [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.470
and women [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.770
STEPHANIE PALMERI: So first off,
one thing I notice is a

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.600
lot of times I'm the first
female investor that a lot of

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.770
these companies meet with.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.920
And that's particularly exciting
when a female founder

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.000
walks in the door.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.340
And the conversation sometimes
completely changes.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.290
And we just step aside from
talking about the business to

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.430
kind of talking about some of
those dynamics as well.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.010
And I think that's exciting.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.660
It's exciting for me to be at a
place in the industry where

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.800
I can have that kind of
connection to a founder.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.560
Whether or not I end up doing
the deal, I am able to

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.200
personally connect.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.590
Because I know what's it's like
to walk in the room and

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:12.500
potentially be the only
one sometimes.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.460
We actually meet with quite a
female founders, and I think

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.840
some of that is the fact that
I'm a woman in our firm and we

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.450
have a relatively diverse
firm to begin with.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.840
And we're early stage and so
there's a lot of women that

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.470
are sort of getting into
starting companies these days

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.510
as opposed to women that have
been leading companies looking

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.550
for follow-on funding.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.800
So that makes a lot of sense.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:37.110
The other thing I've noticed,
though, is that previously a

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.570
lot of the female founders that
were coming to SoftTech

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.380
were building companies not
necessarily focused on women.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.070
So we've seen definitely a shift
towards female founders

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.420
building companies
focused on women.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.480
And particularly within the
next-gen gen commerce space.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.250
I'll give you an example of a
deal that we did recently is a

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.780
company called True&amp;Co.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.350
And it's an e-commerce
play around a fit

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.830
algorithm to fit bras.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.710
So kind of applying, in a sense,
the home trial model to

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.640
ship five bras, see
how they fit.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.810
And the interesting thing about
that conversation was

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.050
that when Michelle Lam, the
founder, came to us to pitch

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.116
the idea, she and I didn't
have to spend 20 minutes

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:19.130
talking about what
the issue was.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.616
MARY GROVE: What's the problem
you're trying to solve?

00:30:21.616 --> 00:30:22.062
STEPHANIE PALMERI: What's
the problem

00:30:22.062 --> 00:30:23.850
you're trying to solve?

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:24.530
I understood the problem.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.685
And I think the reality is
there's a lot of women that

00:30:27.685 --> 00:30:30.480
are starting companies these
days that are focused on

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.430
problems that women have.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:35.580
And then female investors can
kind of get to the core of

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.250
that problem much quicker
and move on to

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:38.750
the meat of the business.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.930
And I think that's exciting.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.840
I do, however, think just in
general, the lower barrier you

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.700
talked about, the need to not
necessarily be an engineer to

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.790
launch a company, there
is a lower barrier--

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.910
it's easier to get an idea into
testing and to determine

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:54.930
feasibility.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.450
And so you don't necessarily
need to have a technical

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.670
background.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.903
I think you do hit a wall
eventually if you don't have a

00:30:59.903 --> 00:31:00.648
technical team in
place, though.

00:31:00.648 --> 00:31:02.950
MARY GROVE: Um-hmm.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:05.200
Makes sense.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.070
STEPHANIE LIU: So I had another
question based on you

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:14.385
said that you don't use design
as much anymore.

00:31:14.385 --> 00:31:16.900
And there was something that
came up which is that there

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.030
are a lot of companies--

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.640
the barrier to entry is low.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.290
So it's pretty crowded space.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.230
So more and more marketing
and design--

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:30.130
who happen to be the two experts
we have over here--

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.220
are now like big
differentiators.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.580
Especially in early stage, when
you're trying to fight

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.990
your way out of this like
pit of [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.540
STEPHANIE PALMERI:
So you're saying

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.693
it's all about execution.

00:31:38.693 --> 00:31:40.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.790
STEPHANIE LIU: So what advice
could you give a startup out

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.210
there about either looking at
their design or looking at

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.280
their marketing techniques to
differentiate themselves?

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.880
MARY GROVE: Hmmm.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.010
Let me put my creative
hat back on.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.074
STEPHANIE PALMERI:
I'll dive in.

00:31:55.074 --> 00:31:57.260
You know, I work with
the early stage

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:57.930
founders all the time.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.290
And the reality is it's focusing
on those one or two

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:03.800
core metrics that are to move
the needle for your business.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.320
So what is that measurement
that you need to focus on?

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.160
Every decision you make about
your product, about your

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.960
marketing, about your hiring,
about your spending, is all

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.010
going back to those core metrics
that are going to move

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.680
the needle and get enough either
traction, customer

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.610
engagement.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.940
So it's either customer
acquisition, maybe user

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.630
engagement, retention, it
potentially could be revenue,

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:31.280
but the reality is early stage,
it's identifying what

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.470
those core metrics are and
making really tough decisions

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.330
that you're focusing
on those metrics.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:36.810
ANGELA BENTON: Yeah.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:42.870
From a design perspective, with
HTML5 and CSS3, I mean

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.790
there's so much flexibility now
in what you can actually

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:48.110
execute and how you actually
execute it.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.890
And so I think there is
a lot of opportunity.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.880
The issue with design then
becomes how do you become the

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.960
most creative person?

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.260
How do you make sure
that nothing you do

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:00.840
exists right now?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.326
And I think that--

00:33:01.326 --> 00:33:01.812
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:01.812 --> 00:33:03.970
ANGELA BENTON: --that's an issue
that designers have.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:08.180
I know I've had that issue
several times.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.670
But one of the things that
I was actually talking to

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.980
someone about is, again, back
to this idea of being

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.080
collaborative and it's
not someone solo

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.440
working in a room.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.490
So how do you get other
creatives around you, but the

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.180
diversity of creatives.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.730
Maybe it's not just
all designers.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:30.830
Maybe it's someone who is a
videographer or someone who

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:35.040
does something else, does
signage or whatever.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.710
And taking all of those elements
so that you're not

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:42.260
just designing really kind
of for like a 2D space.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.240
With HTML5--

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.400
I just saw this, oh, it
was Square's site.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.590
Oh my gosh, I was just on their
site and like literally

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:53.390
it was HTML5, but it was
basically like a 3D type of

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.160
experience.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.450
So that's my advice.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:57.860
MARY GROVE: Nice.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.520
MARY GROVE: We have an audience
question, shifting

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.970
gears to our moderator
page for Stephanie.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.360
And Stephanie, it says one
of the most difficult--

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:04.980
STEPHANIE PALMERI:
Thanks, John.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.238
STEPHANIE PALMERI: He warned
me he was going to do this.

00:34:08.238 --> 00:34:08.686
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:08.686 --> 00:34:10.480
MARY GROVE: Our viewers may
benefit from this advice.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.590
The question is that one of the
most difficult challenges

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.440
in starting hardware-based
startups is that it's such a

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.850
capital-intensive business
to scale

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.460
beyond initial prototype.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.870
And Stephanie, how does that
affect the way you evaluate

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.719
potential investments,
especially at the seed level?

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:26.540
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Well John,
that's a great question.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.860
We've now done two investments
in a physical product.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:37.090
The first was Fitbit, which our
founder, Jeff Clavier, did

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:38.679
several years ago, I
think back in 2008.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:42.460
And I think that may have
been pre-prototype.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:46.030
And the second one we've done,
which is Ubooly, which I

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.429
mentioned earlier.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:51.420
And Carly and her team actually
had a physical

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.380
product being manufactured.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.909
It was pretty much ready
to ship by the

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:55.600
time we did the deal.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.510
So I think a lot's changed in a
few years, and the products

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.850
are very different products.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.600
But the reality is it
is a lot harder.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.390
The capital requirements for a
physical product are a lot

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.910
more intense.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.960
I think to begin with, certainly
crowdfunding

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.250
platforms showing some initial
customer interest is one good

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:19.130
way to kind of demonstrate to
later stage seed investors

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.590
that there might be some
interest in your product.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.370
But that being said, I think
there will be certain products

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.330
that will resonate with
certain investors.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.620
And part of our job is to do
enough diligence to understand

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.120
what does your model look like,
what does it actually

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:42.900
take to get a product produced,
and in what volume

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.546
and what kind of traction will
be significant to get you to

00:35:45.546 --> 00:35:46.180
the next phase.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.400
So it may take a slightly
larger seed round.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.640
It may take a little bit more
patience in terms of capital.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.770
But essentially, when we think
about investing in physical

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.330
products, we're not just

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:00.460
investing in physical products.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.900
The physical products we're
investing in have a much

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.560
broader platform.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.060
Usually they're a
hardware-software play.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:13.170
Both Fitbit and Ubooly really
are software plays.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.020
And so we're looking--

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.420
you know, the physical
product is great.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:16.990
Get it there.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.990
Show that you can build it.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.160
Demonstrate how you
will build it.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.620
But really what we're looking
for as venture capitalists is

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.800
a product that goes beyond the
physical product and creates a

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.110
platform and an ecosystem
around it.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.062
Hope that answers your
question, John.

00:36:31.062 --> 00:36:33.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.290
STEPHANIE LIU: That makes sense
given that "soft" is in

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:34.760
the SoftTech.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:34.920
In the name.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.340
STEPHANIE PALMERI:
Yeah, exactly.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.650
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Yeah I
think that's a French

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:39.913
derivative there, but yeah.

00:36:39.913 --> 00:36:40.386
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:40.386 --> 00:36:42.280
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.550
STEPHANIE LIU: So, speaking of
hardware, going off that a

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.710
little bit.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.360
So in general, though, when
you guys are looking at

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.220
companies to invest in, as
you're building out the

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.800
portfolio, are there certain
markets, specific markets,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.310
you're trying to hit?

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.390
Like you're trying to get
a company that sort of

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.750
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:57.470
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Sometimes.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.900
That's a great question--

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.370
I mean it's a split
between the two.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.210
So we deal in pretty
high volume.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:05.230
So one to two deals a month
is a lot of deals.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.490
There's certainly times where
we sit down as a firm or as

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.890
individual investment
professionals within the firm

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.650
and say, I'm really interested
in exploring and looking for

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.930
opportunities within
this space.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.850
And we may make an effort to try
to meet a lot of companies

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.520
in a short period of time that
focus on a particular area.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.430
But the reality is we just have
a lot of inbound deal

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.000
flow through our network, and
so we consider opportunities

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.340
that kind of fit with the
thesis, but we also have the

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.620
opportunity to experiment
and do things

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.160
outside of the thesis.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.360
Really good example, I think, of
that is we've recently done

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.300
three deals in the last year
in education technology.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.330
And a year ago, we had zero
investments in ed-tech.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.170
And we did our first investment
in a company called

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:52.770
ClassDojo, and ClassDojo sort
of opened our mind to the

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.410
opportunity within education
technology.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:58.440
And later on we've moved on to
do an investment in a company

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.420
called Top Hat Monocle, and then
finally Clever, which we

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.600
just announced a
few weeks ago.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.750
And so I would say sometimes
we go out and look for a

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:07.630
particular space.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.880
Sometimes a space sort of comes
knocking at our door,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.910
and it opens our eyes to broader
opportunities within

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.740
that sector.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.830
STEPHANIE LIU: Yeah, so it's
interesting because from the

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.360
accelerator perspective, you
expect the pivots to be kind

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.500
of like fast and furious.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.060
And you might be in a totally
different space

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.040
than when you started.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.570
So what approach do you guys
take to building a good-- like

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.660
you said, you talked about
this "Big Brother" living

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.650
together for 12 weeks thing.

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.210
So how do you build
a good dynamic?

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.580
How much of that is in the back
of your mind when you're

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.330
looking at applications?

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:39.750
ANGELA BENTON: So our
applications have some

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.925
behavioral questions that we
kind of infuse in there so it

00:38:42.925 --> 00:38:46.970
can kind of give us a sense of
who this person is, if they

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:49.170
fit our core values,
if they would be a

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:52.510
good fit for our program.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:58.040
But kind of to piggyback on what
you said, I mean, we are

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.110
kind of not necessarily vertical
agnostic, but we're

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.700
just getting a lot of different
type of companies.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.190
So for instance, this cycle we
had a lot of education of

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:12.530
companies that applied, and so
that was like reflected in the

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.870
founders that we
actually chose.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.690
And so that added an interesting
dynamic that we

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:22.060
had at least two education
companies in this past cycle

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:26.240
who are not necessarily
competing but they're in the

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.420
same space, and so that hadn't
kind of happened before.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.350
But the dynamic, I would say
we've been lucky to not have

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:37.170
any major issues because
of the--

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:38.235
STEPHANIE LIU: Like direct
competitors.

00:39:38.235 --> 00:39:39.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.548
STEPHANIE PALMERI: No one's
fighting it out.

00:39:40.548 --> 00:39:41.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.200
ANGELA BENTON: No direct
competitors.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.730
And I would say as we're
looking through the

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.930
applications it's not
something that we're

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:50.700
consciously aware of like, oh
my god, these two companies

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.080
are really interesting so they
can't live together.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.920
It's just something that
happens kind of more--

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.585
STEPHANIE LIU: It's
more organically.

00:39:55.585 --> 00:39:56.740
ANGELA BENTON: --organic,
yeah.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.595
MARY GROVE: So to that then,
Angela, can you talk to us

00:39:58.595 --> 00:40:00.600
about some of the shining stars
that have come out of

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.292
NewMe Accelerator.

00:40:01.292 --> 00:40:04.580
Either this season or from
previous seasons.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.140
ANGELA BENTON: So AgLocal is a
favorite of everyone's, which

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.880
is great, and basically what
they're developing is a

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.410
marketplace that connects
farmers who are growing or

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:21.310
raising sustainably-fed meat
and connecting them with

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:24.030
restaurants and consumers.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:29.870
But this last cycle that
we had, we have--

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:32.260
they did a pivot, so I always
want to call them Whoorli, but

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.290
their new name is Derbywire.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.970
And they are kind of near and
dear to me because what

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.390
they're building is a
marketplace for creatives.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:47.110
And I can't wait to put it on
my tablet later tonight when

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.990
it's in the App Store because
I've been trying to--

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.570
I take all these really great
pictures on Instagram but you

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:55.410
can't monetize that
right as of yet.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:56.590
And so it should
be interesting.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.450
I can't wait to be like
user number one.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.360
STEPHANIE PALMERI: So it's
launching tonight

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.270
in the Droid Store?

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.330
ANGELA BENTON: In the Android
Store, so it's

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.550
Derbywire, so yes--

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:05.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.400
ANGELA BENTON: --happy
about that.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.460
Picture Menu is also
one that's great.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:17.590
He actually just got his app in
to the Apple iPhone store.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:17.710
Yeah, oops, sorry.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:23.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.690
ANGELA BENTON: And Kairos is
something that's a little bit

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.700
different because they're
an enterprise play.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.840
So they're not consumer and
they're not B2B, and they have

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.740
a lot of traction
with JCPenney.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.000
They're actually testing their
roll-out in several of their

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.750
stores, and basically what they
do is they use facial and

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.580
object recognition to allow
companies to manage your

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:49.130
businesses better, whether
it's using it as a way to

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.043
check in as a time clock.

00:41:51.043 --> 00:41:51.910
So those are--

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.100
MARY GROVE: Quite
a range there.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.220
ANGELA BENTON: It is.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:54.905
It is.

00:41:54.905 --> 00:41:57.280
But again, if you're like really
creative, I'm like oh,

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.120
I don't have to do all this
other stuff because all these

00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.920
people are doing it.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.380
And I can help them out.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.582
MARY GROVE: Very cool.

00:42:03.582 --> 00:42:04.900
Steph, shining stars?

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.680
STEPHANIE PALMERI:
Shining stars.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.620
I'm addicted to a company we
have called Poshmark, which is

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.870
a marketplace for women's
clothing.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.530
So second sell something-- take
a photo of something in

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:18.700
my closet, upload it on my phone
really quickly, and list

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.336
it to the market immediately.

00:42:21.336 --> 00:42:22.250
ANGELA BENTON: I need that.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.380
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.440
STEPHANIE PALMERI: I open this
up several times a day and

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.970
spend way too much time on it
to the extent where I'm

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:33.010
worried that the founders are
like, what are you doing?

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:33.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.610
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.030
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Did your
shoes get listed?

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.030
So that's a fun one and that's
one that I really-- but I

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.670
think the interesting thing
about that business is it kind

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:47.710
of goes off the collaborative
consumption theme.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.860
So it's recycled.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.970
It's sharing items, or
reselling, and exchanging

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.060
items from my closet
to your closet.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.320
And we're seeing a
lot of interest

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.654
obviously in that area.

00:43:00.654 --> 00:43:01.470
Yeah.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:02.950
STEPHANIE LIU: So we talked
about-- we touched on

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:10.140
e-commerce fashion and, well,
with bras and reusing or open

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:17.010
up my closet kind of thing and
edu, so do you see more women

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.215
entering these spaces?

00:43:18.215 --> 00:43:18.995
I'm just curious.

00:43:18.995 --> 00:43:19.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.100
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Yeah.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.820
Absolutely.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.420
I mean I think the reality is
you have a lot of women that

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:30.580
have industry background,
whether it's fashion, media,

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.850
things that are applicable
to the business

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.670
side of these startups.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:38.430
And the lower barrier to
produce, to get a site up and

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:42.230
running or an app up and running
has enabled these

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.890
founders, and in many cases
these women, to, at a pretty

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.770
low cost, begin to test some of
these concepts and launch

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:49.530
businesses.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:53.490
And to compete potentially with
large players that are

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.380
burdened by physical retail.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.950
So I think what's going on in
commerce right now is quite

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.060
interesting.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.650
We've done a number of
investments in this space.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.760
But I think it's also a great
opportunity for women.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.670
Although I hate to discourage
women from starting companies

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:09.870
outside of those spaces, but I
think absolutely, if you're a

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.710
female and you have built a
passion as well as a potential

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.230
professional background in these
sectors, there's a lot

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.570
of opportunity there.

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:23.700
ANGELA BENTON: Yeah, several of
our founders have industry

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.900
expertise kind of turn-tech
entrepreneurs because of that,

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.230
which actually makes them
more appealing to us.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:33.140
So Carolina with Spriggle, who
they were just in the last

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:37.050
cycle, that was here last week,
has experience as an

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.590
educator, had launched a charter
school that has helped

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:41.750
thousands of families.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:46.790
And now she's basically taking
her experience to basically

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:51.460
distribute science and education
toys to moms kind of

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:55.590
using the Mary Kay model.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:45:00.040
And Rachel Brooks from Citizen
Made is also participating in

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:04.030
the e-commerce and maker's
market like a lot of your

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.980
founders are.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.730
STEPHANIE LIU: Very cool.

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.970
MARY GROVE: So thinking about
the path from accelerator to

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.340
fully-launched company to
investment, do you see,

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.805
Stephanie, any-- do you tend to
see among investments that

00:45:17.805 --> 00:45:20.750
you make a prevalence of those
companies having gone through

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.480
an incubator or accelerator
or--

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.380
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Majority of
our companies don't come out

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.450
of an accelerator.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:28.510
We certainly do invest in
companies that do come out of

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:29.790
accelerators.

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.490
In any given month, we may do
one deal coming out of an

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.220
accelerator, but we certainly
don't have a bias

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.430
one way or the other.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:42.070
I think at the end of the day,
we're looking for just really

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.890
strong founders with ideas
that have traction.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.320
And I think the decision to
participate in an accelerator

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.480
program is a very personal
decision for a founding team.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.270
I think it can provide
a lot of resources.

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:58.420
I think for first-time
entrepreneurs, it provides

00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.930
access to networks that
they maybe didn't

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.450
have exposure to before.

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:06.840
But as we look to back second-
and even third-time founders,

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.140
it's really rare to see those
founders coming through an

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:09.445
accelerator.

00:46:09.445 --> 00:46:10.010
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.160
STEPHANIE PALMERI: So it's
really looking at--

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.000
for us, we're looking at the
company and the prospect for

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:14.540
the company.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.940
The accelerator bit
comes second.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.190
But I think at the end of the
day, there's just been a

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:20.960
tremendous amount of interest
in that area.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.020
And I think if anything, it's
producing a lot of companies,

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.310
and it's my job to kind of
filter through and say what

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.690
are the best companies
regardless of where the source

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:32.782
is coming from that are going
to get to the next stage?

00:46:32.782 --> 00:46:37.040
STEPHANIE LIU: So as kind of
closing thoughts, what do both

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.020
of you think we need
to be doing?

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.610
What does everyone need to be
doing in the investment

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.190
community, in the startup
community, entrepreneurship

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:48.310
community, to get
more diversity?

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:51.880
What's the call to action now
for everyone out there?

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.630
ANGELA BENTON: I think the
biggest call to action is

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:58.460
everybody is busy, so it's
really just being

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.520
conscious about it.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.900
People aren't willfully
exclusive, it's just people

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.580
are busy and they have
things to do.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.940
And so it's like when you're
looking in your networks your

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.100
networks tend to be made up of
people who are like you, and

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.000
so it does actually take more
effort to be more inclusive.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.340
And so just being conscious of
it would be a big thing.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.820
STEPHANIE PALMERI: I think it
takes an effort on behalf of

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.770
both women and men.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:29.460
And I think as women we do
have more females in our

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.910
network, so it is about I'm
a woman who's on an upward

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.480
trajectory, I'm going to bring
two more women along with me.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.040
Right?

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.330
And the women above me, I look
to to help pull me along too.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:43.200
But I also don't exclude myself
in just looking for

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.440
women to provide that.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:49.560
The reality is the majority of
the folks in the space that we

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.800
all are in are males today.

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.230
And that only changes if both
men and women are there to

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.280
kind of get a seat
at the table.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.730
And I think it's naturally
beginning to happen.

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:00.650
I think we're just seeing trends
whether you're looking

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:04.500
at more board seats and even
Fortune 500 executives

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:08.560
naturally, the number is
slowly creeping up.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.640
The same is true for the number
of female founders

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.320
getting funded.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.570
The same is true for the number
of females entering the

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.100
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:14.720
community.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.500
But I think if we're a little
bit more actively involved

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.410
about asking women
to take a seat--

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:20.410
you know what I'm excited for?

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:23.380
I'm excited for the day where no
one invites any of us to do

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.200
a panel about women.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:24.680
Right?

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:24.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:25.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.450
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Where
suddenly we're just part of

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.580
the conversation.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.680
And it's not oh, wait, we need
to remember to invite a woman

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.610
to join us.

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.970
And I think we'll get there
within maybe not my

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:39.900
generation, but I think
we're on the way.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.750
STEPHANIE LIU: What do you guys
think of Dave McClure's

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:45.890
challenge to get more women
involved in $5,000 seed-level

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.810
funding and really put money
where your mouth is?

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:51.830
Do you think that's going to be
an effective way to bring,

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:56.060
like you said, a lot more people
to the table, and make

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.216
more people aware of it?

00:48:58.216 --> 00:49:00.200
ANGELA BENTON: I think it'll
definitely make more people

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.890
aware of it.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:08.370
Also, I think, while the barrier
to entry is low to

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:13.590
begin with, I think having
$5,000 will also kind of let

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:17.700
people take that leap and
it's less of a risk.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.520
Even though it's not much, it's
still less of a risk.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.540
STEPHANIE PALMERI: I think
it's important to have a

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.420
conversation about having more
women begin to give back.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:28.780
But what I would say to any
investor is you invest in the

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.370
best companies and the best
people, regardless of gender.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:34.990
I would like to see more female
angels around the table

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.390
so that there's more women
thinking about investing and

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:38.360
making investment decisions.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.805
And potentially growing a
portfolio at a small stage so

00:49:41.805 --> 00:49:43.980
that they can potentially
move on and do it more

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:44.480
professionally.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.310
But there's a really big
difference between being a

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:49.800
professional investor and
casually making small angel

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.670
investments.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.520
But I think any attention that's
put on this space right

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.220
now is relatively positive
attention, so I'm

00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.070
happy to see it.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:02.370
And I would encourage more women
to think about how they

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:04.430
can get involved in the
community, whether it's

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:09.140
mentorship, investing, or
actually starting a company.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:09.986
STEPHANIE LIU: Mary,
any final thoughts?

00:50:09.986 --> 00:50:11.600
What do you think
about this one?

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.660
MARY GROVE: Yeah, we've
thought a lot about

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:16.070
entrepreneurship and the
cultural values of Silicon

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.550
Valley and what makes the
ecosystem here thrive so much.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.930
And I think we've been fortunate
to work really in

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:21.940
every region of the world.

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.890
And I think that
entrepreneurship is absolutely

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:26.800
thriving, not just in the
Valley, not just across the

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.280
country, but truly
across the world.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.690
It's more vibrant than ever.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.370
We've talked a lot about
the barriers to entry

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:32.230
being lower than ever.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:36.020
I think it's truly that time,
and for all of us who are

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.500
thinking about programs or
partnerships or developing

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.360
these outreach programs to have
an eye for inclusion in

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.690
all senses of the word,
geographic, gender, otherwise.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.120
I think it really does take
a community and takes a

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.000
concerted effort, and
I'm similarly

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.400
very bullish and hopeful.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.370
STEPHANIE LIU: Well thank
you guys so much

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:55.470
for joining us today.

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:56.790
I think this was a great chat.

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:59.710
I feel like my next career is
going to be talk show host.

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:00.260
LAUGHTER]

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.280
STEPHANIE LIU: Like "The
View." I love this.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:01.850
I love this right here.

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.980
ANGELA BENTON: We have
a good dynamic.

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:03.370

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:03.760

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.730
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Next time
we need the table with all

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:07.030
four of us all in one
tiny little place.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:09.908
MARY GROVE: Yeah, thank you
guys for joining us.

00:51:09.908 --> 00:51:10.320
ANGELA BENTON: Thanks
for having me.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.140
STEPHANIE LIU: So and--

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:11.430
STEPHANIE PALMERI: Thank you.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:13.400
STEPHANIE LIU: --thank you for
joining us and tuning in.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.920
Please remember to tune in
tomorrow because we'll have

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.330
Diane Greene, who's the former
CEO of VMware as well as she's

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:19.580
on the board of directors
for Google.
