00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.630
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History and today you aren't going to get

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.880
a blow by blow chronology of the American
Revolution, and you aren't going to get cool

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.510
biographical details about Thomas Jefferson
or George Washington. But you are going to

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.780
get me not wearing any pants.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.100
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Did you know that George
Washington might have had slave teeth

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.280
implanted into his jaw?

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.810
Yeah, I did, Me from the Past, and while it's
fun to focus on metaphorically resonant details,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.730
what we're concerned with here is why the
American Revolution happened and the extent

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.429
to which it was actually revolutionary. Plus,
for the first time in Crash Course history,

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:38.079
I have a legitimate chance of getting through
an entire episode without butchering a single

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.119
pronunciation. Unfortunately, next week we
will be in France, and je parle français comme un idiot.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.700
[theme music]

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.260
So, intellectual historians might put the
roots of the American Revolution earlier,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.899
but I'm going to start with the end of the
7 Years War in 1763, which as you will recall

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.779
from last week was:
1. Expensive, and

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:07.450
2. A victory for the British, including British
subjects living in America, who now had more

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.619
land and therefore more money.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.189
Right, so, in 1765 the British government
was like, “Hey, since we went into this

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.219
debt to get you all this new land, we trust
that you won't mind if we pass the Stamp Act,

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.839
in which we place a fancy stamp on your documents,
newspapers, playing cards, etc., and in return,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.979
you give us money.”

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.740
Well, it turns out the colonists weren't so
keen on this, not so much because the tax

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.640
was high because they had no direct representation
in the parliament that had levied the tax.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.570
And plus, they were cranky about the Crown
keeping large numbers of British troops in

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.030
the colonies even after the end of the 7 Years
War.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.479
And then the British government was like,
“You are inadequately grateful,” and the

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.299
colonists were like, “Shut up we hate you,”
and the British government was like, “As

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.780
long as you live under our roof, you live
by our rules,” and so on, but eventually

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.819
the British backed down and repealed the Stamp
Act. The repeal inspired a line of commemorative

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.159
teapots, thereby beginning America's storied
tradition of worthless collectible ceramics.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.639
But, in the end, this only emboldened the
colonists when the British tried to put new

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:04.850
taxes on the Americans in the form of the
Townshend Acts. These led to further protests

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.670
and boycotts and most importantly, more organization
among the colonists.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.340
The protests escalated: 1770 saw the Boston
Massacre, which with its sum total of five

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.400
dead was perhaps the least massacrey massacre
of all time, and in 1773, a bunch of colonists

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.400
dumped about a million dollars worth of tea
into Boston Harbor, in protest of British

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.099
government decisions that actually would have
made British tea cheaper. Oh it's time for

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.519
the open letter?

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.040
Ah... oh, that did not go well. An Open Letter
to Tea. But first, let's see what's in the

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:41.149
secret compartment today. Oh, it's a gigantic
teabag. Hm. Let's see what flavor it is...

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:42.700
Bitter tyranny variety!

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.810
Dear Tea,
Like all Americans who love justice and freedom,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.099
I hate you. But I understand you're quite
popular in the UK where the East India Company

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.830
would periodically go to war for you.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.730
But, what fascinates me about you, tea, I
mean, aside from the fact that people choose

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.540
to drink you when there are great American
refreshments available, like Mountain Dew,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.170
is that even though you're stereotypically
English, you're not English. It's Chinese,

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.959
or Burmese, or Indian. No one really knows,
but it's definitely not English. You didn't

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.099
even have tea until, like, the 1660s. Posers.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.500
Best wishes, John Green

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.250
So, The Boston Tea Party led to further British
crackdowns and then mobilization of colonial

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.840
militias and then Paul Revere and then actual
war, but you can hear all about that stuff

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.010
on, like, TV miniseries. I want to focus on
one of the ways that colonists protested unfair

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.950
taxation. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.260
As previously noted, the English Crown benefited
tremendously from the import of consumer goods

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.730
to the American colonies, and one of the most
effective ways American colonists could protest

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.579
taxation without representation was by boycotting
British products.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.579
In order to enforce these boycotts, the protesters
created Committees of Correspondence, which

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.480
spread information about who was and was not
observing the boycotts. And these committees

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.879
also could coerce non-compliers into compliance
- which is to say that they were creating

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.409
and enforcing policy, kind of like a government
does.

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.450
The Maryland Committee of Correspondence,
in fact, was instrumental in setting up the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.469
first Continental Congress, which convened
to coordinate a response to the fighting that

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.200
started in 1775. This was back when congresses
did things, by the way. It was awesome.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.269
Anyway, the Continental Congress is most famous
for drafting and approving the Declaration

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.870
of Independence. No, Thought Bubble. That's
the Will Smith vehicle Independence Day. I

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.230
mean the Declaration of Independence. Right,
that one. It's not your fault, you guys are

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.820
Canadian. You've never declared independence.
Worth noting, by the way, that the congress

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.010
edited out more than a quarter of Jefferson's
original declaration, and he forever after

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.330
insisted they’d "mangled" it.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.290
Anyway, I would argue the heavy lifting of
the American Revolution was already done by

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.300
the Declaration. In truth, by the time the
shooting started, most of the colonists were

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.290
already self-governing and had developed a
sense of themselves as something separate

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.040
and different from Great Britain - as evidenced
by these "Committees of Correspondence," which

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.710
functioned as shadow governments - eventually
reaching out to foreign governments, establishing

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.680
an espionage network, tarring and feathering
loyalists and royal officials which, by the

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.360
way is incredibly painful and dangerous to
the victim, and even recruiting physicians

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.020
to tell American men that drinking British tea would
make them weak and effeminate.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.100
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.220
Now, despite all this, about 20% of colonists
remained loyal to Great Britain throughout

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.600
the war, especially in the major cities that
Britain occupied. Also lots of slaves continued

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.630
to support the British, especially after Britain
promised that any slaves who fought with them

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.580
would be freed.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.720
And it's worth noting that while we generally
celebrate the Revolution and see it as a step

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.040
toward justice and equality, the people who
most needed the protection of a government

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.500
might have been better off and more free,
if Britain had won. Especially since Britain

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.240
ended slavery well before America did, and,
you know, without a civil war.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.250
Also, even though most Americans had come
to see themselves as separate from Britain

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.930
before 1776, the British certainly didn't
see it that way. They continued to fight either

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.980
until 1781 or 1783, depending on whether you
calculate by when they actually gave up or

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.480
when the peace treaty was signed.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.850
So you can't really say the American Revolution
was won before the fighting even started.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.610
But the truth is, the American Revolution
and the war for independence weren’t like

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.440
this. They were like this.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.360
So, here's what was pretty revolutionary about
the American Revolution: The colonists threw

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.420
off the rule of an imperial monarchy and replaced
it with a government that didn't have a king,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.320
a radical idea in a world that didn't feature
many non-monarchical forms of government.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.070
And, if you look at the explanations for the
revolution, especially those contained in,

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.700
like, the Declaration of Independence and
in pamphlets, like Thomas Paine's Common Sense,

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.660
there's definitely a revolutionary zeal that’s
informed by the Enlightenment. And that's

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.840
especially true if you focus on the idea of
liberty, as many of the pamphleteers did.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.370
That said, if you look at the actual outcome
of the revolution, aside from the whole no

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.930
king thing, it wasn't that revolutionary.
Let's look, for instance, at two ideas central

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.390
to the revolution: property rights and equality.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.880
So the Articles of Confederation gave the
government no power to tax, which had the

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.900
effect of making sure that people who had
property were able to keep it because they

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.280
never had to pay the government anything in
exchange for the right to own and use it.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.390
And that's very different from taxation systems
dating all the way back to, like, Mesopotamia

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.430
and Ancient Egypt.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.080
And it's probably not a coincidence that most
of the writers and signers of the Declaration

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.980
of Independence were men of property, and
they wanted to keep it that way. So, basically,

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.590
the white guys who controlled the land and
its production before the American Revolution

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.880
were the same white guys who controlled it
after the American Revolution.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.820
And this leads us to the second, and more
important way that as a revolution, the American

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.080
one falls a bit short. So, if you've ever
studied American history, you're probably

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.670
familiar with the greatest line in the Declaration
of Independence: “We hold these truths to

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.510
be self-evident, that all men are created
equal.” Sorry, ladies.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.550
And, you also may know that at the time those
words were written, a large segment of the

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.220
American population, perhaps as much as 30%,
were slaves of African descent who were held

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:37.540
as property and were definitely, 100% not
treated as equal to whites. In fact, the guy

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.260
who wrote those words held slaves, and was
fighting against a government who promised

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.670
to free any slaves who supported it.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.360
Furthermore, women couldn't vote, and neither
could white men who didn't own enough property

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.450
- meaning that the government of, for, and
by the people was, in fact of, for, and by

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.470
about 10-15% of the people.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.300
But here's the real question: Was the American
Revolution what the historian Jonathan Israel

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.650
called “a revolution of mind?” Did it
change the way we think about what people

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.670
are and how we should organize ourselves?
Addressing those questions will involve a

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.790
brief foray into the history of ideas. Let's
study the Enlightenment!

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.340
The Enlightenment was primarily a celebration
of humans' ability to understand and improve

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.160
the natural world through reason. The Enlightenment
had a number of antecedents, including the

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.820
European Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution,
but what made it special was that some of

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.200
its more radical proponents - like, Immanuel
Kant, for instance - went so far as to argue

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.790
that human reason rendered a belief in God
unnecessary and, by extension, proclaimed

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.990
that any belief in divine intervention or
a divine plan for humanity was just superstition.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.829
Given that this was coming out of an overwhelmingly
Christian Europe, this was a pretty controversial

00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:44.660
suggestion, and not all Enlightenment thinkers
would go that far. And more moderate Enlightenment

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.600
thinkers were also more willing to countenance
hierarchical social and political structures.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.350
Like John Locke, a major Enlightenment thinker,
formulated his version of inalienable rights

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.949
as life, liberty, and property. And that's
much more traditional than arguing, for instance,

00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:58.250
that property should be held communally.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.959
And it's no coincidence that the more moderate
Enlightenment thinkers, like Locke and Adam

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:06.220
Smith, happened to be British, and the real
radicals were French. And the founders of

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.350
the United States, were far more closely linked
to those British Enlightenment thinkers than

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:14.879
to the French, who influenced the French Revolution,
which as we will see next week, goes swimmingly.

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:17.970
But even if the government that America's
revolutionaries came up with didn't overturn

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.490
privilege or tear apart the social order as
the French Revolution tried to do, it did

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.639
make significant changes. America made sure
that there would never be a formal nobility,

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:27.670
except for the Count of Chocula.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.420
And, it recognized the equal rights of daughters
and widows, when it came to inheriting and

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.149
possessing property. Also, it created a world
in which future countesses could rehabilitate

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:36.389
their reputations in New York.

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:40.459
But, the real seismic change was that after
the Revolution, Americans came to view themselves

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:45.250
as equal to each other. And, in the context
of the 18th century, that was pretty radical.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.610
"Ordinary Americans came to believe that no
one in a basic down-to-earth and day-in-and-day-out

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:56.079
manner was really better than anyone else.
That was equality as no other nation had ever

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:57.569
quite had it."

00:09:57.569 --> 00:10:01.360
And in the end, the ideas of the American
revolution - ideas about property and equality

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.850
and representation - are still hugely important
in shaping political discourse around the

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.529
world, and particularly in America. And by
America, I mean the United States. I'm sorry

00:10:09.529 --> 00:10:14.550
Canadians and Mexicans and Central Americans
and South Americans. We're provincial, okay?

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.560
I mean, here in the United States, our Presidential
candidates must both know how to wear a suit

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.310
and how to bowl.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.649
But the American Revolution also reminds us
- as the French one will next week - that

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:27.379
revolutionary ideas and values are not always
easy to live up to. Nothing challenges one's

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:31.709
belief in equality quite like becoming rich
and powerful. Indeed, rare is the revolutionary

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:36.399
who doesn't become, on some level, like Orwell's
pigs, insisting that while all animals were

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:38.769
created equal, some were created more equal
than others.

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:42.769
In short, if you're going to base your new
society on philosophy, you should try to found

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:47.800
it on ideals that are as inclusive and humanistic
as possible - because the people executing

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.160
those ideas will never be ideal. Thanks for
watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.579
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson,

00:10:56.579 --> 00:11:00.649
the show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, our graphics

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:04.360
team is Thought Bubble, and we are ably interned
by Meredith Danko.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.279
Last week's phrase of the week was "Historian
Feuds." If you want to suggest future phrases

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:10.259
of the week, or guess at this one you can
do so in comments, where you can also ask

00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:13.379
questions about today's video that will be
answered by our team of historians.

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:16.649
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
