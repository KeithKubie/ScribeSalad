Now the answer to this question is most likely this first region

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.490
down here. And the reason is because it's in front of where the

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.540
mRNA synthesis will likely begin, here. This will allow all the important

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.640
proteins necessary for the process to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.000
assemble and initiate transcription from here onwards.
