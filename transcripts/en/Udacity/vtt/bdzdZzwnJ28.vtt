00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go back.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We can say that the sun's rays being vertical in Syene, that's not entirely true.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The way we made the calculation, that's about a 20% error.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We saw it was 16% on one side and 24% on the other,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so I'm just going to say it's about 20%.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're just trying to get a big picture idea of where our error is coming from here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What about measuring the angle of the sun's rays in Alexandria?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
How much error would we get from this measurement?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's think about how we did the calculation.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We put a vertical rod upright in Alexandria

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and allowed the sun to shine on it, which caused a shadow down here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
By measuring the length of this shadow and the length of this rod,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we could calculate this angle, which we called alpha.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So the only real place for error in this calculation--

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
well, there's 3 places for error in this calculation.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The first is making sure the rod is vertical.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
By simply hanging a weight from a string,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
you can assure that something is vertical

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because you know that weight will always point straight down,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
straight to the center of the Earth.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So this wasn't really something to worry about.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The next comes from measuring the rod itself, measuring the length of the rod.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We know that nothing can be measured to exact precision,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but they had pretty good measuring devices even 2,000 years ago,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so I don't think there's much error introduced in measuring the length of this rod,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and I think we can safely say it's negligible and not worry about it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Finally, we have measuring the length of the shadow.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
When you try to do this experiment at home--

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and that will be one of the homework assignments;

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we're all going to collect this data together--

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you'll find that measuring a shadow length isn't completely trivial.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In fact, shadows are a little fuzzy. It's hard to tell where they begin and where they end.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So actually, there is some error here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Let's say it's about equal to--I don't know--1 centimeter, which is 1/100 of a meter.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If we're talking about a shadow whose length is 100cm,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that would be a 1% error.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
1cm is 1% of 100.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I want to know how can we best reduce the percentage error

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
with the measurement of the shadow.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Should we make the measurement many times?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Should we use a really, really big rod?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Or should we use many rods of varying length?

00:02:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which of these would best reduce the percent error?
