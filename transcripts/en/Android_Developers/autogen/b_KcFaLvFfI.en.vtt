00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.480
 there I only your marine grandson is to see you ask 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 blocking the team through the bargain 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.190
 google and today this video shows you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.170
 how to implement the slide integrates the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.029
 from one to the other with the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.310
 continuous feedback that the user can 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 to see very smooth how is it going 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.170
 must have seen this our application of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.119
 google play good this is the example of how 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.430
 is that implementation will be where you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.559
 can see the indicator is changing from a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.100
 leg to the other very smoothly 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.879
 while you drag there from the other 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.460
 continuously so you do not have any 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.120
 the screen appears for an hour to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.610
 other 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.590
 good to start doing this the first 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.320
 step is the layout 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.690
 I have it first when I read the theses in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.539
 top with slide in tag layout 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.879
 tap down on the river asks him to go 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.770
 is basically content in this place 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.660
 At this point it is important to remember 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.300
 put the full name past the slide 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.400
 intab layout ok because this is a class 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.240
 that will be included in your 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.490
 code 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.369
 well after that I have to do a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.830
 set up a certain specific order is the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.650
 next you will first pick up and get 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.189
 instance of the river fish and define or 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.439
 to adapt a possible kiss and then just 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.080
 the slide integrates layout from our side 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.479
 also set the river and fish needed 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.900
 providing the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.430
 communication between the two and I have 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.380
 here or adapt 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.759
 in this case after what you want but the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.950
 that we are seeing here this moment is 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.200
 To Set A Tahiti Jet Plane Is Important 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.299
 you also define scale because this 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 method called whenever it is necessary 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.680
 set the title of the tag you do not put 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.360
 That's when I put something wrong. 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.170
 title of the thesis the name of the land will stay 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.820
 incorrect 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.520
 in this case you are only using a title 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.159
 based on item position had a team 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.380
 2 and so on 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.729
 well then you can get those 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.939
 classes there that you experiment with 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.219
 make goal I had in the beginning here the video 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.160
 another personal legal example is this one 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.129
 today you will notice as you change from 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.510
 one for another, the indicator is 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.370
 changing color and it changes during 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.950
 position and even the message 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.379
 was red after now yellow 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.239
 ok and it's possible to make this transaction 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:26.140
 very cool way and with the feedback 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.670
 good continuity, the first people we 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.280
 definition of some data that I will 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.379
 use to configure 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.690
 these tags to configure the tab and 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.670
 everything else is a title there. 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.890
 I indicated the triumph of Wagner and indicated 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.739
 ter is to unify the thesis title and where 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.599
 will be the separator from one tag to another 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.010
 ok you can save this shape you 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.700
 want in another resource in another file 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.950
 that when you get good access and there 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.629
 setap is a bit different in this 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.209
 in case we are using a 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.859
 other more personal adapter if you have 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.989
 another care you want to use 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.060
 What do you already use, there's no problem, the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.799
 It is also important to keep the sequence 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.900
 startup 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.090
 In this case the late afternoon has a Doppler 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.310
 that the Colorado team tell me where I'm going 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.519
 write two meters that the indicator 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.340
 color jet wagner colo nÃ© indicator 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.870
 will stay in the tag title and I'm 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.629
 using those data I showed in the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.120
 At first I'm doing jet position. 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.199
 Where are you going? 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.230
 whose data 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:27.760
 just remembering that it will always try to gray 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.919
 but in case you want to do something 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.959
 more colorful and that the will is just to change 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.540
 the position of the colors that you go 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.849
 achieve a very interesting result 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.620
 and there adapts it is very precise that they had it 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.870
 state before the difference is that now 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.120
 I'm taking the title according to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.650
 position also dataset here 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.590
 instead of doing the kind of agreement with the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.900
 position is good, good staff or 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.449
 complete functional codes 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.949
 go to the site was address has both 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.720
 base that the former and how 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.760
 had cholera if you see how the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.159
 color introduction the link will also 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.290
 be in the description of the video and 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.690
 Will to test new colors test 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.620
 new layouts leaves application still 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.209
 more beautiful 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.209
 thank you guys until the next
