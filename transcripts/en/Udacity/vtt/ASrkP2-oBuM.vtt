Here's my answer. We've actually done this before, basically.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For L in links, if l.id=link id, return l.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's give this a test real quick.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So print link by id (24).

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We give this a run.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And we see our link has returned.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And if I give it a link ID that doesn't exist--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
let's try 50--and run this--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we get none, which is what we expected--nothing.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Okay, let's make this a little bit more complicated.
