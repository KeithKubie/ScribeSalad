00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.770
Cid is experimenting
with a piece

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.650
of sandpaper and some wood.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.870
He tries scraping the
piece of sandpaper

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.530
over the wood in different ways
to see how much is scraped off.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.390
The thickness of wood
scraped off, in millimeters,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.800
as a function of the
speed of the sandpaper,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.440
in meters per second.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.610
t of v.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.230
So this is the
thickness scraped off.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.650
So that's the thickness,
or how much is scraped off.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.990
And it is a function of speed.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.910
One, they're using v and also
they're getting negative value.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.840
So we care about the direction.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.730
It's actually the velocity.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.900
So this is how much is scraped
off as a function of velocity.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.350
It's shown below.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.230
And so if the velocity
is greater than 0,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.420
that means that the sandpaper
is moving to the right.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.160
That makes sense.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.730
That's the standard convention.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.335
And if the velocity
is less than 0,

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:54.080
it means the sandpaper
is moving to the left.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.170
Fair enough.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.860
The function is even.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.050
What is the significance of
the evenness of this function?

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.330
Well, the fact that it's
even means that t of v

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.220
is equal to t of negative
v. So that tells us

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.640
that if our velocity is 8
meters per second to the left

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.640
we're going to get
as much scraped off

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.937
as if we go 8 millimeters
per second to the right.

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:25.270
And we see that right over here.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.430
So that is equal to that.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.550
If we go at 6 meters
per second to the left

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.660
we're going to get just
as much scraped off

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.430
as we go 6 millimeters--
6 meters per second,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.020
these are in meters per
second-- to the right.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.490
So these two are
going to be the same.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.820
So it's really telling
us-- and we could say do it

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.360
for 4 meters per
second and negative 4--

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.150
is it doesn't matter if we
go to the left or the right.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.520
What really matters is the
magnitude of the velocity

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.407
or the absolute value of it.

00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:56.990
But it doesn't matter if we're
going to the left or the right.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.700
Whether we're going to
the left or the right

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.930
for a given
magnitude of velocity

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.150
we are going to get the
same amount scraped off.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.650
Now let's see which
of these choices

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.009
are consistent with
what I just said.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.300
Moving the sandpaper faster
scrapes off more wood.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.530
Well, that's true.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.120
We see as the speed increases,
or the magnitude of the speed

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.490
increases, we scrape
off more wood.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.919
As the magnitude of the
speed, this negative 8,

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.960
you might say, hey, that's
lower than negative 2,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.110
but the magnitude is larger.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.570
We're going 8 meters
per second to the left

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.040
and we're scraping off more.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.470
So this is a true
statement, but it's not

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.590
the significance of the
evenness of the function.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.630
This could have been true
even if this was a seven,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.690
but then this function
would no longer be even.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.290
The piece of wood is
six millimeters thick.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.900
We actually don't get any
of that from the function.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.440
Moving the sandpaper
to the right

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.750
has the same effect as
moving it to the left.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.470
Well, that seems pretty close
to what I had said earlier.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.610
That for a given speed to
the right or to the left,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.090
we get the same amount
that is taken off

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.910
of the piece of sandpaper,
or the piece of wood.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.300
So this looks like our answer.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.320
Keeping the sandpaper still
doesn't scrape off any wood.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.420
Well, that is true
but once again

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.780
is not the significance of
the evenness of this function.
