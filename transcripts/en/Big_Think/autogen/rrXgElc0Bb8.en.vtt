vitamin and that's vitamin b12 because
 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.029

origin or bacterially fermented foods so
 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.370
origin or bacterially fermented foods so
you have to make sure that you've got a

you have to make sure that you've got a
 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.489
you have to make sure that you've got a
source of vitamin b12 in your diet and

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499
source of vitamin b12 in your diet and
 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.139
source of vitamin b12 in your diet and
that you're eating a variety of foods

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149
that you're eating a variety of foods
 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.929
that you're eating a variety of foods
but other than that I just don't see it

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939
but other than that I just don't see it
 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.590
but other than that I just don't see it
as an issue at all except for kids for

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600
as an issue at all except for kids for
 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.480
as an issue at all except for kids for
small children and sometimes hard for

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490
small children and sometimes hard for
 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.849
small children and sometimes hard for
children to get enough calories unless

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859
children to get enough calories unless
 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.800
children to get enough calories unless
they're getting enough fat in with the

they're getting enough fat in with the
 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.590
they're getting enough fat in with the
vegan diets that they're getting but

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600
vegan diets that they're getting but
 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.080
vegan diets that they're getting but
parents vegan parents know how to deal

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090
parents vegan parents know how to deal
 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.709
parents vegan parents know how to deal
with that most of them and do a pretty

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719
with that most of them and do a pretty
 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.779
with that most of them and do a pretty
good job and the kids are healthy it's

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789
good job and the kids are healthy it's
 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.510
good job and the kids are healthy it's
fine I said I kind of see all that as a

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520
fine I said I kind of see all that as a
 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.169
fine I said I kind of see all that as a
non-issue and I'm surprised and the

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179
non-issue and I'm surprised and the
 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.279
non-issue and I'm surprised and the
passion about it on both sides I still

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289
passion about it on both sides I still
 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.830
passion about it on both sides I still
hear from people about how dangerous

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840
hear from people about how dangerous
 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.959
hear from people about how dangerous
vegetarian diets are which seems kind of

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969
vegetarian diets are which seems kind of
 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.949
vegetarian diets are which seems kind of
silly and on the other hand I hear from

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959
silly and on the other hand I hear from
 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.080
silly and on the other hand I hear from
vegetarians and vegans about how

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090
vegetarians and vegans about how
 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.440
vegetarians and vegans about how
terrible it is to eat meat and I don't

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450
terrible it is to eat meat and I don't
 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.670
terrible it is to eat meat and I don't
buy either one of those

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680
 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.250
yeah the issue of meat-eating and the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
yeah the issue of meat-eating and the
 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.979
yeah the issue of meat-eating and the
environment is a very important one

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989
environment is a very important one
 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.559
environment is a very important one
particularly industrially industrially

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569
particularly industrially industrially
 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.440
particularly industrially industrially
raised meat in confined animal feeding

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
raised meat in confined animal feeding
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.539
raised meat in confined animal feeding
operations where you have large number

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549
operations where you have large number
 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.380
operations where you have large number
of animals in a very small area and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390
of animals in a very small area and
 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.880
of animals in a very small area and
there's the whole question of first of

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890
there's the whole question of first of
 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.729
there's the whole question of first of
all what happens to their waste because

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739
all what happens to their waste because
 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.030
all what happens to their waste because
a pig farm can easily produce the amount

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
a pig farm can easily produce the amount
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.240
a pig farm can easily produce the amount
of waste that a city of 20,000 people

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
of waste that a city of 20,000 people
 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.420
of waste that a city of 20,000 people
would produce in a day and yet it's not

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
would produce in a day and yet it's not
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.589
would produce in a day and yet it's not
treated no human population of 20,000

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599
treated no human population of 20,000
 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.210
treated no human population of 20,000
would be allowed to produce waste that

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
would be allowed to produce waste that
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.420
would be allowed to produce waste that
wasn't treated to destroy pathogenic

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
wasn't treated to destroy pathogenic
 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.890
wasn't treated to destroy pathogenic
bacteria and yet we have laws that allow

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900
bacteria and yet we have laws that allow
 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.569
bacteria and yet we have laws that allow
these places to pollute the environment

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579
these places to pollute the environment
 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.059
these places to pollute the environment
with animal waste I think that's huge

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069
with animal waste I think that's huge
 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.250
with animal waste I think that's huge
problem and you go to a place that's

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
problem and you go to a place that's
 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.110
problem and you go to a place that's
near a pig farm and you know about that

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
near a pig farm and you know about that
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.380
near a pig farm and you know about that
pig farm miles away you can smell it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
pig farm miles away you can smell it
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.670
pig farm miles away you can smell it
that's something that we need to do

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680
that's something that we need to do
 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.470
that's something that we need to do
something about and I don't think that

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480
something about and I don't think that
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.190
something about and I don't think that
CAFO should be allowed to leave their

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200
CAFO should be allowed to leave their
 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.470
CAFO should be allowed to leave their
waste untreated

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480
waste untreated
 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.330
waste untreated
n'yar there are other issues that have

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
n'yar there are other issues that have
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.629
n'yar there are other issues that have
to do with greenhouse gases and the fact

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639
to do with greenhouse gases and the fact
 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.860
to do with greenhouse gases and the fact
that so much of our grain corn soybeans

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870
that so much of our grain corn soybeans
 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.289
that so much of our grain corn soybeans
and corn and soybeans particularly is

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299
and corn and soybeans particularly is
 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.220
and corn and soybeans particularly is
grown expressly to feed animals if we

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
grown expressly to feed animals if we
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.869
grown expressly to feed animals if we
didn't have if we didn't need so much

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879
didn't have if we didn't need so much
 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.599
didn't have if we didn't need so much
meat then we wouldn't need to grow all

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609
meat then we wouldn't need to grow all
 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.569
meat then we wouldn't need to grow all
that food to feed animals and that would

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579
that food to feed animals and that would
 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.000
that food to feed animals and that would
also have great benefits for the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010
also have great benefits for the
 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.729
also have great benefits for the
environment so I guess where I stand on

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739
environment so I guess where I stand on
 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.220
environment so I guess where I stand on
this is if you do eat meat then just

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230
this is if you do eat meat then just
 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.440
this is if you do eat meat then just
don't eat so much of it
