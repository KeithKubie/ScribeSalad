00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
But as you remember, I said it's not only about your product or service features,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.230
it's also about pain killers.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.240
That is, what are you going to reduce or eliminate for the customer?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.110
So here's a couple hypotheses of what some pain killers might be

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.580
because pain killer until now might have sounded like,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.370
"Well, wait a minute. Do I hand the customers aspirin?"

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.740
And the answer is yeah, you're really going to solve a pain for them,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.530
but the pain might be is your product going to produce savings--

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.240
that is, in time or money or efforts?

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.120
Is it going to make them feel better?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.400
That is, entertainment products don't solve a problem but they solve a need.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.490
Does it kill frustration, annoyances, or things that give them a headache?

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.660
Does it fix solutions they already have but are underperforming

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.890
because you have new features or you're better or faster?

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.780
Or does it end difficulties and challenges that customers encounter every day?

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.500
Does it make things easier or help them get things done or eliminate resistance?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.810
Does it wipe out or add to negative social consequences--

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.810
loss of face, power, or trust--

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.990
or add to social status like Facebook and Twitter, etc, or even LinkedIn?

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.100
Or does it eliminate risk?

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.840
Is it financial, social, or technical risks?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.780
Or what could go very wrong?

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.540
So pain killers, your hypotheses, should include which one of these or some others

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.780
because this list is finite.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.160
There might be other things you're solving and taking away pain from customers.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.990
But you need to be able to articulate, based on your interactions outside the building

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.120
with customers, "Here's what they said."

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.850
"And when I bounced our product off of them, they said, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'"

00:01:41.850 --> 99:59:59.000
"'That really solves this pain and, more importantly, is an important pain.'"
