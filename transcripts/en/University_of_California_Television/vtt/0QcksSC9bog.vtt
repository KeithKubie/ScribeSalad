00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.500
Here at the University of San Diego, we have
taken our designation as an Ashoka Changemaker

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.130
Campus very seriously.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.460
Change is a creative process that can be applied
in business, politics and peacemaking.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.639
And our honored guest this evening, Senator
George J. Mitch...

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.999
Mitchell, has worked for change in all of
those arenas.

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:23.639
His bio is in your program.

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:30.359
Years in service of many kinds you'll see
described there: military service in the U.S.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:37.959
Army Counter-intelligence Corps, legal service
in the Justice Department as a U.S. attorney

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:45.679
and a district judge in Maine, and political
service in the Senate and as a diplomat.

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.219
Senator Mitchell alternated that service with
business experience and private law practice

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:57.749
as chairman of the board of the Walt Disney
Company, a member of the board of his beloved

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:03.319
Boston Red Sox, and as a director of several
other companies.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.069
In each of those positions, Senator Mitchell
was not focused on the status quo, but on

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.840
changing laws, on changing organizations,
on changing this world and on changing his

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.079
own country.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.329
Senator Mitchell knows that change takes time.

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.269
It was 14 years ago that he brokered an agreement
between Catholics and Protestants in Northern

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.030
Ireland and the Good Friday peace accords
were signed.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.159
Then, just this summer while visiting Belfast,
Queen Elizabeth shook hands with former IRA

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:44.099
chief Martin McGuiness, now a top official
in Northern Ireland.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.989
This was a man who had been an avowed enemy
of the British Empire, and in fact a representative

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.390
of a paramilitary group that in 1979 was responsible
for the death of the Queen’s cousin.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.640
Yet this moving reconciliation, a symbol of
putting violence in the past to create a better

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.260
future, is the ultimate goal of every peace
negotiation — more than just a ceasefire

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.379
or a signed peace agreement or even a power-sharing
agreement.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.390
Change takes time and change takes vision,
like the vision that Senator Mitchell has

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.879
for bringing people together in the most difficult
of circumstances.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.920
And now it is our honor to listen and hear
and share with Senator George J. Mitchell.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:44.840
Please join me in welcoming him.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.760
[Applause]

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.890
Thank you very much uh...

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.400
Julie, for that generous introduction.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.750
And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your
warm reception, for your presence here this

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.790
evening.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:06.290
Uh... to the dean, the new dean, thank you
for inviting me and for being such a gracious

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.290
host.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.060
It’s a real pleasure for me to be here at
the University of San Diego and in particular

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.299
here at the Joan Kroc Institute for Peace
&amp; Justice.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.299
Uh...

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.299
I...

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.440
I welcome the opportunity to visit the university
because I know it was started by the Sisters

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.450
of Mercy.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:33.240
I started my education... my life in education
at a parochial school in a small town in Maine,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.430
and I was taught by the Ursuline Sisters.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.800
And I can remember to this moment the discipline
that they instilled in me.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.370
[Laughter] And I have had a high regard for
nuns of all kinds ever since then.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.569
And so it’s a special pleasure to be here
in that regard.

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.740
I uh... want to repeat my thanks to Julie
for that generous introduction.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.670
Now, I entered the Senate under unusual circumstances.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.910
I was serving as a federal district judge
in my home state of Maine when one of Maine’s

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.229
senators, Ed Muskey, was appointed secretary
of state, creating a vacancy in the Senate.

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.530
Since it was the middle of the year, the Senate
was in session.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.730
The governor, on the day the vacancy was announced,
said that he was gonna move quickly because

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.300
he didn’t want Maine to be underrepresented
in the Senate, and he would hold a press conference

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.910
the following Monday at noon at the state
capitol to announce his choice to succeed

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.169
Senator Muskey and fill out his term.

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.210
So there was a lot of speculation in Maine.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.110
We had a former governor, a former senator.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.130
My name was barely mentioned.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.791
I'd just been appointed a federal judge the
year before.

00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:55.280
It’s a lifetime appointment.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.259
So I went to bed early that Sunday night — we
go to bed early in Maine — [Laughter] Uh

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.800
and uh... like everyone else, wondering what
the governor was going to do the next day.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.259
About 11 o’clock that night the phone rang.

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:09.379
It was the governor calling.

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.990
He said, “I’d like you to come down to
the state capitol at noon tomorrow so I can

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.660
announce that I’m going to appoint you to
the Senate.”

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.419
I said, “Well gee, governor, this is a big
surprise."

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.380
I said, "This is a big decision uh...

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.060
I gotta think about it.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.509
I’ve got to call my family, talk to some
friends, think it over.”

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:30.510
He said, “I’ll give you one hour.”

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.100
[Laughter] I protested that that was inadequate.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.900
He said, “Well, look.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.919
You call me at midnight and say you’re not
going to do it, I got 12 hours to find someone

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.949
else, most of them in the middle of the night.

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.060
So you can’t take more than an hour.”

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.599
I said, “OK, I’ll call you back in an
hour.”

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:46.599
I hung up.

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:48.490
I called my three older brothers.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.930
I grew up in a small town in Maine, and I
had three older brothers who were very famous

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.379
athletes, not just in our little town, not
even just in our state; my brothers made all-New

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:03.289
England in college basketball and they were
very well-known.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:06.900
And then I came along and I was not as good
as my brothers.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.409
In fact, I was not as good as anybody else’s
brothers.

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:18.770
[Laughter] And so very early in my lifebecame
known around our small town as Johnny Mitchell’s

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.270
kid brother, the one who isn’t any good.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:28.280
[Laughter] As you might expect, I developed
a massive inferiority complex and a highly

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.080
competitive attitude toward my brothers.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:42.860
So when I called them that night ostensibly
to seek their advice, [Laughter] there was

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.940
a note of triumphalism in my voice.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.580
[Laughter]Everybody here who's got a brother
raise your hand.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.180
[Laughter] So you know what I'm talking about.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.040
So I said to them, “Listen, guys.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.729
The governor just called me and he wants to
appoint me to the Senate.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.650
What do you guys think about that?”

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.849
Well, the responses were predictably negative.

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:06.849
Very negative.

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:11.349
My brother Johnny said, "Look," he said, "Everybody
knows you’re a born loser."

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:17.409
[Laughter] He said, "You couldn’t possibly
win a state-wide election.

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:21.650
None of us can understand how you got to be
a federal judge, so you better stay where

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.949
you are.”

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:26.770
My older brother, he... he thinks he’s somewhat
of an intellectual and he likes to use the

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.050
Socratic method; he... he makes his points
by asking questions.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:36.030
So he said, “Well, now," he said, "let’s
look at this from the standpoint of the people

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.270
of Maine.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:44.330
[Laughter] Aren’t they entitled to have
a qualified person representing them [Laughter]

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.510
in the Senate?

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.380
And isn’t it obvious that you’re not one
of them?”

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.880
Well, after a few minutes of this I’d had
enough.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.880
I hung up.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.880
I called the governor.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.020
I said, “Governor, I don’t need an hour.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:01.150
I’ve already received all the reassurance
I need [Laughter] of my ability to perform

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.640
this job.”

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.620
So I went down the next day to the state capitol.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.580
The governor made the announcement.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:16.590
I flew to Washington that night and I arrived
at National Airport about 5 o’clock and

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.080
I had nothing planned that evening.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.520
The swearing in was scheduled for the next
morning.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.690
Literally on a whim when... when I get into
a taxi, on the spur of the moment I decided

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:32.470
I’ll go up to the Senate, I'll find and
introduce myself to the Senate majority leader,

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:38.810
then Senator Byrd (it could not possibly have
entered my mind that one day soon I would

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:43.680
become the Senate majority leader), and...
just kinda get the lay of the land.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.630
So I went up, a clerk took me into the Senate
— the Senate was then in session debating

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.440
a bill — and introduced me to Senator Byrd.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.561
And he's very busy — if any of you have
ever seen the Senate in session when there

00:09:54.561 --> 00:10:00.560
is debate and there's a lot of senators milling
around and Senator Byrd somehow got the impression

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.140
when the clerk introduced me that I was there
to be sworn in.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.220
So he said, “OK," he said, "we’re kind
of busy but we’ll swear you in.”

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.380
I protested, I said, “No, no, no," I said,
"This... this is set for tomorrow morning,”

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.720
I said, "I had in my mind that all three networks
are probably reserving time [Laughter] for

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.720
tomorrow morning."

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.280
I thought...

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.220
I thought for sure it would be on the front
page of the New York Times.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.560
I said, "We can’t upset those guys."

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.660
Byrd said, “Listen, young man.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.000
We’re very busy here.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.320
I said I’ll swear you in and I will swear
you in right now.”

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.400
So he interrupted the debate, swore me in
and it took less than 10 seconds.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.130
Nobody but he and I and the guy who swore
me in know what's going on.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.990
Even senators standing six feet away and in
conversation were unaware that they had been

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.370
joined by me.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.830
Uh... and then and then the... so it was a
huge disillusionment for me.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:56.540
I was expecting something rather grand and
uh... uh... and then they resume the proceedings

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.120
and almost immediately a vote occurred.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.360
I hold the all-time history, all-time record
in American history, for those of you interested

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.300
in political trivia, for having cast a vote
the in shortest time after becoming a senator:

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.290
[Laughter] two minutes.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:17.880
[Laughter] The first of many informed judgments
I made on your behalf, on behalf of the people

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.010
of Maine.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:26.210
[Laughter]Well then Byrd said to me, “You
know, you’re kind of in luck.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.370
Filibusters don’t happen too often around
here.”

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.460
That was then.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.690
Not the case now.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.510
He said uh.., “There is one coming up in
a little while.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:38.740
Why don’t you hang around, see how things
work around here.”

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.240
So I said, "OK."

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.810
I went, took my seat in the back of the chambers,
number 100 — as far back in the corner as

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.480
you can get.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.600
And uh... after a while everybody else had
left and one senator came in.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.780
He... he got the floor.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.400
He got up and said, “I want to say a few
words.”

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.700
And he spoke for six hours.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.620
About halfway through I began to realize that
I wasn’t learning anything here.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.060
And the thought crossed my mind that maybe
I ought to leave, but of course, I had no

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.070
place to go.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:14.530
I didn't know what the protocol was and he
must have sensed it so he... after a while

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.240
he came over and talked to me.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.510
He stood right in front of me and he kinda
pointed his finger.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.610
[Laughter] Six hours this went on.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.460
And then - I don’t know how many of you
have been in the capitol when a vote occurs

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.570
- the bells ring, the lights flash.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:37.750
It’s a way of telling House and Senate members
how much time they've got to get to a vote.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.020
They call the vote on a procedural matter;
that’s how you keep these filibusters going.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.970
The lights flashed and the bells rang.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.010
I didn’t know what was going on.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.480
In pour the other 98 senators.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.290
They all voted on this procedural matter,
and then they all left.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.110
And I, not knowing any better, stayed there.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.950
Pretty soon another guy came in and he talked
to me for six hours.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.080
[Laughter] This went on all night.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.510
I thought, this being a senator is not all
it’s cracked up to be.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.000
[Laughter] And after a while I was tired,
I was hungry.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.940
I went up to a clerk who was standing by the
door at the side of the chamber and I said,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.670
“Excuse me, I’m new here.”

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.810
He said, “Senator, that’s obvious to everyone.”

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.700
[Laughter] I said, “I’m hungry, I’m
tired."

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.630
I said, "Where did all these guys go?

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.630
Well I’m here.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.890
I thought I was doing the nation’s business,
working hard.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.880
I’m the only one here."

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.880
He said, "I...

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.880
I...

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.880
I said, "Tell me where they go."

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.170
He said, “I will not only tell you, I will
show you.”

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:39.520
And he took me around behind the Senate chamber
into a room smaller than this, where there

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.830
were a whole bunch of narrow, canvas folding
cots set up — of the type you see in emergency

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.830
shelters.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:51.800
And there, lying there in their clothes, were
a bunch of old white guys [Laughter] snoring

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800
away.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.320
Oh my God... talk about disillusionment!

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.280
[Laughter] It was crowded, there were no aisles.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.510
He said, “Senator, there’s an empty cot
in the middle.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.710
You better grab that one.”

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.600
I looked and I had to climb over other senators
to get there.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.190
The first guy I encountered was Ted Kennedy.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:16.990
Ted is not, was not a slight fellow and at
that moment he looked to me like Mount Everest

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.910
in a suit.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.970
And I worried that I might disturb him.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.760
So I used all the athletic skills that my
brothers say I don’t have.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.780
I got over him and then I looked on the next
cot.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:35.850
Lying on his back, snoring loudly, was Senator
Jesse Helms of North Carolina.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:43.510
I’d only been in the Senate one day, but
I was aware of Senator Helms’ role as a

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:48.810
stalwart defender of heterosexual rights.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.520
So I was really nervous.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:15:01.150
[Laughter] I thought, what would be the consequence
if I lost my balance and fell right on top

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:07.160
of him,[Laughter] my first day in the Senate?

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.580
So I tiptoed over him and I got to this empty
cot and I lay down and I...

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.970
I really was disappointed.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.910
I thought, what a mistake I’ve made.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.690
Just a few hours ago I was a federal judge.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.950
[Laughter] I wore a robe.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.770
People got up when I entered the room, they
sat down.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.290
[Laughter] They got up when I left the room.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.810
Now I...

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.510
I was lying here with these guys.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.810
And I began to feel sorry for myself.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.410
And as I wallowed in self-pity, I...

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:41.640
I rolled over on this little cot and I look
right next to me, literally inches away, into

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.150
the face of Senator John Warner of Virginia.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:50.160
At that time, he was married to Elizabeth
Taylor.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.600
[Laughter] And I looked at him and I thought,
who am I to feel sorry for myself?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.260
[Laughter] I said...

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:05.070
[laughs] I said, I, really, I thought, here’s
a guy who could be home legally in bed with

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.600
Elizabeth Taylor and he’s spending the night
with me.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.030
[Laughter] And I’m feeling sorry for myself?

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:17.060
Well, I realized then what we all know but
we tend to forget, is that no matter how bad

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.310
off you’ve got it, there’s always someone
who’s got it worse.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.840
And you can go through life complaining about
things or feeling sorry for yourself, or you

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.130
can try to do something about them.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:32.370
And that was a good lesson for me because
I did try to do something and uh... enjoyed

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.050
myself in the Senate a great deal.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.600
Tonight, I’m not going to talk about the
Senate.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.570
I was asked to speak about my experiences
in Northern Ireland and the Middle East.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.210
And I’ll do that.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.810
Then I want to say a few words in conclusion
about our own country uh... and then I’ll

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:55.680
be glad to take your questions uh... in conclusion.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.840
I spent five years in Northern Ireland, coming
and going and working there and I chaired

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.419
three separate sets of discussions.

00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:09.880
The principal negotiation lasted about two
years.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:17.129
It was for the most part extremely difficult,
very discouraging, with little progress.

00:17:17.129 --> 00:17:23.439
There had been ceasefires established, but
they were routinely violated.

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:26.480
There was regular and periodic assassinations,
bombing.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.870
Two of the men who were delegates to the talks
were assassinated during the talks.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.460
Several others had been involved in the conflict.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:41.130
Some had been wounded badly, some had served
lengthy prison terms for their activities

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.580
and violence.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:50.870
We hit what I thought was rock bottom in December
of 1997, which was about 18 months after we

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.750
started.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:18:00.450
Two days after Christmas a prominent Protestant
paramilitary leader was assassinated in prison

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.440
by a group of Catholic prisoners.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:11.120
That touched off a tit-for-tat series of assassinations
on both sides.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:19.990
Emotions rose dramatically, and the prospect
of success declined.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:26.259
In an effort to try to change the direction,
the governments of Britain and Northern Ireland

00:18:26.259 --> 00:18:34.520
uh... and Ireland moved the talks from Northern
Ireland to London, and then from London to

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.520
Dublin.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.379
But the change of venue did no good.

00:18:37.379 --> 00:18:40.230
The rancor increased.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:45.299
And on the flight back to New York from Dublin
after a week there, uh...

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:53.870
I concluded that the process was spiraling
toward failure and the likelihood of a resumption

00:18:53.870 --> 00:19:00.289
of violence on a scale previously unimaginable
would result.

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:11.660
And so in desperation I formed a plan to establish
an early, firm and unbreakable deadline, after

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.970
which the process would be over one way or
the other.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:24.240
And after some consultations, I established
midnight April 9th as the deadline, after

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.409
which I told them I’m leaving and we’ll
either have an agreement or we’ll have failure

00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:32.890
and war.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:39.700
The last two weeks were uh... round-the-clock
negotiations.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.860
On the last night, uh...

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.260
Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern
came.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.340
President Clinton stayed up all night in the
White House on the phone.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.710
I was in constant communication with him and
them.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:20:01.420
And we finally succeeded in getting an agreement
uh... on the afternoon of Good Friday uh...

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.730
of 1998.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:12.610
I, with two colleagues who assisted me, was
responsible for drafting the document which

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.990
became the peace agreement.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:23.519
As I did so I had in mind many objectives,
two principal ones.

00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:29.090
One was that it had to be their agreement,
not my agreement.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:35.840
On the very first day that the negotiations
began, I said to the delegates to the peace

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.830
conference, “I do not come with an American
plan.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.379
There is no Clinton proposal.

00:20:42.379 --> 00:20:44.659
There is no Mitchell proposal.

00:20:44.659 --> 00:20:49.340
Any agreement that you reach will be yours.”

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:57.190
Over the two years of negotiations, collectively
they spoke millions of words to me and they

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:05.620
buried me in documents: legal briefs and memoranda
and petitions and papers and statements.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:13.559
And so, when I drafted the agreement I made
certain that every word, literally every single

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:18.010
word, had been spoken or written by one of
them.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:23.809
And when I presented it to them I said orally
what I've just said, and I had a cover letter

00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:27.399
that said to them the same thing.

00:21:27.399 --> 00:21:30.059
That was of critical importance.

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:31.059
It is...

00:21:31.059 --> 00:21:38.269
No one is going to subscribe to a document
in which they must by definition make concessions

00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:44.120
if they feel it is imposed on them, unless
you have an all-out war and you have a total

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.539
winner and a total loser.

00:21:46.539 --> 00:21:51.070
But in conflict resolution, short of that
there has to be ownership by the parties and

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:59.330
I was acutely aware that whatever happened,
I was leaving and going back to America.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.490
They were staying.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.500
Their lives were the ones at risk and at stake.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.299
It was critical therefore that they decided
their futures.

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:18.519
The second objective I had was to make certain
that in that document was something for both

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:20.240
sides.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:28.909
I tried to envision each of the political
leaders on both sides of that divide meeting

00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:36.830
with their strongest and most ardent supporters,
and include in that agreement something that

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:43.940
they could hold up and say, “This is what
I got: A, B and C.” Now of course, I had

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:53.090
to give them a little something to get an
agreement, but it has to be a win-win situation.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.809
Short, as I’ve said, of total conflict and
total victory and defeat, there has to be

00:22:58.809 --> 00:23:03.820
a prospect which enables political leaders,
and particularly political leaders in democratic

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:11.240
societies, to justify their willingness to
enter into an agreement uh to prevail.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.410
And it did.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:22.100
They knew, as we all knew, that under the
terms established by the two governments for

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:31.019
the negotiations, any agreement reached would
not take effect unless approvedin a referendum

00:23:31.019 --> 00:23:36.520
by the public in Northern Ireland and in the
Republic of Ireland.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:44.669
Both had to approve independently before it
would take effect so the politicians who were

00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:51.269
in there making the agreement were gonna have
to defend it and explain it to their publics.

00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:58.090
And they did, and it was approved by a wide
margin in the referendum in both Northern

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.120
Ireland and the Republic.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.390
Now, what did it take to get there?

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:10.110
A lot, and I can’t describe every aspect
of it, but let me make just a few points that

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.860
I think contributed to it.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:16.830
And they all come under the heading of common
sense.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:22.669
Patience and perseverance: you have to stick
with it.

00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:28.009
In conflict resolution you can’t take the
first no for an answer, or the second no or

00:24:28.009 --> 00:24:31.809
the 10th no or the 50th no.

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:38.730
I don’t intend or mean to be critical of
the press, but every day you see the reporters

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.399
wanting to set up failure.

00:24:41.399 --> 00:24:44.970
A negotiation begins - there's one going on
in Washington right now - but they didn’t

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:49.480
get an agreement the first meeting they had
so it’s a failure.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:55.789
Almost every day over the five-year period
that I was there, I was asked by reporters,

00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:57.919
“When are you gonna leave?

00:24:57.919 --> 00:25:01.440
When are you going home because you failed?"

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.100
In a sense they were right.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:08.330
If your objective is to get a peace agreement,
until you actually get it you have failed

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.710
to do so.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:19.950
But there’s a difference between a final
failure and working towards success even as

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.799
you experience setbacks.

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:25.289
And there has to be perseverance.

00:25:25.289 --> 00:25:34.320
Secondly, this is so simple, you have to treat
everyone with respect — even, indeed I would

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.450
argue especially, those with whom you disagree.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.190
None of us have problems agreeing with people
of like mind.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:50.749
We’re all humans and one of the things we’ve
learned now from the amazing scientific discoveries

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:56.559
that are being made, particularly about the
human body and especially the brain, is that

00:25:56.559 --> 00:26:06.509
our receptors for information that agrees
with our preconceived notions are that big

00:26:06.509 --> 00:26:09.620
and very acutely sensitive.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:16.289
Our sensors that receive information that
disagrees with our prior beliefs are that

00:26:16.289 --> 00:26:21.029
big and not very sensitive to things coming
in.

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:23.779
Every one of us suffers from that.

00:26:23.779 --> 00:26:33.249
And politicians in life-or-death negotiations
to end conflict, to end death and destruction,

00:26:33.249 --> 00:26:40.070
have especially acute sensors to that with
which they agree and very little that they

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.490
don’t agree with.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:45.769
And so you have to listen very hard.

00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:54.210
You have to try very hard to open your receptors
especially to people who disagree with you.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:59.350
And I think that’s true not just in conflict
resolutions between nations, but in political

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:03.230
negotiations within a country such as ours.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:13.320
And you always have to have the humility to
recognize that on occasion you may be wrong

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.950
and the person who disagrees with you may
be right.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:25.600
It takes a person of self-confidence and self-knowledge
to make that kind of approach to issues, and

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:32.789
to genuinely practice those, but that’s
what’s needed in conflict resolution situations.

00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:35.530
You have to give everyone their say.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:41.279
When I first went there, indeed on the first
day, I said to them, “I’m product of the

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.769
U.S. Senate.

00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:44.330
We have the rule of unlimited debate.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:51.880
I’ve actually listened to a 16-hour debate,
to an 18-hour discussion, to a 12-hour speech.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.330
Nothing you guys can say or do," I said, "that
will faze me.”

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.909
Did I regret that [Laughter] years later.

00:27:58.909 --> 00:28:02.989
Of course when I said that I had no idea how
long this was gonna go on.

00:28:02.989 --> 00:28:07.970
So there I sat day after day, month after
month, year after year, listening for hours

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.289
and hours and hours.

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:15.739
But what I learned is that first off, if you
really do listen to people sometimes they

00:28:15.739 --> 00:28:20.090
make sense when you really think about it
from their perspective.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:27.110
And secondly, it is a necessary condition
to getting their agreement to something that

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:32.380
they don’t like that their view has been
heard and genuinely considered.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:38.210
And every one of us, everyone who's a parent,
everyone who's married, everyone who has any

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:43.640
kind of a personal relationship knows the
difference between someone who is genuinely

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.200
listening and someone who is going through
the motions of listening.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.429
And genuinely listening is hard work, but
it has to be done.

00:28:53.429 --> 00:28:57.409
And finally I’ll say, you need political
leaders with courage.

00:28:57.409 --> 00:29:01.539
The political leaders of Northern Ireland
were ordinary men and women.

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:05.730
You had one of them here last year, a terrific
woman, Monica McWilliams, a very close friend

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.940
of mine.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:17.179
And she is not unique; an ordinary person
like every one of us here, placed in a position

00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:21.799
of responsibility and authority and they rose
to the occasion.

00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:26.190
It’s very fashionable in our society and
others to denigrate, to ridicule, to demean

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:32.830
and insult politicians, and Lord knows they
earn it and deserve it some of the time.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:41.090
But the fact of the matter is, people can
and do rise to the occasion with courage,

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:45.549
with judgment, and do the right thing and
that’s what they did in Northern Ireland.

00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:50.120
A... a lot of people talk about Clinton, about
me, about Blair, about others.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:55.059
The people who really did this in Northern
Ireland were the political leaders and the

00:29:55.059 --> 00:30:03.889
public in Northern Ireland who... who understood
the consequences of failure would mean a new

00:30:03.889 --> 00:30:10.759
outbreak of violence, to the savagery and
a destructive toll that far exceeded anything

00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:12.940
that had occurred before.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.600
And that’s what we need in other crises
as well.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:21.679
Well, I thought it was tough in Northern Ireland,
and it was - five years, five very tough years.

00:30:21.679 --> 00:30:28.850
But a few months ago I spoke at a dinner of
an Irish American group in Queens, New York

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:29.850
City.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.080
About 1,000 Irishmen there.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.920
And I said to them, “I’m about to say
something that I never dreamed that I would

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.100
believe or say.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.570
And it is that after three years in the Middle
East dealing with the Israelis and the Palestinians,

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:52.610
the Irish were a bunch of patsies [Laughter]
but uh... they were really easy.”

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:55.981
Now the Middle East let me talk about that.

00:30:55.981 --> 00:31:07.460
The conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians
is historic, complex, very difficult.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:14.049
So I cannot in a few moments or even in a
few hours give it full justice.

00:31:14.049 --> 00:31:19.999
Uh... what I am about to say is necessarily
uh... a summary that won’t touch on every

00:31:19.999 --> 00:31:29.379
aspect of the conflict, but describes some
of my experience and my conclusions uh from

00:31:29.379 --> 00:31:32.039
the time I spent there.

00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:38.879
The upheavals now occurring across the Arab
world, especially in Egypt and Syria, have

00:31:38.879 --> 00:31:44.399
create... created anxiety and uncertainty
among both Israelis and Palestinians, making

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:49.320
progress in reserv... resolving that conflict
more difficult than ever.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:56.320
But even before the Arab Spring, the conflict
has gone on for so long, has had such destructive

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:03.020
effects, the level of mistrust and hostility
is so high, that many there and elsewhere

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:07.000
regard it as incapable of solution.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.149
But the pursuit of peace there is so important
to them and to us that I think it demands

00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:18.200
our maximum effort, whatever the difficulties
or setbacks.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:26.450
The key to resolution is very easy to state,
but extraordinarily difficult to achieve.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:33.779
It is the mutual commitment of both Israelis
and Palestinians, and the active participation

00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:39.580
of the United States government and the many
other governments and entities that want to

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.419
help.

00:32:41.419 --> 00:32:49.070
Commitment to the task of reconciling the
Palestinian goal of a viable, contiguous,

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:57.989
sovereign and independent state based on the
1967 lines with agreed swaps of land, with

00:32:57.989 --> 00:33:06.980
the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure,
recognized and defensible borders.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:12.210
Security is what the Israelis don’t have
for their people, even though they have a

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.840
highly successful state.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:21.370
In early nine... in early 2009, President
George W. Bush went to Jerusalem, where he

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:27.049
said in a speech, and I quote, “The point
of departure for permanent status negotiations

00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:32.609
is clear: There should be an end to the occupation
that began in 1967.

00:33:32.609 --> 00:33:38.940
The agreement must establish Palestine as
a home line... homeland for the Palestinian

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:44.269
people, just as Israel is the homeland for
the Jewish people.

00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:51.470
These negotiations must ensure that Israel
has secure, recognized and defensible borders.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:59.639
And they must ensure that the state of Palestine
is viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent.

00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:07.940
It is vital,” Bush said, “that each side
understands that satisfying the other’s

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.700
fundamental objectives is a key to a successful
agreement.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:20.160
Security for Israel, and viability for the
Palestinian state are in the mutual interest

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.110
of both parties.”

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:28.410
That's the end of Bush's statement.When he
took office in 2009, President Obama publicly

00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:29.970
reaffirmed that policy.

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:36.260
And it seemed then, in early 2009, that the
culture of peace so carefully nurtured during

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:43.610
the Oslo process had largely dissipated and
had been replaced by a sense of futility,

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:48.169
of despair, of the inevitability of conflict.

00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:56.200
The first Gaza military operation, as you
will recall, had just ended four days before

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.170
Obama took office.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:06.030
Israelis had an election campaign on, the
Palestinians were deeply divided, and as a

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:11.270
result very few people believed that there
was any chance even to get negotiations started,

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.150
let alone conclude negotiations successfully.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:21.510
And unfortunately, that remains the case today
nearly four years later despite an intense

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.920
effort.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.990
A solution cannot be imposed externally.

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:32.100
The parties themselves must negotiate directly,
with the active and sustained support of the

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.290
United States.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:37.600
Both recognize that, both acknowledge it publicly
and privately.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:45.050
Now, to succeed they will both have to engage
in compromise and be flexible.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:52.030
But most of all it will take political leadership
by all concerned, leaders who are willing

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:55.430
to take some risks for peace.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:36:01.850
I still believe that this conflict can and
will be ended, in part because I believe that

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:09.540
the pain from negotiating an agreement — which
will be substantial — will however be much

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:16.820
less than the pain that both will endure if
there is no agreement.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:23.050
If the conflict continues, both Israelis and
Palestinians face a dangerous and uncertain

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:29.640
future that includes of course the possibility
of renewed violence, which could expand in

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.360
unexpected ways to enflame the region.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.440
This is after all a region in which there
are several intersecting conflicts occurring

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:45.290
at the same time, and any one could trigger
a spread to others like a wildfire out of

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:48.140
control.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.930
There are many other dangers to both.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.920
I can’t go into them all but I’ll briefly
summarize the principal ones.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.600
For the Israelis I’ll mention just two.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.720
The first challenge they face is demographics.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:08.460
There are now about 5-and-3/4 million Jews
living in the area between the Jordan River

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.890
and the Mediterranean Sea.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:19.420
In that same space there are about 5-and-1/4
million Arabs, including Israeli Arabs, Palestinians

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.840
in the West Bank and Gaza.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.830
The Arab birthrate overall is much higher.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:29.990
They don’t agree on much, but both agree
that within just a few years — and I’m

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:36.090
talking about a very few years — the Arabs
will be in a majority.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:43.060
And if there is not by then a two-state solution,
the people of Israel will have to choose between

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.090
being a Jewish state or a democratic state.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:51.000
It will not be possible for them to be both.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.480
It cannot occur if there is not a two-state
solution.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.860
This is not much discussed in this country
but widely discussed in Israel, most recently

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:05.480
and forcefully by Ehud Barak, the former prime
minister and now the defense minister who

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:12.030
has said repeatedly that this is a painful
choice that Israel should not have to make.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.150
Their second challenge is technology.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:19.880
To keep out suicide bombers Israel built an
enormous wall.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.880
But the real threat as we all know now doesn’t
come from suicide bombers.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.760
It comes from rockets.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.820
Hamas still has thousands of them even after
the recent operation.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:37.330
They’re crude, most of them homemade, lacking
in guidance, lacking in destructive power,

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.890
but they still create fear and anxiety.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:49.090
And can anyone doubt that over time they will
achieve an increase in both numbers and quality

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.170
of the arsenal?

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:55.500
They’ve stated it as an objective following
the ceasefire.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.800
On Israel’s border, Hezbollah has tens of
thousands of rockets.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.940
The public estimates in Israel are between
30,000 and 50,000.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:10.690
They’re somewhat more effective, and although
limited in range they're engaged in an effort

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.310
to upgrade their arsenal.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:19.880
And finally and most threateningly, Iran now
has rockets that can reach Israel when launched

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.940
from Iran itself.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.850
All of the discussion has been about nuclear
weapons.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:30.320
That’s a very serious problem.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:38.420
But aside from that, Iran has made a huge
technological advance in moving from liquid-fueled

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:46.770
to solid-fueled rockets; far easier to operate,
far easier to conceal, farmore difficult for

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:50.500
Israel or us to target.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:57.580
The Iranian rockets don’t yet have the precision
our... ours do — that is, to strike a specific

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.510
building or military target.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:07.000
But they can come close and if launched they
could cause enormous destruction and death

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.700
in Israel’s cities.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.520
The United States is fully committed to Israel’s
security.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:17.420
And that commitment is firm, unshakeable and
will be kept.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:22.310
To honor it we’ve provided enormous financial
and military support to Israel, most recently

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:28.750
in the development of the effective anti-missile
system that protected them from many of the

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.260
lockets... rockets launched by Hamas.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:37.430
But it is unknown, because it’s never before
occurred in human history, what would happen

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:44.270
if simultaneously thousands and thousands
of rockets were launched from all three locations.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:49.120
And so, Israel’s very existence then could
be threatened.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:56.210
The Palestinians also face serious problems,
obviously and especially the indefinite continuation

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:01.950
of an occupation under which they do not have
the right or the dignity that comes with the

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.520
right of self-governance.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:12.550
In 1947 the United Nations proposed a plan
to partition the area and create two states.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:16.420
Israel accepted it, the Arabs rejected it.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:24.660
The first of several wars began, all of them
won by an increasingly strong Israel.Every

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:35.190
sensible Arab leader today would gladly accept
the 1947 plan if it were still on the table.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:40.980
But it is not on the table and it will never
again be on the table because the circumstances

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.870
have so dramatically changed.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:50.630
And since then, the plans offered to the Palestinians
have been less attractive than the ’47 plan,

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.540
and they’ve rejected them all.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:59.480
But as I told Chairman Arafat directly during
my first tour of duty in the region, and as

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:05.530
I told President Abbas directly during my
most recent tour of duty, there is no evidence,

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:11.380
none whatsoever, to suggest that the options
available to the Palestinians are going to

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.210
get better in the future.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:18.410
So what they’ve got to do is to reach the
common sense conclusion that they’ve got

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:26.260
to sit down, participate and stay in direct
negotiations, and get the best deal they can:

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:32.010
less than what they want, no doubt from their
perspective it will be imperfect and unfair,

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:36.230
but they’ve got to bring the occupation
to an end and they’ve got to create their

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.470
own state.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:44.660
And they can then build on it as Israel has
done, and as the Palestinians can do as they're

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:51.000
demonstrating now under the outstanding leadership
of their prime minister, Salam Fayyad, who

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:58.580
has laid the foundation by building the institutions
needed for a viable, independent state.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:04.620
Unfortunately, that state-building effort
cannot be sustained in the absence of progress

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.250
on the political side.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:11.810
They’re inextricably linked, and so there
has to be progress on both in order to be

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:13.020
progress on either.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:19.580
It’s a daunting challenge especially to
build trust where mistrust exists not only

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:25.370
between political leaders but between the
public in both societies.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:31.190
But they must find a way to renew hope, and
we must do all we can to help them despite

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:37.470
the difficulties, because it is not only in
their interest, it is in our interest as well.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:46.960
My last point this evening involves our country,
where I believe our power and our principles

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.640
are mutually enhancing and must be firmly
bound together.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:59.210
The American Declaration of Independence was
a powerful statement of the right of free

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.340
people to self-governance.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:07.990
The first 10 Amendments to the Constitution,
what we call the Bill of Rights, is a concise

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:15.800
and eloquent statement of the right of the
individual to be free from oppression by government.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:23.220
Most concepts of democracy in our world today
rest heavily on these two principles, and

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:30.750
in this dangerous world they can be maintained
and defended only if we are strong and prepared.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:37.200
The American Revolution was not initially
a rejection of British principles.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:42.560
It was triggered by what the colonists believed
was the failure of the British government

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:47.340
to apply those principles equally to them.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:55.150
A perceived gap between our ideals and our
actions now is a factor in the hostility of

00:44:55.150 --> 00:45:00.650
others to our country and to Western democracy.

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:08.800
The triumph of democracy and the fall of communism
was the signal event of the 20th century.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:16.330
As we move into the 21st century, the power
and the ideals of the United States are influential,

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:18.820
indeed ascendant, around the world.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:25.280
There've been many dominant military and economic
powers throughout history, and that role brings

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.590
enormous benefit and many problems.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:34.530
In this era of instant communication especially,
every grievance in the world — no matter

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:41.520
how local, whether real or imagined — leads
to both a request for assistance from us and

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:47.200
resentment to us, whether we grant the assistance
or not.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:53.240
Obviously, most people want to be on the side
of the strong.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:46:00.750
But for too many people in our country and
outside of our country, power increasingly

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:08.570
is perceived to be the primary or for some
the exclusive basis of American influence

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.240
in the world.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.910
I think there’s much more involved.

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:16.800
Power's clearly important, and we must be
prepared to use it — including military

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.600
force — when necessary and appropriate.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:27.940
A strong economy and a strong military power
are essential to our security, our freedom,

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.940
our prosperity.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:39.420
But power must be deployed not as an alternative
to our ideals, but in service to our ideals,

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:47.870
for it is American ideals that is and always
has been the primary basis of American influence

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:48.870
in the world.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:55.340
They’re not easily summarized, but surely
they include the sovereignty of the people,

00:46:55.340 --> 00:47:03.130
the primacy of individual liberty, an independent
judiciary, the rule of law applied equally

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:12.510
to all citizens and crucially to the government
itself, and opportunity for every member of

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:14.190
society.

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:21.070
Because of those ideals, I believe that the
United States was a great nation long before

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:25.180
it was a great military or economic power.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:30.760
This was a great nation the day the Constitution
was ratified.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:37.230
Four million people clinging to the Atlantic
seaboard became instantly one of the most

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:42.300
influential countries in the world because
of our ideals.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.240
There were no wars then.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.700
We had a very tiny army and a tiny navy.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.480
We didn’t have missiles.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.940
But we had the power of our ideals.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:59.660
They guided us through the early turbulent
years; through the greatest crisis in our

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:04.760
history, the Civil War; through the difficulties
of the 20th century; and they have to guide

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:12.110
us now through the different but still difficult
challenges of the 21st century.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:21.180
I’ll close with one more personal story
uh... to make the important point of opportunity.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:27.240
When I was a federal judge I had great power,
and I have to confess I really loved that

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.290
part of the job.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.130
[Laughter] The only job I ever had where I
had any power.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:35.440
When I was Senate majority leader all you
can do is ask people to do things that they

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.230
should be doing without being asked.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:44.150
[Laughter] But when I was a federal judge
every order I ever gave was carried out to

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.940
the letter, and that was great.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:52.750
But what I really enjoyed was when I presided
over what are called naturalization ceremonies.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:54.480
They’re citizenship ceremonies.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.960
A group of people who'd gone through the required
procedures gathered before me in a federal

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.160
courtroom in Maine.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:07.880
And there, by the power vested in me under
our constitutional law, I administered to

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:14.510
them the oath of allegiance to the United
States and I made them Americans.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:20.960
It was always highly emotional for me because
my mother was an immigrant, my father the

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.960
orphaned son of immigrants.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.330
Neither had any education.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.270
My mother could not read or write.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:31.050
She worked the nightshift in a textile mill
in Maine for 40 years.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:35.050
My father was a janitor at a local school.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:42.650
But because of their efforts, and more importantly,
because of the openness of American society,

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:49.060
all of their children got the education they
were denied — and I, their son, became the

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:52.410
majority leader of the United States Senate.

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:58.320
After every one of these ceremonies I met
personally with each of the new Americans,

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.810
individually or in family groups.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:03.770
I asked them where they came from, how they
came, why they came.

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:07.300
They talked about their hopes, their dreams,
their fears.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:12.210
Their answers and comments were as different
as their countries of origin, but through

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:17.650
them there were some common themes andwere
best summarized by a young Asian man, who

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:23.760
when I asked him, “Why did you come here?”
and he replied in very slow and broken English,

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:31.710
“I came,” he said, “because in America,
everybody has a chance.”

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:32.780
Think about that.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:39.050
A young man who had been an American for 10
minutes, who could barely speak English, was

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:43.790
able to sum up the meaning of our country
in a single sentence.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.920
America is freedom and opportunity.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:52.070
That’s what it is for all of us, and they
are linked.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:58.380
There will not be freedom for all if there
is only opportunity for some.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:04.200
I believe that in this great country in which
we are so fortunate to be part of — the

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:10.230
most free, the most open, the most just society
in all of human history, despite its many

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:11.470
imperfections.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:18.360
And I believe that here no one should be guaranteed
success, but everyone should have a fair chance

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:24.470
to succeed, to go as high and as far as their
talent, their willingness to work, their willingness

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:26.910
to take risks, will carry them.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:34.610
Our con... our challenge, each of us here,
is to so conduct ourselves that 50 years from

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:40.870
now, 100 years from now, people all over the
world will still want to come here for the

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:45.710
same reason that young Asian man wanted to
come: because they will believe in America

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:48.130
there is a chance for everyone.

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:56.000
I spoke in Europe recently and there’s a
certain amount of hostility, some envy, about

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
the United States.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:06.220
And one guy got up and read, pleased with
himself, an article that said China’s gross

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:13.670
domestic product is going to equal that of
the United States in 2048, and China’s into

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:14.670
uh...

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.200
China's on the rise and America’s in decline.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.770
“What do you think about that, Senator Mitchell?”

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:27.390
I said, “Well, first off, if in fact their
gross domestic product equals ours in 2048,

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:31.470
that means on a per capita basis we’re four
times as large as them.

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:36.700
It’s the per capita GDP that really matters,
so I’m not too worried about that.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.980
But secondly,” I said, “I might ask you
a question in response to your question.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:49.410
Aside from a few North Koreans struggling
to... to... get out of the concentration camp

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:54.860
they call a country, trying to get into China,
aside from that, have you ever heard or read

00:52:54.860 --> 00:53:00.290
of anyone risking their lives, crossing the
ocean or crossing the desert or climbing a

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:04.230
fence or burrowing a tunnel, to get into China?”

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:08.710
[Laughter]Have any of you ever heard of that?

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:12.680
Last year, 500,000 Chinese left their country.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:19.193
Even with the restrictive out-migration rules
they have there, a large number of them want

00:53:19.193 --> 00:53:20.290
to come here.

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:26.290
Now they don’t come here because they think
we’ve got it... a good Patriot missile.

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:30.260
Not one person's ever cited that as a reason
to risk their life.

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.930
They come here because they know here they’ve
got a chance.

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:41.920
They’ve got a chance to get what human beings
want everywhere: a decent job, good care for

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:46.400
their kids, a good education to get their
kids off to a good start in life.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.070
Isn’t that what we all want?

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:53.050
No matter the color of our skins, no matter
what ethnic group we come from, no matter

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:59.460
what religion we practice, no matter where
we are — that’s the basic universal desire.

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.710
And what we've gotta do is to make certain
that a 100 years from now people around the

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:06.700
world still want that because it will be true.

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:11.270
Now we do know this: It’s still an aspiration
here.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:13.500
We’re not perfect.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:19.910
And it is not true that every single American
has equal opportunity.

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:25.680
Working at that is something that we’ve
been doing for 225 years and we have to keep

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.680
at it.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:32.340
Don’t ever forget that great as were the
men who wrote the Constitution, and they were

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:40.420
great in every sense, they were constrained
by the society in which they lived and learned.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:46.720
And so the Constitution, which we revere in
its initial form, did not consider a black

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.450
person to be a whole person.

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:56.840
And it restricted the right to vote to only
adult white men who owned property.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:04.450
It took 75 years and the bloodiest civil war
in our history to extend the right to vote

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:07.120
to persons who were not white.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.760
It took another 60 years to extend the vote
to women.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.070
Look at all the women in the audience here.

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:18.440
Can you imagine, 60 years of ferocious political
battle to extend the right to women?

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.730
It’s unimaginable to us now.

00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:22.530
That was the case.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:24.460
That was the case.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:30.290
And then it took another half-century until
we passed the American with Disabilities Act

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:36.380
to extend to persons with disabilities the
right to live a full, free and independent

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.710
life in our open society.

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:42.280
And we’re going through the same issue right
now with respect to sexual orientation.

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.450
And there'll be other issues in the future.

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:53.080
But what our history tells us is a people
optimistic, hopeful, successful, willing to

00:55:53.080 --> 00:56:01.070
confront error, willing to change, willing
to make things better for everyone — that’s

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:04.620
freedom and that’s opportunity, and that’s
America.

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.620
Thank you all very much.

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:45.390
It was a great pleasure to be here.

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:55.230
[Applause]
