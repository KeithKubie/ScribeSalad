mention so certainly I think you've

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959
mention so certainly I think you've
 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.410
mention so certainly I think you've
identified certain causes where the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420
identified certain causes where the
 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.070

unnecessary suffering but would involve
 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.270
unnecessary suffering but would involve
a more public domain something where you

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280
a more public domain something where you
 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.940

okay are you fit to lead let's let's put

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690
okay are you fit to lead let's let's put
 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.809
okay are you fit to lead let's let's put
it that way okay first of all do you

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819
it that way okay first of all do you
 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.430
it that way okay first of all do you
know where you're going because that's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440
know where you're going because that's
 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.629
know where you're going because that's
actually one of the hallmarks of a

actually one of the hallmarks of a
 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.520
actually one of the hallmarks of a
leader leader knows where he's going and

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530
leader leader knows where he's going and
 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.259
leader leader knows where he's going and
maybe other people are also interested

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269
maybe other people are also interested
 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.970
maybe other people are also interested
in going that way but the leaders I've

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980
in going that way but the leaders I've
 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.740
in going that way but the leaders I've
met have carved themselves out a

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750
met have carved themselves out a
 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.229
met have carved themselves out a
personal vision right it's not some it's

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239
personal vision right it's not some it's
 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.270
personal vision right it's not some it's
not some cookie cutter ideological

not some cookie cutter ideological
solution to the ills of the planet

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470
solution to the ills of the planet
 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.620
solution to the ills of the planet
they've done a detailed analysis right

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630
they've done a detailed analysis right
 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.970
they've done a detailed analysis right
they know what they're talking about

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980
they know what they're talking about
 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.860
they know what they're talking about
and they're usually people well they've

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
and they're usually people well they've
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.479
and they're usually people well they've
had a successful relationship they've

credible in five or six dimensions well
 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.599
credible in five or six dimensions well
then maybe you know enough about the

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609
then maybe you know enough about the
 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.060
then maybe you know enough about the
world to dare to mess with its internal

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070
world to dare to mess with its internal
 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.190
world to dare to mess with its internal
mechanisms and if you if you don't have

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200
mechanisms and if you if you don't have
 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.600
mechanisms and if you if you don't have
that kind of in-depth knowledge

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610
that kind of in-depth knowledge
 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.459
that kind of in-depth knowledge
then you should just you shouldn't you

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469
then you should just you shouldn't you
 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.050
then you should just you shouldn't you
should no more work on the economic

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060
should no more work on the economic
 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.990
should no more work on the economic
systems of Western civilization then you

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000
systems of Western civilization then you
 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.600
systems of Western civilization then you
should try to adjust the electronic

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610
should try to adjust the electronic
 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.969
should try to adjust the electronic
systems of your automobile because the

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979
systems of your automobile because the
 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.879
systems of your automobile because the
latter is far less complex than the

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889
latter is far less complex than the
 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.010
latter is far less complex than the
former so of course there's utility and

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020
former so of course there's utility and
 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.080
former so of course there's utility and

but you have to you have to have
 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.379
but you have to you have to have
transformed yourself at least to some

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389
transformed yourself at least to some
 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.790
transformed yourself at least to some
degree into someone who's actually

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800
degree into someone who's actually
 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.679
degree into someone who's actually
competent before you should even dare to

competent before you should even dare to
do such things you think well I have

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699
do such things you think well I have
 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.550
do such things you think well I have
read some marks and now I know how to

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560
read some marks and now I know how to
 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.379
read some marks and now I know how to
change the world it's like that's a very

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389
change the world it's like that's a very
 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.010
change the world it's like that's a very
bad idea

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020
bad idea
 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.540
bad idea
yes the probability that you're gonna

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550
yes the probability that you're gonna
 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.459
yes the probability that you're gonna
take something complex that doesn't work

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469
take something complex that doesn't work
 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.129
take something complex that doesn't work
too badly and fix it with your idiotic

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139
too badly and fix it with your idiotic
 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:22.120
too badly and fix it with your idiotic
intervention is zero so well put
