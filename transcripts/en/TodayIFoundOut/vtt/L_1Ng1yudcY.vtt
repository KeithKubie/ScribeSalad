00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:11.830
The DC Comics Character Who Gained His Powers
from Cocaine

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.369
Comics are littered with weird and obscure
heroes and villains with powers that range

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.060
from the mundane to the ridiculous, but there’s
one character that ranks among the most “interesting”

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.120
ever conceived- Snowflame, a villain with
powers that were intrinsically linked to the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.930
character taking copious amounts of cocaine.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.170
As the character himself explained in the
comic, “I am Snowflame, every cell of my

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.860
being burns with white hot ecstasy.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.170
Cocaine is my god!

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.010
And I am the human instrument of its will!”

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.629
Snowflame was conceived as a villain by DC
writer Steve Englehart for an incredibly short-lived

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.020
comic series called “The New Guardians”,
appearing in just one of the series’ eventual

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.390
12 total issues.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.309
The New Guardians were a superhero team comprised
of some of DC’s more obscure heroes and,

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.389
according to the first issue, were specifically
chosen to be an accurate representation of

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:09.520
the various segments of the human race.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.100
It was also noted that the ultimate goal of
the New Guardians was to pass on their genetically

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.780
superior genes to the next generation.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.680
Notable DC superheroes given the honour of
becoming a New Guardian included a flamboyant,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.200
silk robe wearing gay Peruvian magician called
Extraño, a disembodied Australian woman who

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.520
exists in “aboriginal Dreamtime”, a Japanese
man who is comprised of electronics and who

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.749
interact with various electronic devices,
and an Inuit who had the power of bringing

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:37.909
out the best in people…

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.279
(I can’t make this stuff up.)

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:45.450
ExtrañoDespite the laudable attempt on DC’s
part to make the heroes as diverse as possible,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.009
and even an earnest attempt to include a superhero
gay character in the form of Extraño (ahead

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.859
of its time in this way in the 1980s), the
comic seemed tone-deaf even by that decade’s

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:54.859
comic standards.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.399
In regards to Extraño specifically, because
DC couldn’t outright say he was gay due

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.289
to publishing standards of the time, they
resorted to tired homosexual stereotypes to

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.209
imply it as bluntly as possible, and even
had him being attacked by The Hemogoblin so

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.489
that Extraño would contract HIV…

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.959
The comic also left it unclear whether Extraño
already had HIV when he was attacked by said

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.040
supervillain…

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.730
Supposedly the idea behind the comic was to
use lesser known heroes to explore contemporary

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.670
themes such as drugs and sexuality, but editors
found it too risqué and quickly quashed the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.459
comic after the 12th issue.

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.480
As for Snowflame, he appeared in the second
issue of New Guardians, being portrayed as

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.269
a Colombian drug lord who the New Guardians
attempt to defeat to quell the flow of drugs

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.709
from the region.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.080
Because subtlety wasn’t exactly the name
of the game with this line of comics, the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.670
issue is titled, “Jungle Snow”.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.950
In his first encounter with the New Guardians,
Snowflame mocks the newly formed superhero

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.810
team before proclaiming “Cocaine is my god”.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.749
He then slaps a member of the team called
Ram- the aforementioned Japanese man who has

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.430
the power of electronics…

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.300
Snowflame then proceeds to elaborate somewhat
on the nature of his powers.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.670
He notes that he exudes a constant aura of
fire while acting under the influence of cocaine

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.500
and that the drug similarly increases his
strength, durability and fighting prowess

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.010
to extreme levels, while also making him impervious
to pain- the more cocaine he snorts, the greater

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.010
the effect.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.569
When the Guardians ask him to surrender, he
laughs in their faces, noting his love of

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.519
cocaine, “Give up?

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.549
Give up the ultimate exhilaration, the divine
rapture, the euphoria of electricity that

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.799
now surges through every molecule of my body?”

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.019
Snowflame then calls for his men, who are
also coked out of their minds, to shoot the

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.989
New Guardians with guns and bury them fully
clothed in shallow graves, prompting one of

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.980
the characters to have a flashback to the
aftermath of their fight with The Hemogoblin,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.400
which features several pages of surprisingly
accurate information about AIDS.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.719
Yes, it’s hard to believe they decided to
make Batman movies instead of New Guardians.

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:05.900
The comic then flashes back to the present
and shows that the New Guardians were merely

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.170
pretending to be dead; how they survived being
shot is never elaborated upon.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.099
They then track down Snowflame who is found
lounging around with several women in bikinis,

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.910
bragging about how much cocaine he’s going
to sell, when they confront him and offer

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.280
him the chance to surrender.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.680
Snowflame grabs a huge handful of cocaine
and shoves it directly into his own face.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.389
He then commands his bodyguards, who are inexplicably
all wearing swimwear and also strung out on

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.680
cocaine, to attack.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.180
During the battle, Floronic Man, who has the
power of plants, discovers that he can absorb

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.580
the cocaine from people’s bodies and uses
this knowledge to slowly drain all the cocaine

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.890
from the bodies of Snowflame’s guards.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.590
Snowflame himself is then punched into a shed
full of chemicals, which due to his fiery

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.400
cocaine aura, instantly explodes, presumably
killing him.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.620
The character is never mentioned again.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.400
The late 1980s were a different time

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.560
DC Comics wasn’t the only ones coming up
with oddball superheroes.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.530
Marvel Comic’s “Squirrel Girl” was a
high school student who could control squirrels

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.310
and used them to fight villains.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.550
She also had a 3-4 foot tail, buck teeth,
claws (and retractable knuckle-spikes a-la

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.460
Wolverine), and lips that tasted like hazelnuts…

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.651
She wanted desperately to be Iron Man’s
sidekick, but he rejected her, even after

00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:28.000
she saved his life- though he did tell her
that when she was older, perhaps she could

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.330
join the Avengers.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.479
“Zeitgeist” was another “odd” Marvel
character.

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.960
After finding out he had super stomach acid,
he naturally decided to use it to fight evil.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.330
How did he find out about his super power?

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.319
After getting drunk and making out with a
girl, he fell ill and vomited all over her,

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.919
burning the poor girl’s face and disfiguring
her.

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.120
(Who hasn’t seen that scenario play out?)

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.270
His response to the incident- “I sure hope
the doctors managed to give her back her pretty

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.270
face.”

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.610
The good news is that Zeitgeist now realized
he had a super power and began using it for

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.259
good by vomiting all over the bad guys.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.470
His stomach acid was so potent, that it could
burn through a 4 inch thick steel plate in

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.470
half a minute.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.550
I’m just guessing with that on her face,
the girl did not get her face back.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.080
Another bizarre character was “Rainbow Girl”,
a DC Comics character who controlled the powers

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.530
of the emotional spectrum, which would give
her extremely unpredictable mood swings.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.699
Essentially, Rainbow Girl’s superpower was
almost explicitly a raging case of PMS…

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.629
To fight evil, Rainbow Girl would tap her
anger (the color red), hope (blue) and willpower

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:32.629
(green).

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.720
She also had the ability to create a pheromone
field that gave her a personality that everyone

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:49.749
loved and no one could resist.
