00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.330
This article of desktop weaponry accommodates
multiple rounds of ammunition, launches exploding

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.360
tipped cross-bow bolts, and slings wooden
matches over 30 feet away. In this project

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.360
we're turning some ordinary household items,
into a surprisingly versatile, micro-crossbow.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.820
To start this project, we'll need a handful
of popsicle sticks, and a template showing

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.219
how to cut them. You'll see how to get one
for free in just a minute. Once the popsicle

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.739
sticks are all marked, we can use something
like a pair of gardening shears to cut the

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.100
pieces to size without ever having to make
a single measurement. You can get YOUR free

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.719
template by clicking the icon, or by following
the link in the description. Alright, now

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.440
that our pieces are cut, let's paint them
completely black. And that can be done quickly

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.039
and easily with a permanent marker. The ink
will probably take just a minute to dry, so

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.809
now would be a good time to round up some
metal hair clips. We're only going to need

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.989
2 of them, and you can see that with a little
manipulation, the inside clip breaks off cleanly

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.510
at the bottom. Now the first step of assembly
is securing the clips to the wooden supports

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.780
with a bit of hot glue, so that when it cools,
the limbs arch away from each other in a bow

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.010
shape. Now let's go ahead and add some hot
glue to the inside of the arch so we can press

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.000
the second support firmly into place. I cleaned
up the excess glue with a utility knife, and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.280
now we should be good to set this to the side,
and move on to making the pistol grip. The

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.340
outer rail needs just enough hot glue to secure
the smaller, "rail spacer" flush with the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.540
tip. You might notice I dropped the top down
a touch, to form a little groove about half

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.640
a matchstick deep. Now, it's important this
flight channel stays clean, so we need

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.040
to check for any excess glue and ensure it
all gets removed. At this point we can attach

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.670
the handle support right behind the spacer,
then glue the last rail in place. You can

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.020
see I left a matchstick in the flight channel,
and that's to ensure I get the spacing right.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.480
To finish the frame, all we need to do is
glue the "pistol grip" panels so they overhang

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.480
slightly at the back. Alright, were going
to need a very shallow groove for catching

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.310
the bowstring, so let's try using a knife
to carefully whittle out a small catch in

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.310
the upper rails, in-line with the front of
the pistol grip. While we're at it, why don't

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.000
we use a bit of sand paper to lightly round
the edges of the barrel to help prevent the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.390
bowstring from fraying and breaking. Don't
worry about messing up the paint job â€¦ it's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.510
super easy to touch up make good as new. Now,
the crossbow starts to come together as the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.860
tip of the gun rails are pressed firmly into
a dab of hot glue on the inside of the bow.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.510
And about 30 seconds of steady pressure works
well to keep the connection strong as the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.450
glue begins to cool. I chose to glue some
fillets on the side for added support and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.530
durability, and you should be able to see
the flight groove is slightly higher than

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.910
the limb supports. Now, when a matchstick's
placed in the channel, it will hopefully slide

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.480
freely and without restriction. Alright, it's
time to pick out a bow-string. This is embroidery

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.450
floss from the craft section of a local supercenter,
and I'll be using yellow. Now, if we push

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.930
one end of the floss through the hole in the
tip, tie it in place with a double knot, and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.280
add a bit of hot glue, it should keep the
knot from unravelling. Before we go any further,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.630
I'm thinking we need a second string glued
to the backside of the bow, and wrapped around

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.330
the support 8-10 times on each side. This
will reinforce the connections exponentially,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.310
and a small dab of hot glue should keep the
string from unravelling. Alright, let's get

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.560
back to the bow string. We'll need to twist
it around a few times to keep it tight, then

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.660
flex the hair clips a little before synching
down another double knot. You can see this

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.410
will keep tension on the string and increase
the draw weight of the bow. Of course we'll

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.050
need to add some glue to this knot as well,
and trim off the excess thread, but other

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.030
than that, our basic crossbow is finished.
Let's try it out by cocking the bowstring,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.800
inserting a wooden match for ammunition, and
using our thumbnail to press up gently on

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.690
the string. You can see the wooden bolts fire
off at incredible speeds, and over 30 feet

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.590
away. Now, occasionally the string will jump
the bolt, and fail to launch. So let's address

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.970
that challenge with some pieces from the scrap
pile. If we glue them to the back and create

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.610
a makeshift "retention spring", it'll fire
the bolt every time. The finger holds the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.620
bolt so securely, that it can be fired from
any angle, even upside down. I went ahead

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.190
and wrapped the handle with yellow thread,
and added a couple of mini-clips for additional

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.020
ammo. These "side-mount" quivers are simply
made from a plastic drinking straw. I cut

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.040
two small pieces from off the straw, capped
one end with some hot glue, and attached them

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.069
to the side of the barrel at a bit of an angle.
Now when the bolts are inserted, there's plenty

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.359
of tension to hold them in place, even if
the crossbow's completely inverted. With this

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.730
simple modification, we've tripled our easy
access ammo, which should give a nice edge

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.080
to our gameplay. Now, let's take it to the
next level with some contact explosive bolt

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.190
heads. I made these ones by securing individual
snappers, to the tips of the sticks with a

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.560
bit of electrical tape. This is super awesome
because now our bolts make a bang when they

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.190
impact a hard target. Of course this should
only be done outdoors and with adult supervision.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.370
Well now you know how to turn some simple
household items, into a powerful, and amazingly

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.740
versatile, micro-crossbow. By the way, if
you can't find any embroidery floss, try twisting

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.340
about 4 strands of dental floss instead. It
works great, and it's slippery enough to cock

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.760
and fire a bolt that's already set in place.
Well that's it for now. If you liked this

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.580
project, perhaps you'll like some of my others.
