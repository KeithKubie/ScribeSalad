[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:11.086
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:12.990
DOMINIQUE GISIN:
So hi, everybody.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.970
It's a great pleasure to be here
at Google center in Switzerland

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.020
and talk a little bit
about my past, my present,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.230
and my future, and share
my experience so far, some

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.480
of the emotions and, hopefully,
some of the learnings, as well.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.330
Well, everything started off
when I was pretty short still.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.450
I was 1 and 1/2 years old
when I started to ski.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.320
Can you imagine?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.840
I could barely walk,
and then I skied.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.430
My mom still says I actually
ski better than I walk,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.060
and I must admit,
she's probably right.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.210
And as you can see
already on this picture,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.970
I always had a big,
big smile on my face.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.390
Because skiing is
really the world to me.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.570
It's my first childhood memory.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.600
It's really everything
I care about,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.120
and it's just the
best thing there is.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.840
And I think this
picture says it all.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.640
I went on to become a
professional skier, started

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.560
in several regional ski races,
started to win national ski

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.360
races on a kid's level.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.610
You know, all the
steps everybody

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.390
does who wants to
become an athlete.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.650
In skiing it means every year
a new category, other athletes

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.790
that you compete with,
and I made step by step

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.980
towards world class.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.900
Everything looked
perfectly fine.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.460
When I was 14 I was one of
the best in Switzerland.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.220
I was already
representing Switzerland

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.300
at international races.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.680
I went to a race to
Sarajevo with the plane.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.050
It was an extreme
experience for me,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.200
you know, going to the
airport with all the luggage

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.140
and everything, and then
competing with the best.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.090
And I figured out I don't
only love the sport and skiing

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.760
and the winter, I also
love the lifestyle

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.450
of traveling, living out of
a suitcase, and especially,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.340
comparing myself to the best
athletes all over the world.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.640
When I was 14, I also
got my first injury.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.640
Somebody asked me before if
I ever had an ACL injury.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.380
Of course I had an ACL injury,
like every skier has or almost

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.780
every skier has, unfortunately.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.990
I tore my ACL at my right knee.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.590
After that I got several
complication surgeries,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.400
because we just couldn't
figure out what went wrong

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.230
after the first surgery.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.150
Rehab was perfect.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.450
Year after in the
control, we found out

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.810
that I suffered a broken
patella, something

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.930
that happens if you
take your patella tendon

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.650
as a replacement of your ACL.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.820
It happens very seldom.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.790
That's why the doctors
couldn't figure it out.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.940
After that, I went
through another set

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.260
of surgery setbacks.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.600
It was a crazy time
of struggle and living

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.930
in a world where there was
pretty much only sleeping,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.920
eating, rehab, and that was it.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.600
I wasn't skiing competitional
for more than three years,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.090
between the age of 15 and 18.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.280
Now, this is the
age everybody talks

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.580
about when we want
to figure out who's

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.520
going to make it in
professional sports and who not.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.790
Because it's the time where
everything gets decided.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.680
And that's the time where
I didn't even compete.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.920
Let's not even talk about
being on the podium,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.710
because if you're not on
the start, I can tell you,

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.280
it's pretty hard to
end up on a podium.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.790
So somehow I made
it through that time

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.620
with the help of an
amazing medical setback,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.620
like surrounding, who will
support me extremely well.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.220
I was lucky enough to
have a series of injuries

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.840
that was interesting to the
best surgeons in the world.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.450
Funny, but true.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.529
I tore my patella and
my patella tendon,

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:26.780
and because the whole structure
was already pretty damaged,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.540
the whole muscle was
ripped out as well.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.220
And this complicated
injury is not even

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.200
written down in any book.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.570
It doesn't even have a name.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.740
My doctor who fixed it
is Dr. Segesser, one

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.620
of the most famous knee
surgeons in Switzerland.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.780
And he said he never
had something like it.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.350
So you can imagine that it was
a pretty big deal coming back

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.150
from that.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.520
Now, three years later, many
injuries, many setbacks,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.170
still working on my comeback
and getting back to world class.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.500
And this time, not on slalom
and giant slalom like I

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.680
did as a kid, but on
the speed disciplines.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.000
Who's skiing fan in the room?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.450
Anybody looking ski--

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.140
OK, most.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.880
So we have different
disciplines.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.060
You know that-- downhill,
super G, giant slalom, slalom.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.280
Giant slalom, slalom
is a little slower,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.960
a little easier, but
technically, pretty amazing.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.360
And speed is speed.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.890
Downhill and super G--

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.910
it's straight down,
fast as you can go.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.410
And--

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.642
DOMINIQUE GISIN: Exactly.

00:05:36.642 --> 00:05:37.850
Exactly.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.770
And I was always a
giant slalom and slalom

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.980
kid, because my childhood
hero was Vreni Schneider.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.990
Anybody still knows
Vreni Schneider?

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.370
Yes, thank you.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.050
She was my childhood hero.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.450
She won everything
in those disciplines.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.430
But coming back from the
injury, I had two problems.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.870
First problem was,
my knee was so weak,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.450
and especially my
fast twitching muscles

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.010
were so weak that I
couldn't do slalom anymore.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.780
I couldn't get out of the
turn fast enough to get speed

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.260
for the whole course.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
And the second problem,
which was much bigger

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.740
was, I had to start bib 139,
and all my friends were already

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.270
gone in the next, next, next
upper category, because they

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.680
went through the whole
process of getting better

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.260
in the start list, three years.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.790
And I had none of
those three years left.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.720
So I was there at the starting
gate with the last bib.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.010
And in giant slalom and slalom,
if you have the last bib,

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.380
you will not even see
the gates sometimes,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.380
because the holes that
the people in front of you

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.880
have carved through
the snow, they

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.600
are so big that you have trouble
seeing where you have to go.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.440
And I can tell you, you
will lose some time.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.270
So we say 30 bibs is
approximately one second back.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.390
So if you're starting
with 139, you all

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.830
can calculate very well.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.410
You wouldn't be here
if you wouldn't.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.390
So I will not do
the calcs for you,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.670
but I can guarantee you will not
win a race with bib number 139.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.270
Not even Mikaela Shiffrin, and
I think she's amazing, but not

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.920
even Mikaela Shiffrin will win
a race with bib number 139.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.050
In downhill and super
G, things are different.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.630
because everybody's just
going straight down,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.000
there are no holes
carved in the snow,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.430
and you can win with
the very last bib.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.000
And I went to Cortina
for a race in downhill.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.800
All the coaches
said my coach was

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.430
nuts to let me go down there,
because I was already injured,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.250
with 80 kilometers per hour.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.750
And now they were like, you
really want to let her go 120?

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.660
And we did it, and I
made it to the finish,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.650
and Italian speaker got
crazy, and I got second place.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.880
And it was amazing.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.540
And the best thing about
it was that I qualified

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.820
for Austrian championships.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.600
Now understanding how
this slide's coming there.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.420
Sounds weird, but in skiing,
national championships

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.850
are always international races.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.550
And you know the fight that the
Swiss have with the Austrians

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.150
in skiing?

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.890
Heard about it, maybe?

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.530
If you never heard about
it, you hear it now.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.610
It's very friendship-like,
but it's still a fight.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.220
We want those points,
they want our points,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.880
and we try to get there
and really beat them.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.060
So when I showed up there
without a team jacket,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.620
nobody knew who I was.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.080
The Austrians
laughed pretty hard.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.630
They stopped laughing when
I won one of the races,

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.419
and I became Austrian champion.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.940
Not for real, but
the points were mine,

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.059
and that was what was counted.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.510
After that, things went crazy.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.800
I went to my first
World Cup race,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.450
was clocking the best time in
my very first downhill official

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.550
training ever.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.320
It was a big show.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.410
The whole mountain was amazed,
except for the Austrians.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.470
They said, well, she's
Austrian champion.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.500
They can take the positive
out of everything.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.510
You got to give it to them.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.430
And then world
championships in Are--

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.980
that was one hell
of an experience.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:18.740
I mean, going to Sweden and then
racing in this scenery, which

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.270
was just out of this world.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.990
And I was amazed that suddenly
the people that were on TV

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.570
before were standing on
the starting gate with me.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.930
And I went out there
and I charged a course.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:34.790
I got a fifth place and I
was completely devastated,

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.640
because I wanted
that medal so bad.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.450
But if I think back now, it
was my first world champs.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.040
I got fifth.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.330
I should have been happy,
but I wasn't, I can tell you.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.930
But things went great
and I was really excited.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.910
And then I have one other
big, big passion in my life,

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.430
and it's flying.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.940
And flying, for me, is
something so essential,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.430
because it recharges
my batteries.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.380
And I don't know
how you guys are,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.470
but I can imagine you
have pretty tough work,

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.940
pretty lots to do.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:13.730
If I remember the timings when
regional sent me some mails,

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.200
it was pretty late sometimes.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.910
So I think it is so important
for each and every one of us

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.090
to have times when you work,
but also times when you

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.890
can recharge your batteries.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.320
Because energy is
crucial, you know?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.080
And you can never do
good work if you're tired

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.240
and you're exhausted and
there's nothing left.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.180
So to have a place
where I can go,

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.570
and no matter what, I know I
can recharge my batteries there,

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.950
it's so essential to me.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.960
And that's what flying is.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.120
And yeah, if you
see that picture,

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.350
I hope, like the first skiing
picture, it's the same, right?

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.890
Big smiles and pure
freedom, to me.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.160
So flying is where
I get the energy

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.380
to make the next big steps, and
next big steps led me to Sochi.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.870
After another eight
or so injuries,

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.950
there were constant struggles,
still, when I was in World Cup.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.290
Every time I looked
out of the hole--

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.840
you know how you feel when
you look out of a hole

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.125
after you dig deep,
and do you think,

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:16.250
now I'm going to make it,
now I'm going to make it,

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.710
there was another hammer coming.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:24.660
And I really thought that this
was just the story of my life.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.310
And then I was in Sochi.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.590
And the night before the
race, I was constantly

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.340
thinking that, why?

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.160
Why should it be
like that, right?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.350
And then suddenly, I
was like, you know what?

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.680
The 17-year-old Dominique
would be so ashamed

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.190
if she could see you now,
complaining about having

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.960
the biggest chance of her life.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.690
And then something
switched inside me,

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:55.730
and I knew, OK, I have this
chance to win this medal,

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.680
I so want to do it.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.020
And the day after
I got that gold

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.750
that I was working for
for such a long time.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.900
And it was such a wonderful day,
and it means so, so much to me,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.720
because of course,
a gold is a gold,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:17.570
and it's always the same
color, but mine was really

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:22.760
drowned in blood and sweat
and tears, many tears.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.150
And it means so much more
to you to achieve something

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.030
like that after all
the struggles and all

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:33.710
the setbacks and all the fights
I had to go through in my life.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.030
So yeah, that's Sochi.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.310
And then what was next?

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.820
I needed a new challenge, right?

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:50.470
I was always about going
for my full potential.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.540
You ever had that feeling
that what is like,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.150
getting you up in the
morning is like just

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.890
exploring how far can I go.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.640
How good can I
become in what I do?

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.800
And in skiing, there was a point
after Sochi where I realized,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.220
there is nothing
left I can adapt.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.120
There is nothing left I
can adjust to get better.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.300
I have nothing left
for the next summer

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.510
to change to become
a better skier.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.040
And it's not about the results.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.920
Because yes, of course, I could
have waited for another two

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.650
or three years and hope
that some would retire,

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.150
and some would
maybe get injured,

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.870
because it's pretty common
in our sports, unfortunately.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.090
But it's about what
fulfills me, and it's not

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.160
the black and white
results in the end,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.030
those are the things
that are watching out

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.300
that I can pay my food in
the end of the month, right?

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.360
And I know figures and
facts are important,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.380
and we all have to set goals and
then show that we accomplished

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.890
those goals.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.930
But what is getting
me up in the morning

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.980
is really exploring
how far can I go.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.620
How far can I become
a better skier,

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.760
and now how far can
I go with my studies.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.990
And I always wanted
to study physics.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:20.100
And I don't know how I came
to the idea to go to ETH.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.180
I don't know if it was
the best idea of my life.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.510
It sure was three
years of new challenges

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.010
that didn't feel much
less energy taking

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.820
than all the skiing and
all the injuries before,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.830
and it was a
completely new setup.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:43.500
If you go studying with almost
30, and half of your class

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.730
is 15-year-old
super kids who just

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.970
finished their high school
early, I can tell you,

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.560
it's a challenge.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.860
And I remember in the first
month I was sitting there,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.660
and I never knew if I should
listen to the professor,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.680
if I should try to understand
what he's talking about,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.490
or if I should just write
down whatever he is saying.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.590
And I knew that I
had to choose one,

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.920
because two simultaneous
is just impossible,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.850
and I most times ended up with
doing nothing and just getting

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.430
stressed out that I
could not figure out

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.750
what was the best to do.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.900
So it was completely different.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.700
And then also,
before, I was a skier,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.790
and I was outside every
day in the weather.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.490
And of course it's tough when
you go outside and it's raining

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:36.870
and you have to train all
day, but then starting at ETH

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.920
and being inside all day,
and never even seeing the sun

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.840
or what the weather was like,
wasn't much better either.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.980
So it was the complete
opposite-- living

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.770
in the city to living
in the mountains.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.750
Sitting down all day, to
before, training 45 hours

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.210
a week or something.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.660
If you could have had the
opposite of my life as a skier,

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.260
that was it.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.720
And my body struggled with it.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.620
My hormones struggled with it.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.230
I could not deal with it.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.600
I was completely overwhelmed.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.610
And only after a
year I figured out,

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.130
OK, I have to find
a way in between.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.050
I need to move my body.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:21.270
I can't just do all the homework
until I go do some sports.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.480
Because I don't know how
many of you studied at ETH,

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.840
but I'm pretty sure you all
studied at crazy universities.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.100
And I never finished my
homework in three years.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.115
There was always
something left to do.

00:16:34.115 --> 00:16:35.490
So if I would have
waited for it,

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.890
I would never have
done any sports.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.440
And I realized I need
to do sports just

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.480
to recharge my batteries
again, and also

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.320
to give my body some movement.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.410
I mean, it's crucial, right?

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.960
And I just finished my studies,
my bachelor this summer,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.500
and I will take
a break from ETH.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.100
And of course, skiing
is still my passion.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.790
I mean, I love skiing.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.920
I love snow.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.410
This is the time of the year.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.560
I just hope the
temperatures drop,

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.720
and I understand each
and everyone living

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.630
in the city that
doesn't feel like that.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.660
But you just should come up
to the mountains a bit more

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.260
in winter.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.040
It's pretty amazing.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.319
So I'm still skiing
50 days plus a year.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:26.760
I'm joining my sister on
her path to also, hopefully,

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.710
a lot of World Cup podiums.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.980
She also became Olympic
champion last year,

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.490
something super crazy to
have two Olympic champions

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:40.860
in the same family, and to share
the emotions was something that

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.950
will always stay in my heart.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.690
Because as an athlete,
you just always

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.360
have this filter of
pushing down your emotions

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.670
a little bit so you can
perform at your best.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.330
And if you're the sister,
you can just let it out.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.270
You can live the emotions,
which is something very, very

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.920
beautiful.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.820
And now a new challenge
since October 1,

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.460
so pretty much at the
beginning, I got new work.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.060
I'm sharing management of the
Stiftung Schweizer Sporthilfe.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.540
It's the biggest
organization in Switzerland

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.790
who supports our top athletes.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.790
It's very crucial support.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:28.270
We're sharing [SPEAKING GERMAN],,
doing the management together.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.020
Doris Rechsteiner is
doing it for many years,

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.160
and we appreciate her
amazing experience,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.450
and she helps us get
all our crazy ideas

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.070
into the right direction.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.560
And the support
of our presidents

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.750
Urs and Bernhard is amazing.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.540
They are both sports
fanatics, like we all are.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.480
And we're really hoping
that we can move something.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.630
What do we have to
move in Switzerland?

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.500
Top athletes are paid
completely different

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.300
than in other countries.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.250
Most countries have systems,
where the athletes are somehow

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:12.810
employed by government
in any kind of way.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.220
In Switzerland, it's different.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.370
We support them
on three pillars.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:23.550
We also have the
Swiss Bund Federation,

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.460
who is supporting us through
the lottery money, which

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.140
is extremely important for us.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.650
And then we have, of
course, a lot of business

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:33.990
who is supporting us.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.320
And we have each and
every one of you,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.440
who hopefully will
join this movement,

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.650
because we believe that we
all should do something.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.480
So we will still have the
motions and the experience

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.990
of having Swiss top
athletes also in the future

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.350
and that we can sit in front
of TV and cheer them on,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:00.430
because we have to find another
way than in other countries.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.610
Yeah, these are some figures.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.290
How many athletes do we support?

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.990
It's over 900 athletes,
most top athletes who

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.240
get supported very
broadly and then

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.160
also a lot of young athletes,
who we support on their way

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.660
to the top, which
is a crazy struggle.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.750
You just heard some
of my struggles,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:25.080
and you can imagine how
hard it was for my family

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.290
to find the financial support
to get three kids to the top.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.270
My brother is in World Cup, too.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.790
And there are many
families like that,

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.740
who really try to find a way.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.960
And it's not always easy to
find the money, especially now

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.140
that sports is getting more
and more professional on a very

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.550
young level already.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.130
And we really try to
give the athletes also

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.070
the peace of mind and
parents the peace of mind

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:56.710
that they have a support
system and the back net who

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.960
is holding them up,
so they can focus

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.080
on what this most important
to get their performance

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:08.590
and to go and get
some more medals.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.470
Yeah, the figures
are always crazy,

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:16.780
like how many athletes are
well below wage minimum,

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.660
it's really astonishing
also for us every year.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.470
We do the figures, and
it's not changing much.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.020
So we really have
to support them,

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.630
and we have to find a way
to give them the security

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.270
to support them
in doing their job

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.970
and do what they can do best.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:42.470
So thank you very, very
much for your attention.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.840
It was a pleasure to talk
to you some about me,

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.280
some about our
amazing organization,

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.950
our organization that was
part of the Swiss medals

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.900
in Pyeongchang last winter.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.000
We can see two of
our medal winners.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.210
Those who followed
the Olympic games

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.710
might recognize Mathilde
Gremaud and Sarah Hofflin.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.600
Both medaled at the women's
slopestyle event, gold

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.440
and silver, and all
the Swiss medal winners

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.460
were supported by Sporthilfe.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.980
So the money is really going to
the those athletes that need it

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.430
and those athletes that
are working hard and going

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:25.710
for the medals.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:30.490
95% of all athletes that were
at the games for Switzerland

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.830
were supported by
our organization.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.350
And I think this is--

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.260
yeah, those are the nice
figures that we like to tell

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.930
and that we are
also very proud of.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:48.040
So thanks for your attention,
and hopefully, now we're

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.820
going for some super
interesting questions.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.043
I'm excited.

00:22:54.043 --> 00:22:56.869
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.338
SPEAKER 1: I think we have
some Dory questions already.

00:23:04.338 --> 00:23:05.955
Questions people submit before.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.130
So what techniques did you
use to overcome mental blocks

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:16.117
after your injuries?

00:23:16.117 --> 00:23:17.450
DOMINIQUE GISIN: Different ones.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.830
And I think the most
interesting part about it

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.910
is not what tools I used,
but that I had to figure out

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:31.040
after every injury a new tool,
because no two injuries were

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.910
alike.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.460
There were injuries
where I came back

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.230
without no mental problems.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.100
And I was thinking, well,
what is this mental barrier

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.690
that everybody is talking about?

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.170
I don't know what it is, and
then there were other injuries,

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.270
and sometimes there were
really minor injuries,

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.760
where I struggled so hard,
and I had to find a way.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.480
And there were
different strategies.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.290
We did externalization that
I really talked sometimes

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.540
with my respects.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:03.350
We did [INAUDIBLE],, where
I visualized a lot of races

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.360
without trying to crash.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.610
I had times where
every time, I would

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.990
visualize a run in my mind,
I would end up in a net.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.670
And that's not what
you're looking for, right?

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:16.710
You really want to
go to the finish.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.350
So then I had to train.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.200
I had to train my mind to
think the right things,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:29.030
and I think two most important
points regarding this question

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.290
is always figure out the
way, and always question

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.570
if the one way that
worked the last time

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:40.010
will still work this time to
overcome a mental barrier,

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.770
and then the other is
it's mental training.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.810
It's not mental magic.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.180
You cannot think, I
will do it one time,

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.530
and then everything is good.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.450
It's not working like that.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.510
You really have to sit
down and do it every day

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.650
and use the techniques that
you find in a lot of books,

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:02.810
and there's tons of great
and amazing motivation books.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.440
There's tons of great
and amazing mental books,

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.200
but the thing is you've
got to do it yourself.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.700
You cannot just read the book,
and then everything is done.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.620
It's not working like that.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.950
First on a groomed slope
or a big powder day,

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.390
these days, no question.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:25.010
Always powder days, and
probably, always was like that.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.570
I mean, of course,
before skiing was my job,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.910
and then you just
had those times

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.710
where you had to do your job,
and I always loved my job.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.130
But on a day, on a free
day, I would always

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.500
prefer powder, for sure.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.540
If you live in
Engelberg, you have to.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.090
I would get exiled
from my village

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.710
if I would say something else.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:50.770
I'm pretty sure I would.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:51.448
[LAUGHS]

00:25:51.448 --> 00:25:52.740
SPEAKER 1: You don't want that.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.000
DOMINIQUE GISIN: No, I
don't want that either.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.120
SPEAKER 1: It was
actually this past year

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.190
you said that your sister
won the gold medal.

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.065
DOMINIQUE GISIN: Yes.

00:25:59.065 --> 00:26:01.130
SPEAKER 1: So what
was that moment like?

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.070
DOMINIQUE GISIN: It
was pure emotions.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.970
And as I said before, it
was much more emotional

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.990
than my own victory, because I
was able to allow the emotions.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:17.000
When I won, I was still somehow
in the adrenaline of the race.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.547
And you know, I was
extremely happy.

00:26:19.547 --> 00:26:20.880
And I was crying and everything.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.510
But it was not as
quick after the race.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.090
It took me some time
to realize everything

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.400
and to put everything in order.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.530
And now with my sister,
I mean, I already

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.810
knew when we were
going there that she

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.180
had a pretty big chance
to win that race,

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:43.910
and then I followed her
whole journey very closely,

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.280
and the last 24 hours were not--

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.710
I mean, she crashed in
the downhill the day

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.570
before in the finish.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:55.220
And the day after was that race
that we build up everything

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.240
for in the past three years.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.960
And then you were right
there, right beside her,

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.220
and you cannot do anything.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.860
I cannot hold her hand
when she's skiing.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.610
And I cannot ski myself, as
she's doing it better anyway.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.470
So I don't have to.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.760
And then you just sit there,
and after we had the downhill,

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.180
she did really good downhill,
and then the slalom came.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:26.570
And before the slalom run,
the American moderator

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.780
asked me how I felt
about my sister,

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.080
and I said, she's going to win,
or she's going to straddle,

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.180
because in slalom you
can always straddle.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.990
But I was so sure.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.320
And then I was just hoping
that she would not straddle,

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.390
because it can always
happen in slalom, right?

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.020
So every game, like oh, oh!

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.540
Then yes, it was beautiful.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.390
AUDIENCE: My question is it
seems that skiing is always

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:51.050
about winning.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.950
If you not score first place,
second place is already losing,

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.590
it seems to me.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.150
So sort of two questions.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.760
One is, what happened
if in Sochi, you

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.160
had had second place
and not first place.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.560
And the second question
is is it a good thing

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.040
to become second best of the
world at the Olympics or not?

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:18.380
DOMINIQUE GISIN: I think
it's with all single sports,

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.800
like that, right,
it's first, and then

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:27.830
there's pretty much nothing
after for the public response.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.210
And I'm saying that.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:36.050
So nobody remembers who
was second in cycling world

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.760
championships four years ago.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.760
Do you remember?

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.010
I don't remember.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.150
Somebody remembers?

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:46.100
Maybe if you're a super hardcore
fan, but most people don't.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.490
Now, the question that
is maybe more interesting

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:53.160
is what does it mean
to you as an athlete?

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.960
And I think for
me, as an athlete,

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.140
as I said before is the most
valuable thing if I can perform

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:04.250
at my best, if I can ski
at my full potential,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:08.220
and if I have a run
like that, I'm happy.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.000
And then what the board
says is something else.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.900
And of course, you want the
board to be pretty much in line

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.580
with your own feelings.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:23.040
But if you ever have the
chance to review Sochi, my run,

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.690
I'm coming to the finish,
and I knew that day

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.220
that I had a big chance to win.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.230
I just knew it.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.050
I was on the start.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.190
I was super nervous.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:34.700
I was sick because I pushed
myself really to that point

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.560
where I could be
first again in speed.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.340
And it took me a lot of energy,
because after all the injuries,

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.980
my body just refused
to be fast in speed,

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.052
and it refused to lose control.

00:29:46.052 --> 00:29:47.510
And you need to
lose control if you

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.690
want to win a downhill,
part of the control.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.540
But part of the control,
you have to give up.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.960
So in that position
on the starting gate,

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.270
it's not a comfortable place.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.240
I felt really sick,
and I felt tired.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.538
The last thing that was
in my mind was I'm tired,

00:30:05.538 --> 00:30:07.580
and it's in the starting
gate, not in the finish.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.720
But this is the mental part.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.490
Then the body was fit, and
the body executed perfectly,

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:21.810
automatic, because I build it
up for years for that moment.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:27.530
And then I promised myself from
the start, if you come down,

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:32.810
you look down at the snow, and
you think for a second was it

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.180
all I was able to give?

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.140
Did I execute like I wanted to?

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.540
If the answer is
yes, I have to live

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.620
with whatever is on that board.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.390
I have to.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.740
Of course, I can complain
afterwards and 100s there and--

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.900
I mean, we were same timing,
Tina Maze and me, 0, 0, 0.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.430
It's pure luck.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.163
It's pure luck.

00:30:56.163 --> 00:30:57.830
I'm not going to tell
you anything else.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:58.910
It's pure luck.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.490
I could have been 0, 0, 1.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.312
It's pure luck.

00:31:02.312 --> 00:31:04.520
And we knew it's going to
be a tight race, because we

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.230
had five training runs.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:07.760
Everybody knew the course.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.970
Everybody was adapted
to the conditions.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.550
Everybody had the skis
adapted to the conditions.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.460
We knew it's going to
be hell of a tight race.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.750
That was clear.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.060
And I'm not saying
1/10 was luck,

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.940
but 100th, it's pure luck.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.990
And that's what I wanted to
make sure for me, as a person

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.210
and as an athlete, that
I could live with it,

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:31.580
because as you said,
in the end, it's just

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.260
gold and then nothing else.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.740
And I'm confident
to say that I think

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.490
I could have lived with
silver just as well,

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.490
and not the public response
would have been otherwise.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.885
I wouldn't be at Google today.

00:31:44.885 --> 00:31:46.010
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.790
But to me, as an athlete,
what is the most valuable

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:55.940
is the path and
all the experience

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.850
I took with me through
all these years.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.970
And I can tell you these
days, I still have flashbacks.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.310
I have so many flashbacks
of my former life.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.262
I'm sitting somewhere and I'm
thinking, oh, I'm in Ushuaia

00:32:07.262 --> 00:32:08.720
and it's raining,
and I'm training.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.400
Or I'm in Lake Louise.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.970
It's minus 32 degrees.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.060
It's just too cold.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.420
I had not one single
flashback when I was standing

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.430
on the podium in Sochi, never.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:24.800
Not one single dream,
because as a person,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.050
of course, what the public
thinks of me is important.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.410
But as a person, it's not the
thing that was most important.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.810
The thing that
was most important

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:36.890
was that I was able to
push myself to that point

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.080
to that sick feeling
on the start.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.140
That is the flashback I get,
because that is my achievement.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.670
And then the black white
results and the gold medal,

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:53.300
that's karma, or that's,
in the end, pure mechanics.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.380
You can figure it
out by physics law.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.710
But to me, the valuable
thing is really

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:04.460
the journey and the
feelings that put in there.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.810
The energy I put in.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.860
Does it answer your question?

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.100
It was a long
answer, but I think

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.470
it's a very important
question that

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:13.690
has no short answer for me.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.220
AUDIENCE: Since you
participated in several tourneys

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:24.027
in many years, any loss of
performance that hurt the most?

00:33:24.027 --> 00:33:25.610
DOMINIQUE GISIN:
Loss of performance--

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:28.220
AUDIENCE: Or a loss or
basically for any performance

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.770
in all your tourneys
that hurt you

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.590
the most in terms of how
the performance turned out?

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.510
DOMINIQUE GISIN: Oh, very easy.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.880
Vancouver 2010, the Olympics.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.200
It was heartbreaking.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:46.190
I mean, I was so sure
I'm going to medal there.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.460
Before the season, I had an
amazing season the year before.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.290
I had my first two
World Cup victories.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.610
Everything was set up.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.500
We started to train in summer.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.640
I was starting to be almost
as fast as the men's team.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.040
The men's coaches
started to record me.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.890
That was the biggest
achievement I ever had,

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:08.250
when the men's coaches
started to film me.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.310
And then we had
one super fast ski,

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:14.100
and we were so confident for
the Olympics, we put it aside.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.530
I didn't use it for one
single World Cup race,

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.040
because we just wanted to
be sure that it was still

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.199
OK at the Olympics.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:22.870
And the season started off well.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.139
I podiumed.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:26.060
I did great results.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.550
And then we went
to house, horrible

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.560
weather just one
single training.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.969
And I always used--

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.730
that was one of the
methods mentally

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.489
that I used the trainings to
adapt myself to the slope.

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:40.880
So I was always pretty
slow in training, just

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.560
to get the right
feeling with the slope,

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.870
and when I felt comfortable,
I was able to charge.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.139
And then in the training,
I was super slow.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:49.400
And we had only one training.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.989
Usually, we had two or three.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:54.590
And then in the race, I
was 30 kilometers per hour

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:57.320
faster than in the training.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.950
And I couldn't
handle the situation.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:02.480
I got over the last
roller and crashed,

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.470
tore my meniscus, and also not--

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.860
I didn't tear my ACL, but
I injured it pretty badly.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.660
I got surgery the same evening,
because we had only four weeks

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.280
left to the Olympics.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.030
And I did not lose
hope one single second.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.480
I was still believing in that
medal, all the journey through.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.030
Next day, in the gym I did
everything for that path back.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.830
Two weeks later, I was on the
start of a World Cup race,

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:32.940
and it was crazy.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.940
I mean for me, it was
like OK, two weeks ago,

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.680
I was in the surgery
room, and now I'm

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.130
at the start of
a World Cup race.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.920
And still, I was
able to handle it.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.030
I was 17th at that first race,
which was amazing two weeks

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.840
after the surgery.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.980
And then I went to Vancouver.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.150
And I still believed I
could medal, not 17th, which

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.480
already would have been crazy.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.030
But I wanted to medal.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.720
Then again, horrible
weather, only one training.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.710
And then I still believed in it.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.810
The hill was crazy,
because it rained so hard

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:08.610
that it iced up in a way
that everything was shaky.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:13.280
And then I got over the
last roller of the race,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.850
and I got there with
the fastest split time,

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:20.966
and I crashed five meters
before the finish line.

00:36:20.966 --> 00:36:23.630
I was like, that
cannot be right.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.950
I mean, I gave--

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:26.960
if it would have
been a poker game,

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.100
I would have bet my house,
my car, like everything

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:36.110
I own, OK, my soul on that race.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.790
And then I was lying
there in the finish

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:42.160
area with a concussion,
and I could not believe it.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.320
And that's the one single time
in my career, where I really

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.690
was like I'm not going
to make it anymore.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.340
It's just too much.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.360
And then fortunately, I had
surroundings that supported me.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.280
I had organizations
that supported me,

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.630
and they got me
out of this moment.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.680
And that's also something
super important.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.600
You will not be able to manage
all the setbacks yourself,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.340
probably.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.660
And it's always good to have
somebody, a net behind you that

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.610
just keeps you standing up.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.770
SPEAKER 1: So who is in
that net, that support

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.330
system for you?

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:23.450
DOMINIQUE GISIN: My family
is super important to me,

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.420
especially having siblings
that have the same dream

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:32.570
and also went the same path was
absolutely crucial, because I

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.150
never had to explain
myself at home.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.510
I mean, I understand each
and every one who's asking me

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.460
why the hell did you do that.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.400
I mean, sometimes looking
back, it was pretty crazy.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.610
But it was also amazing
that neither my parents,

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.330
nor my grandparents,
nor my siblings

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.720
would ever ask me that question,
because they just knew why,

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.310
because they have
the same passion.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:58.320
They have the same
fire burning in them.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.600
And it's crazy to do top sports.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.240
It's just a huge
risk that you take.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.780
And you're going out there,
and you're competing.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.180
And as you said, only the
very best will survive.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.998
And that's one single person.

00:38:13.998 --> 00:38:14.540
It's not two.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.230
It's not three.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.700
It's not 10.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.660
In the world.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.980
Think about it.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.190
Think about if you would have to
compete with each and every one

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:26.570
in the world who is doing
your job, would you be top 30,

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:27.860
top 20?

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.530
I don't know.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.820
I mean, I would not
be top 30 in my job.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.360
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.540
So if you do sports,
only that counts.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:42.110
And even for that, you
have to fight as hell to,

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:45.050
as we saw before, to
have an income that

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:52.700
is minimum in our minds,
which is crazy for me.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.170
And the value that the athletes
create for us, I mean, probably

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:01.040
each and every one, otherwise
you wouldn't be here, once

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.040
was sitting in front of
a TV and loving sports

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.230
and loving the emotions
that they gave us

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:10.270
and loving the experience of how
sports is bringing us together,

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:14.030
no matter if you're Swiss
or Austrian or American

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.760
or wherever you come from.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.210
It's such a value
that is created

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:27.390
and I think this value should
also be valued, you know?

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.780
And that's something
which is super important.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.010
And then, for me, I have
that in my surroundings.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.980
But that's not every athlete
has a family like mine.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.250
It's not something that
you can take for granted.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:43.850
And also, not every family
has the possibilities

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:48.200
to finance something like
that for three kids, which

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.640
is super crazy.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.450
And my parents did
amazing sacrifices.

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:57.080
If I look back and I
think, I mean we were not

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.880
in vacation for many years.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.610
And I never thought about
it, because for me, it

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.470
was perfect as it was.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.520
But to my parents,
it was a choice.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.350
And my parents choose
to support us and choose

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:12.230
to live all these
crazy emotions with us.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.670
And I think they
never regret it.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.830
[LAUGHS] But still,
it's a choice.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:20.280
And not every parent
would take that choice.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.380
So yeah.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.630
SPEAKER 1: Do you want to
ask your question in the mic

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:25.380
so we can hear it.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.900
AUDIENCE: My question
relates to this risk.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.690
So basically, downhill is
a very, very fast sport

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:39.050
with a non negligible chance
that you will either seriously

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:45.238
hurt yourself or even die, and
you probably had like hundreds,

00:40:45.238 --> 00:40:47.030
maybe even thousands
of training runs where

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:49.650
you achieved those speeds.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:53.120
Were there times when you
pushed yourself so hard

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.990
and when you were so tired
that you lost pretty much

00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:04.670
most control and you felt
like I, at this point,

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:09.850
am behaving in a way that
doesn't respect my life

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:15.530
and I should never do
such a thing again?

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:19.910
DOMINIQUE GISIN: I think it was
more when I was young probably,

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.790
especially because the
path that I went through

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:29.210
was a very special one, because
I missed all this time where

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:32.730
young athletes are built
up between 15 and 18,

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.700
where they get
adapted to the speed.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.230
Usually you don't come--

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:42.440
my sixth race, my sixth downhill
race of my life, not World Cup

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.710
race, like sixth downhill
race of my entire life

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.750
was a World Cup race.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:51.440
It's not what you should do
with athletes, really not.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.560
And the problem for me
was, because I put myself

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.342
in this crazy situation
with all the injuries I had,

00:41:57.342 --> 00:42:01.220
I had no more choice if I
wanted to pursue my dream,

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.770
because there was
nobody waiting for me.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.920
I can tell you, there are a
lot of talents in Switzerland

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.600
when it comes to skiing.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.230
Of course, we would
always take more.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.080
But we have a lot of talent.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.410
So when I got injured,
there was pretty fast

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:20.150
somebody else who took my spot
as the best in my age group

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.560
and then the second
best and so on.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.320
So when I wanted
to come back, I had

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.130
to take every chance
that there was.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:29.930
And of course, there
were some chances

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.660
that when I look
back at them, I'm

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:38.370
like, how would I ever
come to the idea to do it?

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:42.170
My first downhill was
on a World Cup slope.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.760
It was a [INAUDIBLE]
race, like a race

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.680
a little below World Cup, but on
the slope after the World Cup.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.720
And that's why I got
the spot, because nobody

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.670
wanted to race there.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.630
Yeah, it's true.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.510
And then what
should I have done?

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.500
Then I took it.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.440
I took the spot, and I went
there with my last bib.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.780
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.850
Like we watched that video these
days, and we laughed so hard.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:09.470
But actually, it's not funny,
because I was completely out

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:10.370
of control.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.440
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.050
My skis were just going
down the hill with me,

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.420
and somehow, I ended
up on second place.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.070
Nobody knows why.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.780
But it saved my career.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.490
So would I do it like that?

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:23.990
No.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.630
That's why I
accompany my sister,

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:30.060
because I don't want her to
get in the same situations.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.860
And because I was so much
back in the whole development,

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:39.110
I had that knife on my throat
for a very long time, then

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:42.110
with the first World Cup race,
first world championships,

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.040
I felt I had to medal.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.090
I was there.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.390
And I felt like a
complete failure

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.240
when I was 22 years
old, and I didn't medal

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.790
at the World Championships.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.530
And that was the
problem, you know?

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.960
And when you're young, you
get in these situations,

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.222
and of course, now I'm
30 plus, and I look back.

00:44:00.222 --> 00:44:02.180
And I'm thinking, what
the hell was I thinking?

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.460
It was super irresponsible.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.280
But back then, I
just wanted to race,

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.110
and I would nobody let take
that chance away from me.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.290
And I was lucky enough
to have injuries,

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:17.840
which weren't that
serious, which

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.640
helped me extremely
to deal with it,

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.710
because for me, the pain I
felt in my heart and my soul

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.400
when I wasn't able to ski was
always bigger than the pain I

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.880
had in my knees.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.760
And that's why the
choice was pretty easy,

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.350
paired with the naivete
of youth, I'd say.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:42.590
And sometimes, it's good
to be young, you know.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.290
And it's tough, I know.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:47.960
And skiing has
horrible accidents.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:53.900
And for the whole
community, it was just--

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:57.030
it was-- black days
what happened last year.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.540
We lost two colleagues
on the slopes.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:05.210
And I mean, I would not
think about that every day,

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:09.380
I must admit, before, that this
was really possible, because we

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:14.450
didn't have deathly
injuries in decades.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:15.620
And now we had two.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.380
And it's a slam in
your face, and you

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.220
start to think different.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:24.410
And I hope that we will be
able to support our athletes

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:28.640
in a way that we don't have
to put them in situations

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.480
like I was, that they just
have a better build up,

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.240
because you only get
in situations like that

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:40.395
if the ladder is somehow broken.

00:45:40.395 --> 00:45:41.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.040
DOMINIQUE GISIN:
Yes, because if you

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.240
look today at Giulia Steingruber
or Ilaria Kaslin, the gymnasts,

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:51.870
or also Simone Biles, for those
who don't know the Swiss ones,

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.510
if I look at them, I think
they're completely nuts.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:59.050
I mean, if I would try to do
that, I would die for sure,

00:45:59.050 --> 00:45:59.780
right?

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.840
But they were build up
like that for decades,

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.990
and their bodies were
built to learn that.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:09.440
But you can only do that if
you do that in tiny steps.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.490
So I think it's super important
to have support systems, where

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:15.710
the athletes can
develop in a way

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.497
where you don't put them
in situations like that.

00:46:19.497 --> 00:46:20.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:28.280
AUDIENCE: Equal opportunity,
equal pay between genders,

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:32.480
but also cultural background
is a big topic in our industry,

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.200
many other industries as well.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.350
I'm wondering,
what's the situation

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.780
in professional
skiing and how do

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:44.480
organizations like Sporthilfe
tackle the problem?

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.830
DOMINIQUE GISIN: Yes, of course.

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:49.010
It's a big issue, and
especially, as a woman,

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:52.010
I feel it's an important issue.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.800
I think we all
work the same way,

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.380
we should get paid the same way.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:01.550
I'm lucky enough to come
from a sport which is pretty

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.980
big in female, just like male.

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:08.360
We have years already,
10, 15 years back,

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:13.040
where the international
TV quotes were better

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.900
at the women's races
than at the men's.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.030
I don't think there are
many sports like that.

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:21.020
So we had years where there
were more spectators worldwide

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.600
for the women's races
than the men's races.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.880
I was once at World
Championships.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:30.080
I loved it, where
the women's downhill

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.310
was the most important race,
because Anja Parson was

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:38.870
a legend and a hero in Sweden.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.930
And the women's downhill
was on a Sunday.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:47.000
So I think we are in skiing
at a very lucky position,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.980
compared to other sports.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:53.060
But I think we all have
to work towards that,

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.950
and we can only work
towards that as a community,

00:47:55.950 --> 00:48:00.500
and that's, for me, something
that's super crucial, something

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.200
which should be natural,
but also something

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.650
that will take some time.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:11.360
I think we have to keep the
patience, and at the same time,

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.320
never lose the goal
out of our minds,

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.660
and of course, an
organization like us is not

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.180
making any difference.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.580
That is sure the
first big thing,

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:27.120
because for us, there is no
difference in women's and men's

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.010
athletes.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.100
And I think in the future,
it will be like that.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.740
But we also have to
admit that, as I said,

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:38.050
there are still differences
in numbers of athletes.

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:42.400
So we need more girls in
sports, and that's also

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:48.400
something which we have to bring
into the minds of the parents.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.940
That's why all the support
that Sporthilfe is providing

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.930
is super important also for the
society, because in the end,

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:59.950
it's the parents who decide
if their kids are getting

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.780
into professional sports.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:06.520
And if the parents are afraid
of the risk over an injury

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.520
or afraid of the risk off of
what this means financially

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.310
to their kids in
the future, then we

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:18.290
will not get a lot of kids into
sports, be it male or female.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.520
So we have to find a way
to support the athletes

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.890
in a proper way, such that--

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:26.080
I mean, I hear parents saying--

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.910
and I have to say it in German.

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.450
Forgive me.

00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:33.520
[GERMAN] something--

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.550
I don't know the English word.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:40.480
Solid, yeah, a solid profession.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.650
I feel offended by that.

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:43.450
I mean, sorry.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:48.400
If a professional athlete who
is amongst the top 30 in what he

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.630
is doing of all world, if that
is not a solid profession,

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.930
I don't know what is, you know?

00:49:55.930 --> 00:50:00.320
And you create a value that is
so important for the society.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.730
And if we still have
parents who think that,

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:07.090
then we have to work,
because we should

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:10.300
work that they think
it's a solid profession,

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.180
be it for a girl or for a boy.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.080
Yeah.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.985
SPEAKER 1: What advice would you
give to your 14-year-old self?

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.810
DOMINIQUE GISIN: Yeah,
when you look back,

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.660
you're always smarter, they say.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.530
I wouldn't change too much.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:29.460
I probably would try
to take away the knife

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.870
from the throat in my mind
a little more, because I

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:37.395
had much more time than
I thought I have left.

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.970
But that's only possible
with the experience.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:46.140
So if I would be 14 , again I
probably would do it all over

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.200
and just hope that I
wouldn't get injured so much,

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.580
maybe change some of--

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.300
yeah.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:57.120
No, I mean in the retrospect,
if you're just smarter.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:03.570
But I don't feel I made
a really bad decision.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:07.350
And it also ended
up here, you know?

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:11.320
And I got to do so many things,
only because I got injured.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.220
I would never have gotten
into flying if I would not

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:16.710
have gotten injured,
because I just went

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:19.740
to do it because I was injured.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.820
And then I had spare time
because school was a bit boring

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.010
without having the sports side.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:27.090
And I went into flying.

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:30.390
And now I'm a pilot,
and it's amazing.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.910
So everything is going
as it should, and I'm

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:34.360
super happy with my life.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:40.710
So I would just say go for
it to my 14-year-old self.

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:42.420
AUDIENCE: What triggers you?

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:48.330
Competitors, your own will, or
refuse from somebody that you

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:50.190
cannot do this?

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:52.380
What is the trigger for you?

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:55.950
DOMINIQUE GISIN: My
trigger was always

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:57.876
finding my own boundaries.

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:05.790
I love the feeling when your
body is doing exactly what it

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:09.690
should do, when you trained
for something for four years,

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:14.430
and then you ski down the slope,
and every single movement, even

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:17.460
of your little toe
is just perfectly,

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.290
and you're exactly
in the moment.

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:22.380
You also have those
times where you work,

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.800
and four hours later, you
realize four hours passed,

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.080
and they just went by, right?

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.560
And I feel like these moments
when I'm completely myself

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.900
and completely there,
they are so valuable.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:38.520
And I always experienced
that when I really push

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.310
my boundaries, and
I got to a place,

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:43.500
where I just have to
function, and I cannot--

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.320
I don't have the
extra amount of energy

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.390
left to think about what I do.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:50.410
I just have to do it.

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:54.390
So for me, it was always
about experiencing

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:59.130
those moments, where
I'm at my absolute best,

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:05.970
or at my absolute max, where I
just perform at my max level.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:09.960
And that's something which kept
me going through times where

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:13.240
I had no podiums,
because as I said before,

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.320
when you don't start, you
will not get a podium.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.890
But it was also something that
maybe shortened my career,

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:25.650
because in the end, I could not
get motivated by adding more

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:29.970
victories to the board when
I was not finding something

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:32.310
to push my limits further.

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.010
And just to stay where
I was at and to stay

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:38.250
at the level I was at and
wait for more victories

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:43.500
and for more medals, it was not
something that triggered me.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.890
But as you pointed
out, pretty subtle,

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.600
I think it's something
very important

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.090
that everybody has
their own trigger.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:53.130
And it's super important
to know your triggers,

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:56.470
because it's what gets
you up in the morning.

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:59.520
So be aware of what gets
you up in the morning,

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.080
helps you to get
up in the morning.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.170
[LAUGHS]

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:06.246
AUDIENCE: Do you feel still the
fire inside you to this topic?

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.260
DOMINIQUE GISIN: I will always
feel the fire about skiing.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.990
And now it's not anymore about
skiing fast down the hill.

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:21.200
But it's about the powder days
and just enjoying those turns,

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.260
when I'm just--

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:25.610
and I always ski
with people, or most

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:28.910
time, I ski with
people that are better

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:33.680
than I am in powder skiing,
and that pushes me extremely.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.290
And then I'm, again,
in a situation

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:41.600
where I have to really be at my
max to just cope up with them.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.650
And that's, again,
this amazing feeling.

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:51.750
And other areas of my life,
I'm still far away from my max,

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:52.250
I think.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:55.290
I'm far away from
being my max pilot.

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:59.480
I'm far away of
being my max CEO.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:03.290
So I'm really looking forward
to challenge myself every day

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:07.320
and to hopefully, experience
that fire in those areas just

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:07.820
as well.

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:13.340
But it would be crazy
to expect the same fire,

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:17.240
because it was an extremely
big fire that kept me going.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.770
So I have to be thankful
to have other fires.

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:24.150
SPEAKER 1: I think that's
all we have time for.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.190
Thank you so much.

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:28.190
I think it's so easy to
see a profile like yours

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:32.870
and be intimidated and
think, what have I done,

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:35.870
but to leave after your
talk feeling so inspired

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:37.580
and seeing how
incredible you are.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.260
Thank you so much
for taking the time

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:41.360
to share all your
stories with us,

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.770
answer all of our questions.

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:44.057
We really appreciate it.

00:55:44.057 --> 00:55:45.890
DOMINIQUE GISIN: Well,
thank you, everybody,

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:51.740
for giving me so much
attention and for also thinking

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.540
about amazing questions.

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.600
I think we had some questions
today that I never had before,

00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:01.320
so that's always
very, very valuable.

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.920
And also never be intimidated.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:10.190
I feel like every single
one is doing their path,

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:13.100
and I'm amazed by what
you guys are doing.

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.850
I mean, if I see my
colleagues at ETH programming,

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:20.710
and I'm still hawk, You have
you ever seen hawk programming?

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:24.460
Like it's not that bad.

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:25.890
It got better.

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:31.460
But I always felt
like 10 code lines

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:38.850
for me were like 3,000 for
my colleague's students.

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:41.330
So that is amazing to me.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:46.280
And that's what it's all about,
like finding your own limits

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:50.900
in your own path with your own
fires, with your own triggers,

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:54.210
and really leave your
trail wherever it is.

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:59.060
So I think that's something
that each and every one of us

00:56:59.060 --> 00:56:59.690
can do.

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:02.510
I don't feel it's super special.

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:05.600
Each and every one has
super special things.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.080
So go for it.

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.090
Tell your 14 year
old, go for it.

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:13.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:17.740
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.
