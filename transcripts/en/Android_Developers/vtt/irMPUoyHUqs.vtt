MATTEO VALLONE: My
name is Matteo Vallone,

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.690
and I work in apps and games
business development team.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.190
And in my day to day job I
work with both apps and games

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.992
developers.

00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:09.825
So I thought it would
be interesting for you

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.430
as app developers
to learn more about

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.130
what successful games
developers care about.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.650
And not only that, I will
try to extrapolate some rules

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.530
that you can apply in
your day to day job.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.590
And, also, I will
show some examples

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.450
of how these rules have been
applied by apps developers.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.410
But before that I want to spend
some time talking about why

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.480
we think games and
apps should learn

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.320
from each other-- what are
the relevant things that they

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.230
have in common.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.820
But I don't want to
oversimplify this.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.140
Actually, I want to address
the elephant in the room

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.020
right away.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.760
It's much more difficult to
make money on apps than games.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.750
We all know that.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.590
And it's not only because
it's generally more accepted

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.960
to pay for games than apps,
but also because games

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.450
have much more flexibility
in their mechanics

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.460
and what they can do to
actually monetize users.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.870
They're also selling
virtual goods.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.280
So there's endless
possibilities what they can sell

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.606
and the price points
they can put together.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:11.980
So they basically
can do whatever

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.270
they want in terms of
selling virtual currencies

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.220
or virtual goods in a game.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.790
For apps that's not possible.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.430
But the math is always the same.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.310
Apps and games, in
both cases, the model--

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.220
the dominant model--
is the freemium model.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.490
That means that this
equation on the right

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.740
here, that is always true.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.140
CPI, cost per install,
for your installs

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.570
should always be lower than
the lifetime value of the users

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.260
that you're bringing in.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.730
And that means that
in a world where

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.560
CPI is rising
because there's more

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.670
competition for servicability,
for user acquisition,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.200
in order to make
this function work

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.990
you really need to focus on the
right side of this equation.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.150
And lifetime value is a function
of retention, engagement,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.310
and conversion,
and monetization.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.100
But it all starts with
retention because that's

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.840
what drives engagement.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.880
That's a measure of
engagement, and that's

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.526
what drives monetization.

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:14.770
So retention is king.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.790
This data from a mobile
intelligence company, Quettra,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.190
show how, actually, this is
so important for both apps

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.120
and games.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.640
Here you see a comparison
of retention curves of apps

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.700
based on Google
Play Store ranking.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.600
Here you see that the top
games and the top apps,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.140
they all have better
retention than the ones below.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.570
So even if the curves are
a little bit different,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.030
games tend to have
shorter term retention

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.120
because they are less-- they
have less longevity than apps.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.060
In general this is always true.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.079
So it's not only something
that games developers

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.870
should care about--
also apps should really

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.400
care about retention.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.100
And going a bit further in
retention, the key metric

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.540
that you should
look at when you try

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.850
to optimize your
long-term retention

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.570
is frequency, because
that shows how many times

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.540
a user comes back to your app.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.010
If users come back
to your app often,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.010
chances are they will
get hooked by it.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.710
They will make it part
of their daily routine.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.500
That means they will be retained
and they will become your users

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.770
forever, hopefully.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.390
This graphic shows
how different apps

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.010
category and games
genre have-- they

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.379
are mapped along two metrics.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.420
One is the frequency per
week-- so how many times

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.650
a user visits on average
those apps in a week.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.410
And the day 90 retention--
so the long-term retention,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.810
the end of that curve
that I showed before.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.220
You see that, while they are
different-- it depends on where

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.730
you are in this category--
there is a direct correlation

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.750
between the two.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.420
All right.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.530
So retention is king.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.340
And games know this very well.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.480
They spend a lot of time
optimizing for that,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.554
and you see how--

00:03:58.554 --> 00:03:59.220
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.303
-The icon needs to appeal.

00:04:00.303 --> 00:04:01.704
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:03.150
MATTEO VALLONE: Sorry.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.360
You see how pretty much every
successful game developer--

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.490
and there are a few
highlighted here--

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.330
they tend to before launching
a new game to the public,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.190
they do what we
call soft launching.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.050
They pick a test market
or a beta community,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.779
and they spend a lot of
time optimizing their game,

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.920
tweaking it to the point where
the retention figures are

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.910
satisfactory.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.660
And this process requires
a lot of discipline.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.780
A lot of games get killed
during this process.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.680
But it also ensures that
they invest resources

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.000
in the right product that
actually has a chance

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.920
to be successful and
where that equation

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.410
that I showed you before works.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.540
If you don't do this
already, retention

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.280
can be measured very easily
through Google Play-- so sorry,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.592
through Google Analytics.

00:04:49.592 --> 00:04:51.050
And this is the
report that you can

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.020
look at that shows on the
top, your retention curve.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.200
This is your app
retention curve.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.870
And also, it shows a
breakdown of retention figures

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.170
by cores of users that install
the app in a given day.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.070
So you can also optimize and
see how it impacts retention.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.570
All right.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.160
So now let's talk
about some things

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.640
that you can actually
learn from the games world

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.990
and apply in your
day to day job.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.960
The first one is focusing
on engagement cliff.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.360
This is very important.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.080
And I'm showing you again the
chart with retention figures

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.330
because there's something
else that can be noted here.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.060
You see how in each
case regardless

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.590
of how successful the
app is, most of the users

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.870
are lost in the
first seven days.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.890
That's where everyone loses.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.910
And actually, the
top apps are the ones

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.940
that are doing a
better job, especially

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.650
in the first seven days.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.930
After that the curves tend
to flatten for everyone,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.740
so there's not much difference
between different apps.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.700
But those first seven
days are critical.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.080
Here you see on the right an
average day seven retention.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.210
So after those seven
days, how many users

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.020
are still in the app
for different categories

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.630
on average.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.950
Again, this is Quettra data.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.340
And you see how it varies
between 40% and 15%.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.610
That means that, on
average, 60% to 85% of users

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.630
are lost in those
first seven days.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.809
And that's because users
need to try an app.

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:24.850
They install a lot of
apps, but then they try it.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.850
And in those first few
days they actually decide

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.410
whether they want to still use
it, or just leave it there.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.140
Once they decide, once
the app is good enough,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.980
then chances are the
users will stick.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.820
And actually, that's why
the curves flattens here.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.860
But those first seven
days are critical.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.310
Games know this very well.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.740
In a game onboarding
is quite challenging.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.280
You have to teach a user new
rules, new mechanics, why

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.260
you should care, what is
the story, lots of things.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.720
So it all starts
with a tutorial.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.800
And I want to show you
an excerpt of a video

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.460
that we recently shot with
a very successful game

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.770
developer called Pixelberry
that has a great completion

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.140
rate for its tutorial.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.020
70% of people that
actually start a tutorial

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.160
go through each section
of the tutorial.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.384
So let's play the video
and we'll comment that.

00:07:12.384 --> 00:07:13.050
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.380
-Players coming in, we hit
them with story right away.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.120
And we try and do
it in a way where

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.420
it's a little more natural.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.020
We are cognizant that a
lot of people playing games

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.190
on mobile phones may not
want to read too much text,

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.620
so we try to ease
players into that.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.190
But by the time they
finish our tutorial,

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.060
we're hoping that
they're already caught up

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.370
in the lives of these
characters and they

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.161
want to learn more
about their back stories

00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:38.190
and what's going on.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.466
-I think it is
important to give people

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:41.840
kind of that sense
of progression

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.840
in a game-- especially
in mobile games.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.754
Because I think that
in a lot of games

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:47.920
that you can reach a certain
point where you're just

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.740
repeating the same actions, and
you want to feel like you're

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.905
doing something different.

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:54.030
And I think story is a
great way of differentiating

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.940
that and saying, oh, now you're
dealing with a new villain,

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.207
or now you're dealing with
a new issue that's come up.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.520
MATTEO VALLONE: So they
talk about two key things.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.810
One is the story-- they
use story to hook players

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.780
right away, and
they rely on that

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.580
to make sure that it's
compelling for the user

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.660
to stick around for
the whole tutorial.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.887
The other thing they talk
about is progression.

00:08:13.887 --> 00:08:15.470
Progression is very
important in games

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.380
because, if you think about it,
the game is always presenting

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.490
you with a new challenge.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.260
If you get a sense
of progression,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.180
you keep playing the game--
otherwise it gets boring.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.222
Those challenges shouldn't
be too challenging,

00:08:26.222 --> 00:08:27.430
otherwise you leave the game.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.180
So it's always finding
the right balance

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.460
between making you stick around
to play the next challenge,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.750
but it's not too
difficult for you.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.020
And I actually want to show
you this concept of progression

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.970
and onboarding goes beyond a
tutorial with the other example

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.220
of Playdots, another very
successful game developer.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.930
This is a chart that
shows all their levels.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.650
They are mapped
along two metrics--

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.250
one is revenue per
player in that level,

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.640
and lapse rate-- how many people
left the game in that level.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.640
By tweaking the difficulty
level and the experience

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.940
in the levels that are
below the red lines,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.170
for the under-performing
ones, they actually

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.380
managed to improve
not only retention

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.270
but also average
revenue per paying user.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.400
So again, the message
here is-- this

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.590
is very specific to
games, of course--

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.110
but the message is it's not
only about the tutorial,

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.060
it's about how you
communicate and foster a sense

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.310
of progression within the game.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.810
OK.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:30.780
Let's try to extrapolate
some rules for apps now.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.020
The important thing here is
that in the first seven days

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.680
there is an engagement cliff.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.680
The user is presented
with a new app.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.980
They have to understand how it
works and start playing with it

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.200
and understand the value.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.620
And you want to ease that
cliff as much as possible

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.050
to help them going
through those seven days

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.260
to the point where they
will probably stick around.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.940
So the first thing
to do is finding

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.307
features that provide
value to the user

00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:58.390
without asking much from
them-- something that you

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.430
can show them and they
can experience right away.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.640
And after that you need to
understand the activation

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.140
moments.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.600
What are the key things that
you want the user to do in order

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.120
to fully experience your app and
that requires some engagement

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.980
some commitment?

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.970
For example, creating an
account, uploading a video,

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.410
finding some friends, adding
some preferences-- something

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.800
that personalizes and
makes the experience deeper

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.470
but requires also some
actions from the user.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.940
And you should present
those things gradually.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.280
You should help them going
through each one of them

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.450
step by step instead
of overwhelming them

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.910
with everything
at the same time.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.500
As a consequence,
also, part of that

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.430
is that you should manage
the appearance of pay walls,

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.450
especially in those
first few days.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.480
You don't want to scare
people off or overwhelm them

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.990
with the requirements.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.270
So that's the general rule.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.470
And something that can
help you optimizing

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.130
your app along this
rule is the flow report

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.140
in Google Analytics.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.070
This shows you how
users, on average,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.940
move between different
screens in your app.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.750
You can see the path they take.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.640
And more importantly,
with the red lines here

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.252
you can see where they
get out of the app.

00:11:12.252 --> 00:11:13.460
What are the friction points?

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.620
What are the roadblocks?

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.790
And potentially remove some
of them, if it makes sense.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.880
So very useful report to use.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.040
And I want to show you
an example of an app that

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.860
did a great job applying
these rules recently

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.990
when they redesigned
their own boarding flow.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.320
Overall they achieved
20% better day

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.170
seven retention, which
is a great figure.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.020
The way they did it is that--
first of all, let's talk

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.700
about dating sites and apps.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.760
They require a lot of things to
set up before you can actually

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.720
enjoy and use that dating app.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.020
You have to create an account.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.811
You have to write
something about yourself.

00:11:49.811 --> 00:11:52.680
You have to start answering
some questions about yourself,

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.040
liking some people,
and uploading

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.030
a photo-- a lot of things to
do before you can actually

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.480
use the app.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.090
They redesigned their onboarding
to make it more gradual

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.320
and step by step.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.190
And I'll show you
what I mean exactly.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.250
First of all, this is
what they had before.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.890
They required you to write
an essay about yourself,

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.110
upload a photo,
answer some questions,

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.170
and like some people all
together in the same section

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.700
of the app and with a
series of modal windows

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.840
with no clear sequencing.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.592
So the user felt a bit
overwhelmed and like, oh, wow,

00:12:23.592 --> 00:12:26.050
there's a lot of things that
I have to do before I can even

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.030
use this app.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.720
And if you see on
the right, that's

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.150
just answering the questions.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.070
Even when you go in
one of the tasks,

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.880
it feels quite
overwhelming because you

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.440
have to do-- it's
not that engaging

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.810
and there's a lot of things
you have to go through.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.220
So this is how it looks
after the redesign.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.200
The first thing you see
when you download the app

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.090
is five questions
about yourself.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.680
It's very easy to
go through them.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.790
Right, yes.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.180
You swipe right, it's yes.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.350
Swipe left, it's no.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.930
Once you finish
that, then you're

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.520
only then asked
to upload a photo.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.420
If you want, you can skip this.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.700
So you can enjoy the
app even if you don't

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.160
want to upload a photo now.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.790
But that's the only thing
you need to care about.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.580
After that, then you can
start enjoying the app.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.010
And you are also
reminded of other things

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.570
that you should be doing in
order to fully experience

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.880
the app, but it's
just a call to action,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.557
and you can do it
whenever you want.

00:13:16.557 --> 00:13:17.890
And again, this is step by step.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.070
Once you do this, then they push
you another other action to do.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:25.810
So it goes from a very
low engagement, very easy

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.520
to go to tasks, to a bit more
complex once you actually

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.830
start enjoying the app.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.110
All right.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.560
So now, users have
decided to stick around.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.220
You've done a great job of
onboarding and communicating

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.470
that sense of progression.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.780
Well, let's talk about
how you can monetize them.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.550
I want to talk about
how games look at this.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.930
Even the most successful
games, no matter

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.830
what you do a big
percentage of users

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.680
will never spend a
dime in that game,

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.400
and games developers
are cognizant of that.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.816
The key thing there is
identifying as soon as possible

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:03.440
the users that are
more likely to spend

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.050
and start targeting them.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.360
And even then, once you identify
the people that are actually

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.840
going to spend, understanding
how much they are

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.350
willing to spend
is really powerful

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.320
because different users will
have different propensity

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.350
to buy-- and targeting them
with a different experience

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.450
or different offers
is where you can

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.910
optimize much more than applying
a one size fits all approach.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.405
I want to show you who
does a great job of this.

00:14:30.405 --> 00:14:33.450
This is Space Ape, a
successful game developer.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.620
Their games are Samurai
Siege and Rival Kingdom.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.260
What they do here is
they segment users

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.430
based on the first
seven day behavior.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.510
And they calculate, they
predict the lifetime

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.190
value of each user based on the
way they engage with the game.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.380
And also they tag them with
different spend patterns

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.500
the way they spend and buy
things within the game.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.260
And then they start
targeting these users

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.740
with different offers.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.322
Let me show how it works.

00:15:02.322 --> 00:15:03.280
Here are all the users.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.980
They're hitting
Space Ape servers.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.680
Space Ape starts analyzing
them, and then they're

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.190
assigned to a segment.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.740
Here they have five segments.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.300
I want to show you
just two as an example.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.535
One is predicted to have
a medium lifetime value,

00:15:17.535 --> 00:15:18.910
but the pattern
here is that they

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:24.650
spend a lot in one single
chance, in one single purchase,

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.880
and then they tend not to
spend too much too often.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.790
The other group is higher
actually lifetime value.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.660
But in a single spend
they spend less,

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.840
even if they are predicting
that over time these users are

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.720
spending more-- in
a single spend point

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.430
they tend to spend less but
the frequency will be higher.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.640
So then they expose them
to different offers,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.810
different bundles of items--
where the medium lifetime

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.360
value with a high single
spend point and low

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.470
spend frequency sees a very
big bundle with lots of stuff

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.000
in it, quite expensive.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.680
But it's just buy it once and
probably you never come back.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.400
You're going to use it
for the rest of the game.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.990
While the medium spend
point sees a smaller

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.570
a bundle, cheaper,
but probably you're

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.050
going to come back and buy more.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.730
So that's very powerful.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.270
And if you want to
extrapolate a rule for it

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.370
from for the apps
world is you first,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.280
though, have to realize that
different users are going

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.240
to want something
different from your app--

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.220
and especially they will
have a different value

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.880
perception and a different
propensity to spend.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.680
And if you can identify
them and target them

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.019
with a different offer that is
more customized around that,

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:35.310
that's where you can optimize
your conversion much more

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:35.809
effectively.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.620
A tool that you can use to
start learning about your users

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.130
and how the different
segments behave and start

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.130
thinking about what
you can actually

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.410
do to tailor their experience
is again Google Analytics.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.460
This is the segment
builder in Analytics.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.420
It lets you create segments
with lots of options.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.720
I want to show you
just the behavior

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.130
category of those options.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.660
You have sessions, days
since last session,

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.980
transactions, and
session duration--

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.640
so you can create a segment
based on that for example.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.210
And here we have two groups--
one is highly engaged people,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.430
and the other one is
less engaged users.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.650
And those segments
will then be exposed

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.480
in pretty much every report
that is in Google Analytics.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.470
So, for example, this
is the revenue report,

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.589
and you see, instead of
one line for revenues

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.030
you see revenues for highly
engaged users and revenues

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.510
for less engaged users.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.760
So you can really start
understanding how they behave

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.190
and what is bringing
you each segment.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.700
Who does a great job in the apps
world targeting different users

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.760
with different value
proposition is Wish.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.910
It's an e-commerce app.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.750
And very simply,
they have a group

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.550
of people that are less engaged
and one is more engaged.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.910
To the less engaged
people, the feed

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.330
of products that
they recommend is

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.740
less expensive because it
requires less commitment

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.140
and less engagement to actually
think of purchasing them.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.600
Well, once they see more
engagement and some conversion,

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.210
they start recommending
more expensive products.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.640
So quite simple, but it lead
to 10% better conversion just

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.760
by doing that.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.260
All right.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:16.790
The last one I want to
show is selling umbrellas

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:17.990
where and when it rains.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.880
This is how you sell products
instead of what you sell.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.600
If you look at this
screenshot from Pretty Simple,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.080
another game developer--
Pretty Simple Games--

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.480
they made an art, not only
a science, out of this.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.760
And I want to show
you an example of how

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.184
this can be really optimized.

00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:38.850
Playdots-- again,
they are the developer

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.670
we talked about before
with the progression chart,

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.740
they also redesigned
their purchase flow

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.170
across the whole game.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.070
And overall they achieve
10% better revenue

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.701
per active user, which is
a big number because it's

00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:56.950
for all users, including the
ones that are not paying.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.280
So overall, 10% revenue per
user is quite an achievement.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.790
And I'll show you a couple
of examples of what they did.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.100
The first one is, before
you start a level,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.070
you see a card that shows you
some stats of what you have,

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.100
and it prompts you to
buy things that you

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.710
might need in that level.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.380
It's not the whole
store, it just

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.970
prompts you to buy specific
things-- in this case

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.690
it's boxes-- that you might
need in that specific level.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.590
And similarly, when
you die in a level--

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.670
basically you run out of
moves-- the first thing

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.820
you see is a button that
lets you buy extra moves that

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.570
lets you finish that level.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.700
Instead of starting
over again and just

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.460
going back to the
store and buying those,

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.720
you can buy them now and
keep playing the level.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.150
By doing this, they obtained
6% more paying users

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.924
just by adding these
two call to actions.

00:19:50.924 --> 00:19:53.090
The other thing they did,
they moved some products--

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.050
some in-app products--
within the game experience.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:01.510
So instead of having them
exposed in the store only,

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.160
they also highlight them
on the bottom of the game.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.204
So whenever you want
while you're playing,

00:20:07.204 --> 00:20:08.120
you can purchase them.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.020
And it's one tap.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.960
This led to 5% better ARPU.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.390
Overall, if we want to simplify
and generalize this for apps,

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.560
it's about selling umbrellas
where and when it rains.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:26.180
It's not only making purchasing
accessible and easy for users

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:31.030
so that it's as close as
possible to their experiences--

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.820
one tap away or two taps away.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.230
But also triggering
some call to actions

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.400
when and where it's very
relevant, that specific product

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.342
that you're selling.

00:20:41.342 --> 00:20:45.230
Who does a great job at this
in the apps world is TomTom.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.770
They recently moved from
premium to freemium,

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.880
and they sold 2.4 times
more paying users.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.120
And that's because they
moved in the right way.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.370
They actually thought
about their business model

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.770
and how they could
sell upgrade to premium

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:01.990
in a very clever way.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.000
I want to show you how.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.460
The model is that you have
75 kilometers for free.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.220
You can use the app
for 75 kilometers

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.760
and you don't have to pay.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.720
It's a real metering model.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.150
It's real meters.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:19.150
And then you can upgrade
to one year or three year

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.470
subscriptions.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.550
And the first thing
they did is that they

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.320
made that upgrade bottom
always available there.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.750
It's on the bottom of the app.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.458
Wherever you are in
the app you see that.

00:21:28.458 --> 00:21:30.640
It's one tap away--
you can upgrade.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.860
And you also see the countdown--
how many kilometres for free

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:34.760
you still have.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.390
So 75, 74, 73-- you
see the progression

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.487
and you know when you
need to hit that button.

00:21:40.487 --> 00:21:43.070
The other thing they did-- very
similarly to the other example

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.900
I showed you-- they
trigger some call to action

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.170
when it's quite relevant.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.411
For example, if you
start a new trip,

00:21:49.411 --> 00:21:50.910
they know that
you're probably going

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.390
to run out of kilometres
because that trip is quite long

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.830
and you only have 40
kilometers, for example.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.475
They trigger a call
to action that says

00:21:58.475 --> 00:21:59.860
do you want to upgrade now.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.480
It's better,
probably, because you

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.210
don't want to upgrade
when you're driving

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.590
or you might not have a
connection or you're abroad.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:11.300
So things like that they also
trigger a call to action when

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.030
you're actually running
out of kilometers

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.210
and when you run
out of kilometres.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.650
But the point here is that it's
relevant and it's easy to do it

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.340
and I understand why
I should purchase

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.261
the upgrade in this moment.

00:22:24.261 --> 00:22:24.760
All right.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.790
To wrap up, the
rules are three-- one

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.800
is addressing the onboarding
as an engagement cliff.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:37.080
And so, start by analyzing your
day one to day seven retention

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.500
figures in Analytics.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.540
And thinking about
activation moments that

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.480
are gradually more
invested for the user,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.400
and how you can introduce
them in the app.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.110
The second one is embracing
your apps multiple personality

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.400
disorder-- so understanding
that different users want

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.066
different things and
you can target them

00:22:51.066 --> 00:22:54.780
with different ways, especially
when it comes to in-app offers

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.900
and propensity to buy.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.450
And the third one is about
not only what you sell,

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.870
but how you sell it.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.950
And we say that it's
like selling umbrellas

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.160
where and when it rains.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.550
Make it easy for people to
buy, but also very relevant,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.310
and triggering
call to action when

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:16.520
you think the most chances are
that the user will convert.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.410
So, thank you for
listening today.
