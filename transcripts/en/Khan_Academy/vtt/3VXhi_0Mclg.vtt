00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.511
- So, we've defined two
random variables here.

00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:05.673
The first random variable X

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:07.367
is the weight of the cereal

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:11.393
in a random box of our
favorite cereal, Mathies,

00:00:11.393 --> 00:00:14.804
a random closed box of our
favorite cereal, Mathies.

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:16.599
And we know a few other things about it.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.849
We know what the expected value of X is,

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.714
it is equal to 16 ounces.

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:24.907
In fact, they tell it to us on a box,

00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:27.109
they say, you know, net weight, 16 ounces.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.812
Now, when you see that on a cereal box,

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:30.224
it doesn't mean that every box

00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:32.774
is going to be exactly 16 ounces.

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:35.800
Remember you have a discrete
number of these flakes in here,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.608
they might have slightly
different densities,

00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:38.695
slightly different shapes

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:41.689
depending how they get
packed into this volume,

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.218
so there is some variation

00:00:43.218 --> 00:00:45.774
which you can measure
with standard deviation.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:47.272
So, the standard deviation,

00:00:47.272 --> 00:00:48.816
let's just say for the sake of argument,

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:51.682
for the random variable X is

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:55.258
0.8 ounces

00:00:55.258 --> 00:00:56.757
and just to build our intuition

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:58.053
a little bit later in this video,

00:00:58.053 --> 00:01:00.677
let's say that this,
the random variable X,

00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:04.097
is always stays
constrained within a range,

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.619
that if it goes above a certain weight

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:06.920
or below a certain weight,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.254
then the company that produces
it just throws out that box.

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:12.474
And so, let's say that
our random variable X

00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:16.428
is always greater than
or equal to 15 ounces

00:01:16.428 --> 00:01:19.157
and it is always less than
or equal to 17 ounces,

00:01:19.157 --> 00:01:20.401
just for argument.

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.403
This'll help us build
our intuition later on.

00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:24.147
Now, separately,

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:25.369
let's consider a bowl,

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.883
we're always gonna consider
the same size bowl,

00:01:27.883 --> 00:01:30.440
let's consider just a four ounce bowl

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.107
because the expected value of Y,

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:36.100
if you took a random one of these bowls,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.630
always the same bowl,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.102
or if you took the same bowl

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:41.765
and someone filled it with Mathies,

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:46.052
the expected weight of
the Mathies in that bowl

00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:48.796
is going to be four ounces.

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:50.058
But once again,

00:01:50.058 --> 00:01:51.951
there's going to be some variation,

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:54.158
depends who filled it
in, how it packed in,

00:01:54.158 --> 00:01:56.758
did they shake it while
they were filling it?

00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:57.880
There could be all sorts of things

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.556
that could make some variation here.

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:00.828
And so, for the sake of argument,

00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:02.393
let's say that variation can be measured

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:05.756
by standard deviation, it's 0.6 ounces.

00:02:05.756 --> 00:02:07.648
And let's say whoever
the bowl fillers are,

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:08.645
they are also,

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:11.819
they don't like bowls that
are too heavy or too light,

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.288
and so they'll also throw out bowls,

00:02:13.288 --> 00:02:16.744
so we can say that Y can,

00:02:16.744 --> 00:02:19.042
its maximum value that it'll ever take on

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:20.613
is five ounces

00:02:20.613 --> 00:02:22.413
and the minimum value that
it could ever take on,

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:24.984
let's say, it is three ounces.

00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:26.478
So, given all of this information,

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:28.046
what I wanna do is

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:31.076
let's just say I take
a random box of Mathies

00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:33.350
and I take a random filled bowl,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.673
and I wanna think about
the combined weight

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:39.063
in the closed box and the filled bowl.

00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:41.678
So, what I wanna think about is, really,

00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:42.511
X plus Y.

00:02:43.607 --> 00:02:47.444
I wanna think about the sum
of the random variables.

00:02:47.444 --> 00:02:48.550
So, in previous videos,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.719
we already know that the
expected value of this

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.955
is just gonna be the sum
of the expected values

00:02:53.955 --> 00:02:56.743
of each of the random variables.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:00.275
So, it would be the expected value of X

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:03.738
plus the expected value of Y,

00:03:03.738 --> 00:03:05.612
and so it'd be 16 plus four ounces,

00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:06.725
in this case,

00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:09.968
this would be equal to 20 ounces.

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:11.907
But what about the variation?

00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:13.919
Can we just add up the
standard deviations?

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.338
If I wanna figure out
the standard deviation

00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:19.959
of X plus Y, how can I do this?

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.088
Well, it turns out that

00:03:22.088 --> 00:03:23.792
you can't just add up
the standard deviations,

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:26.232
but you can add up the variances.

00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:30.162
So, it is the case that
the variance of X plus Y

00:03:30.162 --> 00:03:33.049
is equal to the variance of X

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.270
plus the variance of Y.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.816
And so, this is gonna have
an X right over here, X,

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:42.938
and then we have plus Y and our Y.

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:45.208
And actually, both of these assume

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:46.932
independent random variables.

00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:48.752
So, it assumes,

00:03:48.752 --> 00:03:52.757
assumes X and Y are independent,

00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:54.304
I'm gonna write it in caps.

00:03:54.304 --> 00:03:55.922
In a future video,

00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:58.941
I'm going to give you
hopefully a better intuition

00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:00.717
for why this must be true,

00:04:00.717 --> 00:04:02.243
that they are independent in order to

00:04:02.243 --> 00:04:03.831
make this claim right over here.

00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:05.384
I'm not going to prove it in this video,

00:04:05.384 --> 00:04:08.062
but we could build a
little bit of intuition.

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:11.046
Here, for each of these random variables,

00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:13.417
we have a range of two ounces over which

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:14.724
this random variable can take

00:04:14.724 --> 00:04:16.293
and that's true for both of them.

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:18.293
But what about this sum?

00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:21.199
Well, this sum here

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.577
could get as high as,

00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:25.296
so let me write it this way,

00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:28.971
so X plus Y,

00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:32.636
X plus Y, what's the maximum
value that it could take on?

00:04:32.636 --> 00:04:35.259
Well, if you get a heavy
version of each of these,

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.601
then it's going to be 17 plus five.

00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:40.871
So, this has to be less than 22 ounces,

00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.425
that's going to be
greater than or equal to,

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:44.299
well, what's the lightest
possible scenario?

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:45.875
Well, if you get a 15 ouncer here

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:47.154
and you get a three ouncer here,

00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:49.184
and it is 18 ounces.

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:50.434
And so, notice,

00:04:50.434 --> 00:04:53.975
now, the variation for the sum is larger.

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:56.797
We have a range that this
thing can take on now

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.426
of four while the range for each of these

00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:00.956
was just two.

00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:02.513
Or another way you could think about it is

00:05:02.513 --> 00:05:05.898
these upper and lower ends of the range

00:05:05.898 --> 00:05:08.959
are further from the mean

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:11.755
than these upper and
lower ends of the range

00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:14.286
were from their respective means.

00:05:14.286 --> 00:05:15.702
So, hopefully, this gives you an intuition

00:05:15.702 --> 00:05:17.761
for why this makes sense.

00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:19.247
Let me ask you another question:

00:05:19.247 --> 00:05:21.380
what if I were to say

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.305
what about the variance,

00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:25.987
what about the variance

00:05:25.987 --> 00:05:28.595
of X minus Y?

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:29.428
What would this be?

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:30.756
Would you subtract the variances

00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:33.054
of each of the random variables here?

00:05:33.054 --> 00:05:35.747
Well, let's just do the
exact same exercise.

00:05:35.747 --> 00:05:39.246
Let's take X minus Y,

00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:42.364
X minus Y and think about it.

00:05:42.364 --> 00:05:44.477
What would be the lowest value

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.060
that X minus Y could take on?

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.248
Well, the lowest values,

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.130
if you have a low X

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.058
and you have a high Y,

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:54.246
so it'd be 15 minus five,

00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:56.337
so this would be 10 right over here,

00:05:56.337 --> 00:05:57.866
that would be the lowest value

00:05:57.866 --> 00:05:58.699
that you could take on

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.338
and what would be the highest value?

00:06:00.338 --> 00:06:02.726
Well, the highest values,
if you have a high X

00:06:02.726 --> 00:06:03.707
and a low Y,

00:06:03.707 --> 00:06:05.991
so 17 minus three is 14.

00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:06.949
So, notice,

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.553
just as we saw in this case of the sum,

00:06:09.553 --> 00:06:10.788
even in the difference,

00:06:10.788 --> 00:06:13.490
your variability seems to have increased.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.657
This is still going to be,

00:06:16.687 --> 00:06:19.135
the extremes are still further than

00:06:19.135 --> 00:06:20.927
the mean of the difference,

00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:24.097
the mean of the difference
would be 16 minus four is 12.

00:06:24.097 --> 00:06:27.247
These extreme values are two away from 12.

00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:29.019
And this is just to give us an intuition.

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:31.162
Once again, it's not a rigorous proof.

00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:33.993
So, it actually turns
out that in either case,

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:36.108
when you're taking the
variance of X plus Y

00:06:36.108 --> 00:06:37.837
or X minus Y,

00:06:37.837 --> 00:06:39.813
you would sum the variances

00:06:39.813 --> 00:06:42.985
assuming X and Y are
independent variables.

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:44.070
Now, with that out of the way,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.962
let's just calculate
the standard deviation

00:06:45.962 --> 00:06:47.785
of X plus Y.

00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:49.503
Well, we know this,

00:06:49.503 --> 00:06:52.185
let me just write it
using this sigma notation,

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:54.398
so another way of writing
the variance of X plus Y

00:06:54.398 --> 00:06:56.341
is to write the standard deviation

00:06:56.341 --> 00:06:58.103
of X plus Y squared

00:06:58.103 --> 00:07:01.943
and that's going to be
equal to the variance of X

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:06.422
plus the variance of Y.

00:07:06.422 --> 00:07:08.271
Now, what is the variance of X?

00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:10.597
Well, that's the standard
deviation of X squared,

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.871
0.8 squared,

00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:13.960
this is 0.64,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.459
0.64.

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:19.054
The standard deviation of Y is 0.6,

00:07:19.054 --> 00:07:20.836
you square it to get the variance,

00:07:20.836 --> 00:07:22.958
that's 0.36.

00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.660
You add these two up

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.955
and you are going to get one.

00:07:26.955 --> 00:07:30.246
So, the variance of the sum is one,

00:07:30.246 --> 00:07:32.516
and then if you take the
square root of both of these,

00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:35.031
you get the standard deviation of the sum

00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:37.692
is also going to be one.

00:07:37.692 --> 00:07:39.095
And that just happened to work out

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:41.500
because we're dealing with the
scenario where the variance,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.286
where the square root
of one is, well, one.

00:07:44.286 --> 00:07:46.381
So, this hopefully builds your intuition,

00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:48.677
whether we are adding or subtracting

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:51.220
to independent random variables.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.586
The variance of that
sum or the difference,

00:07:53.586 --> 00:07:55.788
the variability will increase.

00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:56.779
In the next video,

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:58.911
we'll go into some depth talking about

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.607
getting an intuition for why

00:08:00.607 --> 00:08:02.666
independence is an important condition

00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:05.833
for making this statement, this claim.
