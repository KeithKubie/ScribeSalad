you know there are some scientists who

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330
you know there are some scientists who
 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.880
you know there are some scientists who
they sort of get into science

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890
they sort of get into science
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.770
they sort of get into science
accidentally they think they you know

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780
accidentally they think they you know
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.530

or whatever their story is in my case I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
or whatever their story is in my case I
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.529
or whatever their story is in my case I
can't ever remember not wanting to be a

scientist okay I think I briefly flirted

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080
scientist okay I think I briefly flirted
 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.080

with the idea of driving a locomotive

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
with the idea of driving a locomotive
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.300
with the idea of driving a locomotive
train I would have was probably two or

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
train I would have was probably two or
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.210

a family that was very focused on

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619
a family that was very focused on
 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.200
a family that was very focused on
education my father was a doctor in a

education my father was a doctor in a
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.490
education my father was a doctor in a
small town but education and especially

small town but education and especially
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.880
small town but education and especially
science and medicine were an important

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
science and medicine were an important
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.529
science and medicine were an important
part of the sort of family culture and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
part of the sort of family culture and
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.560

so I also grew up in the United States

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
so I also grew up in the United States
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.490
so I also grew up in the United States
of America i was born in nineteen fifty

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500
of America i was born in nineteen fifty
 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.439
of America i was born in nineteen fifty
the significance of that was that after

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
the significance of that was that after
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.560
the significance of that was that after
World War two America was really at that

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
World War two America was really at that
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.759
World War two America was really at that
time seen it was becoming it already was

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
time seen it was becoming it already was
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.120
time seen it was becoming it already was
a very powerful country it was taking on

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
a very powerful country it was taking on
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.890
a very powerful country it was taking on
global responsibilities including

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
global responsibilities including
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.710
global responsibilities including
scientific research but also in a major

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
scientific research but also in a major
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539
scientific research but also in a major
competition with the Soviet Union as

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
competition with the Soviet Union as
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.789
competition with the Soviet Union as
everybody knows of the so-called Cold

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
everybody knows of the so-called Cold
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.530
everybody knows of the so-called Cold
War and when the Soviets developed the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
War and when the Soviets developed the
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.649
War and when the Soviets developed the
nuclear bomb and when they also were the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
nuclear bomb and when they also were the
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.649
nuclear bomb and when they also were the
first to put satellites into space quite

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
first to put satellites into space quite
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289
first to put satellites into space quite
frankly it scared the lamb out of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
frankly it scared the lamb out of
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.690
frankly it scared the lamb out of
certainly Americans but certainly a lot

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
certainly Americans but certainly a lot
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.480
certainly Americans but certainly a lot
of the world and so it caused an energy

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
of the world and so it caused an energy
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.999
of the world and so it caused an energy
and the whole enterprise of scientific

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
and the whole enterprise of scientific
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.410
and the whole enterprise of scientific
research especially the physical

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
research especially the physical
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.319
research especially the physical
sciences but also biomedical sciences

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
sciences but also biomedical sciences
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.080
sciences but also biomedical sciences
got energized and so that's the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
got energized and so that's the
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.270
got energized and so that's the
environment I grew up in and in that

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
environment I grew up in and in that
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.069
environment I grew up in and in that
environment scientists and medical

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
environment scientists and medical
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.530
environment scientists and medical
doctors doing research and so on we're

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
doctors doing research and so on we're
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.469
doctors doing research and so on we're
really prized by society and I'm not

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
really prized by society and I'm not
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.020
really prized by society and I'm not
entirely sure that's so true today but

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
entirely sure that's so true today but
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789
entirely sure that's so true today but
it was certainly true then and we were

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
it was certainly true then and we were
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.719
it was certainly true then and we were
seen as assets very little in the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
seen as assets very little in the
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.179
seen as assets very little in the
liability call and so you know as a

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189
liability call and so you know as a
 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.100
liability call and so you know as a
young boy your hero might have been a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
young boy your hero might have been a
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.480
young boy your hero might have been a
base

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490
base
 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.770
base
player but it might also have been a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780
player but it might also have been a
 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.570
player but it might also have been a
physicist like like Oppenheimer or

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580
physicist like like Oppenheimer or
 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.000
physicist like like Oppenheimer or
Einstein
