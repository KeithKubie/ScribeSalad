00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.330
SPEAKER 1: I'm excited to
introduce David Kaplan, who

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.547
is the co-author for this
book that Joel Peterson

00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:09.130
wrote in conjunction
with David, which

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.213
is "The 10 Laws of Trust."

00:00:10.213 --> 00:00:12.030
We're going to be
talking more about it.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.758
So David, please introduce Joel.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.180
DAVID KAPLAN: Thank you.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.280
Showing how old I
am, I remember when

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.450
I showed up a little while ago.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.590
I had my first full-time
journalism job in this building

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.310
back in the age of dinosaurs.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.030
It was a print newspaper.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.440
A lot has changed
since then, including

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.280
you guys now being
in the building

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.190
and that newspaper not being
in the building anymore.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.040
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.120
I met Joel a few
years ago, and have

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.940
come to learn in working with
him why he's considered such

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.130
a treasure among CEOs,
boards-- he's Chairman

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.310
of the Board of JetBlue--
and as a beloved professor

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.710
at Stanford, where he's
mentored many entrepreneurs

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.610
and students who've gone
on to work at Google,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.090
or who had worked at
Google previously.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.760
For purposes of this book, I
may be his number-one student.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.290
When he told me about
the topic and showed

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.970
me some posts he had written
and speeches he had given,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.340
I was skeptical.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.050
Was this stuff about trust pap?

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.710
Was he a Pollyanna?

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.220
And as I came to learn from him
over many classes and sessions

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.010
we would have in person and
on the phone electronically,

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.370
and as I helped him form
his thoughts on paper,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.761
which became this book, I
learned that it isn't, and he's

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:48.260
not.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.780
And that's what he's
here to talk about.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.080
Joel?

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.431
JOEL PETERSON: So I think
you're going to interview me.

00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:02.740
But before you do, I just
have to tell a Google story.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.230
So I teach at Stanford
Business School,

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.009
and the dean there
had Eric Schmidt--

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.130
told Eric Schmidt that he
should sit in on my class.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.860
Because as he said it,
the room temperature

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680
is really good in this class.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.490
And whenever I
teach, I spot people

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.220
who are not part of
the normal classroom,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.920
and I have them
introduce themselves.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.820
And this was maybe 10
years ago, or whatever.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.400
So I called on this
older gentleman

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.650
that was sitting in the class.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.483
I said, would you please
introduce yourself?

00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:32.990
And he said, hi,
I'm Eric Schmidt.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.790
Really glad to be here.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.456
And I said, well,
Eric, you need to tell

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:36.970
the class who you work for.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.350
And the class just broke
out into laughter, thinking,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.090
who is this professor who has
no idea who Eric Schmidt is?

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.450
Now that was before Eric
Schmidt was Eric Schmidt.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.350
But still, he was a
pretty important guy.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.850
So I do teach, as David
said, a lot of people who've

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.920
worked at Google, and then a
lot who come out of the GSP

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.760
and come to Google.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.218
So I'm really
delighted to be here,

00:02:58.218 --> 00:03:01.040
and I think you're doing
it as kind of a Q&amp;A.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.440
And I don't know where
she's headed either.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.481
SPEAKER 1: You know what?

00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.187
When I'm given a mic and a free
forum to ask any questions,

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:07.686
I'm excited.

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:08.500
JOEL PETERSON: You're
supposed to be here.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.333
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, OK.

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:10.429
We'll switch over.

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:11.720
Already playing musical chairs.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.720
But welcome officially, Joel,
to Talks at Google and so

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.330
have you here in New York City.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.204
So before we get right
into the book about trust,

00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:23.120
I'm sure you're all
interested in hearing more

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.130
about your professional
development and all

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.632
the successes you've
had in your career.

00:03:27.632 --> 00:03:29.840
So can you tell us a little
bit about your background

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.270
and how you got
into the hotseat?

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.436
JOEL PETERSON: So I went
to Harvard Business School,

00:03:35.436 --> 00:03:38.700
and there was a guy who put a
3" by 5" card on the bulletin

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.340
board that said, looking
for a French speaker

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.650
to go to the French
Riviera and work.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.550
And I just thought,
my high school buddies

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.830
are never going to believe this.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.490
And so I got interested,
ended up taking the job.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.000
I went not to the
French Riviera,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.200
but to Paris, and then to Lyon.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.840
Ended up in the real
estate business.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.095
Long story short, there
was a lot of workouts,

00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:02.280
a lot of issues at that time.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.520
I became the treasurer
of the company at I

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.270
think about age 29, or
something like that.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.684
And we didn't have any cash.

00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:11.850
If you know what a treasurer
does, they manage cash.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.950
We didn't have any.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.089
And that caused the chief
financial officer to leave,

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.930
and I became the chief
financial officer.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.264
So at age 29, I was the
chief financial officer

00:04:22.264 --> 00:04:24.180
of the largest private
real estate development

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.500
company in the world.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.304
And I didn't have any
idea what I was doing.

00:04:28.304 --> 00:04:30.220
And one thing led to
another, and I ultimately

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.120
ended up as the CEO of
Trammell Crow Company.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.300
And then I ended up teaching,
starting to teach at Stanford.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.360
And then I started my
own investment firm,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.100
private equity,
growth capital firm.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.150
And then I started a
ventures firm, and then

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.645
a couple of real estate
funds, and other things.

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:54.844
So we back maybe now
200 entrepreneurs.

00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:56.260
So I started a
number of companies

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.676
and backed a lot
of entrepreneurs.

00:04:57.676 --> 00:05:02.190
And it's really from that that
these observations about trust

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.690
come.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.290
Because I've seen companies
that have failed or not based on

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.884
whether or not they build
a high-trust culture.

00:05:08.884 --> 00:05:10.800
SPEAKER 1: And so I guess
that's a great segue

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.832
into the next question.

00:05:11.832 --> 00:05:13.540
So in the book, in a
lot of your writing,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.640
you talk about how your
life is a testament

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.240
to the power of trust.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.980
And so in your professional--
in your career,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.600
in your personal
life, how have you

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.440
instilled trust in
your relationships?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.940
JOEL PETERSON: So I
started out with parents

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.150
who really were trusting.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.160
It was a gift.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.920
I didn't really realize.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.030
But if I would make
a mistake, they

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.950
would see that as a preamble
to success the next time.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.410
Have any of you read
Carol Dweck's book?

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.180
It's phenomenal, I think.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180
It's really changed--
I only see a few people

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.180
nodding their heads.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.760
But you really ought to read
this book called "Mindset."

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.270
And it's fundamentally about
accepting failure, seeing

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.850
failure as a
preamble to success.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.460
Well, I started out with
parents that saw that in me.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.190
And then what I try to do is
mimic that in relationships.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.180
And most of the time, it works.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.040
So most of the
time, trust works.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.170
If you extend trust
to people, they

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.066
don't like to disappoint you.

00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:14.900
They fulfill what they promise.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.530
You have more trust in them.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.270
You trust them with
something greater,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.490
and it becomes this
virtuous cycle.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.040
And so it's really
been repeated.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.670
So I have seven children,
and I always say to people,

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.526
I like most of my
kids most of the time.

00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:28.026
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:28.026 --> 00:06:31.410
And so most of them
don't disappoint me.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.300
Most of them really live up
to-- and if I trust them,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.240
they will actually
try to live up to it.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.380
And so I think that's
actually-- there's

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.040
a principle in there for people
who are building businesses,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.550
who are growing businesses.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.090
Pushing the power to people.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.970
SPEAKER 1: And so when
you talk about trust

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.770
and personal in your own
house with your family

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.580
and then professionally,
how do you define trust?

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.220
What does that mean to you?

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.790
JOEL PETERSON: So trust is
ceding authority, the ability

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.240
to act to another party.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.090
So when you give up
control, you have to trust.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.940
And you're trusting somebody
to look out for you,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.490
to do what's in your interest.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.030
We do it all the time.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.050
We do it with doctors,
dentists, lawyers, accountants.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.290
We do it professionally
all the time.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.270
Sometimes in interpersonal
relationships,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.190
we're a little wary, we're
a little bit cautious.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.435
And rightfully so.

00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:22.310
We should be careful.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.100
We should be smart about how
we use this very powerful tool.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.250
I think trust, the
contract that you and I had

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.960
if we trust each other,
it's kind of a thermonuclear

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.920
contract.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.626
If done well, it's
really powerful.

00:07:35.626 --> 00:07:37.500
Take us both to places
we'd not otherwise go.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.159
If poorly done, it
ends in betrayal.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:42.700
SPEAKER 1: And so that was going
to be my follow-up question.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.020
It's like we rehearsed
this already.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.280
So when you trust somebody
and then they betray you,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.330
how do you overcome that?

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.220
And how do you re-empower
yourself to trust them again,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.560
or how do you kind of cope
with that type of situation?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.810
JOEL PETERSON: So it depends
on the level of betrayal.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.143
You know, if somebody says
they're going to do something

00:08:01.143 --> 00:08:04.630
and they don't do it, that
is, in a sense, a betrayal.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.880
But that happens all the time.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.256
And sometimes, it's for good
reasons that they don't do it.

00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:11.539
And so if it's a
minor betrayal, I

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:13.580
try to get to the bottom
of it and understand it.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.360
Because you want to stop those
sorts of things early on.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.840
Otherwise, they metastasize.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.731
And you end up not
trusting somebody,

00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:22.230
and it builds, and
you start looking

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.200
for data that proved that
you shouldn't trust them.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.840
And then trust ends up going
in the wrong direction.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:35.169
So I think it's important to
trust in little increments,

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.926
and then measure it, see how
it's going, and then give more.

00:08:37.926 --> 00:08:41.330
Now when the betrayal is
larger, when it's really

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.840
a betrayal of sort
of a character

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.610
where people have really
violated something deep--

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.760
my guess is every one of
you have trusted something

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.660
in your life, and every one
of you has felt betrayed,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.160
you know?

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.590
And it's a tough
thing to overcome.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.673
So I would say that if
it's one of those betrayals

00:08:57.673 --> 00:08:59.557
of character, the
odds are you're

00:08:59.557 --> 00:09:01.390
going to wake up in the
middle of the night,

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.460
thinking about it.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.910
It's going to be the
first thing on your mind

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.659
when you get up in the
morning, and you're

00:09:05.659 --> 00:09:07.410
going to feel bitter about it.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.860
My advice is get over
it as fast as you can.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.027
That may be years, really,
before you get over it.

00:09:13.027 --> 00:09:15.110
But the way you'll know
that you've gotten over it

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.985
is you're starting to
think about the future.

00:09:16.985 --> 00:09:18.443
You're not thinking
about the past.

00:09:18.443 --> 00:09:20.700
You're not looking in the
rear view mirror and saying,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.660
I can't believe this
person did that to me.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.580
So I think you want to get to
the future as fast as you can.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.172
SPEAKER 1: And so
it's interesting,

00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:31.880
as we're talking about
betrayal and trust

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.970
and with elections and all
the political climate that's

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.210
currently happening right now,
there's a lot of constant--

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.580
you know, there's a lot
of disrespect, I think,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.200
around the political community
right now of the bashing

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.970
and talking down
upon each other.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.020
What are your views on
the political climate?

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.830
And what advice would you
have for the candidates?

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.240
JOEL PETERSON: It's toxic.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.940
And what happens is when you
get into polemics and people

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.740
get far out on the edge, it's
very tough to knit things back.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.700
You know when you
have strained trust?

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.540
It's very tough.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.540
So if people are thinking about
actually leading an enterprise

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.350
after there's been that kind
of a battle, it's really tough.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.630
And so I was just reading
"The New York Times"

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.280
that 2/3 of the electorate
trust neither of the leading

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.410
candidates.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.746
That's shocking.

00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:24.804
For 2/3 of Americans not to
trust either of the leading

00:10:24.804 --> 00:10:25.304
candidates?

00:10:25.304 --> 00:10:27.240
I mean, I find that
just appalling.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.510
Well, what that
means is you can see

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.060
that it's going to be very
tough to bring people together

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:32.560
after that.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.450
So I don't feel great about it.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.979
SPEAKER 1: And is there
advice that you have?

00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:41.020
Can they overcome that
reputation that they have?

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.910
Say, if they do win
the seat, knowing

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.474
that 2/3 don't trust them,
how do they overcome that?

00:10:45.474 --> 00:10:47.390
JOEL PETERSON: So trust
is one of these things

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.310
that you build up a
molecule at a time.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.505
You build trust a conversation
at a time in your life.

00:10:54.505 --> 00:10:57.260
And you can destroy
it in a single act.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:04.270
So I actually think that this
process of bashing is damaging.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.650
I also think that the American
people are the clientele.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.840
And so we're the ones who are
selecting the people that we're

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.970
going to hire.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.720
Fundamentally,
we're hiring people

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.890
to be the president
of the United States.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.490
So it says a lot about us.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.040
And I would say that everybody
in here's a millennial,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.639
it looks like to
me, pretty much.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:25.847
It's one of the great things
about-- well, maybe not.

00:11:25.847 --> 00:11:28.132
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:28.132 --> 00:11:29.410
Not David for sure.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.730
Not me for sure.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.552
But this is a company
of millennials.

00:11:32.552 --> 00:11:35.010
And you know, if you look at
the millennials, they really--

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.180
so I get asked
this all the time.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.080
They're hardworking,
they're smart,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.700
they want to do the right
thing, they care about meaning,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.570
they care about
balance in their lives.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.500
But fundamentally,
I think they've

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.350
become a bit of a
mistrustful generation.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.610
And if you look at the reasons,
I mean, they were told,

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.042
buy a house.

00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:54.250
That's the right thing to do.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.541
And then they've seen their
neighbors be foreclosed on.

00:11:56.541 --> 00:11:57.780
They've said, get married.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.080
And they see their families--
divorce in their own families

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.900
or neighbors.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.550
They were told, go to college.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.120
You know, get a college degree.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.090
And they find that people
get college degrees

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.530
and they end up with a mountain
of debt they can't repay.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.430
And so on and on.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.880
A lot of these things
they've been told to trust,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.386
trust this stuff.

00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:18.010
Go to work for a
company, and then they

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.720
find that people get laid off.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.121
So they've learned to be a
bit mistrustful, a bit wary.

00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:23.620
And there are good
reasons for that.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.510
So in some ways, we have an
electorate that's mistrustful,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.500
that's a bit angry.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.020
And so the candidates
speak to that.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.190
Candidates really are just
reflections of what's going on.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.530
And so I think when you have
that in the candidates--

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.820
so I don't blame the
candidates altogether.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.131
I kind of say, this is
where we are right now.

00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:42.630
And I think it
really takes somebody

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.440
to put their arms around us
and say, hey, what do we share?

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.640
There's a lot more that
we share than divides us.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.820
SPEAKER 1: So as you're
describing millennials--

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.111
and I think I'm probably one
of the older millennials--

00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:55.480
but that really
resonated with me.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.620
I think a lot of how I
think and approach things

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.744
is very similar to what
you said with the weariness

00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:01.430
and the mistrust of
a lot of decisions

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.440
we need to make in life.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.190
In your book, you talk about
different communication styles

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.930
of how you can learn to
trust or kind of clearly

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.517
communicate trust to others.

00:13:13.517 --> 00:13:15.850
Can you talk a little bit
about the communication styles

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.290
and the methods?

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.380
JOEL PETERSON: The most powerful
way to develop trust is to act.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.299
Whatever you do, if your words
and your actions sync up,

00:13:25.299 --> 00:13:26.340
people tend to trust you.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.160
People are super smart.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.360
So I've found that even
the newest receptionist

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.500
in the company knew all kinds
of stuff and picked up on stuff,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.470
whether people were
trustworthy or not.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.011
So the first thing
is that you've got

00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:40.900
to sync up words and actions.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.280
If they're out of sync, it's
very hard to develop trust.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.270
The second communication thing
that I always tell to people

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.450
is, part of communication
is listening.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.780
If I explain the most important
part of communication,

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.034
if you've been around
a good listener,

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:56.950
they tend to capture
what it is you're saying.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.540
And they tend to
listen until you've

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.166
been able to
explicate or tell what

00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:04.290
it is you're talking about.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.200
They've captured it in a way
that they can reflect it.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.710
And if somebody can communicate
in that way as a good listener,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.134
they've done a whole lot.

00:14:13.134 --> 00:14:14.800
And then I think the
other thing I'd say

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.270
is that in a
corporation, in a family,

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.380
in any kind of an organization,
is communicate lavishly.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.712
What that means is you
don't withhold the bad news.

00:14:22.712 --> 00:14:24.170
You know, I see a
lot of people who

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.360
try to manage-- [INAUDIBLE]
talking in the news business,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.640
you guys know that people
hold the bad news till Friday

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.570
afternoon, and then dump it.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.869
All those kind of manipulations
people think work--

00:14:34.869 --> 00:14:36.410
AUDIENCE: But we in
the news business

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.080
try to publish it
Friday morning.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.900
JOEL PETERSON: Even
if it's not true?

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.673
JOEL PETERSON: Yeah.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:43.720
[LAUGH]

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.010
But I think this
idea of disclosure,

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.590
of telling people bad
news as well as good news.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.720
Because people are smart.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.560
People know.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.010
If you learn all of the
important news at the water

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.140
cooler or in the
newspaper, you've

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.876
actually damaged the trust
within the organization.

00:15:02.876 --> 00:15:04.709
So I think you have to
communicate bad news.

00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:09.564
You have to communicate before,
during, and after events.

00:15:09.564 --> 00:15:11.980
And a lot of times, people
think that if they just do one,

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.060
or they can have a news
flash, and that's it.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.130
My experience is most
events have a long lead-up.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.210
They have kind of a crescendo
that something happens.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.840
And then there's
a period of time

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.690
when there's kind
of a denouement.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.690
And I think really
effective communicators

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.510
realize that people need to know
information all along the way.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.960
So I think those are three ways
to think about communication.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.750
SPEAKER 1: Thanks
for sharing that.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.965
And so given that
you need to be more

00:15:39.965 --> 00:15:41.340
transparent in
your communication

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.500
and kind of message at
all points of the process,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.100
how have you incorporated that
in the business environment

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.520
as a leader yourself?

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.560
And then I guess, what advice
do you have for us as Googlers

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.985
to instill that type
of leadership quality

00:15:57.985 --> 00:16:00.087
in our future as we
continue to grow?

00:16:00.087 --> 00:16:02.420
JOEL PETERSON: So I've tried
to think about it two ways.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.331
One is sort of
broadly leading a team

00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:07.940
or whatever where you have
to communicate objectives.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.670
When I was a managing partner
at Trammell Crow Company,

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.750
for example, I used to write
a partner's letter every two

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.832
weeks, and I would make sure
that everybody heard from me,

00:16:16.832 --> 00:16:17.700
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.250
And JetBlue, every Monday
we send out a letter,

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.600
and it's from a member
of the management team,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.899
to all 19,000 employees.

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:28.440
So there's that kind
of communication

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.089
that keeps everybody on
top of whatever's going on.

00:16:31.089 --> 00:16:33.380
The other kind, though, is
I think a much more personal

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.320
kind, which I think you can do
even if your enterprise doesn't

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:36.990
do it.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.210
And to me, it's this notion
of a standing meeting.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.290
So wherever I am, I tend
to go around and stop

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.900
in people's offices and just
say, how are things going?

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.500
What are you working on now?

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.750
What obstacles are you having?

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.208
Is there anything
I can do to help?

00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:55.670
And then typically, it's nice
to ask them about their lives,

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.730
about their family, and to
remember something about what

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.230
was going on in their lives.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.840
I mean, caring about
people is actually

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.460
a really powerful thing.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.470
And a lot of people don't do it,
or they think it's a technique.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.540
You actually have to care.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.849
It really has to matter to you.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:13.530
If you do that,
that communicates

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.859
all kinds of things.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:18.329
If you don't, then people
see through it again.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.329
SPEAKER 1: And is that the
tool or the secret tool

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:25.510
that you use to empower your
employees within the companies

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.094
that you lead?

00:17:26.094 --> 00:17:27.593
JOEL PETERSON: I
don't think there's

00:17:27.593 --> 00:17:28.740
anything secret about it.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.910
I think-- I mean, it is
out of these conversations

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.400
that you end up figuring out
who to empower and how much.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.660
My view of empowering people is,
ultimately what you want to do

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.740
is empower people who are
closest to the customer.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.210
So it's wherever the action
is, you want people to feel

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.260
empowered to make decisions.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.020
You get better decisions
if you can do that.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.925
But you can't do
it all of a sudden.

00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:54.300
You can't just dump all the
decisions of the organization

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.240
on your youngest,
most remote people.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.790
So you have to do
it incrementally.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.254
And then you measure.

00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:02.670
So one of the
chapters in the book

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.772
is about the power
of accountability,

00:18:04.772 --> 00:18:06.230
why there has to
be accountability.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:10.600
If you're going to trust people,
they have to be accountable.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.340
And so they need to know
what you're measuring.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.632
Otherwise, it's not real trust.

00:18:14.632 --> 00:18:16.173
You can surprise
them by, saying, oh,

00:18:16.173 --> 00:18:17.610
that's not what
we were measuring.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.804
So I think you kind of move
to something like that.

00:18:21.804 --> 00:18:23.970
SPEAKER 1: So I was just
referencing my notes really

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.076
quickly, because one of the
things that when trust comes up

00:18:27.076 --> 00:18:28.950
and when you talk about
the 10 laws of trust,

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.780
you immediately think of some
of the synonyms or close words

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.840
which is trust,
respect, honesty.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.490
How would you kind of
combine them together,

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.960
or how do you see them all
in relation to one another

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.260
in how you can live your
life in a powerful way

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.577
and in an honest way?

00:18:46.577 --> 00:18:48.160
JOEL PETERSON: Well,
so I think you've

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.850
mentioned about your virtues
that we all aspire to,

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.660
and we all like in
our friends or spouses

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.205
or significant others.

00:18:55.205 --> 00:18:56.540
Those seem [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.990
I would say, though, that
I categorize all of those

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.980
under the rubric of character.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.530
But that's only one
element of trust.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.560
If somebody has
high character, that

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.570
is not enough to trust them.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.180
We think that this warm,
fuzzy feeling-- ooh, gosh.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.720
I really like her.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.090
Therefore, I trust her.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.750
But I was ask my
executives that come in

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.100
to take these exec
courses at Stanford.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.490
Well, would you trust your mom,
whom you trust, high character,

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.722
to fly a 747 to London?

00:19:26.722 --> 00:19:28.636
And they say, well, heck no.

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:29.971
Well, why wouldn't you?

00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:31.970
Well, because she doesn't
know what she's doing.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.735
She's not competent.

00:19:33.735 --> 00:19:35.785
She's not competent to do that.

00:19:35.785 --> 00:19:37.160
So if you want to
trust somebody,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.206
it doesn't just
start with honestly.

00:19:40.206 --> 00:19:43.000
That's the feel-good
care element.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.984
There's an element
of competence.

00:19:44.984 --> 00:19:46.400
If you're going
to trust somebody,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.110
they have to be competent.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.550
And if you expect
to be trusted, you

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.665
have to be competent, which
means you deliver on what

00:19:53.665 --> 00:19:54.790
you say you're going to do.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.330
And then the final
thing I tell people

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.070
is, people that you trust have
to have the authority to act.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.412
There's no point in
telling David here

00:20:03.412 --> 00:20:04.870
who's a lawyer that
I'd really like

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.530
not to pay taxes this year.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.980
And you're a lawyer.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.550
David has high character.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.910
He's very competent.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.640
So I'd just like
not to pay taxes.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.490
He doesn't have the
authority to do that.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:16.780
He can't make that happen.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.950
So for me to trust him to keep
me from paying taxes is folly.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.200
It's not smart trust.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.680
So trust is, I think, a
really hard-edged principle.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.350
And you can get
really good at being

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.780
thoughtful about who you trust
by being kind of analytical,

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.940
by factor analyzing.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.890
What is it that you're
really trusting?

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.970
And so it is those things
that you mentioned,

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:38.810
but it's not enough.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.990
It's inadequate.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.420
SPEAKER 1: Well, thanks
for pointing that out.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.420
And in Joel's book,
he does define--

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.602
you define the character and the
competence and accountability

00:20:50.602 --> 00:20:52.810
pretty well and pretty
detailed as great tools for us

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.449
to leverage, I think,
in our day-to-day.

00:20:55.449 --> 00:20:57.490
And I want to give you
guys an opportunity to ask

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.614
him some questions as well.

00:20:58.614 --> 00:21:02.650
So we're going to open
the floor to questions.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.590
So there's a mic.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.150
Adeola, if you don't mind.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.400
Adeola right here is going
to run around with the mic,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.130
and just raise your hand
if you have a question.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.130
She can come up to you.

00:21:14.521 --> 00:21:15.396
JOEL PETERSON: Sorry.

00:21:15.396 --> 00:21:17.336
I didn't mean to
ignore you over there.

00:21:17.336 --> 00:21:18.210
AUDIENCE: No worries.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.085
I'm not a millennial.

00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:20.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.230
JOEL PETERSON: So sorry.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.720
AUDIENCE: Do you think
trust can be taught

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.870
and/or learned if you are
working with someone who you

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.610
do not believe exhibits trust?

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.777
Is that something that you
think a person can develop?

00:21:32.777 --> 00:21:34.360
JOEL PETERSON: I
think they can, but I

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.970
think they have to think about
all three of those areas,

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.420
getting good at all
three of those areas.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.980
I think most things
can be learned.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.260
I teach a leadership
class as well at Stanford.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.130
And a lot of people used
to think, well, leaders

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.960
are to the manner born.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.510
In other words, they come
up with a certain DNA,

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.580
a certain whatever, birthright
that makes them leaders.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.820
And that may have been
true a century or two ago.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.950
It is no longer true.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.530
You see leaders coming out of
all kinds of walks of life.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.630
And those who become
intentional and say,

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.810
these are the
things about leaders

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.850
that make them powerful as
leaders, people who understood

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.100
you can actually develop that.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.340
I think it's the same
thing with trust.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.570
So I actually think that if
somebody were to take seriously

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.270
these 10 laws of
trust and say, I'm

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.210
going to operate within
these guardrails,

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.710
these are the
guardrails that really

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.725
are going to set my
behavior or organization,

00:22:29.725 --> 00:22:30.600
they will get better.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.260
They'll become more trustworthy.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.620
They'll become more able
to communicate effectively,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.180
to empower others.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.170
And all of these things
tend to self-reinforce.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.910
And so, yes.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:42.870
Long way of saying yes.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.515
I absolutely think people can
learn to be more trustworthy.

00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:53.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.250
I'm Steven.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.960
I am a millennial.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.576
OK, a little different.

00:22:58.576 --> 00:23:00.242
I'm very interested
in the fact that you

00:23:00.242 --> 00:23:01.616
serve on JetBlue's
board, and I'm

00:23:01.616 --> 00:23:02.890
super interested in aviation.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.780
One of the events, talking about
communicating during events,

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.486
was when the flight attendant
went off the slide at JFK.

00:23:08.486 --> 00:23:10.110
JOEL PETERSON: Thanks
for reminding me.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.760
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.920
Well, I'm sure as
a board member,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.380
you probably had to
deal with some of that.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.900
But what was interesting
is it kind of broke--

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.154
and probably why the
story was so interesting

00:23:17.154 --> 00:23:18.320
was it broke people's trust.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.800
It broke JetBlue's
trust in that person

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.540
and fulfilling their duties.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.760
And someone as a
passenger saying,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.490
I trusted that person
to be there for me

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.070
and not to be jumping
off the plane.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.810
How did you communicate
through that,

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.430
and how did you figure
out-- is this just one

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.340
person, organization that's
operating on the outside,

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.300
or is there a broader
issue within the company

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.300
that you had to address?

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.350
JOEL PETERSON: That's
a great question.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.683
That's one of the things you
ask when something happens.

00:23:41.683 --> 00:23:44.710
We've had several of those
incidents over the years.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.370
And so you always
ask that question.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.750
What we did in that
particular incidence was

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.420
we asked all the
employees to say,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.760
what do you think we should do?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.250
How should we handle this?

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.730
Because it was their peers.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:56.720
It's their company.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.350
They own it too.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.240
And they want to have-- they
want to live the values.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.060
And they were basically
the ones that said,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.530
this person needs
to be moved out.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.900
I think if management had just
come in and say, OK, can this,

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.110
you would have a lot of people
kind of coming to their rescue,

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.780
and whatever.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.607
Whereas because
they were empowered,

00:24:14.607 --> 00:24:16.190
they all sort of
came together to say,

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.514
you know, this is the
right thing to do.

00:24:18.514 --> 00:24:20.680
I think one of the toughest
issues for any company--

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.630
if you're going to build
a high-trust organization,

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.046
a whole lot of
what you have to do

00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:25.650
is get the right
people on the bus

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.840
and get the wrong
people off the bus.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.680
And so I would say
with 19,000 employees,

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.100
we've got some of the
wrong people on the bus.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.520
And that takes courage to go
in and get them off the bus.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.350
Now you can do it generously,
graciously, or whatever.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.784
But it's a constant
management challenge.

00:24:43.997 --> 00:24:45.580
So I will say one
other thing that you

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.780
might find interesting,
and maybe you've

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.110
done that here, too.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.710
But we have five values.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.680
Values are just priorities.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.860
And can you guess what the most
important value is a JetBlue?

00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.930
AUDIENCE: Safety.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.870
JOEL PETERSON: Safety.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:01.730
Exactly.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.540
We fly 35 million people
around every year,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.690
and nothing is more
important than their safety.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.000
That's the number one value.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.270
Which means if it's your value,
if it's really your value,

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.231
you have to spend time on it.

00:25:15.231 --> 00:25:16.480
You have to spend money on it.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.500
People who give lip
service to values and then

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.750
don't spend time or money
or mental energy on it,

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:23.610
they're fooling you.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.170
You can't trust them.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.227
So if you're going to
say, these are our values,

00:25:27.227 --> 00:25:28.810
you have to live
true to those values.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.260
And the second one
is caring, you know?

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.910
And I don't know if any of
you saw-- there a YouTube

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:34.879
video that went viral.

00:25:34.879 --> 00:25:36.420
There were stories
about what went on

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.880
in Orlando after that shooting.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.980
I mean, we were getting
ready for a JetBlue offsite

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.730
in Washington, DC.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:46.952
And so our CEO was up to
his eyeballs in issues.

00:25:46.952 --> 00:25:48.910
As soon as that happened,
he got on an airplane

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.950
and flew to Orlando, even
though everybody was flying in.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:52.950
Nobody knows that.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.620
The press didn't
pick up on that.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.730
The press picked up
on flight attendants

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.770
who were empowered to
do the right thing.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.310
But it got started because
the CEO really cares.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.020
So we had 40 people
at JetBlue who

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.090
were impacted at some level
or another in that thing.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.460
And having the CEO fly down
there and be with those people

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.464
said that value
of caring matters.

00:26:13.464 --> 00:26:14.880
And so you go down
all the values,

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.890
and you really check
yourself against.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.900
If these are our values,
do we spend time, money,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.820
and mental energy
on those values?

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.270
If not, they're not
really our values.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.190
You know, all of us
would like to say, ooh,

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.981
these are the ones.

00:26:26.981 --> 00:26:29.120
I'd love for these words
to be associated with me.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.000
But I will tell you, if you're
not spending your time, money,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.710
or mental energy on it,
they're not really your values.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:39.540
Your values may be watching
soap operas or sports on TV.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.200
You know?

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.390
I have some values
that I'm not proud of.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.970
But I have to say, if it's
what I'm spending my time on,

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.790
they really are my values.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.980
So I think you're going
to have some of that,

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.695
but I think you always have
to true up to your values.

00:26:51.695 --> 00:26:53.820
If you're going to build
a high-trust organization,

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.890
you hold yourself
accountable to those values.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:58.020
Was that at all Responsive

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:58.603
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:58.603 --> 00:26:59.456
JOEL PETERSON: Yeah.

00:26:59.456 --> 00:26:59.956
Thanks.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.750
AUDIENCE: For the relations
that have actually

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.530
gone really sour-- for
example, at the workplace

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:15.700
or in personal
space, sometimes I've

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:21.310
seen most people
or organizations,

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.020
they kind of cut ties
and say, hey, this

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.130
has already gone sour.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.240
Why invest too much time
in building trust here?

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.090
It's already gone.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.340
Do you have, like,
something different

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.780
for in some situations?

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.488
Or generally, I've
seen, like, all right.

00:27:35.488 --> 00:27:39.120
There's no trust, so let's
get rid of these employees,

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.460
lay off, in case of
families or a divorce

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.206
or siblings don't
talk to each other,

00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:50.300
parents don't talk to
their kids for a long time.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.541
The kid has married out
someone else they didn't like,

00:27:53.541 --> 00:27:54.790
or something like that, right?

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.910
So in those situations
I've seen mostly

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.780
that they just cut one dimension
and then live their life.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.170
And I've seen people
just die [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.410
They just live their
life, and then die, right?

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.390
So what happened?

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.410
Like, would they be better
off working on the trust

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:12.487
there before dying?

00:28:12.487 --> 00:28:14.070
Like, you're all
going to die anyways.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:18.360
But should be working
on that [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.730
and is there something different
to do than generally what

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.100
you suggest?

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.640
JOEL PETERSON: So I don't
think you want to die bitter.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.775
I don't think you
probably want to die.

00:28:27.775 --> 00:28:30.390
But don't die bitter,
for one thing.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.180
I think there are a number
of betrayals that are really

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.190
very difficult to repair.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.870
And I think you're
better off in those cases

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.240
moving on to something
where you can

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.780
build high-trust relationships.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.476
It takes too much energy.

00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:46.600
So that's one of the reasons
I say, catch it early.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.220
If you find that
something has happened,

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.636
get it early,
because it will just

00:28:49.636 --> 00:28:52.200
arise later in an uglier form.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.890
So catch it and
nip it in the bud.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.590
Now I would say that if
the stakes are really high,

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.250
like a family member, a
spouse, if there are children

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.400
or whatever, you may
say, it is really worth

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.830
paying a big price.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.325
Usually to repair trust,
though, it takes both parties.

00:29:09.325 --> 00:29:11.040
And I find it's
very difficult to do

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.470
if the party who's offended,
the other doesn't say, I'm sorry

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.880
and ask for forgiveness
and really mean it.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.290
And forgiveness is only when
the offended party forgives.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.060
It's not when you
say, hey, I asked.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.560
You know, a lot of people
think, well, you know,

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.910
I'm sorry if you felt that way.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.330
That's just a blame.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.960
That's not an apology.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.430
So I think it really
requires a sincere apology,

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.000
and then the stakes
have to be high enough.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.440
And then I think you have
to let go of the blame.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.480
I remember one time having
a really tough time.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.125
David knows this
because we had it

00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:48.220
in the early version of the
book and decided to take it out.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.220
Because I was really
struggling with a betrayal.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.880
I mean, it was really
eating me up for too long.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.130
And I had a friend who gave me
"The Count Of Monte Cristo."

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.420
Many of you ever read that?

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:06.400
It is a delicious
version of getting even.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.742
It is just unbelievable.

00:30:07.742 --> 00:30:12.190
But in the end, Edmond Dantes,
who's the offended party,

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.480
decides he's better
off moving on.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.870
He's actually becoming
the person that he hated.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.780
So it will canker your soul.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.720
It will eat you up.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.130
So it's in your interests
to let go of it.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.960
So if it's high stakes, I would
say get in and work at it.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.840
Catch it early.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.460
Get in and work
it out if you can.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.322
If you can't, move
on to something else

00:30:33.322 --> 00:30:34.780
where you can
actually build trust.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.545
Life's too short to
live in these situations

00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:38.971
behind betrayal.

00:30:38.971 --> 00:30:41.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
about the other person?

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.180
JOEL PETERSON: They always do.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.370
They always do.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.850
Nobody ever did something bad
without having a justification.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.580
So it starts out with people
thinking that they were right.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.880
And so I think you have to
start out understanding.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.630
And so the times that
I've worked with her

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.130
have not been the
most serious ones.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.890
But ones that are a degree
below that, I asked people

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.090
to tell me what went on,
what we were thinking,

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:04.590
how did this develop?

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.640
And usually they
have a narrative.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.860
Sometimes it's baloney,
but sometimes there's

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.980
really something to it.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.521
I think one of the more powerful
things that's happened to me

00:31:12.521 --> 00:31:17.012
is when I've said, what did I do
to contribute to this problem?

00:31:17.012 --> 00:31:18.220
That's a really good mindset.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.920
It's a hard mindset to have.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.900
But you almost [INAUDIBLE],
if you're really honest,

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.700
what did I do to
contribute to this?

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:30.280
Odds are pretty good that
you contributed something.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.490
You had a question.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.880
By the way, while the mic's
coming to him, let me say,

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.416
I was speaking-- do any of
you know what Bonobos says?

00:31:40.416 --> 00:31:41.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.120
JOEL PETERSON: Good.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.040
Hooray.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.250
I was the original
investor in Bonobos.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.750
I was the first investor, and
I'm on the board at Bonobos.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.990
And they had me speak
to a company thing.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.030
And I said, you know, any
time I go into a situation,

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.090
I think about, what
would winning look like?

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.620
And just try to imagine what
winning would look that.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.900
And the group was really
quiet and everything.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.040
And I said, you
know, to me, winning

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.920
is having all of you
asking lots of questions.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.040
And so I feel like
I'm losing right now.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.870
And so the hands
were up all over.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:10.370
[LAUGH]

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.780
So I'm feeling like
I'm not winning big

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.804
here yet, so I'm encouraging.

00:32:14.804 --> 00:32:16.470
SPEAKER 1: Maybe
you've already answered

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.990
some of their questions.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.470
JOEL PETERSON: Maybe so.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.969
Yeah.

00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:19.614
Maybe so.

00:32:19.614 --> 00:32:21.780
AUDIENCE: So I love the
notion that if you put trust

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.540
in somebody, most of the
time, it's reciprocated.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.802
And I've kind of experienced
that in my own life.

00:32:26.802 --> 00:32:28.260
But I was wondering,
is it actually

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.910
possible to protect
yourself from sort

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.650
of trusting in somebody that
you could not have trusted?

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.630
Like, I [INAUDIBLE] conservative
by only waiting until somebody

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.410
trusts you to trust them back.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.980
Or do you feel like trusting
in everybody is worth it?

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.720
Because one of the
couple of times

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.100
that you might have
your trust broken

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.371
is a very small loss compared
to all the relationships

00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:53.120
that you've built.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.490
JOEL PETERSON: Yeah.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:54.370
Yeah.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.300
So my view is, it's
good to be the leader

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.580
and to trust somebody.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.470
You don't need to wait
for them to trust you.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.030
Trust people.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.450
But do it in increments.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:04.440
Do it in small amounts.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.930
I tell a story in
the book about my dad

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:11.100
trusting me to learn how to
drive up and down our driveway.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.280
And we had a 100-foot
long driveway,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.950
and it had an L-shaped drive,
and you'd back the car out

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.530
of the garage, hit the
curb, and then drive

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.970
up and down the driveway.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.785
And so I backed the car out
of the garage, hit the curb,

00:33:22.785 --> 00:33:23.660
and then accelerated.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.684
And I forgot to
put it into drive.

00:33:25.684 --> 00:33:27.850
And I went up over the curb
and down onto this berm,

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.190
and hung the car up.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.940
And I tried for a
while to get it up,

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.050
and I realized I couldn't.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.175
So I went in to get my dad.

00:33:33.175 --> 00:33:34.380
He got the neighbors out.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.490
They pushed the
car back up there.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.281
And I thought, well,
that's it for driving.

00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:39.461
I probably won't drive ever
again, but certainly not

00:33:39.461 --> 00:33:39.960
that car.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.990
And as he was walking back
into the house, he turned to me

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.600
and said-- tossed me
the keys and said, son,

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.280
don't forget to put
it in drive next time.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.997
That image has really
been a powerful one to me.

00:33:50.997 --> 00:33:52.080
Trust people a little bit.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.663
If they screw up a
little bit-- and it

00:33:53.663 --> 00:33:55.550
wasn't for lack of effort.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.160
It wasn't for
reasons of character.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.880
It was just, they screwed up.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.310
Toss them the keys
again, talk about it,

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.610
say what you need to do,
and then try it again.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.710
So I think you initiate
trust, but you do it

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.460
in small enough increments
that it doesn't kill you

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.142
if they betray it.

00:34:13.142 --> 00:34:18.731
Because I think if you trust
100 times, one or two times,

00:34:18.731 --> 00:34:19.980
people are going to betray it.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.340
So you just have to
know that with trust

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.394
comes the risk of betrayal.

00:34:25.394 --> 00:34:28.900
SPEAKER 1: And so is there a
way for you to measure trust?

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.960
Like, is there some
type of formula,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.929
or is it just
judgment that you use

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.770
to understand how trustworthy a
person is, or how much of that

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.507
trust you want to instill
in that relationship?

00:34:40.507 --> 00:34:41.340
JOEL PETERSON: Yeah.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.440
So I do a lot of
hiring of people,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.870
and I do deep reference checks,
and I do second or third-order

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.263
reference checks.

00:34:50.263 --> 00:34:52.179
Because I think you can
learn a lot from that.

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:56.040
I also go deep into somebody's
background, all the way back

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.520
to maybe grade school.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.970
And I try to understand,
what were the inflections?

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:05.410
When they decided to go left
rather than right, what was it?

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.150
And I have found a
couple of things.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.690
One is that when people tend
to move away from things,

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.710
they tend to be less
trustworthy than people

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.204
who are moving toward things.

00:35:14.204 --> 00:35:16.370
So people who are always
seeing the next interesting

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.120
opportunity tend to
be more trustworthy.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.710
I've also found
that people who tend

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:25.086
to be winners and who
tend to win on teams--

00:35:25.086 --> 00:35:28.770
there's something about teams.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:31.600
And that's not say I don't hire
people who don't work on teams.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.725
But there's something about
working on a team where

00:35:33.725 --> 00:35:35.130
you have to rely on each other.

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.588
You know what I
find a lot of times

00:35:36.588 --> 00:35:39.012
with the straight-A students,
which are probably everybody

00:35:39.012 --> 00:35:41.330
in this room here-- good.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:42.710
We've got one like me.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:43.781
[LAUGH]

00:35:44.057 --> 00:35:45.140
But they did all the work.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.090
You know, you could be
given a group project,

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:48.440
and they would do the
whole group project,

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.481
because they couldn't
trust anybody else to do it

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:51.315
as well as they did.

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:53.272
Well, people who have
learned to live on teams,

00:35:53.272 --> 00:35:54.910
if you play on a
football team, you're

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.586
not able to drop back,
block the people who

00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:02.020
are trying to tackle you, throw
the pass, run down the field

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.330
and catch the pass.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.410
So you have to have teammates.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.696
So I tend to find
that that's one thing.

00:36:07.696 --> 00:36:10.372
And then I do a
little bit at a time.

00:36:10.372 --> 00:36:14.250
And then I just make darn
sure that I'm trustworthy.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.004
So if somebody tells me
something that's confidential,

00:36:17.004 --> 00:36:20.790
I will never breach that trust.

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.190
You have to have really strict
rules on things like that.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.288
There's no such thing as, you
know, let me just tell you.

00:36:26.288 --> 00:36:28.710
I shouldn't be telling
you this, but-- you know,

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.660
that's a trust breaker.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.457
SPEAKER 1: So when
you look at red flags

00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:35.040
when you're going
through that, so one

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.770
of the things you've said in
the fluctuation and the way

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.730
they direct the conversation
of going away from something

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.920
instead of moving forward,
are there other red flags

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.150
that you could kind of
give us as best practices

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:50.020
to see as, like,
a sign of distrust

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.745
or a sign of warning
or a caution sign?

00:36:52.745 --> 00:36:54.994
JOEL PETERSON: Yeah, I think
another one that I always

00:36:54.994 --> 00:36:59.130
pick up on is how transparent
and open and vulnerable people

00:36:59.130 --> 00:36:59.630
are.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.130
High-trust people
tend to be open.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.300
They tend to be transparent.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.560
They tend to say, ooh, I
hadn't thought of that.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.460
Low-trust people tend to have
an answer for everything.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.290
They tend to hold their
cards close to the vest.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:13.075
They tend to spin you on stuff.

00:37:13.075 --> 00:37:14.676
They're know-it-alls.

00:37:14.676 --> 00:37:16.360
So there's a lot of tells.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.530
There's a lot of ways to pick
up on somebody that you really

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:22.175
wouldn't want to be in
the foxhole with them.

00:37:22.175 --> 00:37:24.150
So I think our instinct,
I think our heart

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.320
tells us a lot of things that
our mind doesn't tell us.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.060
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.700
And as Joel mentioned,
I am not a millennial,

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:35.890
which means I've worked
for many different managers

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.770
and bosses, some who
were Machiavellian,

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.010
some who were micromanaging.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:44.890
And I am just
wondering, how do you

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:49.977
deal with an untrusting
manager or boss?

00:37:49.977 --> 00:37:52.060
JOEL PETERSON: So there
are two things you can do.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.620
One is you can get
feedback to them.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.380
You may be able
to do it directly,

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.507
or you may have to sort
of initiate a 360 review.

00:37:58.507 --> 00:38:00.590
I did that with a number
of folks who I just said,

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.410
it would be good
to do this to get

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.270
the message through to them.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:08.220
And the other thing you
can do is change jobs.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.245
It's very difficult to get
people to change their value.

00:38:11.245 --> 00:38:13.650
You know, if you have a
values conflict with people--

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.630
so I have this
hierarchy of alignment

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.470
that I look at where
fundamentally, the alignment

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:23.560
starts with values, which is the
most profoundly felt thing that

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.660
doesn't change very often.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.940
It moves then to your
objectives in life.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.930
From your objectives, you have a
strategy to get something done.

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:32.100
From strategy, you have tactics.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.530
Who's going to do what, by when?

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.070
And then from
there, you get what

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.775
you measure in your controls.

00:38:36.775 --> 00:38:39.460
So most of the ones
below objectives

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.335
can easily be compromised.

00:38:41.335 --> 00:38:43.460
It's the one where you get
all the way up to values

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:47.930
where my view is, people don't
very often change their values.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:52.280
So if you find you have a values
conflict, you're not trapped.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.515
Most millennials, to get
back to the millennials,

00:38:54.515 --> 00:38:56.620
most millennials believe
today that they'll have

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.590
11 jobs during their work life.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:01.780
And I think that's wise.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.372
I mean, I'm actually going
to write an article in praise

00:39:04.372 --> 00:39:06.830
of millennials, because they
figure a lot of stuff out that

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.420
my generation didn't.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.850
So they've figured out, well, if
there's a conflict over values,

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:12.420
I move on.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.230
I do something else.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.390
So I think you have
those two options.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.052
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:19.052 --> 00:39:19.802
SPEAKER 1: Adeola.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.992
AUDIENCE: It sounds like you've
had incredible experiences

00:39:25.992 --> 00:39:26.950
throughout your career.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:31.640
I'd love to hear an
anecdote about a situation

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.430
where you had to build trust
to achieve a business outcome,

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.151
and what you did to do it.

00:39:38.151 --> 00:39:39.900
JOEL PETERSON: So I
think one of the times

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.970
that trust matters the most
is under stress, under duress.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.050
So I was involved
in a turnaround.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.390
Fundamentally, what
a turnaround means

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:54.050
is that you're out of money.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:55.440
You can't pay suppliers.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.990
You can't meet payroll.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:59.710
You can't-- I mean, you're
basically in extremis.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.350
And so the only thing that's
going to get you through that

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.745
is if you have trust, if
people believe you're going

00:40:04.745 --> 00:40:05.870
to do the best job you can.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.759
You know, the
lenders will take--

00:40:07.759 --> 00:40:09.300
so I was in the real
estate business.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.170
Lenders will take
back property if they

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.050
don't feel like you're honest.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:15.520
But otherwise, if
they feel like you're

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.380
honest and trustworthy and doing
the best job you can, why would

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.890
they want to take that on
and find somebody else?

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.990
So for me, it was a question of
calling individually on lenders

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.040
and just giving my-- and
it's not saying, trust me,

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:28.930
I'll do a good job.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.910
It was saying, here's
why you should trust me.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:33.390
Here's my plan.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.710
I think plans and
specifics actually

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.430
allow us to then trust.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.180
It's not just the warm,
fuzzy, trust me thing.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:47.140
So for me, in a workout, it's
really made all the difference.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.020
Is that responsive?

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:49.942
Not so much.

00:40:49.942 --> 00:40:50.900
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.182
JOEL PETERSON: You wanted to--

00:40:53.182 --> 00:40:54.140
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.980
Just from what you
were talking about,

00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:01.390
it sounded like how
you build relationships

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.350
with people and so
on and so forth,

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:09.090
like, I think personally,
I've felt like in my career,

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.290
like, building
those relationships

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:15.180
and going the extra mile
does make a huge impact,

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:20.470
but I don't have as
interesting experiences being

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:24.040
the chairman of a board
of a major airline

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.735
or working with the biggest
global real estate developer,

00:41:28.735 --> 00:41:29.610
and things like that.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:34.620
So I figured you might have
more interesting situations

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.590
that you could talk about.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.590
JOEL PETERSON: So I wasn't
always the chairman--

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.070
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.670
--does that mean we're done?

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:42.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.590
SPEAKER 1: Sorry.

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:47.310
JOEL PETERSON: So I recall
a time early on in my career

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.945
where I totally screwed up.

00:41:48.945 --> 00:41:52.680
I was dealing with a
financier here in New York.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.976
And I just botched
the negotiation.

00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:58.580
And we used to talk on
Saturdays and do a deal,

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.550
and then we'd make the deal, and
he'd wire the money on Monday,

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.490
papers to follow.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.570
It was a high-trust
relationship.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.690
And so I screwed this thing up.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.380
And I remember him calling
me first thing Monday morning

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.270
and saying, I don't
think you really meant

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.440
to set this deal up this way.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.750
And I thought, oh my gosh.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:18.170
He is right.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.800
I totally screwed that up.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.370
Well, what do you think my
trust relationship with him--

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:26.150
we had dinner just the other
night together after 40 years

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:29.200
of doing hundreds of millions
of dollars worth of deals

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:29.900
together.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.810
And it started with
him calling and saying,

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.980
I don't think you
really meant to do that.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.760
And I was a kid.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.180
I mean, I was
just-- I was pretty

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.740
fresh out of business school.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.375
And they used to
crush me in that deal.

00:42:40.375 --> 00:42:42.011
He's going to be--
he'll be fired

00:42:42.011 --> 00:42:43.510
or something bad
will happen to him.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.295
Who really cares?

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.940
I'm talking about a
big-time New York financier.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.330
Who cares about this
kid down in Texas?

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.860
But what he did was he
helped me through that.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.000
20 years later, when
the real estate markets

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.120
were melting down, he owned
some property in Houston, Texas.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.100
And I said, I'll take those.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.190
I absolutely selected
the properties

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.690
that he was in and
said, I'm going

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.640
to take those on and
work them out for him.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.670
And they weren't the
most profitable for me,

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.610
but I remember 20 years ago.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:15.880
So I think what
happens is you leave

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.940
these little chits around.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.030
And it can be a
conversation with somebody

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:22.563
where you do a kindness,
that it builds trust.

00:43:22.563 --> 00:43:24.370
And you remember.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.490
I mean, my guess is
that if I quizzed

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:29.220
the people in this room,
you would remember the three

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.590
or four teachers in your
life, the three or four

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.720
people in your life
that believed in you

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.600
and went the extra mile,
as you say, for you.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.379
So I think it may not be big
or exciting to everybody,

00:43:39.379 --> 00:43:40.670
but it's a little conversation.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.450
It's a little event,
doing the right thing.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.776
Most of the time it pays off.

00:43:44.776 --> 00:43:45.650
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.860
If you expect it
to, then I think

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.620
you're going to be disappointed.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.495
But a lot of times,
it does pay off.

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:52.870
And that's the
right thing to do.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.453
And you'll be happier, and you
can pass what I call the mirror

00:43:55.453 --> 00:43:56.140
test, you know?

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.517
You want to pass the
mirror test every day.

00:43:59.517 --> 00:44:00.350
Was that any better?

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:01.294
AUDIENCE: Much better.

00:44:01.294 --> 00:44:02.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.170
AUDIENCE: It seems like
as consumers or citizens,

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:08.980
we trust institutions
differently

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.230
than we trust the people who
comprise those institutions.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:15.055
We trust Congress differently
than we trust congresspeople,

00:44:15.055 --> 00:44:16.610
or we trust
newspapers differently

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:17.755
than we trust journalists.

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:19.380
How do you account
for this difference,

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.440
and what can we do
about it to be--

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.807
do about it to be sort of better
at making this distinction?

00:44:24.807 --> 00:44:26.890
JOEL PETERSON: You know,
I hadn't thought of that.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:28.306
That's a really
interesting thing.

00:44:30.928 --> 00:44:32.312
I think you're right.

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.560
It could be that we
trust the concept.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.670
It's like Plato's
types, you know?

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:43.120
It's kind of the archetype,
the perfect thing,

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.122
when we trust the type.

00:44:45.122 --> 00:44:46.640
But when we see
the reality of it,

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:51.600
we see the tragic
nature of human nature--

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.810
so how do you translate that?

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:54.410
I'll have to give some
more thought to that.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:56.013
I think it's an
interesting observation.

00:44:56.013 --> 00:44:56.466
AUDIENCE: Your next book.

00:44:56.466 --> 00:44:58.250
JOEL PETERSON: Yeah,
it's the next book.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.905
David, you work on that one.

00:44:59.905 --> 00:45:00.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:01.730
SPEAKER 1: He's smiling.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.400
You can't see his face, but
he's really excited about it.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.330
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.180
I guess I might have
sort of a follow-up

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.050
question to when you were
talking about apologies

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:12.894
and forgiveness.

00:45:12.894 --> 00:45:15.310
With the anecdote that you
just said about doing something

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:19.410
later on or trying to rebuild
trust in different ways,

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:22.980
do you think then that it's
absolutely necessary to receive

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.180
an apology to give forgiveness?

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.610
Or is that something
that can be freely given?

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:31.380
That you put the impetus on
you to just be forgiving,

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.570
and then hope that
something comes down

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:35.120
the road instead of trying?

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.070
Or deciding that this
is a time that it's

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.700
going to sever this
connection, or just

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.360
trying to let it
go, essentially?

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:47.500
Because trying to, I guess,
be the person to do it

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.070
and then not think about the
winning or loss of that round,

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.430
but just in a
larger sense of, you

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:54.260
don't want to live
harboring this hatred,

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:58.260
even if it's something
that they may never

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.760
do another good
thing for you again.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.593
JOEL PETERSON: Yeah.

00:46:00.593 --> 00:46:02.608
I think you can let go of it.

00:46:02.608 --> 00:46:03.816
And I think that's the ideal.

00:46:03.816 --> 00:46:06.046
And I actually come
from a religious faith

00:46:06.046 --> 00:46:09.198
where we're
commanded to do that.

00:46:09.198 --> 00:46:10.602
You must forgive.

00:46:10.602 --> 00:46:12.840
It's your job to forgive others.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.752
I've just found it's
really hard to do

00:46:14.752 --> 00:46:19.250
if somebody hasn't recognized
it and won't recognize it.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:21.280
It's really hard to let go.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.140
So I think it is
possible, and I think

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.270
you should strive for that.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.940
I will just tell you
that it's really hard.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:28.746
But that's OK.

00:46:28.746 --> 00:46:31.230
Lots of things are hard in life.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:33.272
SPEAKER 1: So we have
about a few minutes left.

00:46:33.272 --> 00:46:34.730
We do have books
in the back, and I

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:37.390
want to give Joel some
time to actually sign

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.784
the books for you guys.

00:46:38.784 --> 00:46:43.210
We can maybe take one last
question from the field,

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:44.680
and then wrap up.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.962
OK.

00:46:45.962 --> 00:46:47.670
See, now you're getting
all the hands up.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:48.625
You're really winning.

00:46:48.625 --> 00:46:50.896
JOEL PETERSON: When it's the
one last one, then it's--

00:46:50.896 --> 00:46:52.832
[LAUGH]

00:46:52.832 --> 00:46:53.736
AUDIENCE: Hi Joel.

00:46:53.736 --> 00:46:54.610
Thank you for coming.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:55.330
JOEL PETERSON:
Yeah, my pleasure.

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:58.480
AUDIENCE: So the four of us work
on Google's US Multicultural

00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.330
Team.

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:02.845
And one of the areas we focus
is on the LGBT community.

00:47:02.845 --> 00:47:04.470
And we've been very
impressed with what

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:05.834
JetBlue has been doing.

00:47:05.834 --> 00:47:08.000
A lot of the conversations
we have with other brands

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.190
are not as on board
as JetBlue is.

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:13.610
So what recommendations
would you or what suggestions

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:17.120
would you give to other
chairmans or CEOs or people

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.180
in your position at
different companies

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:23.780
to kind of participate more in
the LGBT community initiatives,

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:27.390
how to establish themselves
more in that field or anything

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:29.952
around the LGBT community?

00:47:29.952 --> 00:47:30.785
JOEL PETERSON: Yeah.

00:47:30.785 --> 00:47:35.580
So my view is that
it's no longer so

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.720
much the issue of diversity.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:42.950
Diversity's kind of
last century's term.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.410
I think it's about
inclusiveness now.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:48.790
And I think inclusiveness
is sort of-- you're just not

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:53.240
very smart, I think, as a
leader if you're not inclusive.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:58.080
And so if you think about all of
the talents that are available,

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.650
you don't want to
cut any talent off.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:06.040
So I find that it crosses racial
lines, ethnic lines, gender

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.770
lines, sexual orientation lines,
it crosses all kinds of lines.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:11.502
You really, as a
business leader,

00:48:11.502 --> 00:48:12.960
you're actually
being stupid if you

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:18.872
don't embrace all of these
various approaches and values.

00:48:18.872 --> 00:48:20.330
AUDIENCE: I agree
with you on that.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.740
We just have to
get other people--

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.198
JOEL PETERSON: Well, I think
it's a question of enlighten--

00:48:24.198 --> 00:48:26.490
I think people, the more
enlightened they are,

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:29.430
the more experience they've had,
the more things they've run,

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:30.650
the more people they've met.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:32.691
You know, that's another
one of these cases where

00:48:32.691 --> 00:48:34.390
I think if people
just in the abstract,

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.280
they can classify people.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.160
You know, nobody likes
to be classified.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.685
People are individuals.

00:48:39.685 --> 00:48:41.060
And I have rarely
found that when

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.870
I get to know an individual,
I don't like them.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:45.710
That's very rare.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:49.764
So I think it probably
starts out there.

00:48:49.764 --> 00:48:52.120
SPEAKER 1: So
thank you for that.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.330
So I guess to leave
us with a few words

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:58.445
as we all read
this book and share

00:48:58.445 --> 00:49:02.060
and collaborate and discuss
this book even after today, what

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.780
do you want readers
to kind of leave

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.170
with after reading this book?

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:08.510
What do you want
them to remember?

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.514
And what's next for you?

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.680
JOEL PETERSON: You can be
intentional about building

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.624
a high-trust set of
relationships in your life.

00:49:15.624 --> 00:49:16.790
There are things you can do.

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.207
You can take control
of it in your life.

00:49:19.207 --> 00:49:23.820
And I was challenged by a
military guy who came to me

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.400
and said, you don't build trust.

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.580
You earn trust.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.980
And I said, well,
you do earn it sort

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.150
of on a one-off conversation
at a time basis.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:35.055
But fundamentally, you can build
trust within an enterprise,

00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:36.720
within a family.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.590
So you actually think about it.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.240
So I'd really like
people to say,

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.000
I can take control of this
powerful element in my life

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.670
by learning how to manage it.

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:50.620
What's next for me is I've
threatened to do another--

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.297
I think I have one
more book in me,

00:49:52.297 --> 00:49:53.900
and I've threatened to do that.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.010
I've taught at Stanford now
for a quarter of a century,

00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:59.782
and I think I'm going to
die with my boots on there.

00:49:59.782 --> 00:50:01.198
I love teaching young people.

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:04.136
I love the potential that
I see in young people.

00:50:04.136 --> 00:50:06.135
SPEAKER 1: Well, we've
enjoyed having you today,

00:50:06.135 --> 00:50:08.255
and we're happy to
continue to learn from you.

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:09.620
You're welcome here any time.

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.430
Thank you so much.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.730
Thank you.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:11.771
JOEL PETERSON: Thank you.

00:50:11.771 --> 00:50:14.980
