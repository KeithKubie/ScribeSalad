Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:05          We're continuing our partnership with learn liberty today and joining me as an author and associate professor of Philosophy at the College of William and Mary. Chris Fryman. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me. All right man. We're going to do philosophy for an hour. Are you ready? Sounds good. Yeah, you are prepared. I feel the jacket, shirt combo. It's very philosophy. Give me the Rubin. That's what this is my Tyler came up with. All right, let's talk philosophy because I think one of the things that I try to do on this show is I talk about philosophies more than people, ideas more than people. And it seems to me we live in a time where we don't do a lot of philosophy and ideas stuff. Well, and I guess that's maybe why, why people are watching this. So let's do a little philosophy you want to one with you. Give me just some of the basics of what people should understand about philosophy.

Speaker 3:          00:52          Okay. Well, yeah, that's a great question. How's that for an open ended question? Discharge? Uh, yeah, something might take the hour. But uh, yeah, so I think, you know, at the fundamental level philosophy is about challenging assumptions. I think one thing that makes philosophy different from other sorts of academic disciplines is that you can't really take anything for granted. So when you're, you know, doing philosophy, you have to justify why killing people is wrong. For example, why feeding the hungry is good. And all of these things that we take for granted at the level of everyday life philosophy calls into question. And I think that's really important. And so the kinds of philosophical questions that I'm most interested in are ones having to do with moral right and wrong justice, injustice, the moral importance of economic equality, these sorts of things. Uh, and also the, the ethics of public policy.

Speaker 3:          01:44          So for example, one thing that non philosophical disciplines can do is make predictions about what a given policy is likely to do. So we'll opening the borders lead to higher unemployment, higher GDP, something like that. Um, but all things considered, they can't really tell us what the right thing to do is. We say, okay, suppose it turns out that opening borders will slightly increase domestic unemployment, but it also will mean that a certain workers and the developing world will see their incomes rise by 300%. For example, this leaves open the question of what should we do? Is that a trade off that we should make? And that's really what philosophy tries to answer is what should we do? All things considered.

Speaker 2:          02:26          All right, so in a little bit we're going to get to some of your moral philosophies that you care about, an economic philosophies and, and uh, immigration and a bunch of other things in just a little bit. Uh, but first I'm curious, what got you interested in philosophy in the first place?

Speaker 3:          02:41          That's a good question. Uh, so I think it was doing philosophy before I realized I was doing philosophy because arguing, let's say good natured arguing was the family tradition in my household. So ever since I was a little kid, uh, you know, my parents and my sister and I, we would argue about religion and in these sorts of things, right and wrong, the economy. And when I got a little bit older, I started reading things in philosophy and economics, columns, articles and things like that. And I realized that there was this kind of formal discipline called philosophy where you could argue about right and wrong and justice and injustice. And if you were very lucky you could get a job doing this. If I get paid to do this, not a lot. Not a lot of jobs, not paid very much either, but it's kind of like saying, you know, you can get paid to eat ice cream for a living. I thought, okay, that's, that's a pretty good gig if I can get it. And so that was kind of the start of the trajectory into philosophy.

Speaker 2:          03:34          Yeah. You know, it's interesting because I came from a very similar family in that regard where we argued about everything from economics and religion and all of those things. And I guess perhaps if this is what led you here, it's kind of what led me here as well. But we're missing that these days. Don't you think like that must infuriate you as someone that cares about ideas. When you watch the news and watch all these people that are, aren't arguing from like a principal position or something like a, a philosophically thought out position, but just from like a party place or a partisan plays must drive you nuts.

Speaker 3:          04:05          It does. It does because right. I care about ideas. I care fundamentally about good arguments. So this is something that I hope happens to my students in my classes is they come in with a set of preconceptions. They have, you know, their partisan political beliefs. Everybody does. I have my partisan political beliefs, but I hope we can try as hard as we can to just focus on the arguments then critically and maybe change our minds even if it means admitting that we were wrong or uh, you know, finding out that we have different political or religious beliefs from our friends. We should really just follow wherever the arguments lead us.

Speaker 2:          04:40          I actually like it when you find out you were wrong on something. Cause when I've had the moment on this show and the, and the most famous one is when I had Larry elder in here. And he just kind of beat me senseless with facts and we've since become friends and he was on just recently. And I loved the guy that it was scary in the moment. Like sitting there in the moment of being beaten is not fun, but afterwards when you go, Whoa, that's what it's about. It's actually pretty cool.

Speaker 3:          05:04          Yes. So I don't like, like you said in the moment, I don't like being burdened by, cause I got a couple of things I'm going to play pretty good. Nothing was, yeah, yeah. But, but long term, I think that's right. It shows growth. And the funny thing is that what are we afraid of when it comes to changing our minds and admitting when we're wrong? What's really the harm in that? And I really, I like the process of arguing it's, you know, a form of recreation or something, like a form of exercise. Um, I think, I think it was Edmund Burke who said something like, the person who challenged my adversary is actually my best friend, or something like that. So the person that is willing to argue with you in good faith and genuinely cares about getting at what's true rather than what maybe confirms their prior political beliefs, that's, you know, that's the person that I want to hang out with us. First. I want to talk with

Speaker 2:          05:51          one of my best friends growing up. Uh, his name is Arie Greek. So he was willing to Greek philosophy and all that, and he was my sparring partner for them from, from literally from 12 years old until, well past college. Even now. And we ironically, we actually agree more now than ever before, which is sort of weird because we both had sort of reverse, uh, philosophical journeys or political journeys, but that's actually what it's all about. So tell me a little bit about some of the philosophers that have affected you.

Speaker 3:          06:18          So one of my favorites is probably John Stuart Mill. So he was a classical liberal. He, uh, so here's what's known as a utilitarian, and this is a moral theory that essentially says the right thing to do is the thing that has the best consequences. I think that produces the most happiness for everybody who's affected. I find that view attractive and moral philosophy. But he was also, he was a classical liberal politically. Uh, he was a big defender of free speech, a free discussion in particular. His book on

Speaker 2:          06:46          Brady is probably the single greatest defense of freedom of speech. I travel with it, you know, I'm on tour right now. I travel with it. It's a thin book. Everyone should have it under your pillow. But yeah, that's about it. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So what, okay, so you mentioned classical liberalism. Okay. Everyone knows my feelings on this. Do you see any meaningful distinction between classical liberalism and libertarianism at this point?

Speaker 3:          07:09          I think that libertarianism is probably a bit narrower than classical liberalism. So, but this is a matter of debate. I don't have a very firm opinion on this, but when I think of a libertarian, I think of somebody who says the state should do the following three things, have a court system, have police force, um, and maybe enforced contracts, something like that, no more, maybe some kind of very small social minimum, uh, Milton Friedman negative income tax type thing. Whereas I think classical liberals are more friendly to a, a more active state. But I would also say that I'm happy to say that Libertarians are a part of the classical liberal family.

Speaker 2:          07:48          Yeah. It's funny because, uh, I had done Boudreaux and here are a couple of weeks ago talking about this and I fall on that path where the more I go down the libertarian roots, I really liked. I like that line of thinking. I still think there's some utility of the state, but I think the more that you have these conversations, for me, I'm finding it harder and harder to defend anything related to the state. Which is it, I guess I'm taking a philosophically fair approach to this because I'm taking in new information.

Speaker 3:          08:16          Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm, I'm the same way. So I think that the, the best arguments for something like classical liberalism or libertarianism is just the pervasiveness of government failure. So, you know, you look at where actual government money goes, not just not in theory, but in practice where it goes, um, what sorts of groups are advantaged and disadvantaged by the state? I think that the government just doesn't work very well. And so the same reasons why we don't want the government producing food, for example, are also reasons why we might not want the government and the business of say, running schools fools.

Speaker 2:          08:50          Right. So do you think it would be fair to say that if it ran well, if this thing was a slim operation

Speaker 3:          08:56          and it was financially sensible and we had people of good moral character in the government and the rest of it, but you'd actually have no reason to be certainly a libertarian and meet perhaps even a classical liberal, you might actually be more of some sort of big government democrat or something like that. I think that's right. At least from my perspective. So, as I said, I'm a fan of mill and utilitarianism. The idea that the right thing is the thing that produces the best results. And so I think in a world in which the state was run by angels, very wise people, very benevolent people, and it produced good results. I would be happy to accept a, a big activist government or regulatory and redistributive state. But I think that are very powerful reasons for thinking that that's not the world that we live in.

Speaker 3:          09:36          So I think that some of my audience, when they hear you talk about mail and what's what's best for everyone, they're going to view that through some sort of lens of collectivism, which is going to set some bells off. So can you unpack that a little bit? Right? Yeah. So, so for, for what it's worth, my view is that a system that produces the most happiness, the most flourishing, the most prosperity is something like a libertarian, minimal state, perhaps with a, a small social minimum. So when you look historically at collectivist regimes, say the Soviet Union or North Korea or something like that, these don't have a good track record of making people happy. When you look at the societies that actually make people happy compared to the alternatives, they tend to be a limited government free market, a civil libertarian ish kind of states. All right. So what other philosophers that's affected you?

Speaker 3:          10:28          You're one for one. Yeah, John Stuart Mill. Right up the top. I'll give you somebody who you might not like, although we might not be familiar with them. Peter Singer who is a contemporary utilitarian and a lot of people, I think a lot of classical liberals and Libertarians, uh, aren't big fans of his, although I think they need not, not be fans of his. So he's uh, he's famous for a number of things. He has a number of very controversial positions on a lot of things. Um, but one of his more famous thought experiments involves you imagining that you're a walking somewhere and you pass a small child who's drowning in a shallow pond and you can save this child at a very low cost to you all. All that's required is that you step into the pond to get your shoes muddy and pull the child out.

Speaker 3:          11:13          But this means you'll have to spend that at all 100 bucks on new shoes. And he says, clearly the sacrifice of $100 worth of shoes is worth saving this child. And so this suggests that we have strong obligations, uh, to make personal sacrifices for the betterment of the world's poor. And I think that's right, uh, as at the level of moral principle, for example. But I think a lot of libertarians and classical liberals worry that what this is going to mean is we ought to have large welfare states. We ought to have billions of dollars channeled into foreign aid and so on. And I can understand why they make that leap, but I don't think that follows, especially again, if you look at the track record of whether or not the government does a good job of helping the poor and I think it generally doesn't. Yeah. So, and I definitely want to get to your thoughts on that.

Speaker 3:          11:57          So do you view that sort of is like that sort of like a micro macro argument that at a micro level, yeah, you'd probably do it. Like I'm sure if either one of us were walking down the street, we wouldn't care that much about our shoes enabled to save somebody. But at a societal level we'd probably gets to a lot of your economic arguments as well. The more that you keep giving over to society, the more that it keeps taking in essence individuals in their private lives. Uh, if they do a good job of saying when you searching which private charities do a good job of alleviating poverty in the developing worlds. And I think there are some, then we would have in some time in some sense of societal obligation to help just in the sense that most people of means have this obligation to say donate some of their paycheck to the against malaria foundation, for example.

Speaker 3:          12:43          But I think that doesn't justify saying we want the state in the business of redistributing income, uh, on a global level if only because it just doesn't do a very good job of it and oftentimes makes poverty even worse. All right, so you are a blogger at bleeding heart libertarian. Yes. Now I've seen this site before and I checked it out again before, uh, before you got here. I thought, all right, the phrase bleeding heart, libertarians, that sorta sounds like what a classical liberal is like, right? We've got a little, a little more heart in essence are we were okay with a little more state to hopefully make sure that people who need it the most are okay. Uh, but I think a lot of people will see those terms at odds. Bleeding, heart, libertarian. Yeah. No, and that's a great, uh, a great point too.

Speaker 3:          13:25          In light of the conversation about Peter Singer because I do think that we have, and I think a lot of classical liberals agree that we have this strong obligation to uphold political institutions that work particularly well for the poor. And this isn't, even though the term bleeding heart, libertarians is new. This isn't just something that popped up in the last five or six years. If you go all the way back to Adam Smith, he has this, this argument about the division of Labor and free trade. He says, you know, you're sitting at your desk trying to make pins all by yourself. Maybe you could do two or three in a day. You have a division of labor where one person straightened up the wire or the other person's putting the pin on the, on the wire and so forth, makes us massively more productive than we otherwise could be.

Speaker 3:          14:07          And then through free trade are, everybody's welfare is increased, but he stresses that this is particularly good for the poor because he says a society in which we're very productive and we have this abundance of material goods is a society in which these sorts of goods are going to be a lot cheaper. And this is in fact what we see. Uh, and so a society in which the real price of not just necessities, but also things that we might consider luxuries like smartphones or something, a society that makes those abundant and cheap as a society that's very good for the poor. So I think a bleeding heart libertarian or classical perspective is hundreds of years old. Although you probably, we haven't done a good job of marketing ourselves, perhaps. Yeah. How would you actually define what good is? I mean, I know that that's a tough one. That's right.

Speaker 3:          14:52          Yeah, that's a, that's a big question. So here's the evasive answer is there, it depends on which philosopher you're talking to. Right? So, yeah. So, so some philosophers think that, so mill has this view that the could consists of pleasure, but it's a sophisticated view where some pleasures are of higher quality than others. So if, I dunno, you have pleasure as a result of shooting up heroin and that's equal in intensity and duration to the pleasure that you get from reading Shakespeare. There's something qualitatively better about the Shakespeare than, than the heroin. Um, and so that's his view is that it's a life of pleasure. But where are you have these hot, higher and lower pleasures? Other people, other utilitarians then, oh, pleasures created equal. Other people have, uh, maybe more complicated views where a bunch of stuff makes a life good. So it's pleasure, it's knowledge, it's living a morally virtuous life and so on.

Speaker 3:          15:47          And this is a debate that we've been having for 208 or 2,500 years with no end in sight. I sense, I know where you stand on that, but you want to elaborate on that a little bit more? Well, so I think that the, yeah, so it's a good question. Yeah, no, as long as I'm here. So what, what is good? Well, so I think the good for a particular person is probably, um, what a philosopher would call the satisfaction of your informed preferences. So essentially getting what you want, if you know what it is that you're getting. So for example, you might want the liquid that is in our glass right now because you have the belief that it's water. But if you have the fall, if that belief is false because it turns out to be vodka or something like that, you might have a desire for what's in there.

Speaker 3:          16:31          But the desire is in some sense informed by this false belief. But if you have perfectly true beliefs about the world and then you desired, uh, say that cup of water, I said, well that's good for you to get that water. You're getting what you want. Yeah. So you basically believe that selfishness is good? No, because I think that a lot of people, I think most people in fact have preferences, rational preferences for the welfare of other people. So I would say, you know, most can you make it a selfish argument for that? Because the way I've always sort of understand, or at least the way I use these words now is that by doing what is good for me, I, that doesn't mean I want to ransack the entire world, right? I want to do good so that it's good for my community. I want to take care of my own house so that my neighbor, hopefully it will be like I, I'm next door to someone with a nice house and you're going to take care of their eyes.

Speaker 3:          17:19          So I view selfish. I guess that's a little more of an ran thing where I've used selfishness actually as a virtue. Yeah. So I think the difference would be in at say a case where you're, you're, uh, walking and see the child drowning in the shallow pond, the question would be, well, what is the reason why you're saving this child and, and ruining your boots? I think a good answer to that as well, because they care about the child's welfare. Um, and then sometimes it's true that that's a preference that you have. So it's your preference until you could call it a sort of, I don't know, self guided or self preference, but I wouldn't call it a selfish preference in the sense that you expect in some sense, uh, this child's welfare to directly translate into benefits for you. Right. But you would feel good after I get it.

Speaker 3:          18:02          Like you wouldn't if you'd be a pretty twisted person if you were like, well, walking by like, well, how's that gonna make me feel after low, you should, you should do what to write. But I know what's right can often lead to all sorts of bad things. Um, but I think you could make a selfish argument for that. Like, you know, that if you walk by a child that you could easily help and you don't, you're going to feel shitty after if you have any shred of conscious. Well, right. So I hope, right. [inaudible] sociopaths I hope have that have that sort of psychological disposition. And as far as sort of ones. So I think also what morality is more concerned with is not just the good of the individual, but sort of the good of all. So I think sort of what the morally right thing to do is figuring out that decision.

Speaker 3:          18:42          So this is the kind of million utilitarian view that the right thing to do is basically that which produces the most good for everybody, not just an individual person. So it could be in some cases that, uh, a person's individual good, uh, comes apart from what's morally good. So you could imagine somebody who just has no desire to help other people. I would still say they're doing something morally wrong if they fell to help other people because they're not taking that person's welfare into account. Right. So where do you think morals come from? This has been an ongoing discussion on this show between, you know, talking to Jordan Peters and adventure peer and Sam Harris and Michael Shermer, Dennis Prager, and many others. And there's sort of a religious argument. I think there's a secular argument for it. Um, I think I'm somewhere in the middle. I think it's a really rich spot to figure out what people think about things.

Speaker 3:          19:28          Yeah. So that's, that's a, that's a hard question. Uh, I'm not sure I have a satisfying answer to that, but maybe in terms of the religious question, there's this very old argument from Plato at the Youth of flow dilemma. I'm not sure if that's ever popped up in conversation, but the idea is basically, uh, does, does God wills something because it's pious independently of God's will or is it pious because God wills it and Plato's view was, well, uh, it, it doesn't quite make sense to say that it's pious just because God wills it. Because you could imagine as a thought experiment that God willing all sorts of terrible things just as, as a thought experiment that, you know, if God wills us to torture it doesn't seem like that would make torture good. Um, and so it seems more plausible to think that, uh, there is sort of an independent standard of goodness.

Speaker 3:          20:17          Even, even if you are a theist, for example, and you believe in God and you believe God has this intimate connection to morality, I think even on views like that, it makes sense to say that, um, goodness is in some sense independent of the will of God. And so in terms of what more, that's again, sort of an evasive answer as to what, it's not a, where morality comes from. I mean, I'm inclined to say, I mean, it comes from sort of what's good for human beings and maybe other sentient animals. So what sorts of things satisfy or interest satisfy our preferences, causes us pleasure and pain, these sorts of things.

Speaker 2:          20:50          Do you think that subjective though, that different cultures obviously have different beliefs in different, you know, moralities and all sorts of things?

Speaker 3:          20:58          I would say it is not subjective in the, in the sense that, uh, different, different cultures having different moral beliefs would show that nobody's wrong in those debates. So it might be very difficult to determine who is wrong, but I don't think the mere fact that different cultures have moral standards shows that it's subjective. So by analogy, uh, you could imagine different cultures having different beliefs about astrology, for example. So some cultures think that astrology is legitimate enterprise are the ones, don't they disagree about that? But I think it's safe to say that there is in some sense and objectively correct answer about that. Uh, same thing with other sorts of scientific disputes. Right?

Speaker 2:          21:37          But do you think that that objective place, does that have to come from God per say? Or can it come from, I mean, the, the discussion that we've had a lot around here and that a lot of people in this space talk about basically is does objective morality either come from God and religion or does it come from enlightenment values? And then there's other arguments that it's only through religion that we got to enlightenment values in the first.

Speaker 3:          22:01          Yeah, that's tough. My hunch is that something like enlightenment values. Um, so I, I don't know, I'm somewhere in the agnostic space, uh, myself. Uh, and so I think that sort of philosophy guy, right, exactly. So it's hard not to, it's, it's hard not to be an agnostic. So yeah. So I'm agnostic, but I'm also Jewish. And so there's, it's all part of the kind of questioning, lack of certainty and so forth. Um, so I think that there is that there's enough reason to think that we have objective morality, even if you're not certain about the existence of God. Um, that, yeah, we shouldn't worry that morality is going to collapse if people become atheist and agnostic.

Speaker 2:          22:43          Right? Because when I've had this discussion, usually with conservatives, you know, they love to say, well, God gave us morality. You know what I mean? Your rights come from God. And for me it's like, I think you have, whether they're god, the God given rights, or it's your right freedom is your right as a human being or as optimus prime said, freedom is the right of all sentient beings. You don't even like, I think you are born free. I just think that's a, that's a humanistic approach or you're born free. The government can take away your freedom, but it doesn't give it to you. And I think that's just a really interesting place to go for all these political discussions.

Speaker 3:          23:15          I agree. So I that that's what I think that there are no right and wrong ways to treat other human beings that are just true independently of whether or not the state happens to respect them. And as soon as the kind of enlightenment thought, so John Locke's, I'd look in the state of nature, I would be wrong to kill you or assault you or steal your property. This is just the wrong way to treat human beings. It doesn't really have anything to do with the state. Now he might want the state to come in and protect those rights, enforce those rights and so on. But the rights of themselves, the standard of the right and wrong way to treat other people does not itself come from the state. So before we get into some of your, your, the specific arguments that you make on economics into a budget, how do you think are our founders got so much of this stuff right?

Speaker 3:          23:56          If I'm going on the assumption you believe they did, but I mean every time I go to DC and I go to the monuments and I read all of this stuff and I just was in Philly yesterday, I mentioned to you and I have now a copy of the I that little copy, like an old Republican senator of the declaration and the Declaration of independence had gone off the alarm at the, there was this thing with like, it would set off the Tsa alarms at the, Oh, this one's just standard, simple paper or whatever. It's probably, we'll set up some alarm somewhere. I'm sure. Um, if I go to San Francisco or something, I'm sure a constitution, it would set off an alarm. But, um, uh, I assume you think that they got a much of this stuff correctly. How do you think they, they did it?

Speaker 3:          24:33          Yeah, so I think that, I don't know. So I think that some of it, and this is a bit outside of my own area, but I think that a lot of them were influenced by a smart philosophers. People like, so I think the law, the influence of someone like lock on the constitution is pretty evident. The influence of somebody like David Hume on, uh, people like, uh, Madison. I think that's, I think that maybe that's a matter of controversy and history, but I think there's some evidence to suggest that. So I think that they were students of history students, a philosophy, students of economics, and this helped them get a lot. Right. And I think I, you know, obviously I think there were mistakes and the way that they applied it and, um, you know, the way that, uh, like Jefferson's, uh, omission of mentions of slavery and things like that. But I think in terms of like the fundamentals, a lot of that was informed by really smart philosophers and economists.
