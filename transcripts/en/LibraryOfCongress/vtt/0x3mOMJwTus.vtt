00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.200
&gt;&gt; T.J. Halstead: Good morning.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.180
I'm T.J. Halstead,
the Deputy Director

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.230
of the Congressional Research
Service, and it is my pleasure

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.060
to welcome all of you, our
distinguished panelists, guests,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.270
and friends of the
Library of Congress.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.830
And to thank you as well
for joining us today

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.220
as we celebrate Human Rights Day.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.340 position:56%
Human Rights Day is officially
observed every year on December 10th

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.170
to commemorate the adoption
of the Universal Declaration

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.360
of Human Rights by the General
Assembly of the United Nations

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.190
in Paris, on December 10th of 1948.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.660
The Declaration was designed
to provide a global framework

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.860 position:56%
for human rights following World War
II and the end of the Colonial Era.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.080
The Declaration can be
accurately characterized

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.130
as the first truly global
enunciation of human rights

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.500
and is considered the
most translated document

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.060
in modern history.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.980
It's available in more
than 360 languages

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.050
and new translations are
added on a regular basis.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.370
Given the status of the document,
its history and its impact

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.500
on legal systems around the
world, I think it is very fitting

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.090
that my colleagues at the
Law Library of Congress,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.590
the world's largest law library,
and a leading research center

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.020
for foreign comparative

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.550
and international law are
hosting today's event.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.230
Today's program, the Impact of the
Miranda Warning on Human Rights

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.920
in Eastern Europe will address how
American laws have affected human

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.970
rights developments in Romania
and the former Soviet Union.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.800
Before I introduce my friend
and colleague, Mr. Peter Roudik,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.120 position:56%
who will serve as today's moderator,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.450
I kindly ask that you switch your
mobile devices to silent mode.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.520
And please note that this
program is being videotaped

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.210
and will be presented later as a
webcast on the library's website.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.270
At this time, I welcome
Peter Roudik,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.180
head of the Law Library's Global
Legal Research Directorate,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.480
to the stage.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.000
Who will share more details
about today's program

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and introduce our distinguished
panelists.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.980
Peter. Thank you very much.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.280
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Thank you,
T.J. As T.J. mentioned,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.280
today we are celebrating
the adoption

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.200
of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights in 1948,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.310
which provides a global
framework for human rights.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.470
But today's event also
marks the 50th anniversary

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.770
of the 1966 Supreme Court
decision Miranda versus Arizona.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.910
Which the library has been
commemorating throughout this year.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.330
This landmark Supreme
Court ruling requires

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.070
that criminal suspects
will be informed

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.890
of their constitutional rights
at the time of their arrest

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.690
and before interrogation.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:01.320
[ Inaudible ]

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.410
Who discussed with us
procedural protections afforded

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.290
by the United States Constitution
and safeguards by the courts

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.090
and how they're essential
to our liberties.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.890
Then in July we hosted
the law and film event

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.420
which highlighted how the
[inaudible] the Miranda Warning has

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.510
evolved over the last fifty years.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.090
[ Inaudible ]

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.100
And that is why today we conclude
our commemoration of Miranda

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.630
by examining how this ruling
and American legislation

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.530
in general has served as an
inspiring example for those

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.210
who fight injustice
in other countries.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.980
Also it is not a coincidence that
today is the Anti-Corruption Day

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.360
which is celebrated on
this day since 2003,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.960
when the U.N. declaration against,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.990
convention against
corruption was adopted.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.850
Also the issues are interconnected,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.460
and all of those issues will
be discussed today during

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.760
our discussion.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.630
And that's why I'm honored to
present our distinguished speakers

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.380
to you who will discuss
the Miranda Warning

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.480 position:56%
and human rights in other countries.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.680
Today we are joined by Kyle Parker,
Senior Professional Staff Member

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.000
of the United States House

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.320
of Representatives
Foreign Affairs Committee.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.300
Dr. William Pomeranz, Deputy
Director of the Kennan Institute

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.150
for Advanced Russian Studies
of the Woodrow Wilson Center.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.610
Honorable Monica Macovei, member
of the European Parliament

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.710
and Former Minister
of Justice of Romania.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.450
She just came from Brussels
to participate in this panel

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.020
and [inaudible] really
thankful for that.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.060
And the Russian journalist,
historian

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.450
and [inaudible], Natella
Boltyanskaya.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.110
Of course you are waiting to listen
from our speakers, not from me.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.980
So I'm really honored
to present them for you.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.860
We have partition of scholars,
academics, politicians,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.810
and we will hear [inaudible]
from each of them individually

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.940
and then to have a discussion.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.510
At this time, please join me in
welcoming Kyle Parker to the stage.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:12.060
[ Applause ]

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.010
&gt;&gt; Kyle Parker: Thank you, Peter.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.060
It's, it's an honor to participate
in today's discussion here

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.900
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.580
My first job in Washington
was actually helping

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.560
to start the Library of Congress'
Open World program back in 1999.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.960
A program that was conceived
by Dr. Jim Billington,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.250
and academician [foreign
language] in, in Russia.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.380
It began as a high-level exchange
between Russia's Federal Assembly

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.110
and the United States Congress.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.130
And now as a Congressional Staffer,
I regularly rely on the expertise

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.200
of the Congressional Research
Service as well as the attorneys

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.100
at the Law Library to do my job.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.340
And frankly, one of
the best perks I feel

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.030
of being a Congressional Staffer
is the ability to go online late

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.010
at night at my house
and order a book

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.000
from the largest collection
in the world.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.610
And have it sitting on
my desk the next day.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.660
So it's good to be here.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.830
As, as you mentioned,
Peter, our conversation is,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.950
is especially timely in addition
to marking 50 years since Miranda

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.080 position:56%
versus Arizona and Human Rights Day.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.820
Yesterday marked 25 years since
signing of the Belavezha Bill

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.800
of Accords, which dissolved
the Soviet Union.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.790
So it's as good a time as any to
take stock of where we've been

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.910
and where we may be headed as a
new Administration takes power here

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.710
in Washington.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.190
Now under the new rules of
the House of Representatives,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.330
all legislation we
introduce must be accompanied

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.320
by a statement naming
the relevant parts

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.410
of the U.S. Constitution giving
Congress the authority to legislate

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.530
on the subject of the
bill to be introduced.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.220
So let me start off with what
I consider to be something

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.970
like a constitutional authority
statement for U.S. advocacy

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.300
on human rights in Europe.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.350
It comes from the organization
For Security and Cooperation

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.360
in Europe's 1991 Moscow Document.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.310
And states that, quote, "The
participating states emphasize

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.320
that issues relating to human
rights, fundamental freedoms,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.700
democracy and the rule of law are
of international concern as respect

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.510
for these rights and freedoms
constitutes one of the foundations

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.800
of the international order.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.640
It categorially and
irrevocably declare

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.990
that the commitments undertaken in
the field of the human dimension

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.690
of the CSCE are matters of
direct and legitimate concern

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.710
to all participating states.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.490
And do not belong exclusively

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.880
to the internal affairs
of the state concerned."

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.370
End quote.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.390
This unambiguous declaration
was reaffirmed

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.850
at the most recent
OSCE summit in 2010.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.060
And the commitments referenced
happen to be the richest body

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.800
of human rights commitments
that bind all

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.030
of the OSCE's 57 participating
states which of course includes all

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.620
of Europe, the countries
of the former Soviet Union

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.450
as well as the United States.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.120
Obviously, there are many other
reasons for the United States

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.920
to care about rights that are
universal and inalienable.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.610
But this is a pretty
good one to cite to those

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.830
who would dismiss our
concerns as meddling

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.370
in others' internal affairs.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.130
In fact, during my time at
the U.S. Helsinki Commission,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.360
I used this declaration
as my email signature.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.920
Now, I was asked to give the
American perspective and will do

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.030
so today as a practitioner of
human rights policy in Congress.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.630
And as far as human rights in
general and human rights in Europe,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.580
Congress leads the United States
government in advocating for

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.810
and legislating on
fundamental freedoms.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.910
As the branch of government
closest to American civil society

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.560 position:56%
which cares a great deal about human
rights, Congress often sees merit

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:06.540 position:56%
in ideas and causes that bureaucrats
and experts may find inadvisable,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.220
unrealistic, or even impossible.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.400
But it's precisely this
institutional tension

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.650 position:56%
that produced monumental human
rights legislation addressing abuses

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.120
in Eastern Europe since Miranda.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.320
These are the Jackson-Vanik
Amendment of 1974,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.510
the creation of the U.S.
Helsinki Commission in 1976,

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:32.360
and the Magnitsky Act of 2012.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.370
And most recently the Global
Magnitsky Act which is on its way

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.720
to the President's
desk for signature

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.620
as we speak here this morning.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.100
I spent nearly a decade
covering human rights in Russia

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.570
at the U.S. Helsinki
Commission which in the 1970s

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.300
and '80s was the lead
U.S. agency for advocating

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.960 position:56%
for Soviet dissidents, Jewish
refuseniks, and the captive nations.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.910
But during my time
on the commission,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.930
we focused on corruption
instead of communism.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.360
And while fighting corruption

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.800
and promoting human rights
is not the same thing,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.250
there's enough overlap to at least
allow the casual use of one term

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.060
to also include the other.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.170
In early 2009, I reluctantly
accepted a meeting

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.900
that would dramatically change how
I viewed human rights advocacy.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.840
Set a new precedent for how
the United States responded

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.330
to human rights violations
in Russia,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.720
and now offers a powerful
new mechanism

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.810
to address human rights
violations around the world.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.420 position:56%
And one that happens to be
uniquely suited for this current era

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.010
of shrinking budgets and
extreme transparency.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.280
This meeting was with Bill Browder,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.890
who previously managed the best
performing hedge fund in the world

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.760
and was for a time the largest
foreign portfolio investor

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.060
in Russia.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.470
I didn't know him personally, but
remembered him as being a champion

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.990
of Vladimir Putin's
early economic reforms

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.330
which made Browder's
expulsion from Russia in 2005,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.530 position:56%
all the more notable and perplexing.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.040
Bill came to tell the story of
his tax lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.460
who was in pretrial
detention in Moscow

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.750
for having exposed the largest
tax fraud in Russian history.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:17.040
And was being subjected to
increasingly torturous conditions.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.080
Sergei's story was remarkable
in that it was a departure

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.310
from the usual tale of wealthy
Russian businessmen who had fallen

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.800
out of favor with the Kremlin
and then were facing something

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.860
that might charitably be
called "selective justice."

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.780
But Sergei was a young, middleclass
Muscovite who was not involved

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.500
in politics, whose
client lost no money.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.380
And was seeking only to
understand what we now know,

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.250
thanks to Magnitsky's
heroic efforts,

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.800
to be an elaborate scheme involving
senior officials, organized crime.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.410
And the offshore zone to steal
at least a half a billion dollars

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.940
from the Russian Treasury
and launder it abroad.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.050
This fateful meeting with Bill was
the beginning of efforts outside

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.610
of Russia to save Sergei and later

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.740
to honor his commitment
to the truth.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.260
Now it's easy to get jaded on
the human rights beat in Russia.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.710
And work at the Helsinki Commission
in the Putin era was frustrating,

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.090
low profile, and with
few visible successes.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.280
The North Caucuses simmered
with low intensity conflict,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.820
creating a long list of victims of
forced disappearances and torture.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.140
Russia's free media
and civil society were

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.440
under increasing pressure.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.940
And the United States was
making a concerted effort

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.400
to improve relations
despite these obstacles.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.200
I speak in the past tense because
I no longer work at the Commission,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.620
but as we all know, the
Putin era continues,

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.140
and the situation has worsened.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.740
At the Commission, I saw my job
as scanning the horizon for cases

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.360
where our attention might be
able to make a difference.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.850
And for cases that would be of
particular interest to our bi--

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.830
our bipartisan Congressional
leadership.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.320
Not always an easy things to do.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.000
Whenever I learned of a case
that met these criteria,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.760
our usual approach was to try
and get a senior US official,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.650 position:56%
preferably the Secretary of State or
even the President to raise the case

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.260
with their Russian counterparts.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.760
Frequently, we would only
learn if the case was raised

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.230
in the broadest possible terms,
and usually from a response

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.680
from some lower ranking
official we didn't even write to.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.580
Thanking us for our
concerns, and assuring us

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.100
that they share the same concerns.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.220 position:56%
Basically, the sort of mealy-mouthed
letter that makes you even angrier

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.910
than had you been completely
ignored.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.310
And the Russian government
never paid any attention

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.680
to these interventions,
nor did the press.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.350 position:56%
And then another journalist or human
rights activist would be killed,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.230
with little hope of ever
finding those responsible.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.710
And we dash off yet
another press release,

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.370
condemning the latest
human rights outrage.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.380
It was all very unsatisfying,
but it was what we did

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.350
because we had to do something.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.580
In an attempt to be fair
and spread our attention,

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.210 position:56%
I had a few active files on my desk.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.400
And if I had been focusing
on one for a while,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.730
I'd try to focus on another.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.520
And somehow the sense that
there were probably thousands

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.730 position:56%
of cases much worse than the ones
we were aware of was strangely given

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:22.650 position:56%
as an excuse for not doing something
on the cases we did know about.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.210
In the summer of 2009,
human rights activist,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.780
Natalya Estemirova's
bullet-riddled body was found

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.210
on a roadside in Ingushetia.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.440
She had visited our Washington
offices not long before her death.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:40.290 position:56%
And it felt entirely inappropriate
to merely condemn her brutal murder.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:45.070
The time had come for action,
but again, what could we do?

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.650
At the Commission, Estemirova's
murder would be the last death

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.020
of an activist where our
response would be limited

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.390 position:56%
to the same old ineffective tools of
pleading for high-level US attention

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.590
and calling for investigations
that are unworthy of the name.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:03.810
A few months later, on November
16th, 2009, Sergei Magnitsky,

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.310
whose plight we learned about
earlier that year, was handcuffed

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.270
to a bed in an isolation
cell and beaten

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.830
by prison guards until he died.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.410
His torture and ultimately
murder was rigorously documented

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.530
in his detailed and
voluminous legal complaints.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.830
And by the bureaucratic

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.630
and authoritarian system
that killed him.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:29.030
Sergei was a young, idealistic
Muscovite who placed great hope

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.850 position:56%
in then-President Medvedev's promise

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.600
to end what Medvedev himself
had called "legal nihilism."

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.740
Only to become its
most emblematic victim.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.690
At the Commission, we
began work immediately

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.500
on assembling documentary
evidence of his false arrest,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.630
illegal detention,
torture, and murder,

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.340
as well as on the massive tax
fraud against the Russian people

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.850
that he gave his life to expose.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.510
We also combed federal
law for precedent

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.830
on how we could address his
case in the United States,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.690
given that a cover-up was
gaining speed in Moscow.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.980
We found a Bush-era executive order
called Proclamation 7750 giving the

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.900
President authority to bar foreign
persons engaged in corruption

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.200
from entering the United States.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.370
Losing a visa seemed a ridiculously
small strike at impunity.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.510
And we weren't even sure if any
of those involved planned --

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.400
visited or had planned
to visit our country.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.710
But in April 2010, Senator
Cardin, who was the Senate Chairman

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.520
of the Helsinki Commission,
and now the ranking member

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.000
of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.680
decided to send an open letter to
Secretary Clinton, including a list

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.850 position:56%
of 60 Russian officials complicit
in Sergei's false arrest, detention,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:50.160
torture, and death as well as those
involved in the crimes he exposed.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.710
And asked that she
use this authority

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.580
to publicly ban their entry.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.840
Given our previous
experience of sending letters

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.640
into a non-responsive void,
we didn't expect much.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.560
But after releasing this
letter late on a Sunday night

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.370
as Moscow was waking up on
Monday, we awoke in Washington

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.790
to fireworks in the Russian press.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.670
Dramatic headlines
in the Western press,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.300
and Secretary Clinton
wanted to see the Senator.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.210
If we can gauge our
effectiveness by their reaction,

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.620
this list was a direct hit.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.270
In fact, I think it was
Newsweek that ran the headline,

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.240
"Cardin Drops Bomb on
Russia's Corrupt Elite."

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.210 position:56%
And Russia's leading anti-corruption
activist, Alexei Navalny,

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:42.610
posted the list on his website
with a one-word headline: Wow.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:47.330
The [foreign language]
had become a rallying cry.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.280
We had finally discovered the
Achilles heel of corrupt officials

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.660
in Russia and around the world:
their exposure to the West.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.950
Having trashed the
rule of law at home,

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.730
they stash ill-gotten gains abroad
in countries where due process

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.690
that -- in countries with due
process that respect human rights.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.900
They also keep passports
with multi-entry visas handy

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.480
in case they fall out of favor
and need to make a quick exit.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.940
Moreover, ours was an
asymmetric response

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.560
that couldn't easily be countered.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.330
The Kremlin tried banning US
officials and freezing their assets

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.150
and were met by jeers
from their own citizens.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.760
They also tried banning
US officials they viewed

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.490
as having violated human
rights only to be drawn further

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.030
into a public conversation
on the importance

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.430
of protecting those rights.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.660
This new technology for
keeping human rights

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.190
on the agenda was also
a fairer response.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.320
It shamed individual violators
without saying anything

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.340
about their country as a whole

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.550
or blocking any business
deals or trade.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.270
Further, it was an
approach that cost nothing

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.890
and was easily replicable
in other countries quietly

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.820
or with public debate.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.890
In fact, this week Estonia
became the first European country

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.750
to pass a Magnitsky-styled law and
similar proposals are now pending

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.280
in the United Kingdom and Canada.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.920
In the coming months and years,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.470
we fought an uphill battle spanning
two Congresses to take this idea

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.210
that had the proverbial snowball's
chance into a new section

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.940
of the United States code.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.640
Throughout the campaign,
our greatest support came

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.450 position:56%
from Russia's besieged civil society

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.800
and from the International
Human Rights community.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.260
While our greatest resistance
came from the Administration,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.190
the Kremlin, and the trade
lobby, in that order.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.390 position:56%
In fact, it was the Administration's
proxy blocking in Congress that led

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.380
to the Magnitsky Act being tied to
Russia's Jackson-Vanik termination.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.610 position:56%
And it was the Administration's
desire to spare Russia that led them

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:51.110
to propose that Congress make
the act explicitly global.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.220
They later reversed course and
joined the House leadership

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.830
in insisting that it
be limited to Russia.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.030
The original Magnitsky Act also
set the stage for our response

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.200
to Putin's unprovoked and
illegal war in Ukraine.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.660
With many of the early targets

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.690
of the Magnitsky legislation
being added

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:12.480
to Treasury's specially designated
nationals' list by executive order.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.480
Should those sanctions ever
be removed prematurely,

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.210
here or in Europe, I suspect
that the Magnitsky Act will stand

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.280
as the most prominent rebuke

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.230
to the violent kleptocracy
currently ruling Russia

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.060
and menacing the entire region.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.540 position:56%
The new global Magnitsky Act builds
on the successes of the original act

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.610
and they prove a valuable tool
for the new Administration

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:41.090
to target human rights abusers
in China, in Iran, in Cuba,

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.620
or anywhere in the world.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.980
I hope they implement it
vigorously and I'm confident

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.800
that the Human Rights
community as well

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.250
as Congress will be
encouraging them to do just that.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.010
Thank you.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.500
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Thank you, Kyle.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.800
Dr. Pomeranz.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.100
&gt;&gt; Dr. Pomeranz.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.400
Well, thank you very much, Peter.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.980
It is always a pleasure to be at
the Library of Congress and to walk

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.610
by the Law Library of Congress.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.850
A brief story: I did a
Ph.D. for five years,

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.440
but I always like to say I have
five days I remember the most.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.160
And one of those five days
took place at the Law Library,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.880
and this may date myself, where I
was given a stack pass and allowed

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:24.680 position:56%
to go into the depths of the Library
of Congress, press some buttons

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.840
that I couldn't quite understand.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.450
But nevertheless, books began
to appear, and all of a sudden,

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.870
there in front of me was
the largest collection

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.860 position:56%
on the pre-revolutionary Advocatura,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.350
the legal profession,
in Czarist Russia.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:44.950
And I smiled because my Ph.D. had
gotten a huge lift that morning,

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.540
and it was all thanks
to the Law Library.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.700
And I proceeded to spend a
good three months digging

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.780
through what was available.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.740
And it was just a tremendous,
a tremendous opportunity.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.700
I'm going to follow on Kyle, but
take a little different approach

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.600
to the discussion of Miranda.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.290 position:56%
Because as was mentioned at the
beginning, our, our goal is not only

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.120
to look domestically but
also internationally.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.330
And looking at how US
law impacts foreign law

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.670
and influences human rights.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.330
I'll focus primarily on Russia
but I'm also going to talk

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.670
about other post-Soviet
countries as well.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.180 position:56%
And in the spirit of the Miranda
Warning, I'm actually going to delve

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.320
into criminal procedure within the
Russian criminal justice system,

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.720
but then expand to talk
about broader issues

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.680
about how the United States
promotes legal reform abroad.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.260
And at the very end, a general
discussion about the direction

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.860
of Russia's legal trajectory.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.280
Now to do so, I want to issue
one caveat at the beginning.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.430
I just finished reading
a fascinating

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.620
and in many ways upsetting
book called Just Mercy,

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.150
by the lawyer Brian Stevenson,
who details the problems

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.470
of wrongly condemned people
in the US justice system.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.710
Suffice it to say, when you have a
chance to read about the underbelly

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:10.300
of the US criminal justice system,
it has its fair share of problems

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.650
and unpleasantness as well.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.340
So I want to emphasize that the
Miranda Warning is always the

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.970
beginning of the process.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.450
It does not eliminate
necessary long-standing biases

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.750
within a legal system that
can lead to unjust verdicts.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.790
And that is true of all legal
systems and not just to Russia.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:34.230
But as I mentioned, I'm going to
begin with criminal procedure,

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.360
and I'm going to start
with the passage

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.620
of the Russian Criminal
Procedure Code in 2001.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:44.120 position:56%
Now, I was doing the math, and I
realized that was just 15 years ago,

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:49.800
but it really hearkens to another
era in Russian and Russian history.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:56.130
Because the Criminal Procedure Code
was signed by one Vladimir Putin.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.450
And at the time, it was
perceived in many ways

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.200
as a very important liberal reform.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.870
Transforming the Russian criminal
process and holding out the promise

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.470
of reforming the corrupt
Soviet legal system

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.830
that was still in place
inside Russia.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:18.650
Now, the 2001 Criminal Procedure
Code does possess a Miranda-style

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:24.560
warning stating that when a suspect
is detained or is in custody,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.500
that that person has
the right to know

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.200
of what he or she is suspected of.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.150
He or she has the right to
obtain documents related

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.000
to the instigation
of the criminal case.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.350
And that person has a
right to avail themselves

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.580
onto the advice of legal counsel.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.930
Yet 15 years afterwards,
few would argue

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:49.250
that the Russian criminal justice
system has lived up to that warning

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.610
or indeed to Western standards.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.620
And the question is why is this so?

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.410
Or to ask the question another way,

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.940
why has a Miranda-style
warning become superfluous

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.380
within the Russian legal system?

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.050 position:56%
And the answer can be found in a
fascinating statistic inside Russia,

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:13.490
and that is the conviction rate of
Russian criminals who go to trial,

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.420
and that statistic is 99%.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.980
Similar percentages exist in other
post-Soviet republics as well.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.820
And the question, when you look
at that, is how can that be?

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.380
Why is, why is it that
99% of all people

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.680
who go before the [inaudible],
face --

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.070
inside the criminal justice
system end up being convicted?

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.650
Now, on one hand you might think

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.870
that maybe Russia has some
outstanding criminal investigators

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:44.830
who are diligent and impartial and
always are able to get their man.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.020
But that really isn't the case.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.130
You also might think that it's
because of rampant corruption,

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.980 position:56%
and in certain economic cases, there
are plenty examples of corruption.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:00.780 position:56%
But the average Russian criminal
defendant is male, poor, uneducated,

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.820
and without any resources
necessarily to bribe a judge.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.290
So it's not really
corruption as well that,

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.520
that explains the 99%
conviction rate.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.750
The major problem, as
I would put forward,

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.710
and as Russian scholars
have themselves argued is

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.960
that the incentives are all wrong.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.880
What do I mean by that?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.490
Because when you look at how
certain legal institutions

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:31.210
and practitioners are
evaluated, they're evaluated based

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.030
on convictions and acquittal rates.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.490
So for example, if I'm a prosecutor
in Russia, and I want to get

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:40.900
on in the system, I will be judged

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:46.710
by how many acquittals have
resulted in my prosecutions.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.510
So in other words, acquittals work
against me if I want to advance

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.170
within the Russian
criminal bureaucracy.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:57.710
Similarly, if I'm a judge, I will
be evaluated by the percentage

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.880
of cases that are overturned.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.420
Again, most of the cases
that are overturned

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.480
in the Russian criminal
justice system are acquittals.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.290
So again, if I'm a part of the
legal, Russian legal bureaucracy,

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:14.540
I have certain incentives
not to break the system.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.220
And that is really not to
somehow challenge this fact

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.740
that Russia has a 99%
conviction rate.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.210
Now Russia has adopted
an adversarial system,

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.880
at least a trial, where a defendant
is represented by a lawyer,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.010
and the state is represented
by the prosecutor.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.800
But as I noted above, by
the time one gets to trial,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.020
the decision essentially
has been made.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.100
I once talked to a Russian defense
attorney and asked them, "Well,

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.060
what do you tell your client
before you go to trial?"

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.490
And he informed me he tells
them that they have a one

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.390
in 100 chance of getting off.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.950
Again, you can imagine
that, you know,

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.290
how that goes down with the client.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.620
But nevertheless, they, there
are people who are still willing

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.660
to fight within the system.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.730
But if you are somehow going to get
the charges dropped against you,

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.630
the crucial time to do it is
in the investigation process.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.500
And during the investigation
process,

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.970
the Russian legal system primarily
retains the inquisitorial system

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:16.450
that has so long prevailed
not only in the Soviet period,

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.820
but even in the Czarist
period as well.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:24.800
And during, under an inquisitorial
system, it is the investigator

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.560
that controls the investigation --

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.440
investigation, and
the course of inquiry.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.050
And in many cases, the advocate or
the lawyer, the defense attorney,

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.610
is appointed and paid by the state.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.510
And in order to keep
this steady stream

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:42.010
of appointments going is
unwilling to challenge the state.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.500
Now, criminal procedure code
does allow defense attorneys

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.500
to interview witnesses
and submit evidence

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.500
into the case file during the
preliminary investigation.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.830
But that evidence is assumed
to be bias in many cases

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.740
because it is submitted
by the defense attorney.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.650
Now you may ask, "Where is the
Russian judiciary in this process?"

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.480
Which is the logical
check on potential abuse

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.220
by investigators and prosecutors.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.520
And not surprising, the
judiciary is part of the problem,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.820
not the solution, as well.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:18.280
In the US and in other legal
systems, a appointment to a --

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.820 position:56%
to the judiciary is really the final
step in a career whereas in Russia,

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.920
one can become a judge
at the tender age of 25.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.170
Now, the also important aspect
of the Russian judiciary is

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:36.880
that it is drawn mainly from the
judicial bureaucracy prosecutors,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.700
court secretaries, and so forth.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.330
It is not drawn from
the defense attorneys,

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.960
the people who have the most
kind of practical experience.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.130
And that is for a variety
of reasons.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:52.410
But it means that the
judiciary is kind of overflowing

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.410
with people of the system.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.400
And so the long-standing biases

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.330
against the criminal defendant
perpetuate themselves.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:04.590 position:56%
And limit the impact of any
Miranda-style warning to defendants.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.090
And this leads to my second point.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:11.340
One that is well known but also
deserves to -- deserves repeating.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.640
And that is promoting human rights
and legal reform is not just

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.460
about establishing new
procedural guarantees

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.270
of what is written in the law.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.570
It also requires the
reform of institutions.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.870
And as we have learned

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.700
that post-Soviet legal institutions
have proven highly-resistant

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.000
to change.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.140
This is not just true
of the judiciary,

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.470
but also true of the
prosecutors' office.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:40.060
And the legacy, the Soviet legacy
that has affected prosecutors

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.930
and the position of prosecutors

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.790
in the post-Soviet space
has best been seen recently

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.590
in Ukraine and not in Russia.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:52.280 position:56%
And the assumption is again that
the prosecutor resembles an American

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.910
prosecutor or at least a prosecutor
in the continental system.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.540
Where their primary
responsibility is

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.110
to represent the state's
interest in court.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:04.410
And the answer in the
post-Soviet space is no.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.540
A Ukrainian prosecutor,
like a Russian prosecutor,

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.690
possesses far more administrative
and supervisory responsibilities

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.610 position:56%
than his or her Western counterpart.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.300
And the institution of the head

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.950
of the prosecutor's office is
also tied to a political leader.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.720
It is no accident that the
prosecutor's office has been known

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.960
as "the eyes of the state."

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.450
For almost three centuries
in post-Soviet Russia,

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:35.270
the Soviet Union, and
in the Imperial period.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:39.220
So when Ukraine began to
reform in the aftermath

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.530
of the Euromaidan Revolution
two years ago,

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.380
it gradually became
apparent that one

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:49.590
of the main stumbling blocks was
the prosecutor's office itself.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.310
The prosecutor's office
stood at the nexus,

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:57.430
and in many ways successfully
blocked three reform processes.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:02.240
Anti-corruption, the division
of powers, and the rule of law.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.660
And it was no accident that a
very frustrated Vice President,

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.850
Joseph Biden, felt necessary to
call the President of, of Ukraine

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.900
and demand that the head
prosecutor be fired.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:19.400 position:56%
Now, Poroshenko was very reluctant
to do so in part because his ability

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.450
to control the head prosecutor, who
reports directly to the President,

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.470
under the Ukrainian Constitution,
was one of the few sources

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.780
of leverage that the President had

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.590
within the Ukrainian
political system.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:37.760
But even though Poroshenko was
ultimately agreed to fire the Head

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.970
of the Prosecutor's Office,
he wasn't in a position,

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:45.090
was not in a position to
fire 18,000 other prosecutors

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.680
who were also tainted
by the previous system

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.490
who are also part of
the Soviet legacy.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:55.430
And that is the other, the --
the dilemma of the reform process

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.010 position:56%
that the United States tries to deal

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.100
with because the United
States prides itself

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.750
in evolutionary reform.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.400
But it's much more difficult
to pursue this notion

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.410
of evolutionary reform in a legal
system that is still weighed

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.910
down by Soviet legal institutions.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:16.210
Now what is required in order

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:20.990 position:56%
to address this problem is political
will, and we are still waiting

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:25.190
to see to what extent the
political will exists in Ukraine

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.210
to transform its legal system.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:31.010
Such political will is
noticeably lacking of course

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.620
in the Russian Federation.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.080
That is not to say that Russians
have necessarily abandoned their

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.490
legal system.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:42.300
One of the fascinating things about
Russian law, if you follow it,

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.310
is the increasing number of civil
cases that take place in Russia,

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.170
and the willingness of average
Russian citizens to turn

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:53.210
to the courts to address
everyday complaints.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:58.020
A leaky pipe, common spaces,
all these types of issues.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:02.050
And so the fact that so many
Russians are willing to turn

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.230
to the courts for everyday
civil suits is really one

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:09.230
of the under-appreciated
aspects of legal reform.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.840
And, and the nature of the
Russian legal system itself.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.850
People don't go through
the, the difficulties

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:18.880 position:56%
of pursuing legal cases unless they
have, believe, they have some chance

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.510
of resolution at a certain level.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:26.060
Nevertheless, Putin's return
to the Presidency in 2012,

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.160
has been accompanied by
a dramatic deterioration

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.440
in the human rights
situation in Russia.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.150
And Kyle has highlighted some of
those in terms of the legislation

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.750
that has been passed,
the foreign agents law,

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:43.230
the law restricting the right
to protest, freedom of assembly,

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:48.530 position:56%
anti-gay legislation, anti-blasphemy
legislation, and so forth.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:52.030
We've also seen the
politicization of the legal process

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.030
since Putin returned to office.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:59.230 position:56%
And again, there is a growing number
of cases that can be cited there.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.990
And finally, in the
aftermath of Crimea,

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:07.800
we now have the human rights
disaster in, in Crimea as well

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.780
as in Eastern Ukraine where
we really have seen kind

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.130
of the deterioration of any
sort of legal decisions.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:18.460
All those issues impact
human rights in Russia today.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.160
All of them need to be followed.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:25.270
All of them need to be included in
any assessment of the rule of law

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.660
and Russia's legal trajectory.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:32.260
But as, as, as I draw to the end of
my, my comments, I'm going to focus

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.850
on another alarming development
in Russia's legal devel--

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.790
, legal evolution over
the past year.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:43.550
And that has been a decision by the
Russian legislature to pass a law

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.430
that allows the Russian
Constitutional Court

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.180
to overturn decisions by the
European Court of Human Rights.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.080
Now one cannot underestimate
how important Russia's decision

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.510
to join the European -- to
sign the European Convention

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.010
for Human Rights.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.310
And become a part of the
European Court has been.

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:04.290
It has allowed Russians to
appeal human rights infractions

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:05.590
to Strasbourg.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.470
It has allowed -- Strasbourg in
turn has imposed significant fines

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:14.350
on the Russian government that it
has, that is has to pay in order

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.900
to address human rights violations.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.410
And finally, Russian courts
have referred to the Convention

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:25.260
and to individual European Court
rulings when making their decision.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.270
So if you want to look at
the evolution of Russian law

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:32.000
and how foreign law has been
able to penetrate Russian law,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.310 position:56%
one of the best examples to date so
far has been the European Convention

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.340
and European Court decisions.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.470
Now, as I mentioned in 2015,

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.810
Russia established a mechanism
whereby the Russian Constitutional

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.830
Court can overturn
European Court decisions

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.070
that violate the Russian
Constitution.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:56.290
Now, admittedly, European countries
have been very good at finding ways

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:59.630
to avoid implementing European
Court decisions themselves,

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.340
but they have never gone so far

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:04.240
as to establish a specific
legal procedure

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:10.620
that allows a domestic court to
overturn a European Court decision.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.120
The Russian Constitutional Court
has already done so in one case,

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.630
in a prisoners' voting
right, rights case.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:19.460
And it looks like it's
going to do so again

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.860
in a upcoming [inaudible] decision.

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.610
So therefore, as someone who
monitors human rights in Russia,

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.190 position:56%
I will be paying strict attention to
how the relationship between Russia

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.630
and the European Court
of Human Rights evolves.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:36.960
It has been severely tested in the
past, but Russia has never been

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.870
so bold as to leave the European
Convention or to walk away

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:43.920
from Europe, but it will
come under increased scrutiny

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.730
and pressure going forward.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.470 position:56%
I should add that the Constitutional
Court in Russia will also be coming

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.970
under increased scrutiny.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:53.310
One of the first reforms that
Vladimir Putin did when he came

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:56.950
to power was abolish one of
the high courts in Russia,

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:01.310
the higher commercial courts, and
rolled it under the Supreme Court.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:05.270
I think there's a genuine fear that
Putin will take a similar approach

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:09.430 position:56%
to the Constitutional Court and roll
it under the Supreme Court as well.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:14.050
So in conclusion, I think we
are as again, Kyle mentioned

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.000
and I'm sure everyone is aware,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.390
we are really entering a new
period of US-Russian relations.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:23.000
And it, it remains unclear

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.120
in many ways what role
human rights will play

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.050
in US-Russian relations
going forward.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.780
Part of the challenges,
challenge will be to focus

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.780
and to highlight those human
rights abuses inside Russia

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.600
and around the world as well.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.530
The other part of the
challenge, however,

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:44.440 position:56%
is to live up to our own ideals
which are in so many ways symbolized

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.830
by the procedural protections

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.950
and guarantees articulated
in the Miranda decision.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:51.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Thank you, William.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.550
Miss Macovei, please.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.050
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: Do
you mind if I speak here?

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.660
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Yes, please.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.290
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: I'm
used to speak standing.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.110
Are they working?

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:06.190
Yes. I used to speak standing.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.720
Hello, everyone.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.870
And I'm happy to, to make,
have made such a long travel

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:13.650
to be here with you today.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:20.240
And I also am happy that about this
coincidence that we celebrate the,

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:25.710
the Anti-Corruption Day,
International Anti-Corruption Day

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.860
and the International
Human Rights Day.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.850
One is today; one is tomorrow.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.350
Today is Anti-Corruption Day.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:34.540
Tomorrow is -- is Human Rights Day.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.140
And maybe that's not
the coincidence.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:40.750
We can't talk about civil
rights in a corrupt country,

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:45.160
in a country where the, that
the state [inaudible] captive

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.460
to corruption.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:55.600
Now, listening to my previous
speakers, to the previous speakers,

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.590
I see some common background.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:03.800
I also served as a member
and then as a President

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.980
of the Romanian Helsinki Committee.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.380 position:56%
I know is different than your
Helsinki Commission in the Congress,

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:15.200
but it deals with human rights
and I took to the European Court

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.640
of Human Rights to which you last
referred as a civil rights lawyer.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.840
I took about 20 cases all

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.450
for Romanians whose rights have
been violated by the state.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:32.170 position:56%
And I won them all, and that was one
of the happiest period in my life,

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.080
to, to write these applications.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:40.180 position:56%
Most cases referred to people beaten
up by the police or even killed

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.690 position:56%
after being beaten up by the police.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:49.630
Also property cases and
generally it's being imprisoned

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:52.660
for criticizing political figures.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.490
Imagine at the beginning
of ninety, we ratified --

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:58.130 position:56%
the [inaudible] ratified the
European Convention of Human Rights.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:03.400
Ninety-four, politicians
didn't like, didn't want,

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:09.760
didn't accept that they are
criticized by, by journalists.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.740
So we had criminal offenses
to take them to prison.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.750
They were called "offense
against authorities."

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:18.340
So a politician was the
authority itself of the state,

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.800
so if you criticize the
politician, insult the politician,

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.310
then you insult the authority of
the country and you go to prison.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.760
Okay, this time are gone,
but this European Convention

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.200
of Human Rights helped a lot
and all these case helped a lot

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.280
to change the country and I
assume not only in Romania,

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.560
in all these countries in
Central Eastern Europe.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.730
On Miranda Rights,
yes it also helped --

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:52.370
I am supposed to speak about this
in, in Central Eastern Europe

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:59.420
and in the Balkans but I will just
-- one significant difference.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:06.160
We informed the accused people of
their rights, including the right

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.940
to keep to silent, including
the right to have a lawyer,

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.980
including the right that anything
you can say can turn against you.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.510
But it happens not the moment
you are taken from the street,

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.790
if you are taken from the street.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:22.910
But the moment when you are
interrogated as a suspect.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:31.880 position:56%
So because you consider a person to
be arrested after he's kept a number

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:37.550
of hours during interrogations.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:42.440
Or it could be one hour and then
it's a, it's an arrest warrant.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.920
But not when you are taken from
the streets, from the barbershop,

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.350
from your house, and so on.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:53.400
So we apply it but not
the same moment as you.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.120
In the European Union, we
have a, human rights charter,

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.510
and also we have minimal
standards for the defendants.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:06.550
And informing the defendants or the
accused people about their rights,

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.800
it's one of this minimum standards.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.380
And also referring to foreigners
we have to do it in the,

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:17.800
in the language they understand.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:24.740
Now I said at the beginning
that it's not a coincidence

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:30.230
that Anti-Corruption Day and
Civil Rights Day are so close,

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:38.310
like in one because in a
corrupt society, we cannot speak

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:43.520
and we cannot [inaudible] there
are civil rights respected.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:49.320
Corruption creates a double
reality like, like those mirrors

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.960
in which kids look and the,
the reality is different.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.330
And their, their bodies
are deformed.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:44:00.270
I don't know exact word in English,
but that's what corruption creates.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:05.870
Because if you have a, a judgment
of a judge based on corruption,

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.850
then you create a parallel
reality, another reality

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.700
which is determined by corruption.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.280
If you have a government
decision based on corruption,

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.920
then again, it's another reality.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.350
If you have a building
permit based on corruption,

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.150
then it's another reality.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:24.640
All of these are legal
reality, but they're realities

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.870
because they happened in reality.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:30.210
That's what I'm saying that it's
a parallel reality determined

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.510
by corruption.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:36.690
And that we can't speak
about civil rights.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:42.490
In the [inaudible]
countries, we all have politi--

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.040
high-level political corruption.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.290
And I'd like to defer to this.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:50.860
And looking back, looking
back, I'm sorry --

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.840
I have flu, but I think
you can understand me.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:00.370
I said in the former
communist countries,

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:04.530
we all have high-level
political corruption.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:05.830
Thank you.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.130
But it's very cold.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:11.070
You use a lot of ice.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.680
[Laughter] A [inaudible]
would be better.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.980
It's fine.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:23.220
A thing that in 1990,
we had to move from,

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.810
from a state which was
dominant by the government,

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.550
the communist government
to democracy.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.560
And from the state economy
to the market economy.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.360
Do you want some water with ice?

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.660
[Laughter]

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.220
&gt;&gt; I have some as well.

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:44.000
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: Now, this,
this means that we had to,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.250
that a lot of money, large
amounts of money had to move

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:50.600
from state hands to private hands.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.230
Think of privatizations.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.860
Yes? We all said the state
is a bad administrator.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.700
We need to privatize.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:03.550
So huge, huge values moved
to the private hands.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:06.730
Then we need to redo the
infrastructure again, by whom?

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:12.340
By private companies
which were just forming.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.890
And again, large amounts
of money moved

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:18.260
to the private companies,
to the private hands.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:24.500
Now these were opportunities which
were taken right away by the people

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:28.830
who didn't think of freedom, of
democracy, but they thought how

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.960
to make money in these
[inaudible] times.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.480
And we did privatizations and
all these public procurement

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.520
without even, at the beginning,
without even having laws.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:44.750
It was just a law for this
case, and then another law

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.300
for another case of privatization.

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.280
Or the laws were in
continuous changing.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:56.420
So in a way it was
inadvisable to reach this point.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:04.430
Also the judiciary was very,
was afraid, was, was poor.

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:09.190
The law enforcement was even, the
police officer were even afraid

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:16.120
to go on the streets for not being
-- I can't say killed, but --

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:20.840
but being molested by
the, by the people.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.000
And the also the judiciary
was not trained.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.900
No one knew at that time what was
money laundering, for instance.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.450
Or many other crimes
which exist today.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:35.880
Also the, the accountability
of the politicians in front

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.410
of the population was very low

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:41.390
because people didn't know
what accountability was.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:45.790
Yes, they were used that what
politicians do and say, that's it.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:47.090
It took time.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:51.790
All this took time, but during this
great time, we got this oligarchs.

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:57.640 position:56%
We call them the same like in Russia
which means you get political power,

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.140
then you also are a businessman.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.010
And then you realize
that you need the media.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:05.200
And so they bought
the media as well.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:09.450
And now we have not only Romania
and all countries in the region,

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:12.510
we have oligarchs owning the media.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.470
And they all declare
their activities,

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:15.960
like the most independent
news [inaudible].

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.970 position:56%
They don't have at least the
honesty to say, "Okay, this belongs,

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.850
this TV's broadcasting for this
party," for at least the people

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:26.260
to know to what they look.

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:38.510 position:56%
Now, all, all television, all radios
are the most independent news post.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.090
So that's a problem we have.

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:46.180
I'll come back to and I'll
give you some examples

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:49.870
of fighting corruption
in this countries.

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:54.500
Now when, when you say,
"We, we fight corruption,

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:59.740
political corruption," it means
you have corrupt politicians.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.560
So fighting political corruption
could be a contradiction in terms

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.220
because if you have
corrupt politicians,

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:13.610
you go to this corrupt politicians
and ask them to adopt legislation

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:16.530
which would go against themselves.

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.600
Yes? Which would take
them to prison,

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.460
which would confiscate
their assets and so on.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.590
No. I succeeded to do this in
Romania when I was a Minister

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:32.710
of Justice two years before
Romania's accession to the EU only

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:35.120
because it was pre-accession.

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.950
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:40.690 position:56%
And I was fired after the accession.

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:45.730 position:56%
They said, "Enough anti-corruption."

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:50.670
It's -- so politicians, if they
have to choose between the good

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:55.370
of the country, the public
good, and their own freedom,

00:49:55.370 --> 00:50:02.030 position:56%
assets and their wellbeing, no doubt
that they will choose in that area

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:05.970 position:56%
of the world, they will choose
their personal interest and freedom.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:10.050
And not the, not the big good,
and not the good of the country.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:15.340
And they don't even care what the,
you know, what ambassadors say,

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.690
what the EU says, what NATO says.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:22.700
No, they care about themselves
to not go to prison or to,

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:29.630
to keep their assets out,
outside any confiscation.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:32.330
And I'll give you an example.

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:35.470
So I became, I came
from the civil society.

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.800
I [inaudible] the civil telephone
from the then-elected president,

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.160
and I became a minister without
being part of any political party.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.390
That's possible in Romania.

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:49.340
And the argument was if
we really do the fight

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.840
against political corruption,
then the Minister

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.420
of Justice should not
be a politician.

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.250
Okay. This convinced me.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:58.920
And so -- sorry?

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:06.430
So here I was with a
political government.

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:09.150
I was supported by
one of the parties,

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:15.160
four parties in a coalition, but
I had my objective and my way.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.520
And I remember the first -- I set

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:20.510
up the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's
Office, and I said, "You know,

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:23.210
you investigate anyone
based on evidence.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:27.160 position:56%
It doesn't matter if it's the person
is in power or in your position."

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.230
Which never happened before.

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:31.730
And it happened that
the first person

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:36.460 position:56%
to be investigated was a Vice Prime
Minister of the government I was in.

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:41.490 position:56%
So the news appear in the newspapers
and then had the government session.

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:44.760
And the Prime Minister
said, "Monica,

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.020
I thought we were after
the opposition."

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:50.620
So I said, "We don't
go after anyone.

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.690
We are not hunting here.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:54.270
It is based on evidence.

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.700
And my understanding
is that I joined a team

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.980
where anyone is investigated

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:03.740
from this government or
from the opposition."

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.970
And you know, in time things
will, will be balanced

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.300
because it's a trans-party,

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.790
trans-party organized
crime or corruption.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:18.310
Now who is first or who is second,
you know, it is based on evidence.

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:21.320
Well anyway, all these government
look at me like a twin enemy.

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.240
They said we have the Minister
of Justice in the government

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.320
that we are investigating?

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.920
I said, "Yes, that's life."

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.750
And then the Prime
Minister tried to --

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:38.070
I'm telling you this story just to
realize how, how the history goes.

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.470
And the Prime Minister
didn't give up.

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:45.840
And he said, "Okay, but maybe
you find the channel a way

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.380
to build the channel between
the prosecutors and me,

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:53.310
the Prime Minister, and I
would know before anyone else

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:57.220
who is investigated from the
Parliament or from, you know,

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.570
high position level

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:01.400
in that administration
or from the government."

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:08.100
And we all know that there are
periods of civic surveillance, yes?

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.920
So I said, "No, you will not know.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.980
I don't know, and you
will not know."

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.280
And you know what?

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:20.360 position:56%
It's shock -- it's funny to say no
to a Prime Minister or to your boss.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.110
They never expect that.

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:24.250
They don't know how to behave

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:27.340
because everyone said,
"Yes, Prime Minister.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.170
Yes, Prime Minister, yes."

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.670
And [inaudible] and I said, "No,
you'll not have such a channel.

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:35.560
No, I'm not signing this,
or no, I don't do this."

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.490
And I realized that the
beginning, it's a shock.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:41.980
They don't know what to say.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:46.320
And it's in your advantage.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:51.480
So I, in a way, now we do very well
with anti-corruption in Romania

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.400 position:56%
because we have this anti-corruption
directorate from the prosecutors,

00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:04.210 position:56%
and they are embedded in a, in a, in
the body with financial specialists.

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:07.910
They do financial [inaudible]
for money laundering.

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:12.380
Also, also [inaudible] experts
of [inaudible] judiciary police.

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:17.980
It was very difficult to keep
this body alive and not being,

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.500
and avoid being dismantled
by politicians.

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.740
But we have so far succeeded.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:27.530
We use the American Embassy,
we use the European Union,

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:32.160
use to a different [inaudible]
factors to keep it going.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.510
And the people have trust
in this institution.

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:38.100
It's about 80% trust.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.590
In the political parties, it's 10%.

00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:44.140
But still people don't
go on the street,

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.680
you know, to defend institutions.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.270
They don't have [inaudible]
to, to, to go to demonstrate.

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:53.560
But it's there.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.690
What I noticed is that I --

00:54:55.690 --> 00:55:01.780
okay, I expected the day in which
politicians told the judiciary will

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.320
say, "Okay, it's time to stop.

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.620
They catch us.

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.280
We did it, now we stop."

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.940
No, this day don't
come, doesn't come.

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.970
And I'm sure it will never come.

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:17.500
What I notice is that for
the last over ten, ten years,

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.600
they tried to find more
sophisticated ways.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.900
And I give you an example.

00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:24.370
We had the last year
a Minister of Finance

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:27.440
in office was taken by,
from the barbershop.

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:34.660
What he was doing, he was buying
paintings, and he built in one

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:39.230
of his many houses
double walls to hide them.

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:44.910 position:56%
Or we had judges who stopped the
elevator between two floors thinking

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:49.960
that interceptions -- they thought
they could be intercepted, so they,

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.850
they thought they could
be investigated thinking

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.840
that their [inaudible] would
not pass through the walls.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:02.260
So they just can't
refrain from being corrupt.

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:06.490
Or we had another judge who got
21 years in prison for instance,

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:10.130
last year, or this year -- 2016.

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:16.100
Was calling the clients in
his cases in the toilet --

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.880
I'm sorry, but that's how
it happened, in the toilet,

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:25.810
flushing the water, hoping that the
interception could be, you know,

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:27.790
his voice could be covered by this.

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:30.090
It's incredible.

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:33.610
But all these people are caught.

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:39.190
And I'm just telling you how, you
know, how their brain functions not

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.510
to stop, but to find
different ways to escape.

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:48.090
So they're caught and they are --
they, they are sent to [inaudible].

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:52.750
We have a lot of Ministers
of Finance, of --

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:57.060
of Finance, of all
sorts of Ministers.

00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:00.210
Foreign Minister, Foreign Prime
Ministers, Sitting Ministers.

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:05.480
We have four sitting
Finance Ministers arrested

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:10.420
and in different stages of the,
of the judiciary procedure.

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.520
We had to appoint the, this
year when the one wanted --

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.820
last year when the one wanted

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:17.720
to be the Finance Minister
they are all afraid.

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:22.360 position:56%
Because all were taken for --
[inaudible] one of them and another.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.190
Now we have corruption, but
we fight it efficiently.

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:30.760
My problem is that the countries in
the region, Central Eastern Europe,

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.610 position:56%
they have corruption, the same level

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.780
of corruption or they
don't fight it.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.110
They don't have efficient
institutions.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:41.700
Now -- and I'm finishing right now,

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:47.610
I want to say looking
back how we succeeded.

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:50.890
One single person can make it.

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:54.000
You don't need -- you can't
do it through the system.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.290
The judiciary system in
itself will never change.

00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:59.100
People don't like the change.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:03.380
They don't like to change their
habits to learn new legislation,

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.770
to change their [inaudible]
friends, you know.

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:09.260
They don't like change.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:13.910
They don't -- they like
their old, nice, good life.

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:17.300
So don't expect the professional
category to come and to say,

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:19.970
"We want to change ourself," no.

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:25.000
You need an agent of change
like, like an engineer would,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.800
would explain you how your
system is, is broken by small --

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:47.370
Help me. [Laughter] Okay, small
holes done by sharp instruments.

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:53.020
So this agents of change
come from outside.

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.600
So it's enough, one.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:00.330
Then you find someone in the
system because you find one or two

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:02.390
or three people in the
system who are good

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:04.140
and professional and
really independent.

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.990
And that's enough.

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:10.510
And then they bring
other people like them,

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:12.080 position:56%
and the system will build by itself.

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:15.830
It's just need the
first one who has the --

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:18.800
who should have the
power to do it, yes?

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:23.680
The political power and
the stubbornness and the --

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.530
to take the risk because
you have to take the risk

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:28.330
to do it, to do it, to start it.

00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:31.050 position:56%
And then it, it, it works by itself.

00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:39.250
As, as you say, you know, the
-- the ball is, is rolling.

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:49.560
And I'd like to, to quote
something which I like very much.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:55.620
One or it is said by more people,
one of them was Mark Twain.

00:59:55.620 --> 01:00:01.520
He said that two categories
of people on this earth.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:07.900
The first category are the people
who adapt themselves very easily

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.510
to the surrounding world.

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:15.700
The second category is
formed of the people who want

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:20.670
to adapt the surrounding
world to themselves.

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:24.920
Who do you think are the
people who bring the progress?

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:30.840
Those from the second
category who want

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.440
to adapt the world to themselves.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.990
Like I have a dream --
Martin Luther King, yes?

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.950
It is enough one person
with a dream.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:45.580
And then more and more and
more people so the same.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:51.040
We have to look for this one,
for this individuals who want to,

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.960
to adapt their world to themselves.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.670
And that's the only way to
make progress in civil rights,

01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:02.740
in anti-corruption, in democracy,
in anything we want in our life,

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.770
in our cities, in our countries.

01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:06.070
Thank you.

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:09.140
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Thank you so much.

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:10.440
[Inaudible] game changers.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.740
But it's good, even better

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.950
when those game changers
are supported from outside.

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:15.250
And that's why I would

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:18.760
like to invite our next
speaker, Ms. Boltyanskaya.

01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:24.490
&gt;&gt; Natella Boltyanskaya: My good
luck is to speak about good people

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:27.880
because the gentlemen
and ladies were speaking

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.590
about the corrupted people.

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:32.180
I want to tell you about Americans

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:35.540
who supported human rights
movement in the Soviet Union.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:41.600
It started in the middle of fifties
because before Stalin's death,

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.210
it was impossible to
support human rights movement

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:50.190
because it was impossible to
find any human rights movement.

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:53.550
Every -- resistance was
suppressed very harsh.

01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:57.610
So at my first picture, you
can see faces of the persons

01:01:57.610 --> 01:02:02.230
who [inaudible] they
were outstanding persons

01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:05.440
in the supporting of human rights
movement in the Soviet Union.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.510
Between them you can
see some Presidents,

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:11.120
and of course Congressmen
and Senators.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.750
Of course they are not all of them.

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:16.030
I think that during my study,

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:20.670
I will try to complete
the list of those persons.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:26.820
So let me start with the
support of American legislators.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.120
What did they do?

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.860
They attracted public
attention to the numerous cases

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.030
of the human rights
violation in the USSR.

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:40.170
Of course, they used mechanism of
economic and political pressure.

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:44.370
They, it was going far beyond
the political confrontation

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:48.740
with the Soviet system because
of course American legislators

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:53.990
and America itself had some wish
to restrict the Soviet Union.

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:56.450
But when we see, for
instance, that picture.

01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:59.040
It is small picture,
but the picture --

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.130
we can see Senator Kennedy who
was meeting former refuseniks

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:08.160
at the board of their plane
which came to Boston from Moscow.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.270
And it was not obligatory
for him to do it.

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:14.140
It was just his wish to do it.

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:19.560
And of course this support
of American legislators,

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.800
it was dictated by
the fail of the spread

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.220
of communist ideas in the USA.

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:33.220 position:56%
I read some investigations, some
hearings, Congress hearings in 1934.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.730
It was conversation with
leader of American communist.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:39.490
"Guys, I am afraid of him
because he was very --

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:44.260
he was ready to do
every cruel things

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:48.160
that Russian communists
have already did."

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.160
What was the origin of idea?

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:56.890
I think that I can speak about
National Security Council report.

01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:00.880
United States objectives and
programs for national security.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.880
It was the first time when
they mentioned that they want

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.260
to find some groups of people in
the Soviet Union and encourage them

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.860 position:56%
to initiate some national movements.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.140
There were two persons whom
I should mention, obviously.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.310
First of them is George Kennan.

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:19.720
He was a diplomat and historian.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.240
His first action was famous long
telegram which was sent from Moscow

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:33.890
to America in 1946, in which
he was talking about need

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:36.410
to resist the Soviet propaganda.

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:40.350
But he speaks that all Soviet
propaganda [inaudible] is basically

01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:43.510
negative and destructive.

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:47.270
It should therefore be
relatively easy to combat it.

01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:53.390
When second his big deal was
a political warfare in 1948.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:56.740
It was the idea of public
committee working closely

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.370
with the US government to
sponsor various activities.

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:05.190
And in 1949-1950, he
started two committees.

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:09.310
It was Free Europe Committee, and
American Committee for Liberation

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:12.510
of Nation of Russia from Communism.

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:20.050
[ Inaudible ]

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:23.500
And East European people.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:28.840
So we can show the first step,
it was [inaudible] radio in 1947,

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:32.020
Voice of America begins
Russian broadcasting.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.720
It was not political radio.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.140
The goal of it was to
show the political --

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:44.020
the cultural and eventual life
of America to Russian listeners.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.260
The other, from the other hand,

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:51.680 position:56%
Soviet Union perceived every foreign
broadcasting in Russian as trying

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.430
to influence to their
internal affairs.

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:59.400
In 1950, a Radio Free
Europe goes on the air.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.100
It was the radio from the
countries of Eastern Europe.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.230
And in 1953, Radio Liberation.

01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:06.000
Later, Radio Liberty.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.080
It's interesting that the
first broadcasting day

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:11.240
of Radio Liberty was that
very day when Stalin died.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:18.810
And at that very day, it
was Representative Kersten

01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:20.720
who first told in Congress

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:24.000
that we should support
Russian civil [inaudible].

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.370
But first I will tell you about
national intelligence estimates.

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:33.490
Anti-communist resistance potential
in the [inaudible] Soviet bloc.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.520
Unbelievably interesting reports.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.910
Believe me: 1955, 1958 and 1966.

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:42.210
What do they do?

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:43.510
What did they do?

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:48.180 position:56%
They tried to eliminate ability to
resist from inside the Soviet Union,

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:52.080
from inside the China,
and some other countries.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.930
Now let me tell about my
favorite gentleman, Mr. Kersten.

01:06:55.930 --> 01:07:01.940
So he not only told about ability
of resistance, in 1951, him --

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.780
it was Kersten Amendment which
directed Congress to appropriate

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.400
about 100 million annually

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.170
to support resistance
behind the Iron Curtain.

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:16.040
And to support their refugees who
would come to other countries.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.290
In 1953, it was creation
of the Select Committee

01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:21.760
to investigate the
incorporation of Lithuania, Latvia,

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.090
and Estonia into the USSR.

01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:26.920
In 1954, this committee replaced

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.530
by the Select Committee
on Communist Aggression.

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:34.050 position:56%
Of course they investigated not
only penetrating of the Soviet Union

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:38.750
to the Baltic States, but also
to the states of Eastern Europe.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.880
And committee's activity.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.580
Public hearings in the United
States and many other countries.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.460
Testimony of many witnesses

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:52.260
and approximately 1500
[inaudible] investigations.

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:55.980
And after the committee
completed its study,

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:59.620
its findings were presented
in 27 reports.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:03.090
I think that the activity
of Mr. Kersten

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:04.900
and his committee was
some kind of [inaudible]

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:09.030
because between his
Congress activity,

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:12.520
he worked with Mr.
[inaudible] and he,

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:19.290 position:56%
it was he who also investigated
cases of internal communist problems

01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:22.160
in the United States of America.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.250
Up to me, maybe could be very cruel

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:28.140
because the real people
were in prison.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:33.880
But again, I will repeat that
America was scared by spread

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.760
of communist, communism
inside the country.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.060
Some facts about this committee.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.340
The committee was assisted
by Department of State,

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:47.660
United States Information Agency,
Committee for a Free Europe

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:52.300
and [inaudible], [inaudible]
administrations,

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:55.680
and the Legislative Research
Service of the Library of Congress

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.250
in Georgetown University.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.420
First, investigation was
about the Baltic countries.

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:05.810
If you look at the left part of
the picture, you can see very back

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:09.110
of Congressman Kersten and
there you can see some woman.

01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:11.450
She doesn't wearing hijab.

01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:17.020
It's Lithuanian woman who is giving
her testimony and she's afraid

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:21.160
because her relatives could
be suppressed in Lithuania.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:25.210
So there were many hearings,
there were many witness.

01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:26.510
I read the book.

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:29.360
It was really outstanding book.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:34.510
Beginning of the page, you can
see the report of New York Times

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:40.650
about the Soviet invasion to the
Baltic countries in 1904-- 40.

01:09:40.650 --> 01:09:45.270
The second topic of Kersten
Committee was Soviet Jewry,

01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:47.680
and I think that he
just opened the way

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.990
to the other numerous
commissions and committees

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:52.720
which supported Soviet Jewry.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.280
Because in 1955, it was hearings
and investigation treatment

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.110
of the Jews by the Soviet.

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:01.590
There were two resolutions.

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:08.990
And after Mr. Kersten, in 1963,
many American Jewish organizations,

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:11.850 position:56%
they pushed Congressmen and Senators

01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:14.720
to do something to
support Soviet Jewry.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.770
And if you will look to the list
of emigration, Jewish emigration

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:23.120
from the Soviet Union, you see that
only after America participated

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.840
in this fighting, this
number increased a lot.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:32.590 position:56%
So in October 1963, just [inaudible]
17 requests to the Secretary

01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:34.820
of State from different
Congressmen with the questions

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.890
about the plight of Soviet Jewry.

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:43.660
And ever request is accompanied by
a lot of requests from the people,

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:46.480
from the residents of different
Congressional districts

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.260
and they are asking Mr.
Congressman, help us.

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:51.560
Help them.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.860
Help them.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:57.800
And I saw also three requests from
senators to the Secretary of State.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.190
They speak about the sale
of grain to the USSR.

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:05.410
We see economic [inaudible],
and they ask if it is possible

01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:11.040
to underline that the
[inaudible] would be available

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.340
for making [inaudible].

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:16.070
It's 1963.

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:19.920
Some quotes, I [inaudible]
will not repeat them.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.350
They are quotes about the
plight of Soviet Jewry

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:25.070
from President Lyndon Johnson.

01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:29.800
There was a Senator, Jacob
Javits, who he did a lot

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.870
and he told a lot about
Soviet Jewry.

01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:36.210
And there was Senator
Robert Kennedy.

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:38.660
I know that there was
several members of Congress

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.290
who visited the Soviet
Union a bit later.

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:45.390
And some of them were really
expelled from the Soviet Union

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:49.190
for their support for Soviet Jewry.

01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:51.790
Why attention was focused
specifically

01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:53.090
on those groups of people.

01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:57.910
I mean, Baltic States,
Ukrainians and Soviet Jewry.

01:11:57.910 --> 01:12:01.710
First they started to show their
potential earlier than the others

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:10.820
because after the Second World War,
big groups of resistance were both

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:13.070
in Baltic States and Ukraine.

01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:18.550
Of -- after the Israel's state
appeared on the map of the world,

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:23.300 position:56%
many Jews, Soviet Jews, they
announce that they want to emigrate.

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:27.130
So those people, they started
the activity earlier than others.

01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:30.500
They have some contacts with their
communities outside of the USSR.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.800
It's really so.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.300
And their resistance both
[inaudible] if we speak

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.940
about Baltic States' and Ukraine's.

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.900 position:56%
And peaceful if we speak about Jews.

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:42.190
It didn't stop despite suppressing.

01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:44.260
I think it's important.

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:50.100
So now Senate, April 1964, there
were three persons, Senator Javits,

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.540
Senator Abraham Ribicoff
and Judge Goldberg

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:58.250
who made another investigation
about the Soviet Jewry's plight.

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:01.090
And there were three, three
important things they said.

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:03.950
We must give them to
the Soviet Jews voice.

01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:06.330
We must rise to their
defense, and we must cry

01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:09.120
out for justice and justice.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.470
Reasons of the activity.

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:13.820
Of course, I told about
danger of communist influence

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.520
around and inside of the USA.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:20.820
Of course it was attempt to
weaken the USSR by all means.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.600
And of course there
were supporting forces

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.800
that could do it inside of USSR.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.490
And I think that it
was some moral act

01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:31.760
because they were really
sympathizing

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.120
for the suppressed
categories of citizens.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:40.520
In 1955, as I have already told
you, was the first evaluation

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:45.400 position:56%
of dissident potential in the Soviet
Union, and it was rather poor.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:50.360
Last of those reports was in
1966, and I make a quotation.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:54.480
"Intellectual discontent in the
USSR doesn't threaten the overthrow

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.220
of the regime, nor is
it likely to do so."

01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.980
So we can see that they were not
looking for some [inaudible].

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:03.580
They were not looking
for some persons

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:07.810
who will overthrow the regime
from inside of the USSR.

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:10.250
It was moral supporting.

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:14.710
And now I'll tell you about
some different forms of support.

01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:17.700
Financial support for
dissemination of information.

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.510
Voice of America, [inaudible]
of Liberty.

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:25.350
In 1972, it was a big scandal in
Congress about [inaudible] Liberty

01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:28.720
because they were financed
by the government

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.660
of the United States but secretly.

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:35.660
But after it, everything went
outside, and they continued.

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.490
Investigations: I know
several of them.

01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:44.150
Baltic countries, Soviet
Jewry Ukraine, prison --

01:14:44.150 --> 01:14:48.370
labor camps in the USSR it's a
very interesting investigation.

01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:53.610
And punitive psychiatry, abuse of
psychiatry in the Soviet Union.

01:14:53.610 --> 01:14:58.300
I cannot enumerate hearings,
records, and resolutions,

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.480
many of them in Senate and
Congress from 1950 to 1990.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.130 position:56%
These are some meetings in the USSR.

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:08.870
Of course, they started
from refuseniks.

01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:13.060
And it was the most
famous group of people.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:18.410
Many Congressmen, Senators, and
even just simple tourists came

01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:20.270
to visit those people.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:24.660
I know that one of
the gentlemen spoke

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.330
about the Helsinki
Commission in the Congress.

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:31.520
It was the lady who
invented this idea.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.400
Her name was Millicent Fenwick.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.660
She was very extravagant lady.

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.850
She came to the Soviet Union,
and after it, it was her idea

01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:40.520
to create such a commission.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.040
And the first chairman of this
commission was [inaudible].

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.130
So I know that many America
Congressmen and Senators met

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:53.980
with dissidents, and it was
Millicent Fenwick who also met

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:57.670
with dissidents because she
didn't know about their existence.

01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:02.500
It was some Jewish activists who
leaded her to [inaudible] who was

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.320
at that time the chairman
of [inaudible].

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.700
Another point of interest is
legislative [inaudible] economical

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.270
and other relation
with the countries

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:17.230
where human rights
were being violated.

01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:20.900
You mentioned Jackson-Vanik
Amendment, but it was not the first

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:24.020
and not very sensitive
for the Soviet Union.

01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:30.150
The first of them was Foreign Trade
Act Amendment, and another thing

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:32.730
which I should mention
was Stevenson Amendment

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:35.550
which restricting giving loans

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:39.030
to the Soviet Union for
mineral exploration.

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:42.940
And it depended also from
the freedom of emigration.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.710
Other public laws we can remember.

01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:48.650
Kersten Amendment which
also directed some money

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:51.390
to support people behind
the Iron Curtain.

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:56.040
Negotiations between the USSR
and American governments,

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.720
about exchanging suppressed people.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.060
It was favorite Soviet
dissident [inaudible].

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:05.490
It was Natan Sharansky
who was exchanged

01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:08.010
for some other people,
and it was [inaudible].

01:17:08.010 --> 01:17:10.920
He was exchanged not
for American citizen

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:15.950
but for some Chilean communist with
participating of the United States.

01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:19.220
And of course there were
meetings in the USA.

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:24.400
There were [inaudible] who
met with different Presidents.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.380
Here you can see some pictures
with Presidents and dissidents.

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:33.910
They're right side, the
upper part of pictures --

01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:38.030
lunch which President Reagan
gives for the Soviet dissidents.

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:44.190
Lower, you can see President Carter
who meets with Mr. [inaudible].

01:17:44.190 --> 01:17:47.130
The left part, there is
not only President Reagan

01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:50.970
but there is Senator Moynihan,
there is Congressman Thomas Lantos.

01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:56.600
There was also Senator Kennedy,
and they meet step-daughter

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.430
and her [inaudible],
academician [inaudible].

01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:02.580
So the world was pondering,
the USA was acting.

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:07.170
I tell about first public
law which was telling

01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:12.100
about President should deny any
economic or military assistance

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.270
to the government of
any foreign country

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:17.280
which practices the
internment or imprisonment

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.810
of that country's citizens
for political purposes.

01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:22.850
It was before Kersten [inaudible].

01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:27.190
It was before many other acts.

01:18:27.190 --> 01:18:31.790
As a result, I can speak about real
help for many suppressed people

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:33.800
and their families, really.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.790
I can speak about monitoring
of visitation

01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:38.740
with political prisoners
in the USSR.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:41.250
And there were two Congressmen,
at least two Congressmen,

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:46.220
who visited [inaudible]
political camp in 1988.

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:52.790
It was Chairman of Helsinki
Committee, Christopher Smith,

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:56.870
and it was former Congressman
from Virginia, Mr. Frank Wolf.

01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:59.310
They visited [inaudible]
political prison,

01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:01.410
and I heard that there
was some scandal.

01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:05.070
Some of prison-- the prisoners
tried to give them some note,

01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:07.870 position:56%
and they were, they couldn't take it

01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:11.380
because there were a
lot of guards there.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:14.450
And of course it was some kind
of protection for many people

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:21.360
because as far as the world knew
about some political prisoners,

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:27.280
I have watched many hearings
in Congress about the plight

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:31.190
of political prisoners --
[inaudible] or some others.

01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:34.410 position:56%
So it meant that those people there,

01:19:34.410 --> 01:19:37.210
they couldn't do everything
they wanted

01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:40.220
with them during their
being in prisons.

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.340 position:56%
Overall, American support was useful

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.410
for the Soviet citizens
who wanted to emigrate.

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:48.760
Potentially useful for the
Soviet political prisoners.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:53.370
I think that it's my opinion that
it was more moral than tangible.

01:19:53.370 --> 01:19:54.870
It was known by actions

01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:58.090
that couldn't be explained
by only political goals.

01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:04.560 position:56%
And it was sort of a matter of honor
for many Americans, and I thank --

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.650
my thanks to them for that.

01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:11.460
We'll talk about, talk about
[inaudible] work today.

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:14.940
I think that modern Russia is very
different from the former USSR.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:18.070
From their -- though
there are many cases

01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:21.080
of violating international
laws as well

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.170
as human rights inside the country.

01:20:24.170 --> 01:20:27.340
One of the main Soviet
problems, freedom to emigrate,

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:29.510
is not topical for modern Russia.

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:31.160
At least now.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.870
Because I know that they are
making some restricting laws.

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:40.260 position:56%
Political confrontation between the
two countries is not so harsh today.

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:43.070
The threat of international
terrorism is common

01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:45.350
to Russia and America.

01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:47.280
Restrictions against
the Soviet system

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.640
if we'll compare Jackson-Vanik
Amendment

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.940
and the list of [inaudible].

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:56.160
Jackson-Vanik Amendment was
against the whole country.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:01.240
List of [inaudible], it tries to
persecute the country's persons.

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:02.980
It's personified.

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:07.880
But of course both restrictions
of that time and the modern time,

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.740
they influence the entire country.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.270
And I think the idea of
pushing another country

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:17.460
to respect its own constitution
and international rules also

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:21.780
without military aggression
is very relevant today.

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:27.680
At the end of my speech, I
should say my special thanks

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.470
to my sources of information.

01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:32.830
It's of course Library of Congress,
Library of the Kenan Institute,

01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:39.110
Woodrow Wilson Center, and I made a
documentary about Soviet dissidents

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:43.200
and during that serial, series,
I made a lot of interviews.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.290
And it's also my source
of information.

01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:46.740
So thank you.

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:51.810
Here are my contacts if you
need, and thank you very much.

01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:53.230
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Thank
you to all our speakers

01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:55.110
for your valuable presentations.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:59.510
Would you like to make
any additional comments?

01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:02.780
No, if not, then let
me ask a few question.

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:05.170
For example, in the years Miranda

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:09.430
and [inaudible] court rulings
were able to strike [inaudible]

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:13.260
between two major goals:
promotion of law enforcement

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:17.320
and securing civil rights
and interest of individuals.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.990 position:56%
Why doesn't work in other countries?

01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:26.600
What can be done to [inaudible]
diametrically opposing interests

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.960
in other, in the countries
we are talking about?

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.220
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: You ask me?

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:34.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: [Inaudible] anyone.

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.820
Okay.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.640
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: I
would say it starts

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.600
from the different criminal system.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:51.290 position:56%
It's true that, that as we speak and
for many years ago the difference

01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:55.900
between the continental system
which means the law is important

01:22:55.900 --> 01:23:00.580
and not the jurisprudence,
and the common law system

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:03.110
which is specific to US and UK.

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:09.050
Which means the judicial
precedent is very important.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:16.630
Now this difference is not,
is not divided strictly

01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:19.410
as it was ten, twenty years ago.

01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:22.450
Now we have the European Court
of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:25.200
We have the Court of
Justice in Luxembourg,

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:31.520
the Court of European Union, and
they both rely on jurisprudence.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.190
Totally and fully.

01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:35.820
So it's, it's a mixture.

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:39.470
However, as I said, there
are differences between the,

01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:43.480
the, the way we see things.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:48.890
As I said, the main
difference starts from the point

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:52.470
that in many countries, the arrest

01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:57.970
of the person is not the moment you
deprive him of freedom physically

01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:02.000
and you say, you know, "You have
to come with me to the police."

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.250
That's not the moment when
we consider that it's arrest.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:10.720
If it's, if he's kept at the
police for two, three hours,

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.280
then yes, you can say it's arrest.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:21.960
But that was again taken,
taken by winning a case

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.490
at the European Court
of Human Rights.

01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:25.920
It's not, it doesn't in the law.

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.570
So that, that's, that's
a difference.

01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:33.890
Otherwise, the informing of the
people is [inaudible], otherwise,

01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:43.670
the informing of the people
comes when the person is, again,

01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:45.580
before he is interrogated
as a suspect.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.880
Not even arrested.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.330
Maybe we'll not arrest him.

01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:51.020
We just interrogate him
[inaudible] he will be [inaudible]

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:56.020
and still being free.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.960
So that's the difference.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.210
Since I have the floor, I'd
like to say something else.

01:25:07.210 --> 01:25:10.110
But not related to the question.

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:11.410
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: No, [inaudible].

01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:13.440
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: The
Russian Federation danger

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.240
which I'm very much concerned
of today, and we are all

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.520
in the post-communist countries.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.600
And I speak of Poland, of
Baltic Countries of Romania.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:34.790
I don't, I strongly believe
that Soviet Union leaders

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:42.050
of the political establishment
in Russian Federation today

01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:44.270
and yesterday [inaudible].

01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:46.430
They never gave up.

01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:50.740
The corrupt politicians,
they never said, "Okay,

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.410
the Soviet Union is
over, and that's it.

01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:55.820
We let these countries go."

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.340
No, they don't.

01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:03.350
And as we saw in Crimea and as we
see in different other countries,

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:06.100 position:56%
they want, they think in long terms.

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:07.480
That's the difference.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.730
They think in hundreds of years and
they make plans, long-term plans.

01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:16.230
And they want all these countries
to come under their influence.

01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:17.820
And because you spoke today,

01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:20.680
you referred to the role
of Radio Free Europe.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.310
I can tell that now --
so Radio Free Europe

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:27.660
and BBC left these countries
Central Eastern Europe

01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:29.690
because we joined the
European Union.

01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:31.750
We are democratic and
free and so on.

01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:33.050
We don't need them.

01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:35.950
Well, that was a mistake.

01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:41.150 position:56%
What happens now is the, the Russian
Federation replaced the Radio Free

01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:45.800
Europe and BBC and they
bought, for instance in Romania,

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.710
they bought licenses to open a TV.

01:26:48.710 --> 01:26:50.380
They already have a radio.

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:57.220
Russia Today, and a lot
of blogs in Romanian.

01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:01.340 position:56%
And now they will, they broadcast
in Romanian as Radio Free Europe did

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.060
and BBC did for the Romanians

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:06.550
to understand what's happening
in the big world, yes?

01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:07.930
The same are doing the Russians.

01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:11.470
They broadcast in Romanian.

01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:16.030
They, they bought in
Crimea and then in Ukraine.

01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:20.080
And then Ukraine gave
them and withdraw them.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:24.810 position:56%
Baltic Countries refuse to sell them
on the frequencies and the licenses

01:27:24.810 --> 01:27:29.650
to broadcast in, in their
language in their countries.

01:27:29.650 --> 01:27:33.780
In the Republic of Moldova,
they broadcast freely and they,

01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:35.400
they, they have the license.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:42.280
I don't know why Romanian all your
visual body sold them the, the,

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:48.330
the license even to open a
television, but they did.

01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:54.610
So my appeal is Radio Free
Europe and BBC, please come back.

01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:56.360
And the more than that.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.980
More than a radio, also television
because it's, it's a danger.

01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:04.430
And I can see in the last
five years the anti-American,

01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:11.990
the anti-European Union, the
anti-democracy speeches and blogs

01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:21.800
and you know, leftist, leftish
people and groups who, who, who,

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.680
who [inaudible] the
mind of the people.

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.980
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Well,
you are at the point,

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.670
you may ask you another question.

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:29.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: Sorry, thank you.

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:30.870
&gt;&gt; Keep the platform.

01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:33.020
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: When you
conducted your reforms in Romania,

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:36.610
you used human rights
mechanisms and principles to help

01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:40.210
to fight corruption
like nondiscrimination,

01:28:40.210 --> 01:28:42.610
transparency, accountability.

01:28:42.610 --> 01:28:44.430
And to thanks to your reforms,

01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:46.910
the country was admitted
to the European Union.

01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:53.480
Their judicial system was
rid of political dependency.

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:57.360
Now it seems that some
countries in the region are --

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.850
or leaders of some countries
are less interested in develop--

01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:04.910
in fulfilling their
human rights obligations.

01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:06.790
And there is a general opinion

01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:10.290
that human rights is a
by-product of democracy.

01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:14.970
What can be done to
fight this approach?

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.940
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: To
elect other politicians

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.020
than the ones we have today.

01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:23.960
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Thank you.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:28.620
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: Politicians
form the state bodies, yes?

01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:31.580
They don't like civil rights.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.550 position:56%
And they don't like anti-corruption.

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:35.850
I couldn't have done
it in my country

01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:37.880
if another country would
have done it before

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.730
because then you know
what to expect.

01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:42.860
Even if it was pre-accession.

01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:46.280
Now anti-corruption is
wanted by Slovenias,

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.800
by a lot of people not politicians.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.460
People see what happens in
Romania, and they want it.

01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.910
But their politicians, because
they see what happened in Romania

01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:59.080
and that they go to prison,
they will never adopt it.

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:01.920
They will never adopt
such legislation.

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.680
So basically, what,
what, when I did it,

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:09.050
they didn't imagine
what will happen.

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:11.380
They thought, "Okay, we
make another institution,

01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:13.550
make some other legislation."

01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:15.400
So now it's much more
difficult to do it

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:18.360
after we have this, this results.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.660
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Thank you.

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.820
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: But I want to
-- just an example to [inaudible].

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:27.020
For instance, if you go to
Prague, the tourist agencies,

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:30.890
they offer you the
Tour of Corruption.

01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:35.560
Just to realize the, the, the,
the dimension of this phenomenon.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.310
Or in Slovenia, after
they joined the EU,

01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:41.240
they try politicians'
opposition power three times

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.790
to dismantle the anti-corruption
agency.

01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:45.700
And I can give you more examples.

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:49.980
So that's another thing of
the honor of the politicians.

01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:54.450
You know, we join the club, we've
made promises that will go forward

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:56.560
that the reforms are reversible,

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:01.770
and then we do everything
we can to go back.

01:31:01.770 --> 01:31:03.570
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Anyone
would like to add?

01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:06.470
[ Inaudible ]

01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:08.640
&gt;&gt; Kyle Parker: Well,
just to follow up on the,

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.370
the question, "What can be done?"

01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:14.470
A proverbial Russian question
is that the, we often ask.

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:20.130 position:56%
Again, in terms of what can be done,

01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:22.400
and our colleague has
mentioned this as well.

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:26.150
Really the push has to also come
from, from within the country.

01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:27.630
From within civil society.

01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:32.520 position:56%
You can't assume that the
institutions themselves will reform.

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.050 position:56%
That's the lesson so far of Ukraine.

01:31:35.050 --> 01:31:38.510 position:56%
That the institutions and indeed the
political leadership have been less

01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:42.650
than thorough in terms of
pursuing Ukraine, pursuing reform.

01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:47.730
Yet the public -- the civil society
has continued to demand reforms.

01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:51.150
And that is one of
the crucial aspects

01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:53.390
of keeping the process going.

01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:55.650
The other really depends
on pressure from outside.

01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:58.670
I mean, again, would Ukraine be
reforming if the United States

01:31:58.670 --> 01:32:01.970
and the EU weren't demanding
that certain reforms take place?

01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:05.940
And that requires that the United
States and the EU have the courage

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.810
of its convictions and to uphold
its belief in human rights.

01:32:09.810 --> 01:32:11.310
That's what came through
so prominently

01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:12.900
in Natella's presentation.

01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:16.990
That in the 1950s and '60s, you
had the series of politicians

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:20.760
who not necessarily
pursuing political advantage,

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.180
but believed that they were
doing something that was right.

01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:25.970
And that's something that
we have to maintain as well.

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.180
&gt;&gt; William Pomeranz: Yeah,
on that point I would just --

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:33.800
I would just also add you, you
had those behind the Iron Curtain,

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:37.490
as it were, also very much
poking the consciences of those

01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:39.830
in the West to get even louder.

01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:46.990
And I'm not sure I completely
understand your question, Peter,

01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:51.750 position:56%
but I think some, some of it has to
do with balancing security and, and,

01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:56.780 position:56%
and liberty, and, why some of this
has been so difficult in the region.

01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:02.750
I know one thing related to, to
Monica's comments as getting rid

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:08.080
of the politicians we have,
certainly that mood is,

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.520
is quite strong, I think.

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.300
Not just in the United States
now, but, but in Europe.

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.570
It's a populace mood.

01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:16.160
And I've often wondered if,

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:21.190
if the way to solve what is really
the classical problem of politics

01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:23.380
of how do you get the
right people to serve?

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:29.140 position:56%
It, it because presumably the people
who would be best would never want

01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:32.420
to drag themselves through
the mud and serve is, is, is,

01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:36.900
is exploring the idea of a jury
duty sort of process for certain,

01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:41.230 position:56%
for politicians or for certain
societal boards or things where you,

01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:45.820
you, you draft a group of peers and
say, "It's your turn this year, to,

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:49.190
to, to make these laws and
reviews, review this question."

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:55.600 position:56%
But on the, the, the question of you
know sort of security and liberty,

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.150
I think it was FBI
Director Comey who's had,

01:33:58.150 --> 01:34:04.010
who's had a difficult year, has
said that this was the problem

01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:08.050
that he found the most challenging
in his entire government career,

01:34:08.050 --> 01:34:10.230
and, and it, and it's only
gotten more challenging.

01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:15.010 position:56%
From my persepctive as a citizen, I,

01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:18.410
I think balance is
really the wrong word.

01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:24.010
I, I, I, you know, I feel like
in the human rights field,

01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:27.870
my assumption is that human
rights is the perennial underdog

01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:30.340
and that our work will
never be done.

01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:34.690
And therefore it's impossible for
us to have too big of a success

01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:36.800
to really do too much in this area.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:40.750
And thus, whenever it's tried,
you know, whenever it's, you know,

01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:43.950
people talk about balancing
it, I get worried.

01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:52.110
And I, I also think that, you know,
it's -- when I hear politicians,

01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:56.560
you know, nothing to me is more
annoying than the usual drum rate,

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:00.180
sort of, of politicians talking

01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:05.760
about how their top priority
is the safety of the citizens,

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.400
or the American citizens
when I as a citizen, again,

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.140
would rather hear them say that
their top priority is the liberty

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.720
and freedom of the society.

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.900
And I haven't heard a whole lot
of that in the past decade or so.

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.880 position:56%
And I think it's understandable why.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.480
And one last thing on,
on perhaps the confusion

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:25.500
between the two systems as
we look at, you know, Miranda

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:30.400 position:56%
and our jurisprudence and that in
Eastern Europe, particularly Russia.

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:36.680
Is the reality of very strong
informal practices in Russia.

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:40.060
And so I think where, where
we're talking about what --

01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:42.220 position:56%
and we don't have this as much here.

01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:46.500 position:56%
So whatever we have, you can
actually read in the book, and, and,

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.910
and you know, that
exists in Russia, too.

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:53.420
But it's only part of what
is, what is the reality.

01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:55.880
And that there are
vast informal practices

01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.350
that are sometimes realer
than, than the legal framework.

01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:03.750
So in, in addition to legal
framework, political will,

01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:08.430
institutional reform, there's
this question of, you know,

01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:11.120
should you move those
informal practices into law?

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:12.420
Is it culturally appropriate?

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:15.270
How do you, how do you look at
the two and balance the two?

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:17.270
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: So there
is a lot of work to do.

01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:19.110
There are -- one.

01:36:19.110 --> 01:36:20.410
&gt;&gt; Natella Boltyanskaya: Can I -- ?

01:36:20.410 --> 01:36:21.990
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Just
very brief, please.

01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:23.290
&gt;&gt; Natella Boltyanskaya:
Yes, of course.

01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:24.590
I think that it doesn't work

01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:28.370
because it's too much political
correctness in the world.

01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:32.240
When we speak about for instance,
[inaudible] list, we don't mention

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.090
that Russian president
would also be on that list.

01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:40.070
I think that if we contact with the
people who violate the principles

01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:44.220
of political correctness and
laws, we should not follow them.

01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:45.520
That's it.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.820
&gt;&gt; Peter Roudik: Thanks.

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.120 position:56%
Monica, you wanted to say something?

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:57.270
&gt;&gt; Monica Macovei: Yes, I
said elect other politicians.

01:36:57.270 --> 01:37:02.390
If a politician is corrupt and
he's from, from our, from the focus

01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:06.650
of its citizens, we don't have --
they can't be called politicians

01:37:06.650 --> 01:37:10.840
who love their countries or
politicians who love the people.

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.740 position:56%
And if I give you an example, we had
local elections in June this year.

01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:21.390 position:56%
And one mayor of a big city was, was
in prison, arrested for corruption.

01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:25.370
And he was elected 70%, he won 70%.

01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:27.740
Again, as a mayor of the city.

01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:31.140
Now we have parliamentary
elections starting in two days,

01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:37.500
and there are tens of people of
candidates who have been convicted

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.230
or are under investigation.

01:37:39.230 --> 01:37:42.620
So it's out of my understanding.

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:47.050
That's why I'm saying we need
the, we need get new people in.

01:37:47.050 --> 01:37:50.640
We need -- it's time, I think it's
time the history of our country

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:55.470
or of the world when those
who, who never thought of,

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:58.780
of getting involved into the
politics have to do it, you know?

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:06.080
It's -- when you start stay
aside in times of moral crisis,

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.620
that's the worst crime [inaudible].

01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:11.990
You go in to relieve [inaudible]
most difficult inferno.

01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:17.850
And I think that's such
of what I want people,

01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:23.030
some individuals should, should
leave aside their personal comfort.

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:27.030
Well, [inaudible] I don't criticize
that, and should get involved

01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:29.230
in the politics and replace them.

01:38:29.230 --> 01:38:32.990
Because otherwise, they keep,
they keep replacing each other,

01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:34.290
and we'll never go ahead.

01:38:34.290 --> 01:38:35.590
