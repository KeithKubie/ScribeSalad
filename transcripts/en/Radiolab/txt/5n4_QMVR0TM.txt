Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W N Y s C. Yup. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich and I'm Latif Nasser. This is Radiolab and today we're going to do something completely upside down and inside out. Yes, it's, it's a sport story sort of, but like none you've ever heard. And therefore we found a reporter who is a sports reporter. Like none. You've ever heard. Yeah, I've been to a gym lately. Mike Peskov. He's the host of the just podcasts put up by slate, formerly of NPR, still sometimes roots fan br. And now he's here telling the story to us. Yeah know. How did you even first hear about this? Were you covering it? Oh yeah. Yeah. So

Speaker 2:          00:46          this is morning edition from NPR news. I'm her name on tape. I was covering the 2012 Olympics for NPR. Good morning. Hello. And I declare open the Games of London, the stories of the Olympics. Um, you try to find your own stories that are obscured, but if there's a big story, you chase it. So in those Olympics.

Speaker 1:          01:04          So for you, what were the most notable achievements in the first week of the Games?

Speaker 2:          01:08          Well, it's history of the base con. Microsoft's breaking the all time record. Obviously over a hundred years, nobody's won as many medals at the Olympic Games and everyone knew that bolt and his record set inquest in a hundred would be you.

Speaker 3:          01:24          Oh, he's returned to tied with the most empathetic way. Brilliant, brilliant fun. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:34          can this badminton story pops up

Speaker 1:          01:38          and everyone rushes to figure out what the heck's going on with badminton. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:44          because the 2012 London Olympics, badminton tournament, just, it took this somewhat obscure sport and it morphed it into this bizarro thought experiment about competition and integrity and what it means to win. Okay. But mostly I think that the, although to be fair, Mike, he jumped on this story for very personal reasons. As a New Yorker, I say a lot of words and they're mispronounced in the NPR audience with jump on them. But I always can say the Anand badminton and get a lot of plots. So I'm attracted to badminton. But what's the wrong way to say badminton? Most people say badminton bad. Ben, like you're talking to some hands where winter time I'm like, you're chastising a playful cat, right magnet. And I see. And then also, um, you know, you, you and I probably think of badminton as this backyard fun, silly game. But

Speaker 3:          02:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:44          according to Mike, no, this is anything but it has nothing to do with the badminton you play in your backyard. It's much faster than you think it would possibly look. You get these player, I want a shot flying all over the court, stretching, reaching, diving. The skill of the competitors is, you know, readily apparent. This is pulsating badminton. Shuttlecock is a funny thing and perhaps not as impressive a thing as a tennis ball, but it looks, you know, a lot like tennis and there was a lot of tension. So to be a fresher and there's a lot of grunting and it totally seems like every bit of a legitimate and highly skilled sports.

Speaker 1:          03:30          Wait, I'm going to start. Okay. So, so Robert [inaudible] so you haven't seen this yet, but I would like to show you something. Okay. This is an ad.

Speaker 4:          03:44          Yeah. This, okay.

Speaker 1:          03:46          This is the game that is at the center of this whole story. Oh Man. These doubles group. I patient a women's doubles. Badminton. It is not a metal round. It's in the group place stage. There's a huge crowd here. Like the place is packed. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          04:02          Please welcome a representative of the People's Republic of China. Why don't you show me you're young.

Speaker 4:          04:08          So these two teams come out. Uh, you got China yellow when red uniforms, the oceans. So here, comm

Speaker 1:          04:17          versus Korea. Purple and white. Yeah. And let's just skip ahead here.

Speaker 4:          04:24          Yeah. All right. So here we go. Game on. This is the first surf [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:30          Korean serve. So the Korean player flicks her wrist. The shuttlecock goes over the net. China return [inaudible] right into the net. But that was it. That was the whole thing. Oh, that was just a, alright. Um, so Korea and second serve

Speaker 4:          04:47          and Chinese return and same thing. You know that again? Yeah. So that

Speaker 1:          04:54          service has turned over and now the Chinese are surfing China, Korea, China.

Speaker 4:          05:00          It doesn't matter if you can, uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:03          this is not exactly scintillating. I just gotta tell you, I think you're welcome. Watch this next point. So the Korean player serves it. Yeah, it's sales over the net and then it goes, goes, goes, goes, goes. And the Chinese player clearly is right there. She has it. She then winds up just a slight bit like you could see, it's like she has this deep ingrained muscle memory from years of doing this. She winds up, she's about to hit it and then she's stops. And the Charlotte Cock just plunks under the floor inbounds point to Korea and then tellingly she looks, yeah, back at the back corner of the court where her coach's sitting. Uh, they both are. Yeah, yeah. This is a fix. They're fixing this. Well this is, yes. But there been plenty of occasions where one side wants to lose and it ain't hard to, and the more important thing is that it ain't hard to get away with it. Usually you wouldn't even notice it. You know, it's the difference between a couple of serves over the line, a couple balls into the net, but in this case, as the match goes on, you start to realize

Speaker 4:          06:13          that's a very lethargic Scott come back.

Speaker 1:          06:15          Korean players seem to be trying to lose too. The cervic faults. Yes, that's it's a rally of course everybody we tried to lose like both sides. Well it's actually a strategy because the way the tournament is laid out, both these teams are going to be moving on to the metal rounds, but whoever wins this game is going to have to play another Chinese team, a really strong team. I see. And whoever loses is gonna play a way easier Danish team. So both teams are hoping to lose. Yeah. And it is the rare instance where you have both sides incentivized to lose that. You get something that should be scored by Spike Jones. It's a little bit of a prisoner's dilemma, right? Either side could lose, but when both want to lose, it becomes this surreal waiting game. Right. You know who's going to crack first and score a point and so you got the best players in the world who just start hitting the shuttlecock out of bounds, see fault after fault, faulting on purpose, and we'll just take the bull straight in the net. You're hitting the shuttlecock into the net. I'm sorry. You know it's blindingly obvious what's going on. And you know that both tried to lose. Sometimes they hit it below the net and that is unforgivable. They're hitting it straight into the ground or by tripping over their own shoelaces purposefully until what you get is serve up all into the next point after point of just hearable badminton. And it just devolved into this absurd repetitive, crazy making lose the thought.

Speaker 4:          07:58          This is not to displace. Yes,

Speaker 1:          08:03          the lame, I mean this is not, this is not sport this, but it is kind of a sport because, and this is why I really love it. At a certain point, these two teams have to start competing with each other to lose what, let me play you this point. So China serves it. Korea hits it back, but it's going way out of bounds now. Now, in a normal world, China would obviously let that fall so that they could take the point, but they lunge to save it, right? And they're hitting it back. No Korea, then they are like, no, no, no. You know what? We're pretty sure we want it out of bounds. They hit it in the opposite direction, even further out of bounds. So now China goes to save it once again, but they don't get there in time. So the point goes to China, which China actually didn't want. Um, and, and the Koreans wanted the whole time. So what are you saying then as well? It's like, it's like we invented whole new sport, which is the exact opposite of badminton. It is, it is photo negative. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:03          then towards the end of the first,

Speaker 4:          09:06          that woman referee has been pretty quick outcomes. The referee since the birth.

Speaker 1:          09:12          Hello, Torsten speaking. Hi, how Torsten Baron was the head Olympic badminton referee who got that call.

Speaker 6:          09:18          And I also heard the spectators Buzo. I went to watch it. It looked pretty awful. This was not [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:24          right. [inaudible] is the planners together

Speaker 6:          09:27          and uh, told them that they were not playing seriously and uh, they were making a very serious mistake and uh, they played stupid and said no, we playing and we're trying our best

Speaker 1:          09:39          needed told me also [inaudible] we were actually able to get in touch with, what's her name? You most of us three of the four players in that match. Both Korean players [inaudible] John can earn and they're going the chemo. And I knew that Kim Hannah and also one of the Chinese players [inaudible] how was [inaudible] and [inaudible] [inaudible] told me they were trying to lose in that match. But what do we did in the expected south career? What the do the same thing has a male sound, our whole, and as for the Koreans, junk young urn said that they too were trying to lose at least during certain moments in the game. But when the crowds hurted Abou [inaudible] the run and the ref came out, her partner, Kim Ha na said that. So I was surprised and I'm embarrassed. We're just much about loggers on scared. We just wanting to get out of the court as soon as possible. Got To [inaudible]. So Torsten walks off the court, they window in court again. And then the second serve after Torsten walks out the court. Nothing but net. So for the next few points, it does not get much better. No, it didn't look like world class back.

Speaker 4:          10:57          Mm.

Speaker 1:          10:58          So the set comes to an end. Korea wins the set and while the players are waiting on [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          11:03          sidelines who comes to the tournament referee, again,

Speaker 1:          11:07          Torsten comes back onto the court, you walks up to the players and he pulls out of his pocket almost subtly and shows to the players this black car, the black car, which means discord, vacation. This is absolutely extraordinary. He has given both teams

Speaker 4:          11:25          a black card or has he threatened them with a bat card? I'm really not terribly short. The players have returned to court.

Speaker 6:          11:34          It was now that they should play or they would be in deep. Sorry, maybe I shouldn't say the black, the black card that says that the car, the car was out and I was, I told them in very clear words and very seriously that in order to help themselves, they better play now.

Speaker 7:          11:57          Can they then can they [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:59          the Korean player Junkie on the [inaudible] said that she turned to her party

Speaker 7:          12:03          and I told her there are them and we are we so come give your, hit you. Okay, let's just play and do our best.

Speaker 1:          12:11          The second set starts and pretty good. [inaudible] China's [inaudible] Lee told me, so you see both sides changed a little bit instead of just serving into the net, things started to get better. Oh Raleigh. They would get the rally going but then as the points kept coming, you started to notice like they were playing very slowly. Six still really off here. They were not hitting the border very hard. [inaudible] yeah, the Korean team wouldn't admit this, but once ya Lee said that both teams, you then changed the basic fact gabion and we're still trying to lose, which I have to say is exactly what it looks like when you watch it. Because for the rest of the match, you get a bunch of these points where like, where just they'll lob, it's super high, you know, as if to say, hey, smash it down on us. Take your point. Or they will, uh, you know, hit it out of bounds and then face palm just, you know, practice their swing after they missed one just to, to see, say, Oh, you know, my mechanics are off. I just gotta just practices a few more times. Um, because it's like we've entered a whole third iteration of this game where it's like they're not just trying to lose, they're trying to cover up the admin cover up badminton. You're trying to lose, but you're trying to look like you're trying to win.

Speaker 8:          13:30          I don't think. No.

Speaker 1:          13:35          So finally, after 20 long, the minutes of this, uh, the Korean team loses the match by winning it

Speaker 8:          13:45          tonight has left me with a very nasty taste in the mouth. Tonight is not sport. It was a disgrace. Good night.

Speaker 1:          14:00          [inaudible] so all four players walked off the court and Kim Ha na told him he was not a pleasant winning at all and the parents were in the audience that day. And afterwards they asked her what happened,

Speaker 7:          14:14          what happened and why, why do you have to get the booze from the audiences and et cetera. And I was, I was sad and feel, felt defeated. So I didn't even want to talk to my mom. So I remember I was just going, went to the hotel and had, had arrested [inaudible] killed,

Speaker 6:          14:33          know, and uh, the next morning at eight o'clock or four pairs, in fact, we're disqualified according to the disciplinary regulations of, uh, the badminton world federation,

Speaker 1:          14:43          which has a rule on the books that you can be disqualified for failing to use your best effort.

Speaker 6:          14:49          And the same evening they, on the plane home,

Speaker 1:          14:52          they were just thrown out of the Olympics. The scandal at the Olympics [inaudible] this whole to do about the badminton players. Everyone was talking about some losers shuffle colts were going out. [inaudible] the shuttle coke into the net like a five year old in the backyard picnic. It was downright humiliating post. Just sad

Speaker 7:          15:12          that uh, they were committing suicide in that tournament can usually be job [inaudible] it's a bad time. The punishment hits me quite hard. I was very sad and I felt helpless.

Speaker 3:          15:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          15:33          [inaudible] I was perplexed and didn't know what happened. We just cried.

Speaker 1:          15:42          This doesn't sound like it's getting any better. No, but there's still more, uh, after the break. Okay.

Speaker 7:          15:48          Hi, this is Nila from Hamburg, Germany. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          16:03          I'm former US attorney Preet Bharara and my new podcast is called stay tuned.

Speaker 9:          16:08          If you look at areas where he is unconstrained, his behavior is pretty consistently awful. It's about the human side of power.

Speaker 1:          16:42          We're back. I'm Robert Krulwich and I'm lots of Nasr. This is radio lab. And when we left off, the Korean and Chinese women's badminton teams had just been disqualified, kicked out of the Olympics. So what, so then what happened to the [inaudible] players? Like what happened them? Well, all four of them did keep playing badminton professionally after this, uh, junk young earn from Korea even went on to win a bronze in Rio. But at the time this was a brutal punishment for all of them. Well, but you know, they, they did something wrong. This wasn't right. Right. I, you know, I don't even, I questioned whether it's even unethical. I think it's ethical in a way. What they did, really, what the players did. I do, I think it's an ethical how so, okay. So is the definition of ethics in sports two two wins. Sure. Without cheating.

Speaker 1:          17:32          Yes. Does that mean to win every point? No, not necessarily. You know, in baseball there's the thing called the intentional walker. In football, a team will take a safety instead of punting and letting the other teams score a touchdown. So this a calculation where our point here or there is not as important as the hole and the hole is the game. So, okay, let's move back. Let's pan out a little more. I think an individual game is often lost. Look, we're not going to put our good starter here. We're going to manage the lineup because the goal is to win the championship. And the thing to remember about these players is if what we want is players who are hyper competitive and actually want to win at all costs, that's exactly why they were losing so badly because they wanted to win the overall championship at all costs. And the badminton federation had a set of rules that all bug guarantee that this would happen.

Speaker 10:         18:28          Well. Yeah, I mean it's stupid to have an event where people are trying to lose. If that event is a sporting event, especially at the apex of, you know, the only time people care about bad news it seems really good.

Speaker 1:          18:41          So this is chuck Klosterman, we called him in because he writes a lot about sports and also because he wrote the ethicist column for The New York Times magazine.

Speaker 10:         18:50          Now is this a, uh, some kind of tragedy will, it's not, I guess in less bad mittens really important to you than it probably is

Speaker 1:          18:58          in this case. I think the thing that people got really upset about is this is this idea of the Olympic ideal.

Speaker 11:         19:04          All the context to I promise that we shall take part in the Olympic Games

Speaker 1:          19:09          athletes both

Speaker 11:         19:11          in the true spirit of sportsmanship for the glory of the sport and the honor of our teams

Speaker 1:          19:17          to transcend the in the way that as a super athlete you're transcending your humanity but then also as like this representative of your country and I think it did poke a lot of people like a lot of people did seemingly get kind of upset about Oh

Speaker 10:         19:32          yeah. I mean for some reason it is disturbing to see athletes failing on purpose that just, it seems to Kinda like tap into some, I like morals somehow

Speaker 8:          19:44          tonight has left me with a very nasty tasting.

Speaker 10:         19:47          Yes. Like, like, like I don't know if not trying in a sporting event is a moral question, but it feels that way when you see it happen.

Speaker 8:          19:56          Yes.

Speaker 10:         19:58          Here again, one of the interesting thing about sports is that we watch these adults playing multimillion dollar games, but they're the same games that like a six year old or seven year old plays. So when you have a seven year old kid, you would say it doesn't matter if you win or lose. It doesn't matter what happens, just play hard. You don't have to succeed. It's the trying that matters. So when you see people at the eyes level not trying, there's, it's almost, it's sort of wrecks the entire idea of why we play sports at all. You know why? If you're at a playground in two kids race across the playground to see who can get to the swing faster or whatever, like that's like a biological thing. Maybe we are biologically driven to compete, so that's the baseline expectation of what we have. Have these bad been players that they will try to compete.

Speaker 1:          20:40          It seems to me there's an opportunity here for true athleticism and a kind of topsy turvy little bit and reversed and reversed it and see if you can do that as well as you do the other way. I mean sports only work one way though. They don't work both ways. I mean it would, it would be be like going to your wife and saying like, okay, you say you really love me. Prove it by hating me in a creative way. Or to go to a great piano player and say like, if you're so awesome at playing piano, Bang your fist against the keys in a way that I will be, you know, I will be sickened by it, but every ticket out of the out of matters of the heart and put it back on the field, what would be the most radical solution that you could imagine if your desire was to convincingly and astonishingly athletically lose weight?

Speaker 1:          21:30          I suppose if they were both trying to do it in the most convincing way it would be, that was not really the case here. I can say they never confronted it. How do you lose on purpose if the other side's also trying to lose on purpose? And I'm trying to think, there are some sports. So in football, let's say in American football, let's say both sides want it to lose. Well, here's how the sport would go. You can't make the other team score. But you can score a safety on yourself. So the quarterback would get the ball and start running towards the zone end zone, and then there'd be a gel break by the defense to tackle the quarterback before he got [inaudible]. Baseball is hard. You could hit the batter. That would be, that would be an interesting game. What about darts instead of aiming at the dartboard, just turning around and aiming it your opponent. So that's like the, that's like the baseball strategy for the bodybuilding. Think about the implications [inaudible] where do I think I would win? I see like a will Ferrell movie out of this thinking. We get to a point, our team, all right, this is what we need. You've got to go out there and go and then there's a loser on the other. It's also, and then I lose

Speaker 3:          22:51          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          22:51          You can hear more of Mike Tesco on his podcast and the just more of Chuck Klosterman and his latest book. But what if we're wrong? Big thanks to all the players who talk to us and to those who helped us get those interviews and joy. Lee Lee McCune, Kim uniquer, Tika thanks to opponent and Charla who came in and helped us puzzle this whole match out. And in addition, a special thanks to Gracie a Polly Gracie was on the Indonesian badminton team in those same Olympics and an hour after the match, we featured, uh, she face off against a different Korean team. Uh, all four players in that match were also disqualified for not using their best efforts to win. Uh, she really helped us, uh, understand what it was like to be in that situation. This story was produced by Matt Kielty and Annie Mcewen and Latif Nasser. I remember Krulwich and I'm of Vassar and I guess that ends the game at this point.

Speaker 12:         23:51          Go to the next minute. Hi, it's Mike. I'm going to do this. It's possible that even though this is the fifth time I've said David Gabel wrong, but I'm going to do it once and I'm got to do it with an intro of myself and here goes, hi, this is Mike Scott here to tell you that Radiolab is produced by Jad Abumrad.

Speaker 1:          24:43          here's an idea I have. There was an old brittle, then it goes like this. A king talks to his Tucson's two princes and he says, here's what we're going to do. Get those horses out of the stable. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to jump on your horses and ride to the city gate, which ever horse gets the city gate last. Your going to inherit the fortune. Maybe it's a crazy king. So the two princes look at each other. They both think and then they jump on the horses and they ride fast as they can. Why? To to reign in their wishes at the very last minute. Jump off of wishes and say, Whoa, and then wait until the other one. I don't know. Are they, are they planning on just just, just removing a section of the gate and then just smashing it up against the other horse? Yeah. No, that's terrible. Like the answer, what is the answer? They jumped on each other's horse. They dropped on the other brother's horse. Maybe. Let me just think about other sports. Of course. He said whichever horse gets her last, so how that.
