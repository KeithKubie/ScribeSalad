00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
sustainability and I found out a variety
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.439
sustainability and I found out a variety
of things that we're very optimistic

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449
of things that we're very optimistic
 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.170

out to have poverty between 2000 and
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.570
out to have poverty between 2000 and
2015 worldwide and actually hit that by

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
2015 worldwide and actually hit that by
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.849
2015 worldwide and actually hit that by
about 2010 right so we're in that period

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
about 2010 right so we're in that period
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.069
about 2010 right so we're in that period
of the fastest transformation of the

all these great technological

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000
all these great technological
 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.700
all these great technological
innovations on the horizon and it looks

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
innovations on the horizon and it looks
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.959
innovations on the horizon and it looks
to me like things could go

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
to me like things could go
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.060
to me like things could go
extraordinarily well if we were careful

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
extraordinarily well if we were careful
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.150
extraordinarily well if we were careful
but I'm not optimistic and maybe that's

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
but I'm not optimistic and maybe that's
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430
but I'm not optimistic and maybe that's
me I'm pessimistic because I also see

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
me I'm pessimistic because I also see
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.049
me I'm pessimistic because I also see
that there's five or six things

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
that there's five or six things
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.750
that there's five or six things
happening all of which appear at the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
happening all of which appear at the
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.250
happening all of which appear at the
level of catastrophe that are all

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
level of catastrophe that are all
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
level of catastrophe that are all
happening at the same time and so one of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
happening at the same time and so one of
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.970
happening at the same time and so one of
the things that I'd like to ask you is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
