00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.960
 Your body is made up of many things - such as this cell - an indispensable component, 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.759
 Make up you... that is, you! Also, in every cell in your body, there is about 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:15.190
 At least ten microbes that are essential to your life. Serious, unique 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.990
 The array of billions of microbes are on your body, you are in life 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.410
 Pick them up through the mouth, ears and other parts. meaning is, 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.779
 You in your heart are just a small part of what makes up you. 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.930
 We call it the microbial system, and these small creatures have about 22 million of them belonging to their DNA. 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.860
 Genes, which not only allow them to survive, but also control hundreds of programs in your body. 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.640
 They help you digest food and maintain the health of your immune system. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.960
 They can even regulate hunger and make you feel full. Think there is pressure? They also make chemicals for this - 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.510
 In fact, mice that live in a sterile environment without these microorganisms 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.540
 The effect on coping with stress is worse than that of ordinary mice. 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.189
 Have you heard of faecal transplantation? This is real! Some diseases are caused by 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.369
 Lack of diverse microbial populations, making individuals susceptible to infection. 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.439
 It has been found that transplanting cultures of healthy human feces to 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.719
 The patient's gut to treat these diseases is more effective than any antibiotic. Scientists have discovered that 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.850
 When the microbiota of lean mice are transplanted to obese mice, they are amazingly 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.700
 Lose weight more effectively, even when their diet remains the same. These creatures 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.649
 Very important to you, even in the future, doctors may diagnose 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.469
 Your microbiota is not yours. 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.490
 But then there is crazy protection - although your cell is just a small part of you, 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.429
 But in fact you can change another 90%. Unlike genes that your parents inherit, 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.630
 The food you eat will affect your microbiota. 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.090
 Foods containing beneficial and probiotics, such as new and healthy bacteria, 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.399
 Helps the old bacteria grow healthily. Conversely, the fried chicken or other food you eat 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.350
 Processed foods are treated with chemicals to kill bad bacteria, but at the same time unfortunately 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.479
 Kill some bacteria that are good for you. In fact, Westerners are better than other cultures. 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.070
 There are many microbial diversity, and people in other places mainly eat natural foods. 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.080
 This is the processed food they eat, using antibacterial soap and 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.610
 Caused by antibiotics. This also explains why Western culture has a high rate of allergies and 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.110
 Autoimmune disease. 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.140
 So when you worry about what you are, you have to 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.200
 Remember that you can control these super biological cells. If you are tiny to you 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.390
 Life is good, there is a good diet, they will take good care of you. Or at least... that ten percent 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.140
 Really you... 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.020
