00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:06.503
If 3 times a number is equal to 3 halves

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:09.723
what is the number? so let's just say

00:00:09.787 --> 00:00:11.637
that our number..unknown number

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:13.807
let's just call that "x". So we could say

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:23.675
3 times our number x is equal to 3 halves

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:26.012
so now we just have to solve for x

00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:27.574
so if we want to isolate an x here on the

00:00:27.574 --> 00:00:29.194
left hand side, the most obvious thing

00:00:29.197 --> 00:00:31.257
to do is 3 times x, if we divide by 3,

00:00:31.257 --> 00:00:32.927
we're gonna left with just x

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:34.757
We can't just do that to one side

00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:36.227
of the equation if we want to

00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:37.283
maintain this equality

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:38.527
we have to do it to both sides

00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:39.401
so you divide both

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:42.157
sides by 3 and we're going to be left with

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:46.137
x is equal to 3 halves divided by 3

00:00:46.137 --> 00:00:49.687
that is the same thing as 3 halves times

00:00:49.687 --> 00:00:55.297
one-third which is going to be

00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:58.947
equal to one half. You can verify that

00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:02.953
3 times one-half is 3 halves
