[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.480
LAMA TSOMO: Well, I'm
excited to be here.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.100
Google's pretty famous.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.170
And I never expected to
even end up here at all.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.580
And to be able to share my
favorite things with you guys

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.040
is just such an
honor and pleasure.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.540
And, of course, I've shared
the benefits of Google,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.180
as has just about everybody
all across the planet,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.649
so kind of a nice cycle
that I get to partake in.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.940
Hopefully there will be some
benefit both from the book

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.810
and from the talk today.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.700
So everybody has
come from busy lives,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.980
whether you're viewing
the video or actually

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.780
sitting in person
right now, and so I'd

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.390
like for everybody to just stop
and take a moment to be quiet.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.449
We so rarely do it
even for a moment.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.620
So while you're
sitting here you might

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.217
think you're doing nothing.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.580
I would say there are a
couple of things you're doing.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.310
One thing is, you're
paying attention, perhaps

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.195
to this lady talking.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.810
And there's something
else you're doing,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.750
and you do it all the time.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.618
You hardly ever notice
you're doing it.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.690
You even do it when
you're sleeping.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.056
So as you might have
guessed, you're breathing.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.570
But we're so busy with all
kinds of other things we're

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.290
paying attention to out there
that we don't pay attention

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.970
to something so
simple and present

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.440
as the breathing
going on in here.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.670
So I ask you just
to take a moment

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.460
and pay attention to this
breathing that you're doing.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.690
And not saying, I am breathing,
but just the experience

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.336
of the belly moving as it moves.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.770
Or maybe you pay
attention and notice

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.040
the coolness in your nostrils
and mouth as the air moves.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.480
Congratulations.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.270
You were just meditating.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.470
[CHUCKLES] It doesn't have to
be some big, mystical thing.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.130
For a long time, early on
in my efforts to meditate,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.910
I had all these ideas about what
meditation was supposed to be.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.780
So I thought it was maybe
some kind of hypnotic state,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.260
or I thought I was
supposed to stop my brain.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.660
And the brain is a
thinking machine.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.710
It manages, it handles thoughts.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.290
And it turns out, those things
were totally inaccurate.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.800
But I didn't get a chance to
have meditation instruction

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.870
for a long time, so
I kept sort of having

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.940
these many misconceptions
and thinking,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.360
I'm a terrible meditator.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.660
Which, by the way, saying
that mantra to yourself

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.660
is not conducive to meditation.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.420
I've proven this.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.420
I've proven a lot of ways
not to meditate, by the way.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.640
So another thing
I proved was what

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.620
happens when I don't meditate.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.240
Though because I finally got so
discouraged, because I thought,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.740
I'm just not meditating well.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.350
I'm not cut out for this.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.040
My mind wanders
all over the place,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.030
I generate lots of thoughts,
I'm just a terrible meditator.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.030
I'm wasting my time.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.140
Forget it.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.740
So I stopped even trying
to do daily meditation.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.430
And I didn't notice
it right away,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.450
but actually my life started
to get more and more off-track.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.660
And after five years of
doing my personal experiment

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.070
in not meditating,
I found myself

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.290
really off-track in my
life, not doing the things

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.400
that really meant something to
me and that were right for me

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.350
in my life.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.180
And it happened by little,
tiny decision after decision.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.340
And we make thousands of
those every day, actually.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.180
And they go by in a flash
and we don't even realize it.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.540
So not coming to
myself every day

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.810
and always having the lens
turned outward, never turning

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.480
it inward and just kind of
taking a break on responding

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.420
to outside things, it turned
out that, even though I

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.360
was doing a bad job of it
with just sitting with myself

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.010
and just being
quiet, I wasn't there

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.920
then when that little
knowing would bubble up.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.694
So what I always think of
is like the eight ball.

00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:45.360
You know that thing
where you turn it up

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.330
and this little
thing bubbles up?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.450
So, I wasn't there to see it.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.050
But my deepest self, my true
self knew what was right

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.060
for me, what was on track
for me, and what wasn't.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.190
And I just wasn't
there to hear it.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.680
So I kind of woke up
to things five years

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.660
after not meditating,
you know, beginning

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.330
my non-meditation
program, and I realized

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.690
I was living in the
place that wasn't right

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.360
for me, with people that
were not right for me,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.850
doing stuff that wasn't
right for me, on and on.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.080
And somehow I guess my inner
self just kind of broke

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.300
through the distraction
and I was able to hear it.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.790
So I thought, oh my gosh,
even my pathetic attempts

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.130
at meditation at least I
was there to hear more.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.530
So I want to meditate every day.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.660
And you know, just kind
of through those thousands

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.130
of little decisions,
a little more track.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.970
Hopefully more
and more on track.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.120
But this time I want
to get instruction.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.600
So as a kid I played piano.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.370
And I got much better
at piano for having

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.420
gone to a piano teacher.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.930
It turns out, it really helps
to go to a piano teacher,

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.450
and practice.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.670
So I thought, maybe the same
principle works for meditation.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:16.800
So I set about trying to find
a teacher who was right for me,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.580
and I made a list of
the qualities I wanted.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.560
They had to be really
highly-realized,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.220
highly-accomplished
meditator, really

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.420
knowledgeable in their
tradition and so on.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.960
And one thing I forgot
to put on the list was,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.770
must speak English.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.240
So he still doesn't
speak English.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.110
He's a Tibetan Lama.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.770
And so I ended up having
to learn Tibetan just

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.828
to be able to converse with him.

00:07:44.828 --> 00:07:47.470
And it's a very difficult
language to learn.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.160
But it turns out, the same
principles are at work.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.030
You can do it a few
minutes every day,

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.230
but it has to be every day.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.090
And sometimes having total
immersion is very important.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.890
And that turns out also to
be true with meditation.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.930
And total immersion in
the Buddhist tradition

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.680
is called retreat.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.180
So I did both daily
meditation and retreats

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.570
and studied with this Lama.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.010
And he really took me on.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.770
And I would try one practice
and it was so beneficial,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.670
I was feeling so much
better and able to handle

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:31.160
the challenges of life better,
and even in the moment of life

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.169
for having been consistently
meditating and doing

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.309
these retreats, I got more
and more excited about it

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.559
and I wanted to do the next
practice and the next one.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:42.400
And one thing led to another
and, as my kids put it,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.010
I was lama-nated.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.430
So I am now a Lama myself.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.410
But not on the
level of my teacher.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.880
I still take from him.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.140
But I have certainly
learned a lot.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.140
And I've had a chance to teach
a lot and work with Westerners,

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.770
and that's been really
rewarding work for me.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:08.570
So I've been more and
more on track for me.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.090
And so what you've
probably heard a lot about

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.190
is the benefits of
meditation for longevity,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.270
the immune system,
working better.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.770
You can even multitask
better because it turns out

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.590
that your brain is actually--
your conscious mind is only

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.630
paying attention to
one thing at a time,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.640
but it's shuttling very quickly.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.990
And it appears to us
that we're multitasking,

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.450
but actually were shuttling.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.780
And meditation--
in fact, the one

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.090
that I'm going to
be teaching you more

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.210
formally in a little
bit, and you already

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.750
started to do-- that
helps with multitasking.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.560
So there are all kinds of
wonderful studies coming out.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.090
Pain-- helping a great
deal with pain, compassion,

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.600
all kinds of benefits.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.840
What I wanted to talk about
and focus more on today

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.070
was living in meaningful life.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.020
And they've only just started
doing a lot of studies on that.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.710
There's one 50-year
study that was

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:19.240
done in a book called "Why Good
Things Happen to Good People."

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.820
And that's a very
interesting study.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.700
But what I really
want to focus on

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.400
is more my understanding
from the Buddhist side of it,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.880
why is it that we all want
to live a meaningful life?

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.060
And why is it that so often
a meaningful life involves

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.300
somehow benefiting others?

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.040
We can just take a
little vote here.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.640
How many people here feel
that a meaningful life to them

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.202
would be somehow, in some
way benefiting others?

00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.400
OK.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.590
It's unanimous.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.470
We have passed by a
unanimous measure.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.140
This is what I always
find to be the case.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.250
Why is that?

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.120
Why wouldn't it
be something else?

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.480
And even in the
studies on the brain,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.337
what makes us happier for
longer is helping somebody else.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.930
So I'll give you a
Buddhist metaphor.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.630
Let's say that we are
all from one source,

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.200
that everything is
created from one source.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.470
And the physicist
David Bohm would

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.970
agree with this, that if you
sort of break it all down

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.170
and you went into subatomic
physics-- in the early days

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.030
it was subatomic physics--
and if we get down

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.020
to that level, then
the inside of my skin

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.230
and the outside of my skin--
it doesn't look any different.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.010
So we can kind of get down
to a common denominator.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.490
So if that root is a
common denominator,

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.180
let's use the
metaphor of an ocean.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.560
So there's one great
big, vast ocean,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.600
and it makes all these different
waves, and each wave is unique.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.040
There are no two that
are exactly alike,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.930
and you can't freeze a wave.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.750
They just keep
changing and moving,

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.977
and their shape
changes and so on.

00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:25.810
But the important thing
that I'm focusing on

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.392
is the uniqueness of all
the waves and the fact

00:12:28.392 --> 00:12:29.850
that they're actually
all connected

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.200
and part of this one big ocean.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:39.420
So each of us is a wave,
and yet we're all connected.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.880
So why else would
it be that when

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:50.200
we see a suffering stray
puppy, our heart is moved

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.040
and we suffer with
them a little bit?

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.870
Now, most of the time
we're too distracted,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.360
but I believe that somebody
who is really accomplished,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.020
somebody like His
Holiness the Dalai Lama--

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.700
the cover boy for
my book-- he can

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.520
feel a huge amount of suffering
on a much more vast level,

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.990
and really suffers with.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.550
So naturally then we're inspired
to do something about that.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.400
And I've noticed that,
for example, people

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.740
who have survived
rape really want

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.960
to work in the field of helping
others who have survived rape.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.730
Or I was listening
recently to somebody

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.350
whose son was killed
by gang violence

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:39.360
and he had to go on this
deep journey of forgiveness,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.480
got to know the family
of the killer of his son,

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.930
got to know the
killer of his son,

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.130
and became good friends
with the grandfather

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.000
of the one who killed his son.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.960
And now the families
have become very close.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.490
And he does presentations
along with the grandfather.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.550
You work with gang
members and work

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:05.570
with families who've lost people
from gang violence and so on,

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.830
and he said he's leading
the most satisfying life he

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.590
could possibly imagine.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.290
Of course he misses his son, but
this is a way that he could--

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.150
it set him on what I
call a redemption story.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.930
And I think we all have
something like that.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.900
And somehow we've-- I know
somebody else who spent seven

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.130
years in a very poor
place-- I'm sorry,

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.220
a year in a very poor
place when she was seven,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:38.450
and she was so moved and felt
such pain that she had a roof

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.820
over her head and food to eat
and they didn't, it set her

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.420
on a path of helping
bring benefit to everyone.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.020
And she's still following
that today in her 50s.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:56.620
So how do we pursue a
life that's meaningful?

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.440
We want our lives to
count for something.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.290
And whatever our unique
gifts are as this wave,

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:08.540
we want to bring that to all of
the ocean and benefit somehow.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.770
How do we find that?

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.470
How do we stay on
track day to day?

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.680
This is where meditation
can be so helpful.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.360
And this is really what
I'm more focusing on,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.280
rather than all of the
other wonderful things

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.620
you've probably read
about in studies.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.800
So how does that work?

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.130
A couple of things.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.510
There are many things
I could point to,

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.470
but we don't have a lot of time.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:41.720
So one thing I can point
to is, when you sit quietly

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.610
and you're not responding
to the stuff on the outside,

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.270
you're taking a break,
and even the stuff

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:53.220
that you normally have to think
about and plan about regarding

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.270
your work-- and I think that's
true for a lot of people here.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.370
You know, it's mental work
that you're doing a lot--

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.960
to take a break from that.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.070
First of all, I have
a lot of mental work.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.820
Writing books, teaching,
that kind of thing,

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.260
working with our
retreat facility

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.310
that we're building and so on.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.949
But taking a break
from it and saying,

00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:19.740
I don't have to think
about that right now.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.290
I have a few minutes where I'm
going to take a real vacation.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.910
So you can take
a daily vacation.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.970
Every day, but a real one.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.940
Not spending a bunch of
money to go to a beach

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.830
or have drinks with
parasols or whatever

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:40.140
and then still your mind is
churning, but a real vacation.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.400
And when you do
that it's like you

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.970
get to look into a pond that
normally is all stirred up,

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.000
and there's silt all
through the water

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.770
and the waves are
churning around,

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.080
and you let that all settle.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.930
And the silt settles.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.240
And the waves
settle a little bit.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.040
It doesn't have to be
perfect, but we can see more

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.280
what the water really is and
what it looks like all the way

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.349
to the bottom.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:08.880
That's what we can
do for ourselves

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.170
in just a few minutes a day.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.790
The key is to do it every day.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.800
I learned this with
practicing piano,

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.780
and I learned it with
learning Tibetan.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.010
it's about doing it every day,
even if only for a few minutes.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.410
And you will make progress.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:31.940
There's a handout that shows the
different stages the brain goes

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.000
through in the process of
forgetting and remembering,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.180
because what you find you
do over and over again

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.780
in meditation-- I'm going to
make this prediction right

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.440
now with confidence-- you're
going to come to this moment

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.140
where you go, oh yeah,
I was meditating.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.710
Because what you
were doing instead

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.220
was spinning a
movie in your mind.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.820
So thoughts come and go.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.640
And we can just sit and let
the thoughts come and go

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.380
as we focus on an
object of support,

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.730
like focusing on the breath.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.770
But there's going to
come a moment where

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.510
we forget to do that and we
start following after a thought

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.590
and making a story, which
is what we-- we all tend

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.980
to do that, as human beings.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.070
And it's the making a story
and making this whole movie

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:24.170
and this continuum that is
now no longer meditation.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.177
Just having the thought come
and go while you stay present

00:18:28.177 --> 00:18:29.760
and you've just
watched it come and go

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.450
and you didn't go after it,
you're still meditating.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.790
That's eligible for meditation.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.920
But as soon as you've
followed after the movie

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.470
and then you say, oh,
yeah, I was meditating.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.580
So particular parts
of the brain light up

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.040
and it's in the handout
which you're welcome to.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.580
And so these are desirable
parts of the brain that normally

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.680
don't light up so much.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.430
We follow after a lot
of thought and make

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.050
a lot of movies all day.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.350
So that's already a good thing.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.740
But there's a couple more.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.960
So after we've remembered,
oh yeah, I was meditating,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.490
we bring our mind back to
the object of meditation,

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.160
other parts of the brain
light up, also very good.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.190
And then we attempt to keep our
mind there as long as we can.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:22.190
That lights up yet other
desirable parts of the brain.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.270
And then we forget
again and so it goes.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:29.660
So that's a wonderful cycle
that Dan Harris calls--

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.902
you know, the news anchor.

00:19:30.902 --> 00:19:32.610
I don't know if you're
familiar with him.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.440
He wrote a book on his
stumbling into meditation.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.580
It's called "10% Happier."

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.310
He refers to this cycle as
bicep curls for the brain.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.060
So it's just fine to
forget and remember,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.690
because then you
get to do all that

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:53.115
and rest freshly in this
peaceful, abiding meditation

00:19:53.115 --> 00:19:53.780
called Samatha.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.360
So what is my
offering to the world?

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.390
I just want to share that
a little bit with you.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.830
In my adventure not
meditating and then

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.460
meditating and discovering it
was so much better when I did,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:18.340
and I felt so much happier just
ongoing, and so much better

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.927
able to handle
challenges in life.

00:20:20.927 --> 00:20:23.010
I thought, well, I want
to share this with others,

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.940
and I don't want them to have to
wait until they're middle-aged,

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.940
they stumble upon a Lama,
they learn to Tibetan,

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.650
they sit in retreat in Nepal
and on a mountain in Montana,

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.480
you know, for years at a time.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.400
Cumulatively I've spent
years in meditation retreat.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.980
I want to make it easy for
Westerners to get started

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.300
and to pursue a path where
they can deepen as much as they

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.600
want to all the way to the end.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.040
Or at least just be able
to pursue daily meditation

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.430
and have the support for that.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:01.470
So I began offering
a weekly class

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:06.070
and I noticed that
really I needed

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.910
to give more background where
they could just kind of refer

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.640
to it on their own.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.875
I thought, I've got
to assign a book.

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:15.500
And also then they don't have to
keep asking the same questions

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.950
because this is so new, they
can just refer to the book.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.640
Well, I just looked
and looked and I

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.580
couldn't find the book
I was looking for,

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.910
so I thought, well,
I'll just write it.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.400
That turned out to
be a big project.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.340
And it grew and grew and grew.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.950
And now this book is one
of a series of three,

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.710
and it's already,
you know, pretty big.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.620
But this is the
introductory one.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.660
And it's assuming absolutely
no prior knowledge.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.910
And in the back of the book
there are practiced cards.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.810
So when you want
to remember, OK,

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.770
how do I-- what's the
step-by-step and just

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.230
a few quick notes,
you can have it right

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.800
there wherever it is that you
normally sit and meditate.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.447
And I also wanted to have more
support than just the book,

00:22:08.447 --> 00:22:10.780
because once I realized I was
going to put this book out

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.820
in the world and not just have
it in a Montana meditation

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:19.530
group, I thought, well,
people need their groups.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:24.620
People need to sit together and
chew on this stuff together.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.430
And how does this
affect my life?

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.200
How does my life
affect my meditation?

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.330
How do I put these
things together?

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.720
And for people to be able
to chew on that together--

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:39.150
I've seen how rich that is
and how deeply people connect

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.670
when they have
something to really sink

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.610
their teeth into like that.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.970
How often do we do that?

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.610
You know, going
to a bar you don't

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:50.620
have quite the same
quality of conversation.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:56.270
So I just suddenly thought,
what if the crew on "How

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:01.240
I Met Your Mother" had set aside
a weekly time in somebody's

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.800
living room and just talked
about this stuff and, you know,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.950
road-tested these methods
and talked about their lives

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.320
together in a meaningful way?

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.160
And I give context pieces,
too, and then people

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.060
could chew on that.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.240
And so we called these
learning circles.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.170
And we've just
begun setting things

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:26.420
up so that you can fairly easily
get started with a learning

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.690
circle.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.880
So you can download a tool kit.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.300
And really, all
the way through, we

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.620
see it's terribly important
how the group relates

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.730
to each other,
what are the norms.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.570
And now I'm getting into
a "New York Times" article

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:49.240
I read about something
called Aristotle, which

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.490
I think you guys know about.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.440
And I was excited to see
that because that's something

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.900
I feel strongly about
and I wanted to be sure

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:07.030
that we covered the meditation
instruction, the background,

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.680
sort of the map-- how
does this all work, what

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.700
is the context, and
so on-- and also

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.050
how can we enact these
things in relationship

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:21.220
to each other in these
small groups that

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.010
are sort of where the rubber
hits the road and even

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.900
in larger groups?

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.050
So I enlisted the help of
my friend Aaron Stern, who's

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:38.880
sitting right here, because he's
an expert at that third piece,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.390
the interrelationships
and how to sort

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:47.440
of enact Buddhism in
relationship with each other.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.400
Because he is an expert
at that, has developed

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.910
some wonderful methods.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:55.500
So we're bringing in some
modern Western methods

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.440
to add to these time-tested
ones from the East.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.201
And so it's a very
rich combination

00:25:01.201 --> 00:25:02.201
that we wanted to offer.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:12.940
I also am really interested in
mixes of ages working together

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:18.060
because there's-- if you think
back to what we evolved with,

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.060
we evolved in villages and
everybody was mixed together.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.050
We weren't separated in classes,
sort of Henry Ford-style

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.580
assembly line learning,
which I think is not natural,

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.280
not a way to go, and
I think that's why

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.050
there's a lot of terrible social
dynamics going on in schools.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:39.900
And then that's our learning
ground for social dynamics.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.200
But there can be a richness
in mixing ages together

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.730
because people in
their young adult years

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.510
have a lot of energy and vision.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.020
They know what's coming
just over the horizon.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.070
And there's a power in that.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.950
There's a particular
power in that.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:04.420
Then for old people like me,
we've been around a long time

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.740
and so we've learned
some techniques,

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.750
educated ourselves
in some things,

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.420
and just spent a lot of
time experiencing life.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.620
And so I think this can be
a very powerful combination.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:21.870
But again, we need to know how
to work together, and want to.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.070
But I think that's what
were designed to do.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.070
And at this time in
the world we all need

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:31.200
to get together and bring all
of our superpowers together.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.220
Our individual
ones as unique ways

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.710
and our different
demographics, all of it

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.750
to come together to solve
the very big challenges

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.515
of this time.

00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:46.660
I think we're ready for
some question and answer,

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.490
and then I will more formally
teach you Samatha practice

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.741
to finish up the session.

00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:54.240
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you very much.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.730
I have so many questions.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.297
I was writing ferociously.

00:26:57.297 --> 00:26:59.005
LAMA TSOMO: Your page
is full of writing.

00:26:59.005 --> 00:26:59.963
FEMALE SPEAKER: I know.

00:26:59.963 --> 00:27:02.450
It's really cathartic
to write by hand

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.320
and not be typing for once.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.210
I need to take a few
notes back to my desk.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.880
So you just touched on this
at the-- sort of the end

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.300
with project Aristotle.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.420
And I think we're
fortunate enough

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.900
to work at a place that
supports developing

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.490
a practice of mindfulness
through things like gPause

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.460
and Search Inside Yourself and
having beautiful meditation

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.110
rooms.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:29.710
But it still is very much
an individual process.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.050
It's very much an
individual journey,

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.350
unless you're lucky
enough to find a teacher.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:38.350
And the general rule of thumb
at Google is, is don't be evil

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.170
or don't be a jerk.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:39.440
You know?

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.023
Nobody wants to work
with that person.

00:27:41.023 --> 00:27:43.410
But I'm wondering
what your thoughts

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:48.090
are on bridging the gap between
sort of this individual, really

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.030
difficult, deep-rooted
practice and then bringing it

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.730
to the workplace and
not necessarily taking

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.310
your whole team to the
meditation room to meditate,

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:02.110
but how can we benefit and
how can our teams benefit

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.420
from the work that we're
doing individually?

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.010
LAMA TSOMO: Mm-hm.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:10.780
So at Namchak we do have a
meditation room also, and at

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:15.780
lunchtime people-- whoever
wants to-- can go in there

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.200
and sit and meditate.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.860
So there's that.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.640
But as you said,
what about that gap?

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.650
So I don't think you need to
have your work groups also

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.480
be your meditation groups.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.640
I think those who are interested
could find each other.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.950
I bet you have
technology for this--

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.590
where those who are interested
could find each other.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:44.400
And I think a good size is,
like, six to eight people.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.180
And if it's more than that there
could be more groups, you know?

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.430
There could be lots of groups.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.763
I don't know how many people
you have working at Google,

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:54.210
but there could be many,
many of these groups.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.680
And they can sit in somebody's
office or a little nook

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.650
in the cafeteria, whatever.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.750
And just decide, you
know, one a week,

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.750
Wednesdays for
lunch or after work

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:11.010
or whatever it is, we're
going to sit together

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:16.650
and we're going to do
the 8-week online course.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.140
We have an online course and
they're weekly installments,

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.910
and so people could
do that together,

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.720
which would be really fun.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.050
Or work their way through
the book, or both because,

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.910
not surprisingly,
since I designed both,

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.750
they're very similar.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.670
Basically covering
the same material.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.580
But the book gives
you more background.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.500
It's got more richness to it.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.240
And so it's a good thing to
refer to at least on your own.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:49.470
And if you guys do set
up learning circles,

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.990
at least for the next little
while every time I come back

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:56.510
to California what I'd like to
do is sit with learning circles

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.920
and talk with people about,
what's your experience?

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.240
How is it going on the cushion?

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.448
How is it going in the group?

00:30:02.448 --> 00:30:04.700
And that kind of thing.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:09.990
The other thing is, I have
convinced my friend Aaron

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.560
to put together a
Saturday workshop

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.800
for working on personal
leadership, group dynamics.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.460
Again, rubber hitting the road
in interpersonal communication

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.010
in groups.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.550
And so that might
be something that

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.070
learning circle
people would like

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.520
and people in just
your work groups

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.500
might also enjoy attending that.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.210
So those are some
ways to get started.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:40.110
And, by the way, there are
teaching videos on the website

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.400
so that you can get
talked through--

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.064
and also audio-- talked
through the meditations.

00:30:46.064 --> 00:30:48.230
And again, meditation cards
in the back of the book.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:52.160
So those are some ways to get
started not just individually

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.685
but also in groups.

00:30:54.685 --> 00:30:57.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: And, you know,
based on your experience--

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.710
obviously now you're immersed
in a community of Namchak that

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.509
is a team of people
who are obviously

00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:05.550
very passionate about this
and dedicated to this.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.430
But sometimes we
might be working

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:12.450
with people who have no
interest in mindfulness.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:15.080
And we all encounter
people in our daily lives

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.630
who don't necessarily
find value in that.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:22.160
So how can you bridge
the gap between someone

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.460
who is dedicated to that
and works towards that

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.560
and might have a
practice, and someone who

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.260
is just at a different point?

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.340
I guess, have you
seen ways in which

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.140
your communication
and your ability

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.380
to work with people of
different backgrounds

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.610
has benefited you through
your meditation practice?

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.990
LAMA TSOMO: Actually,
at Namchak, we

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.640
don't just have meditators.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.430
We also have people
who have no interest

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.236
whatsoever in meditation.

00:31:48.236 --> 00:31:49.360
We have the whole spectrum.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.943
We have people who
are totally gung-ho

00:31:50.943 --> 00:31:53.200
and people who are
never going to do that,

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.670
practicing Christians.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.450
And, by the way,
I've taught people

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.980
who are practicing
Christians who

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.640
wanted to learn how to
meditate and use it every day,

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.940
and they're still really
practicing Christians.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.270
So there's a whole gamut.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.680
And we all really
enjoy working together.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.970
And we have invited Aaron
to come and teach us

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.480
some of his tools
that he's developed

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.620
and work with us and so on.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:23.714
And we've been able to
then work together happily.

00:32:23.714 --> 00:32:25.380
That answers your
question a little bit?

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:25.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:27.727
I had a question a
little earlier on.

00:32:27.727 --> 00:32:29.810
One of the first things
you said is, you realized,

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:30.851
I'm not a good meditator.

00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:32.520
I'm not good at this.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.280
And my assumption would be
that most people in this room

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.420
are somewhat interested
or familiar with

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.230
or have a meditation practice.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:44.490
And there are so many times
when I've experienced this,

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.730
"I'm not a good
meditator" moment.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:51.700
And you mentioned the value
of just sitting and letting

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.640
the water settle, even if it's
only settling a little bit,

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.417
and seeing what the water is
and what's inside the water.

00:32:57.417 --> 00:32:58.750
But what if that doesn't happen?

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.580
LAMA TSOMO: Well, I thought
it wasn't happening.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.440
And that's why I stopped.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.200
And it was only in retrospect
that I realized, wait a minute,

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.200
it was happening more
than I thought it was.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.010
I think we Westerners have kind
of a low opinion of ourselves,

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:17.720
and it's rather unjustified.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.460
At one point it kind
have occurred to me--

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.310
and this is before
my Buddhist days--

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:26.980
I was like, if everything
is made of God, then so

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.330
is everybody, including me.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:31.830
So that's what we're
really made of,

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.288
is something that's very pure,
whatever we want to call it.

00:33:34.288 --> 00:33:38.370
You know, whatever that source
is, that's our source, too.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.680
And so maybe we're not
so terrible after all.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:46.970
But there's a funny story I love
to tell about Mingyur Rinpoche.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:52.920
He's another Lama who-- the
Lamas coming from the East

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.980
were confused by
this Western penchant

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.140
for kicking ourselves and
thinking we're terrible

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.910
and, "I'm not worthy"
and this kind of thing.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.740
Having no compassion
or love for ourselves.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.920
And then, what basis
then do we have

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.159
for having compassion and
love for everybody else?

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:12.380
Love thy neighbor as thyself,
even is in the Bible.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.710
So then maybe that's
why America falls

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.840
so short of our aspirations to
be a compassionate and loving

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.550
country.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.420
But anyway, Mingyur
Rinpoche really

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.210
was trying to understand
his American students,

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:32.340
and he finally decided to do
this unworthiness meditation.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.679
And so he practiced
it every day.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.480
And eventually, after
a couple of weeks

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.699
of assiduously practicing this,
he was feeling kind of crummy.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.949
And it just got kind
of worse and worse

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.570
and then he finally
realized one day,

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.469
I feel terrible about myself.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.350
Isn't this great?

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.350
Now I understand my
Western students.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.780
He was so happy.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.950
And of course, he was able to
reverse it with the practices

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:04.500
that he knew and was able
to really help his students.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: I have one
question before you guide us

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.350
through a meditation.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.390
LAMA TSOMO: OK.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.848
FEMALE SPEAKER: And one of the
first things we did together

00:35:11.848 --> 00:35:12.605
was just breathe.

00:35:12.605 --> 00:35:13.210
That's It.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.810
Just pause and breathe.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:19.540
And almost any time I do
this I think and realize

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.540
how shallow my breath is.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.710
And it's even shallow
when I'm noticing it.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.170
So imagine when I'm
just at my computer

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.890
or in a meeting how
shallow it must be.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.470
And we use such a small
percentage of our lungs.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.860
And I wish we all
could sit and meditate

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.130
in the base of the Rocky
Mountains in Montana,

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:43.500
but unfortunately we don't have
quite that Big Sky fresh air

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.500
around here.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.007
So in atmospheres like
the Silicon Valley

00:35:47.007 --> 00:35:48.840
I'm sure we have beautiful
meditation rooms,

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.220
but how do you remind
yourself, even when you're not

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.992
meditating, to breathe?

00:35:53.992 --> 00:35:55.700
How do you just
incorporate that practice

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.260
into your daily motions?

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.900
LAMA TSOMO: Well, I am
addicted to my computer, too.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.815
And I'll forget I'm on
a mountain top and all

00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:07.690
of the glorious things,
and I'm sitting there

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:11.190
staring at the computer for
hours and hours every day.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.800
I also am in a lot of meetings.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.120
So you forget where you
are, at that point, right?

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.920
You're just paying
attention to the thing.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.530
So I have this program which
I don't remember the name of,

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.660
but I bet there are
several of them.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.580
And it just flashes
on your screen.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.520
You can still see behind
it, and you can always

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.550
click it to dismiss it
quickly if you want to,

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:41.460
but it also is a moment to just
remind you to take a breath

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.730
and actually rest
your-- resting your eyes

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.220
and focusing them at
least 20 feet away

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.490
is really good for your eyes.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.810
Keeps you from going
near-sighted, staring

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.150
at a screen all the time.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:55.230
Your eyes aren't meant to
be focused on one distance

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.520
all the time.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.630
So, for lots of
reasons, you can set it

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.600
for however timing you want,
if you want it every hour,

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.080
every half-hour, whatever it is.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.870
That's a simple reminder.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:11.950
Also, if you do happen to notice
that you're feeling anxious,

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:16.540
it's impossible physiologically
to be as anxious if you

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.470
take a big breath and exhale.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:24.550
So we automatically sigh
sometimes when we're anxious,

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:28.410
and you could just do that
even when your body might not

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.860
have automatically done it.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.450
But if you just know about
this, that's a moment

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:34.840
you can take a big breath.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.777
And when you do meditate
you're not meant to, like,

00:37:37.777 --> 00:37:39.290
force big breaths.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:43.510
It's supposed to be
just quite natural.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:48.200
And I find I tend to
savor in between in-breath

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.730
and out-breath, because
it's just so quiet

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.960
and still for that moment.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.440
I kind of savor that.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.900
So that's what I
would say about that.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.691
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:01.170
Those are useful.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:03.030
I wrote them down in
case any of you didn't.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:06.650
You can come take
my notes later.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:09.062
So if you would like
to guide us through.

00:38:09.062 --> 00:38:09.770
LAMA TSOMO: Yeah.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:14.620
So now we'll do a
more official guiding

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.460
through the practice
of Samatha meditation.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.800
Shyine, in Tibetan.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.040
And Shyine means
"peaceful abiding."

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.340
there are many different
kinds of meditation.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.900
Everybody thinks there's-- or,
most people think there's just

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.900
one, but actually you can
come at this thing from many

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.940
directions.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.840
Some are compassion
meditations, some

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.790
are-- actually there some
very athletic ones further

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.610
on down the road.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:50.820
And some that clear away the
first static that we feel

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.790
when we sit down to meditate.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.140
But the one I'm going to
share with you is Samatha.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.120
So there isn't too much
more than I already

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.585
told you, actually.

00:38:59.585 --> 00:39:02.610
It's very simple.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.220
That doesn't mean
easy, but simple.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.210
So one thing is posture.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:14.210
And this is going to help you
to achieve the clear yet calm

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.110
state that we're going for.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.380
What we aren't going
for is agitated,

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.790
nor are we going for sleepy.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:23.600
And I don't know about you, but
when I haven't had enough sleep

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.030
and I drink too much coffee, I
can do both agitated and sleepy

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.280
at same time.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.750
So we're not going for that.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:34.870
We're going for clear and calm.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:38.980
So there is an exercise for
that that only takes, like,

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.740
30 to 60 seconds.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.430
It's in the book and there's
a demonstration of it

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:47.187
because there are some
movements on our website.

00:39:47.187 --> 00:39:49.020
You can get to our
website from the handout.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.080
It's Namchak.org.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:40:00.250
N-A-M-C-H-A-K. Namchak.org.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.730
Because you'll need
to see a video of that

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.140
to really be able to do it.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.900
But it kind of jump starts
your Samatha practice.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.510
So here's Samatha.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.820
You sit with your back straight.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.550
If you can do full Lotus
position, wonderful.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.420
Tell your friends.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.290
You should be proud you
can also sit cross-legged.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:20.920
You can sit on a chair.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.460
Any of that will do.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.480
The main thing is
that you're sitting

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.130
with your hip joint bent.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:34.130
And there's-- you know,
what happens with the prana,

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:37.790
the chi, is helped by that.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:40.380
And then you need your back
straight because again,

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:46.620
your prana needs to flow
in a straight, open pathway

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.300
up your spine.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:55.930
So you're sitting not
with a taut, rigid spine,

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.470
but supple and straight.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:01.180
And it turns out that
hunching is actually

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:05.930
straining some muscles
more than you realize.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:09.400
And a favorite thing is to
hunch and then have the head up,

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.540
and then go visit the
chiropractor for your neck.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.100
So if you have your
vertebrae like a column,

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.110
it's actually less
strain on everything.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.210
And you sit on your
sit bones, whether it's

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:25.140
a chair or cross-legged
or whatever it is.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.090
If you are sitting on
the floor cross-legged,

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:30.870
it's important to have a
little bit of elevation.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:36.880
Your rear needs to be on a
firm cushion and your knees

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.150
a little bit lower, and
it just really helps

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:44.610
to be able to sit straight
comfortably, very easily.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:45.650
So that's important.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.140
And the visualization
that I think

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.440
helps for me is imagining
that, through the back top

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:55.770
of my head, is a string that's
hanging from the ceiling.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:58.580
So I'm like this marionette.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.310
Very relaxed, very supple,
hanging from the ceiling.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:09.830
And in our tradition we don't
close the eyes all the way,

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:13.590
we have them facing
down, sort of following

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:14.970
the line of the nose down.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:21.950
And your mouth is
a little bit open.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:27.080
You're going to actually breathe
mostly through your mouth.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.080
The tip of your
tongue is touching

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.364
where the upper palate meets
the teeth, the upper teeth.

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.536
And once again, you just pay
attention to your breath.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.880
Again, it's the
direct experience

00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:03.140
of the movement of your belly or
the coolness across your mouth.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:23.017
Thoughts will come and
go, and we let them.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:59.380
You find you've been following
after a thought, good.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:05.650
That's more awareness than
maybe you've had in years.

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:08.210
Noticing that.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.990
And doing that bicep
curl for the brain,

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:15.065
bringing your mind
attention back to breath.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.300
And breathing naturally.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.820
That was a quick introduction.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:28.410
And I'd like to follow
through with more right now,

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:32.420
so if anyone had
their devices on,

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:33.810
I'd like you to turn it off.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:37.280
You won't need to
take any more notes.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:42.867
And I invite you to take a
few minutes of real vacation.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.260
So we'll do this
again, remembering

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.540
the marionette posture.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.510
Eyes gazing down.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.990
Tip of the tongue
where the upper palate

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:07.124
meets the upper teeth.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.434
And settling our
attention on breath.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.300
Again, if you've been following
after a thought, good.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.220
You noticed.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:59.125
Bring it back and settle
freshly back into Samatha.

00:48:51.082 --> 00:48:55.580
The more times you notice
you've been making movies

00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:02.820
in your mind, the more that
means you've been aware of it,

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.890
and the more times you can
freshly come back to Samatha.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:52.920
If you find your
mind is too jumpy,

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.607
try to bring your
gaze a bit lower.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:02.430
And if it's a bit sleepy,
raise your gaze just a bit.

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:09.690
Now I'd like you to take
a moment and reflect.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:12.918
Ask yourself, how am
I feeling right now?

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.170
Adjectives, perhaps.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.670
Images.

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:42.970
Whatever this is that you're
feeling, hopefully good,

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:46.980
I'd like you to savor it
for just a moment more

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:50.150
as I ring the bell.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.875
And you listen to the sound
as it slowly fades away.

00:51:57.288 --> 00:52:00.276
[BELL RINGS]

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:44.880
Thank you.
