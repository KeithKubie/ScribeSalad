00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:01.797
- [Instructor] We have already covered

00:00:01.797 --> 00:00:06.511
the notion of area between
a curve and the x-axis

00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:08.624
using a definite integral.

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:11.364
We are now going to then extend this

00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:14.336
to think about the area between curves.

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:16.124
So let's say we care about the region

00:00:16.124 --> 00:00:19.583
from x equals a to x equals b

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:23.229
between y equals f of x
and y is equal to g of x.

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:25.063
So that would be

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:26.313
this area right

00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:28.636
over here.

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:31.124
So based on what you already know

00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:33.074
about definite integrals,

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.582
how would you actually
try to calculate this?

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:38.159
Well one natural thing that you might say

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:39.297
is well look,

00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:41.317
if I were to take the integral

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:42.234
from a to b

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.763
of f of x dx,

00:00:46.844 --> 00:00:49.514
that would give me the entire area

00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:50.514
below f of x

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.833
and above the x-axis.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:56.132
And then if I were to subtract from that

00:00:56.132 --> 00:00:58.848
this area right over here,

00:00:58.848 --> 00:01:00.776
which is equal to

00:01:00.776 --> 00:01:03.585
that's the definite integral from a to b

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:04.918
of g of x dx.

00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:09.530
Well then I would net out
with the original area

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.830
that I cared about.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.709
I would net out with this
area right over here.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:15.869
And that indeed would be the case.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.842
And we know from our
integration properties

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:19.421
that we can rewrite this as

00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:21.348
the integral from a to b

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:24.715
of, let me put some parentheses here,

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:25.548
of f of x

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.492
minus g of x,

00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:30.986
minus g of x

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.559
dx.

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:37.254
And now I'll make a claim to you,

00:01:37.254 --> 00:01:39.228
and we'll build a little
bit more intuition for this

00:01:39.228 --> 00:01:40.946
as we go through this video,

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:43.245
but over an integral from a to b

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:45.497
where f of x is greater than g of x,

00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:46.821
like this interval right over here,

00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:49.398
this is always going to be the case,

00:01:49.398 --> 00:01:51.395
that the area between the curves

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:53.415
is going to be the integral

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:55.830
for the x-interval that we
care about, from a to b,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.338
of f of x minus g of x.

00:01:58.338 --> 00:01:59.522
So I know what you're thinking,

00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:01.403
you're like okay well that
worked when both of them

00:02:01.403 --> 00:02:03.028
were above the x-axis,

00:02:03.028 --> 00:02:04.909
but what about the case when f of x

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.115
is above the x-axis and g of x

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:08.833
is below the x-axis?

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.296
So for example,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.897
let's say that we were to
think about this interval

00:02:12.897 --> 00:02:13.918
right over here.

00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:15.822
Let's say this is the point c,

00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:17.819
and that's x equals c,

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.258
this is x equals d right over here.

00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:22.765
So what if we wanted to calculate

00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:24.348
this area that I am

00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:27.850
shading in right over here?

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.776
You might say well does
this actually work?

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.471
Well let's think about now

00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:33.971
what the integral,

00:02:35.095 --> 00:02:37.138
let's think about what the integral

00:02:37.138 --> 00:02:40.388
from c to d of f of x dx represents.

00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:48.911
Well that would represent
this area right over here.

00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:52.161
And what would the integral from c to d

00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:55.768
of g of x dx represent?

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.499
Well you might say it is

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.264
this area right over here,

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.541
but remember,

00:03:02.541 --> 00:03:06.349
over this interval g of
x is below the x-axis.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.205
So this would give you a negative value.

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:11.109
But if you wanted this total area,

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.944
what you could do is take this blue area,

00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:14.314
which is positive,

00:03:14.314 --> 00:03:17.286
and then subtract this negative area,

00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:21.280
and so then you would get
the entire positive area.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.811
Well this just amounted to,

00:03:23.811 --> 00:03:26.318
this is equivalent to the integral

00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:27.235
from c to d

00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:29.380
of f of x,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.119
of f of x minus g of x again,

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:36.202
minus g of x.

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.436
Let me make it clear, we've
got parentheses there,

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:42.436
and then we have our dx.

00:03:43.803 --> 00:03:44.801
So once again,

00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.287
even over this interval when one of,

00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:48.145
when f of x was above the x-axis

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:49.979
and g of x was below the x-axis,

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.787
we it still boiled down to the same thing.

00:03:53.787 --> 00:03:55.297
Well let's take another scenario.

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:57.108
Let's take the scenario when they are both

00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:59.058
below the x-axis.

00:03:59.058 --> 00:04:02.449
Let's say that we wanted to go from

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.514
x equals, well I won't
use e since that is a

00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:09.206
loaded letter in mathematics,
and so is f and g.

00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:11.504
Well let's just say well
I'm kinda of running

00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:12.758
out of letters now.

00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:15.614
Let's say that I am gonna go from

00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:18.494
I don't know, let's just call this m,

00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:21.141
and let's call this n right over here.

00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:25.134
Well n is getting, let's
put n right over here.

00:04:25.134 --> 00:04:27.108
So what I care about

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:28.191
is this area,

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.497
the area once again below f.

00:04:31.497 --> 00:04:33.215
We're assuming that we're
looking at intervals

00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:34.701
where f is greater than g,

00:04:34.701 --> 00:04:36.791
so below f and greater than g.

00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:38.672
Will it still amount to this with now

00:04:38.672 --> 00:04:40.552
the endpoints being m and n?

00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:42.735
Well let's think about it a little bit.

00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:45.220
If we were to evaluate that integral

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.137
from m to n

00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:51.094
of, I'll just put my dx here,

00:04:51.094 --> 00:04:51.927
of f of x

00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:54.899
minus,

00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:57.309
minus g of x,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.311
we already know from
our integral properties,

00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:03.842
this is going to be equal to the integral

00:05:03.842 --> 00:05:05.305
from m to n

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.555
of f of x dx

00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:09.615
minus the integral

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:12.166
from m to n

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:14.602
of g of x dx.

00:05:15.847 --> 00:05:17.867
Now let's think about what
each of these represent.

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:20.584
So this yellow integral right over here,

00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:21.834
that would give

00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:26.342
this the negative of this area.

00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:28.920
So that would give a negative value here.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.845
But the magnitude of it,
the absolute value of it,

00:05:31.845 --> 00:05:34.144
would be this area right over there.

00:05:34.144 --> 00:05:35.677
Now what would just the integral,

00:05:35.677 --> 00:05:37.256
not even thinking about
the negative sign here,

00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:38.974
what would the integral of this g of x

00:05:38.974 --> 00:05:41.040
of this blue integral give?

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.571
Well that would give this the negative

00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:45.615
of this entire area.

00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:48.401
But now we're gonna take
the negative of that,

00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:51.907
and so this part right over here,

00:05:51.907 --> 00:05:54.415
this entire part including
this negative sign,

00:05:54.415 --> 00:05:56.250
would give us,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.036
would give us this entire area,

00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:00.383
the entire area.

00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:02.171
This would actually give a positive value

00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:04.168
because we're taking the
negative of a negative.

00:06:04.168 --> 00:06:06.559
But if with the area that we care about

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:09.671
right over here, the area that
we cared about originally,

00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:12.759
we would want to subtract
out this yellow area.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.663
Well this right over here,

00:06:14.663 --> 00:06:16.219
this yellow integral from,

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.377
the definite integral
from m to n of f of x dx,

00:06:19.377 --> 00:06:20.398
that's exactly that.

00:06:20.398 --> 00:06:22.674
That is the negative of that yellow area.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:25.716
So if you add the blue area,

00:06:25.716 --> 00:06:27.991
and so the negative of a
negative is gonna be positive,

00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:29.477
and then this is going to be the negative

00:06:29.477 --> 00:06:30.778
of the yellow area,

00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:32.775
you would net out once again to the area

00:06:32.775 --> 00:06:34.493
that we think about.

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:36.025
So in every case we saw,

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.697
if we're talking about an interval

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.903
where f of x is greater than g of x,

00:06:39.903 --> 00:06:42.341
the area between the curves

00:06:42.341 --> 00:06:44.826
is just the definite
integral over that interval

00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:47.493
of f of x minus g of x dx.
