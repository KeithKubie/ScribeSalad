00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.889
The Origin of the Republican Party

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.049
Pro environmental legislation, peace, universal
health care and progressive policies (including

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.990
raising taxes)- your granddaddy wouldn't recognize
the GOP of today.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.109
So how did the Republic Party get its start
and evolve to its modern state?

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.039
By the mid-19th century, the fabric of the
United States was being torn apart by slavery.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.740
The famous 1820 agreement, the Missouri Compromise,
which had prohibited the spread of slavery

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.480
in much of the former Louisiana Territory,
was repealed in 1854.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.340
Northern anti-slavery activists, including
luminaries Salmon Chase, Charles Sumner and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.070
Horace Greeley, came together to form an anti-slavery
party.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.670
Greeley, in a June 1854 New York Times editorial,
christened the party: “We should not care

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.561
much whether those thus united [against slavery]
were designated "Whig," "Free Democrat" or

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:03.990
something else; though we think some simple
name like Republican would more fitly designate

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.420
those who had united to restore the Union
to its true mission of champion and promulgator

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.510
of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery."A
meeting was held on June 6, 1854 "Under the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.910
Oaks" near Jackson, Michigan in which 10,000
people attended.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.630
Shortly thereafter, the newly formed Republican
party gained control of Michigan, and made

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.540
significant inroads elsewhere.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.250
As such, by 1855, the Republicans controlled
the U.S. House of Representatives.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.460
At its national convention on June 17, 1856,
John C. Fremont was the first nominee to represent

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.220
the party in the race for President of the
United States; the famous slogan for his unsuccessful

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.240
bid was: "Free Press, Free Soil, Free Men,
Fremont and Victory."

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.220
The Party of Lincoln The Republican Party
saw its first President in the form of Abraham

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.180
Lincoln who won the election of 1860 and became
the 16th President of the United States on

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.979
March 4, 1861.

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.849
On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired
on Fort Sumter and the United States Civil

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.780
War officially began.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.849
On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation
Proclamation that stated: "that all persons

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.310
held as slaves" in the Confederacy "are, and
henceforward shall be free."

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.319
Lincoln died on April 14, 1865, but the Republican
Party carried on the civil rights crusade.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.200
With Reconstruction, the 13th (outlawing slavery),
14th (guaranteeing civil rights) and 15th

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.129
(right to vote) Amendments to the Constitution
were passed, as well as the Civil Rights Act

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.859
of 1866.

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:48.359
These protected newly freed slaves and others
alike to vote, own land, find work, use public

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.290
accommodations and hold public office.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.870
The Party of Roosevelt (the other Roosevelt)Ascending
to become the 26th President of the United

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.030
States at the death of William McKinley on
September 6, 1901, Theodore Roosevelt is remembered

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.510
not only for his Rough Riders and tough talk
("Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick"), but

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.609
his commitment to the environment and his
fellow man.

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.579
Teddy broke the power of the trusts (powerful
monopolies), won a Nobel Peace Prize for helping

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.159
to end the Russo-Japanese War and created
numerous national parks, forest reserves and

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.489
national monuments.

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.151
Crater Lake, Devil's Tower and large areas
of the Grand

00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:32.140
Canyon are only three noteworthy examples
of the dozens of wild places he protected.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.840
During his tenure, U.S. forests reserves quadrupled
from 43 million to 194 million acres.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.790
The Party of Eisenhower The 34th President
of the United States, Republican Dwight D.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.319
Eisenhower swept into office with a policy
of "Modern Republicanism."

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.949
A war hero, he was the Supreme Commander of
allied forces during the successful D-Day

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.959
invasion on June 6, 1944.

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.199
Taking office in 1953 during the Cold War,
Eisenhower was committed to peace, and counted

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.900
signing the armistice that ended the Korean
Conflict among his accomplishments.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.230
Also committed to civil rights, he ordered
U.S. troops to support integration of the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.689
schools in Little Rock, and is quoted as saying:
"there must be no second class citizens in

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:16.739
this country."

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.099
In his Farewell Presidential Address to the
nation, Eisenhower warned us to be vigilant

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.870
against the undue influence of the defense
industry on government: “A vital element

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.289
in keeping the peace is our military establishment.

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.069
Our arms must be might, ready for instant
action, so that no potential aggressor may

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:38.440
be tempted to risk his own destruction . . . . But
now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.690
of national defense; we have been compelled
to create a permanent armaments industry of

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.050
vast proportions . . . . This conjunction
of an immense military establishment and a

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.120
large arms industry is new in the American
experience . . . . Yet we must not fail to

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.700
comprehend its grave implications . . . . In
the councils of government, we must guard

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.560
against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.560
complex.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.439
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced
power exists and will persist.”The Party

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:16.009
of NixonSetting aside any high crimes and
misdemeanors, the 37th President of the United

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.250
States Richard M. Nixon had some significant
accomplishments during his five years in office.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.009
He was the first American president to visit
the People's Republic of China in February

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.220
1972, and his talks with Soviet General Secretary
Leonid Brezhnev led to the Strategic Arms

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.550
Limitation Treaty (a nuclear limitation pact).

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.240
Domestically, Nixon established the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.100
Later,when he signed the Clean Air Act on
December 31, 1970, he opined, "I think that

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.629
1970 will be known as the year of the beginning,
in which we really began to move on the problems

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:58.159
of clear air and clean water and open spaces
for the future generations of America."

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:04.110
Also of note, in 1971, Nixon, imposed price
controls and ended the gold standard for the

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.110
dollar.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.870
In September of that year, he abolished the
military draft.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.830
But perhaps the most surprising thing about
his presidency was his idea for a "Comprehensive

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.319
Health Insurance Plan."

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.590
Proposed to Congress on February 6, 1974,
Nixon advocated a universal

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.419
health care system that is remarkably similar
to the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare)

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.849
of 2010.

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.979
The Party of ReganOur 40th President of the
United States Ronald Reagan was not afraid

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.810
to tax and spend when the country needed it.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:42.139
In 1983, he agreed to a $165 billion bailout
of an ailing Social Security program.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:48.509
He also created the Department of Veterans
Affairs on March 15, 1989, a much-needed agency

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.699
that added more than 60,000 people to the
federal payroll.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:57.000
More shockingly, however, he is credited with
raising taxes 11 times.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.180
As noted historian Douglas Brinkly told NPR:
"Ronald Reagan was never afraid to raise taxes.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:17.009
. . . He knew that it was necessary at times."
