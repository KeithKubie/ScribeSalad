00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.660
It is still tragically sometimes assumed

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.820
that the best way to cheer someone up is to tell them that everything will be alright.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.140
To intimate that life is essentially a pleasant process

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.900
in which happiness is no mirage and human fulfillment a real possibility.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.360
However, we need only read a few pages of the book known as The Pensées

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.300
by the great French 17th century philosopher Blaise Pascal

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.040
to appreciate how entirely misguided this approach must be.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.740
Because Pascal pulls off the feet of being both one of the most pessimistic figures in western thought

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.860
and simultaneously one of the most cheering.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.060
The combination seems typical.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.380
The darkest thinkers can, paradoxically, often be the ones who best lift our mood.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.520
Pascal was born in Auvergne in central France in June 1623.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.340
And from the earliest days learnt to look at the glass of life as half empty.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.480
His mother died when he was three, he had few friends, he was a hunchback, and he was always ill.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.200
Luckily, he was recognized from an early age - and by more than just his proud family - to be a genius.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.920
By 12, he'd worked out the first 32 propositions of Euclid.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.100
He went on to invent the mathematics of probability.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.020
He measured atmospheric pressure,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.040
constructed a calculating machine,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.680
and designed Paris's first omnibus.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.920
Then, at the age of 36, ill health forced him to set aside plans for further scientific exploration

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.460
and led him to write a brilliant, intensely pessimistic series of aphorisms in defense of Christian belief

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.860
which became known as the Pensées, the book for which we today chiefly remember and revere him

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.900
The purpose of the book was to convert readers to God and Pascal felt the best way to do this

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.380
was to evoke everything that was terrible about life.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.480
Having fully considering the misery of the human condition,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.320
he assumed his readers would then instantly turn for salvation to the Catholic church.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.020
Unfortunately for Pascal, very few modern readers now follow the Pensées like this.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.260
The first part of the book, listing what's wrong with life,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.760
has always proved far more popular than the second, which suggests what's so right with God.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.000
Pascal begins by telling us that earthly happiness is an illusion.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.420
But he's especially keen to point out how much we hate being on our own, thinking and exploring our own condition.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.240
Pascal is perhaps best known for this aphorism of genius:

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.980
"All of man's unhappiness comes from his inability to stay peacefully alone in his room."

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.060
This aphorism should be written in large letters in the departure lounges of all the world's airports.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.440
Pascal's charm lies in his bitterness and tart cynicism.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.840
People will do anything rather than consider their dreadful reality, he thinks.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.140
Man is so vain that the slightest thing, like pushing a ball with a billiard cue,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.980
is enough to divert him.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.800
At the same time for Pascal, people are tortured by their passions, especially the passion for fame.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.240
We are so presumptuous that we want to be known all over the world, even by people who will only come after we have gone.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.380
And perhaps the greatest source of suffering is the most banal:

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.340
Boredom.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.940
We struggle against obstacles but once they are overcome,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.080
rest proves intolerable

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.000
because of the boredom it produces.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.220
Pascal's bitter conclusion: "What is man? A nothing compared to the infinite."

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.860
Pascal misses no opportunities to confront his readers with evidence of

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.000
mankind's resolutely deviant, pitiful, and unworthy nature.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.720
In constantly seductive classical French,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.160
he informs us that happiness is an illusion.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.960
That misery is the norm.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.840
That true love is a chimera.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.360
That we are as thin-skinned as we are vain.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.080
That even the strongest among us are rendered helpless by the countless diseases to which we're vulnerable.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.100
That all worldly institutions are corrupt.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.080
and finally, that we are absurdly prone to overestimate our own importance.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.500
The very best we may hope to do in these circumstances, Pascal suggests,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.220
is to face the desperate facts of our situation head-on.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.200
Given the tone, it comes as a real surprise to discover that reading Pascal

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.880
is not at all the depressing experience one might have presumed.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.120
The work is consoling, heart-warming, and even at times pretty hilarious.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.520
For those teetering on the verge of despair, there can paradoxically be no finer book to turn to

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.280
than one which seeks to grind man's every last hope  into the dust.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.680
The Pensées, far more than any saccharine volume touting inner beauty, positive thinking, or the realization of hidden potential

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.540
has the power to coax the suicidal off the ledge of a high parapet.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.360
If Pascal's pessimism can so effectively console us,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.140
it's because we usually cast into gloom not so much by negativity as by hope.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.440
It's hope with regard to our careers, our love lives, our children, our politicians, our planet

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.620
that's primarily to blame for angering and then embittering us.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.520
The incompatibility between the size of our aspirations and the mean reality of our condition

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:06.280
generates the violent disappointments which torture our days and etch themselves in lines of acrimony across our faces.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.980
We should honor Pascal and the long line of Christian pessimists to which he belongs for doing us the great favor

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.800
of publicly and elegantly rehearsing the facts of our rather sinful and pitiful state.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.680
Reading Pascal reminds us that the secular are, at this moment in history,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.460
a great deal more optimistic than the religious.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:33.220
Something of an irony, given the frequency with which the latter have been derided by the former for their apparent naïvety.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.160
It's the secular whose longing for perfection has grown so intense

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.120
as to lead them to imagine that paradise might be realized on this earth

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.900
after just a few more years of financial growth and medical research.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.900
With no evident awareness of the contradiction, they may in the same breath gruffly dismiss a belief in angels

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.880
while sincerely trusting that the combined powers of the IMF, the medical research establishment, Silicon Valley, and democratic politics

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.480
will together cure the ills of mankind.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.780
Religions have wisely insisted that we are inherently flawed creatures

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.860
incapable of everlasting happiness, beset by troubling desires, obsessed by status,

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.000
vulnerable to appalling accidents, and always heading for death.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.060
Why should any of this be so cheering?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.180
Perhaps because pessimistic exaggeration is so comforting.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:26.880
Whatever our private disappointments, we can start to feel very fortunate when we compare our mood to Pascal's.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.740
Pascal wanted to turn us to God by telling us how awful life was.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:39.500
But by sharing his pessimistic analyses, he ironically strengthens us to face the trouble of our own lives on this Earth

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.000
with greater courage, forbearance, and occasional humor.
