Frank Parrish needed to know what was

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349
Frank Parrish needed to know what was
 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.480
Frank Parrish needed to know what was
going on beyond the beach

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490
going on beyond the beach
 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.150
going on beyond the beach
on an earlier mission he turned to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160
on an earlier mission he turned to
 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.310
on an earlier mission he turned to
national Geographics Crittercam

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.339
Crittercam is a recording device once

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349
Crittercam is a recording device once
 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.830
Crittercam is a recording device once
attached to an animal it records its

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840
attached to an animal it records its
 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.140

every move

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
every move
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.249
every move
this gave us the opportunity to

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259
this gave us the opportunity to
 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.290
this gave us the opportunity to
basically follow the seal into the water

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:42.000
and we found some pretty exciting things

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010
 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.439
we found that they were going right off

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449
we found that they were going right off
 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.579
we found that they were going right off
shore and they were sleeping 50% of the

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589
shore and they were sleeping 50% of the
 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:49.569
shore and they were sleeping 50% of the
time that they're away from the beach

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579
time that they're away from the beach
 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.189
time that they're away from the beach
they weren't eating they were sleeping I

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199
they weren't eating they were sleeping I
 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.770
they weren't eating they were sleeping I
was that was a shock

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780
 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.160
Frank had no idea how deep the riddle of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170
Frank had no idea how deep the riddle of
 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.939
Frank had no idea how deep the riddle of
monk Ziya life was about to get

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949
 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.840
the seals headed into the murky depths

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850
the seals headed into the murky depths
 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.210
the seals headed into the murky depths
too dark for the camera to see I would

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220
too dark for the camera to see I would
 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.749
too dark for the camera to see I would
start but satellite tags showed the

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759
start but satellite tags showed the
 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.570
start but satellite tags showed the
seals clustering over one specific

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580
seals clustering over one specific
 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.000
seals clustering over one specific
location

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010
 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.640
Frank and other experts joined the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650
Frank and other experts joined the
 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.350
Frank and other experts joined the
University of Hawaii to investigate

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.680
in a deep sea submarine they plunge into

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690
in a deep sea submarine they plunge into
 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:45.370
in a deep sea submarine they plunge into
darkness down an incredible 1,600 feet

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380
 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.860
that's pretty much barren is boring

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870
that's pretty much barren is boring
 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:56.040
that's pretty much barren is boring
there's not much to say

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050
 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.560
then suddenly oh what's that oh look at

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570
then suddenly oh what's that oh look at
 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.950
then suddenly oh what's that oh look at
that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960
that
 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.670
that
there's life as a big dream we came to

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680
there's life as a big dream we came to
 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.960
there's life as a big dream we came to
these things that were sticking up there

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970
these things that were sticking up there
 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.370
these things that were sticking up there
kind of like pinnacles off the bottom

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380
kind of like pinnacles off the bottom
 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.810
kind of like pinnacles off the bottom
and then they were completely encrusted

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820
and then they were completely encrusted
 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.199
and then they were completely encrusted
with these big beautiful gold corals you

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209
with these big beautiful gold corals you
 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.400
with these big beautiful gold corals you
got down there you were looking at what

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410
got down there you were looking at what
 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.800
got down there you were looking at what
the seals were feeding at

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810
the seals were feeding at
 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.890
the seals were feeding at
here fish can't hide from seals in the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900
here fish can't hide from seals in the
 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.350
here fish can't hide from seals in the
coral they're easier to catch open

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360
coral they're easier to catch open
 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.860
coral they're easier to catch open
bottom sand places loose rock that they

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870
bottom sand places loose rock that they
 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.380
bottom sand places loose rock that they
can flip over I mean they're finding

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390
can flip over I mean they're finding
 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.410
can flip over I mean they're finding
habitats that they can get at the fish

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420
 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:48.760
then on a follow-up dive proof positive

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770
 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.520
oh my god

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530
oh my god
 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.340
oh my god
a monk seal at the bottom of the world

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350
a monk seal at the bottom of the world
 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:03.399
a monk seal at the bottom of the world
foraging for food

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409
 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.949
this discovery radically changes the way

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959
this discovery radically changes the way
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.750
this discovery radically changes the way
scientists must view where seals live

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.170
their habitat must be protected beyond

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180
their habitat must be protected beyond
 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.239
their habitat must be protected beyond
the beaches beyond the shallow corals
