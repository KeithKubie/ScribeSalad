00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.370
But now we come to a robot that
we can demonstrate for you.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.830
It's the PUMA, which stands for
programmable universal machine

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.820
for assembly.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.040
In fact, it'll do many
other things as well.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.230
Mr. Hammond is in
complete control.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.490
I hope, and so he'll
now start the robot off.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.310
So that's the starting position.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.770
He has several movements.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.100
That's waist, now shoulder.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.840
As for the right arm,
that's a shoulder movement

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.850
as for the left arm.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.880
That's two movements.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.380
That's elbow that makes three.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:06.820
And then we have free movements
of the wrist, roll, pitch,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.350
and yaw.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.820
So that's the complete
set of movements

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.200
with the gripper at the end.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.600
That head can be replaced
by various devices

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.360
according to the
job required to do.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.030
Now these are the
single movements.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.600
There's an electric motor
driving each of these joints.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.840
Now we'll show you that
the arm can be coordinated,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.240
so that, like your
own arm, you move

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.330
various joints at the same time
to produce certain motions.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.390
And so let's go off with
the coordinated motion

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.160
in a straight line.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.650
Called that the x
direction, if you like.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.880
There she goes.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.576
Now we'll do the y direction.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.775
And the z direction.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.260
And then he can
do inclined lines.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.690
I'd better let him
start, I think,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.460
so I know which way
he's going for this.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.180
All the joints,
practically all, are

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.870
moving as he follows that trace
and now he's doing that one.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.720
And no doubt will
follow it by that one.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.550
So that's three lines
in different directions.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.600
So now he'll show you something
about reproducibility i.e

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.320
getting back to the same
place in succession.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.990
For that, we will apply
that point pointer.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.610
Its gripped.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.939
I will now stand safely back
and watch the proceedings.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.210
That's a point in
space, a marker,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.100
and he's approaching
from behind.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.290
He's now doing a rapid movement
in space, showing off a little

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.640
you might say.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.260
And coming back from the top.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.040
Important thing is that he's
getting back to the same place.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.330
He's showing off
again and now he's

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.560
coming in again to
exactly the same position.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.680
That's good.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.450
So you can see it
repeats itself,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.760
and it can do these
motions in between.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.930
We take the pointer out
now and invite a challenger

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.750
to see if he can beat the
robot at a game, with which I

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.690
have to say, the robot
is extremely good.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.980
So do we have a volunteer?

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.480
Douglas.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.542
Douglas has, I have to
admit, I tried this before.

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:45.740
Now this is the competition.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:54.500
Douglas will, in a moment,
point this little curved piece

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.210
of wire, and I
switch it on, you can

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.240
see that every time
he touches that wire,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.520
it makes a rather
unpleasant noise.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.460
Now your job is
to take it around,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.520
Douglas if you
will, in one hand,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.630
around the wire and
see how far I get

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.715
without making funny noises.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.224
Once, doing really well,
thank you, keep going.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.570
Can you just go a little faster?

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.070
[BEEPING]

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.510
Two.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.010
[BEEPING]

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.460
Three.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.910
[BEEPING]

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.790
[BEEPING]

00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:43.950
That's very good.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.950
If we stop at the
top, that's a very,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.890
and you're putting it back, and
we'll switch the machine off.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.680
And I may tell you that that's
not an easy thing to do.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.760
I touched about 20 times
on the first curve.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.728
So Douglas has done
extremely well.

00:04:58.728 --> 00:05:05.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.050
You notice I switch
the machine off.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.226
Well, we'll start off
by getting the robot

00:05:11.226 --> 00:05:12.350
to switch it back on again.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:17.707
It's on.

00:05:30.856 --> 00:05:31.370
[BEEPING]

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.610
Oh dear.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.110
That's not very good.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.360
I think it can do better that.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.700
Mr. Hammond is now
telling it to get going.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.540
[BEEPING]

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.310
Oh dear.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.000
Couldn't you do something
to it and get it going round

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.540
without doing that?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.800
Ah.

00:06:04.684 --> 00:06:05.600
Now he's got it going.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.080
So far so good.

00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:32.700
That's going to be a clean
run, I think, this time.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.612
Well that's very, very good.

00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:41.320
Can it do any better
than that you think?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.190
Watch it showing off at the top.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.140
[APPLAUSE]
