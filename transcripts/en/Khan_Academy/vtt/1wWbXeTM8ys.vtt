00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.390
- My name is Melanie Fox,

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.170
I create the AP Macroeconomics
and AP Microeconomics

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.680
content for Khan Academy.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.056
Well if you don't develop that mindset,

00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:12.740
you say, "I can't overcome this barrier,"

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.390
you've just made that barrier
permanent for yourself.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.370
So for me, because I
loved economics so much

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.000
it was just a way of finding
a way around those barriers

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.730
whether that was taking fewer classes

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.180
to give myself more time to concentrate

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.930
in the areas that I struggled with,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.800
taking classes in the summer

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.360
where I could focus on
just one class at a time,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.370
that helped me a lot to
get past those barriers.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.540
The day I walked out of
my calculus one final exam

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.110
and I knew that I had aced it

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.960
and I don't think I had aced a
math class since fifth grade.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.783
And that was just euphoric,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.600
I remember...

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.510
I can even remember the price of gasoline

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.430
when I walked out of the
building after that exam

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.014
because it was just such a
vivid memory of, I did it,

00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:14.580
I was finally able to overcome this.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.370
It's okay to struggle.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.060
It's probably better to
struggle than to not struggle

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.190
because if you can get through
things very, very easily,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.750
when you hit that first barrier,
you don't know what to do,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.130
and it's good to have the
experience to have hit a barrier

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.943
and find a way to push back that.
