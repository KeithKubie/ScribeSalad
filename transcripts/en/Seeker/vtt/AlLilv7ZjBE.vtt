00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.040
We have a pretty good idea of how and when the universe began

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.840
as for how it's going to end...ummmm

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.200
Hi everyone, in Universe A, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.380
The Big Bang Theory is more than just a TV show my parents keep telling me I should be on.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.020
It's our best explanation for how the universe, as we know it, started.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.960
When Edwin Hubble looked at the night sky in 1923, he discovered that the universe was much bigger than just our Milky Way.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.760
There were actually metric oodles of galaxies, all over the place.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.080
Then in 1929, because he wasn't done being a science boss,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.560
Hubble also noticed that the majority of galaxies are speeding away from us.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.480
Logically, then, if you go backwards in time,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.760
everything must have been smushed together in a singularity, at some point,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.120
and I mean that both physically and temporally.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.260
With all that phenomenal cosmic power in an itty-bitty living space,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.100
it blew right up in the greatest fireworks display of the last 13.8 billion years

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.780
As you can imagine, this discovery was a game-changer

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.000
Einstein's equations on general relativity from 1917

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.660
should've mathematically predicted an expanding or contracting universe

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.820
but the math had been intentionally fudged by a scientist who didn't want to believe the universe wasn't static

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.780
and what was that name of that idiot who ruined Einstein's math?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.500
a man by the name

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.100
of Albert Einstein.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.200
Einstein called his creation of his cosmological constant

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.020
"The greatest blunder of his career"

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.580
and as a result, has been doomed to obscurity.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.560
So, if the universe has a beginning, then what does that mean for how it will end?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.940
Where is this all going?

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.700
Well that nut's a little tougher to crack.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.020
At first, it was thought there was two possibilities

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.240
If the universe has enough stuff in it, gravity slows the expansion, and eventually it will collapse into a singularity

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.580
and maybe even another big bang?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.080
This is elegant, and beautiful, and makes wonderful, satisfying sense.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.260
Unfortunately, the universe is under no obligation to make sense to you

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.180
And the other possibility is happening.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.180
The universe isn't just expanding, it's accelerating.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.880
What's driving the acceleration? What is making space itself expand like the surface of an inflating balloon?

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.960
We have no idea.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.120
Our best guess is some, as yet, unexplained source of energy snappily known as "dark energy."

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.600
So, if everything keeps going the way it is, it looks like the universe could expand and exist forever.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.220
Whether life can exist forever is a different story.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.880
Our sun will exhaust it's fuel in about 5 billion years, while much smaller red dwarfs will use their fuel in trillions of years.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.040
That is an incomprehensibly long time, but that time will come nonetheless.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.580
Black holes will still be doing stuff; radiating particles back into the void,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.660
But even supermassive black holes will dissipate after googols of years.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.480
Eventually entropy will spread energy uniformally across the universe and it just won't be possible to do literally anything

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.920
So life as we know it, is 'kaput'.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.020
This is called the "Heat Death" of the universe

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.900
Or "The Big Freeze"

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.200
and it looks like we're headed that way.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.040
An international team of astronomers just studied the energy output from two hundred thousand galaxies

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.780
and discovered its half of what it was just two billion years ago.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.680
We're apparently in the midst of a steep
decline but eventually it will slow down

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.500
as only the biggest black holes are left
petering out.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.420
That is one way the universe could end --

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.280
not with a bang but a whimper --

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.989
but we don't know enough about dark energy to

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.360
assume it's going to keep acting the way it does.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.480
Maybe it'll slow or even reverse and we'll get a big crunch or a cyclical universe

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.480
or maybe everything, even atoms themselves, will get ripped to shreds

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.230
Remember I said dark energy is making space itself expand?

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.959
Things aren't just moving away from us.
Space itself is growing.

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.919
it stretches at about 70.4 kilometers per second per megaparsec

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.240
which means that if you had two objects a megaparsec apart with no velocities relative to each other

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.220
every second they would get 70.4 kilometers farther away.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.320
A megaparsec is 3.3 million light years though so it's a very tiny inflation.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.480
Over smaller distances other forces like gravity or the strong nuclear force

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.960
means the expansion of space doesn't affect atoms or solid objects.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.459
Dark energy could become more dense, though,

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.019
and given long enough the stars, planets, even atoms, could be ripped apart

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.680
This is called "The Big Rip."

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.260
As you can tell, dark matter is the linchpin of these two theories and there's still more possibilities.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.660
One of them, cosmic uncertainty, essentially throws its hands in the air and says we don't

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.540
know what will happen until we understand dark energy.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.500
So, clearly, figuring out this stuff will tell us a lot about our future.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.789
Well maybe not our future.
You and I will be long gone by the time any of these

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.169
scenarios would play out and the human race itself may have vanished or evolved

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.729
into something unrecognizable.

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.260
Sadly, nobody lives to see the future but it's going to be a really interesting place.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.460
So, that covers many of the prevailing ideas on how the universe will end

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.499
but what happens when YOU end?

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.199
Trace talks about that here:

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.239
Firstly, at death all your muscles relax.

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:46.519
It takes burning oxygen for energy to keep you tense:
no O2, no tension.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.860
This includes the body's sphincters which is why death often causes defecation and incontinence.

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.229
Where do you think the universe is going?
