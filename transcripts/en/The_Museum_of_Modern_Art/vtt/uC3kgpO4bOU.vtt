00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.670
Welcome to week three. Silhouettes.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.340
So this week we're going to be looking at,
as Steph just said, silhouettes.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.980
And if we're thinking about what a silhouette
means in its very basic sense

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.080
it's something

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.110
that is outlined against a lighter background.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.390
So you see its shape, you see what it looks
like at its very parameters.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.250
But if that's the dictionary definition, Steph,
what are we thinking about in terms of fashion?

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.030
What does a silhouette mean for us there?

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.640
I mean, at its core, the same thing, but it's
really sort of the shape that the outline

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.190
of the clothes are creating on your body.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.451
Which, of course, brings up very interesting
conversations, because most of the time, the

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:38.981
shape that the clothes are creating around
our bodies is not the shape that our body

00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:39.981
actually is.

00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:40.981
Right.

00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.130
And so we take on silhouettes for any number
of reasons.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.200
For our power, to sort of make ourselves maybe
bigger than we are, or to think about trying

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.010
to change our bodies into some, perhaps, more
desirable shape.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.160
Either more desirable for us or for social
reasons.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.180
Or to hide our bodies...

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.180
Right.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.180
...in some cases.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.180
Absolutely.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.810
So lots of different reasons for changing
our bodies through clothings and the silhouettes

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.240
that we take on.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.070
And this week we're going to be looking at
different themes and areas in terms of silhouettes

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.200
through the last century or so.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
Right?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.200
Yep.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.750
So to start off the week, we're going to talk
about basic ideas around clothes and shape,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.170
and we're going to look at a few examples
of the little black dress.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.360
The little black dress is not necessarily
something that might first come to mind when

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.439
we think about conversations around silhouette
and shape, but actually, it lends itself very

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.600
well to the evolution of shape throughout
the 20th century.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.650
The little black dress is a concept, it's
not a thing.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.800
It was a concept that emerged in the 1920s.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.189
What's fascinating about the little black
dress is that what remains consistent about

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.790
it is its color.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.970
What changes about it constantly is its shape.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.060
So it offers a really nice lens into looking
at different silhouettes throughout the times

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.439
and throughout the evolution of the little
black dress itself.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.030
Michelle: And pretty constant also is just
a conversation about silhouettes in fashion.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.259
And so we have here the really wonderful "Are
Clothes Modern?"

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.530
book that Rudofsky created, actually shortly
after his show.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.530
This is 1947.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.829
The show itself was 1944 at MoMA.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.009
But you can see, and there's really a better
picture that will come up during the module

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.319
itself, the silhouettes he commissioned.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.230
Four of these sculptures, they were meant
to show people who came to his exhibition

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.511
that silhouettes have really constricted our
bodies and changed them.

00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:23.900
And when we say "they" and "our," mostly women,
actually, he was talking about.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.159
So here you have four different styles of
dress, and the bodies that would've had to

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.269
have been biologically beneath them to support
them.

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.189
And even, actually, thinking about silhouettes,
he was also thinking about footwear, too.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.680
So not just about the kind of garments that
you might use, but accessories too that shape

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.709
our body.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.819
So we're going to talk about shape, certainly,
but also about conforming, right?

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.819
Yeah.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.629
So think about how many times you might have,
you know, metaphorically poured yourself into

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.709
a garment, right?

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.449
You're buttoning, sucking in, etc., and in
a lot of examples of fashion items, this is

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:58.719
precisely what we are doing.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:04.730
A key example of making one's body conform
to a fashionable silhouette is the pencil

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.730
skirt.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.150
The pencil skirt is essentially a very straight,
narrow skirt, often below the knees.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.569
It had a particular moment in the 1960s as
a key component of professional workwear.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.799
And we're going to be looking at an example
of the pencil skirt that was worn by the character

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.719
of Joan on "Mad Men," somebody who very much
so had to negotiate her position in the office

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:29.719
place.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:36.279
And her wearing of a pencil skirt, at once,
lent her this sort of degree of power because

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.370
of the way it made her body look.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.979
But on the other hand, in a very literal way,
it kind of detracted from her agency because

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.499
it was something that was sort of difficult
to walk in.

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:50.159
So these are sort of the things we think about
when we're conforming our body to different

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.199
pieces of clothing.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.450
What does it allow us to do, but also, what
does it hinder us from doing?

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.769
One of the things that we'll look at after
conforming is about augmenting the body, and

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.730
silhouettes allowing us to be bigger than
we perhaps are.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.329
And one of my favorite items, I think, in
the course is the Wonderbra.

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.329
The Wonderbra was around from the 1960s.

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.319
And it sold pretty steadily throughout its
lifetime until, in the early 1990s.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.299
Lots of different cultural things came together
] especially in the West, to suggest that

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.470
an enhanced cleavage was something that was
inherently fashionable at a particular moment.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.930
And their advertising campaign really enshrined
this bra as the cleavage-enhancing bra of

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.009
the decade and perhaps of all time.

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.790
And so to augment a silhouette is also an
important conversation we'll have.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.400
We'll finish up by looking at freeing.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.759
So thinking about the ways in which the body
has been freed through the silhouette.

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.819
Whether it's through capri pants, the idea
of women being able to take on a bifurcated

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.870
pant, and in the mid-century what that meant
to move out of something more constricting

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.979
into a garment or a silhouette that allowed
them to move more.

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.979
We'll look at the caftan for some of the same
reasons.

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.330
And then also the zoot suit, a really important
suit moment in the '30s and '40s in particular,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.360
that gave not only a freedom of movement,
but also freedom of expression to the people

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.430
that wore it.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.699
And then to conclude, we're going to have
a conversation that brings us into the contemporary

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:12.699
momentâ€¦.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.729
Alexandra Waldman, who is the founder of a
brand called Universal Standard, which essentially

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.620
looks at sizing through a more realistic perspective.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.800
Lauren Downing Peters, who is a scholar in
the area of plus-size fashion and its history,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.370
particularly in the 20th century.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.599
So we hope you enjoy this week's offerings,
and that you participate in the discussion

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.459
forums.
