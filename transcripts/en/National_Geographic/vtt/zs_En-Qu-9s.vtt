00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.303
[music playing]

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.571
We are here to
document the lives

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.005
of people living in Alaska.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.074
The harsh reality is the
environment we're up against,

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.175
it makes it tough to do our job.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.410
Get out of there.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.746
Working on life below
zero can be very dangerous.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.647
Gun's here, camera's here.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:15.682
Never know what to expect.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:16.483
Hey, hey!

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.684
You [bleep] see that?

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.520
Gonna be tough, but we're
going to get the shot.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.022
Every scenario, we
got to prepare for this.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.224
But we're still smiling.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.027
We're having fun, still
making like below zero.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.329
Yes!

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.463
Bring it on.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.931
[ice cracking]

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:35.402
[music playing]

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.410
This is what keeps
me up at night.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.579
We arrived to the
Hailstones' Kiwalik camp

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.181
just before dark last night.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.850
Unfortunately, the storm
that we're expecting

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:52.986
could be a little bit
worse than what we thought.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:57.424
Winds gusting to up
to 65 miles an hour,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.994
which is a hurricane
level windstorm.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.862
And it keeps getting worse.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.064
We actually had to
abandon our camp

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.567
and come and take refuge in
the teepee with the Hailstones.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.707
Survived the night and the
crazy winds and woke up.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.075
And we came outside.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.479
And the temperatures
dropped about 40 degrees.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.882
The wind just shifted to the
West, which is really unusual.

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:26.419
And it pushed up the high
tide underneath the ice,

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:31.424
totally flooded this delta where
our snow machines were parked.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.027
Yeah, this is deep, a
couple of feet of slush.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.262
If we don't get them
out really quickly,

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.065
they're going to become encased
in new ice, which is just

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.934
going to be a disaster for us.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.204
So we're going to get
some help from Chip

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.540
and tow these machines
out as quickly as we can.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.844
[motor humming]

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.614
This is half the fun.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.885
[chuckles]

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.220
Yeah, looks like
it's good to me.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.927
[motor whirring]

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:12.398
There's one.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.100
And that's the worst
part is the basket sled.

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.202
You get that frozen
in, and it's horrible.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.172
This is a fun
winter task, tying

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.308
knots under water in 10 below.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.810
OK let's do it.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.311
Ready?

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:29.215
[engine revving]

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:35.121
Yep pretty good system
here, takes a lot of manpower.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:39.692
We got a deep one here,
last one, sitting pretty low.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.761
Let's do it, boys.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:45.164
[engine revving]

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.769
Good job, guys.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.337
That was a close call.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.572
Nothing's going to stop us.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.706
We're undaunted.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.675
Yeah, we'll get through it--

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.476
Yep.

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.278
--storms, floods, whatever.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:02:59.078
Bring it on.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.046
Bring it on.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:03.383
It's not going
to stop television.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.984
In five years on
"Life Below Zero,"

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.420
this has been one of the
craziest 24 hours for me,

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:08.721
for sure.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:11.190
Now we need to go back to
our camp and assess damage.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.892
And who knows what we're
going to find there.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.496
We need to rebuild our shelters
and assess our gear situation

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:20.333
and make sure that everybody
can stay warm and safe.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.702
It's a matter of life and death
in the Arctic in the winter,

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.404
having good shelter.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.139
There's no one we
can call out here.

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:27.774
There's nowhere we can go.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.277
We're out on the coastal
plain of the Arctic Ocean.

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.513
We need to be
totally self-reliant.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.715
This is about as
extreme as it gets.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.921
We made it back to camp.

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:43.423
It's become part of the ocean.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.826
[wind rustling]

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.875
Whoa, there's a tremendous
amount of water underneath.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:06.412
The floor of the tent is
like a waterbed right now.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.948
It's kind of surreal
to be in 10 below zero

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:12.819
in the middle of winter in the
Arctic and have water issues.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.722
We prepare for snow
and ice and wind.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:18.257
But you don't expect
your tent to flood

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.392
in the middle of winter.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.160
It's really kind of surreal.

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:23.129
Lesson learned, I guess.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:26.532
It takes such an effort to get
out here that once we do make

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.900
it out here, we
really want to make

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:30.503
it work, because the logistics
are just so daunting.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.839
And this place is incredible.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.708
It's really brutal,
beautiful, and wild,

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.878
and makes for really
wonderful television.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.547
It's going to take some more
work on the part of the crew.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.050
But I think we can do it
and keep it functioning

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.519
and get back to filming
till the next storm.

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:57.397
We're celebrating Ben's birthday
today, probably not the way

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:58.731
that he expected.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.968
But we're having fun and
making the most of it.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:05.304
Food, food, food, food, yay!

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.607
[laughs] Let's eat
it while it's hot.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:08.741
Yeah.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:11.778
So I feel very grateful
and fortunate right now.

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:15.248
I'm getting a very memorable
and unique birthday experience,

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:16.549
my birthday caribou.

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:17.817
Yum.

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.318
It's an arctic gourmet.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:20.687
It's awesome.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:23.122
It's a great birthday dinner
for me and for the whole crew.

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.023
It's a little hot, Kevin.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.825
Thank you.

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:29.162
[wind blowing]
