00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.630
&gt;&gt; Steven Livingston: Eliezer
Sternberg admits that he's a little

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.810
like that loveable, but
pain in the butt kid

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.430
who always has another question.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.580
When his parents would give
him an answer he would be quick

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.630
to say, "But why?"

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.400
This inquiring mind led
him into neuroscience

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.390
and he's now a neurologist
at Yale New Haven Hospital

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.700
and you still can't seem to stop
asking bigger and bigger questions.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.760
Sometimes the questions show
up in the titles of his books

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.250
like this one for his first book
"Are You a Machine?; The Brain,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.780
the Mind, and what it
Means to be Human."

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.310 position:56%
Sternberg explores the big questions
posed by our brains and our minds,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.340
questions of identity, the
unconscious and the self.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.890
His next book "My Brain Made
Me Do It" took on the question

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.690
of whether we are truly
in control of our actions.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.270
Now in his latest book
"Neurologic" Sternberg insists

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.210
that our neurons display
a kind of logic

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.970
that helps the brain make sense
of the confusion all around us.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.420
As he puts it, the brain assembles
all of our thoughts and perceptions

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.280
into a sensible narrative,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.030
a narrative that becomes our life
experience and sense of self.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.880
There is he says, an
underlying neurologic

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.690
that drives our experience
of the world.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.730
Questions are bound in this book.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.940
Each chapter has a
whim sickle title,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.000
a question that suggests
something far deeper.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.370
Chapter 2 for instance,
"Can Zombies Drive to Work?"

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.740
Chapter 5, "Why Do People
Believe in Alien Abductions?"

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.800
Sternberg pushes beyond
the everyday discussions

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.230
of biology and neuroscience.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.960
As our Washington Post
reviewer said,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.540
he extends into the more abstract
humanistic even poetic realm

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.470
of the philosophy of the mind.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.930
Now, for some answers to these
questions, please join me

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.510
in welcoming Eliezer Sternberg.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:21.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.900
&gt;&gt; Eliezer Sternberg: Hi, can
everybody hear me in the back okay?

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.820
Good. I'm really-really
excited to be here,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.560
thank you all so much for coming.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.440
I'm very excited to talk to you
about my new book "Neurologic"

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.330 position:56%
and rather than go into detail right
now and tell you what it's about,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.980
I thought I'd rather
show you a few examples.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.700
Has anybody ever seen this
show, "My Strange Addiction"?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.460
Nobody wants to admit it.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.780
A few people.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.240 position:56%
So, in short, it's a television show
about people to eat strange things

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.880
and I want to show you
a couple of scenes.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.440
This is a woman who eats dirt, so I
tried to have a few close-ups there

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.030
so you see the dirt
going into the mouth,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.910
so you know what I'm talking about.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.500
And I wanted to start with
the following question.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.310
Why would anyone eat dirt?

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.510
Can you think of an adjective to
describe someone who eats dirt?

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.040
[ Background Conversations ]

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.110
Right, crazy is the number one
word that probably comes to mind,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.050
but what if I can give you a better
explanation for why she eats dirt.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.380
Would still call this person crazy

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.890
if I gave you the following
explanation,

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.400
there was a sniper rifle
pointed at her and they said

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.990
if you don't eat this dirt I'm
going to gun you down, so then

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.050
and so understand why
she ate the dirt.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.880
She was coerced, right?

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.960
Now what if I give you a medical
explanation for why she eats dirt?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.570
Would that convince you?

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.620
Pica syndrome is a syndrome
of eating odd substances

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.560
and there's some examples
in here, paper, paint, ice,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.030
plaster, and dirt would qualify.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.080
Pica syndrome occurs in
people who have anemia

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.830
or low red blood cell counts from
a number of different reasons,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.090
but it's from a mineral deficiency

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.340
so iron deficiency,
mineral deficiency.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.640
So that's interesting.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.200
Someone's got a mineral
deficiency and this can drive them

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.440
to eat very strange substances.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.740
So in the literature

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.190
on this syndrome people wonder
could there be some kind

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.540
of unconscious motivation

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.620
to replenish those lost metals
basically, that lost iron

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.590
by finding it in alternative
sources.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.950
And thought of that way, you
might even say that someone

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.380
who eats dirt isn't crazy but it's
just sort of a logical compensation

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.990
of their brain, there's
an inherit logic to it

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.130
and that's the basic idea.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.350
So I want to talk about
a more neurological case

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.200
of a patient named Walter

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.940
and I can't actually show
you what Walter looks

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.320
like because we have privacy
laws in medicine, so you'll have

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.430
to take this image to help imagine
him and Walter's wife was really

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.540
into the "Antiques Roadshow" and
she saw this on television and had

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.320
to buy one just like it and
one day, Walter was walking

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.840
around his living room and
he knocks over the table upon

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.830
which this beautiful vase
stood and it did not end well.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.010
And Walter's wife was furious,
absolutely beside herself

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.940 position:56%
because this wasn't the first time
Walter had done something like this.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.000
For the past few months, in fact,
Walter had been walking into walls,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.420
knocking over things, and
she just couldn't understand

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.070
and this was the last straw.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.200 position:56%
"Walter", she said, "we're going to
go and take you to the neurologist."

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.640
This is a colleague of mine.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.410
So the neurologist decides to
get a scan of Walter's brain

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.950
and he gets the CAT scan,
these are just two slices

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.650
of a CAT scan I'm just going
to orient you to the bottom

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.050
of the screen which
represents the back of the brain

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.190
and that is the occipital
lobe which controls vision.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.270 position:56%
And if you can see it on this
image, there's sort of a darker area

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.750
on both sides we call a hypodensity
and that represents a stroke

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.320
and on the other side, that
stroke actually extends

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.370
into the parietal lobe.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.660
Now, the occipital
lobe controls vision;

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.220
both sides of it have been
completely obliterated by a stroke

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.620
which means that Walter is blind.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.220
Not blind from an eye problem,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.520
but blind from a brain
problem, he's cortically blind.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.640
The odd thing is, this has
been going on for so long,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.430
why didn't Walter seek out help?

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.790
Why would he deny this?

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.510
And the neurologist
decides to investigate it.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.810
"How are you?"

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.470
he asks. "Fine."

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.590
"Anything wrong with you?'

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.720
"Nope, everything's perfect."

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.810
"Anything wrong with your vision?"

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.030
"No, works fine."

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.000
The neurologist holds
up a pen and he asks,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.800 position:56%
"Then can you tell me what this is?"

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.070
"Dark, it's so dark in here
nobody can see anything."

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.110
The neurologist humors him, puts on
the light, he says "I put the light

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.320
on can you now see
what I have here?"

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.670
"Look, I don't want to
play games with you."

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.050
"Fair enough, but can
you describe how I look?"

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.940
"Sure you are a small, fat chap."

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:24.560 position:56%
Now the neurologist who was tall
and thin, he realizes at this moment

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.110
that Walter's not denying
that he's blind.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.930
He actually doesn't realize it.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:39.460
Now, I wonder is Walter just crazy
for not realizing that he's blind

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.730
or can we find a logical
explanation?

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.470
Walter has Anton's syndrome which
is a triad of three symptoms.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.810
The first is cortical blindness,
blindness from a brain cause.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.880
The second is anosognosia
which translate

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.470
to in English, denial of illness.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.830
So he's denying his, that he's
blind and denying not consciously

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.540
but rather unconsciously.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.710
And the third is confabulation,

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.690
confabulation is a
fascinating symptom

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.860
in which people have this
unconscious compulsion to cover

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.810
up any gaps in their knowledge
with a made-up explanation

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.110
and they will do this time

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.390
after time no matter
how many times you ask.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.370
Now if remember in that CAT
scan the stroke extended

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.870
from the visual cortex in the back

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.990
of the brain the occipital
into the parietal lobe.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.460
The parietal lobe is actually
also involved in vision,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.110 position:56%
but at a higher level of processing.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.080
Meaning, if the occipital lobe
is processing the actual pixels

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.470
that we see, the parietal lobe is
actually monitoring how the visual

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.590
system is working and then using
that to sort of draw conclusions

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.380
about it and give more
cognitive input.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.440
Now, imagine a circumstance in
which there was a break in the link

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.920
between vision and in the system

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.570
that monitors how the
visual system is working.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.400
In that situation, that
very unlikely situation,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.290
you could actually
destroy the visual system

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.960
but the brain wouldn't know it

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.860
because the monitoring
capacity is not there.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.920
Now, imagine what the brain has
to go through at this moment.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.900
The brain's got to come
up with an explanation

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.120
for the following scenario;

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.050
my visual system is
working, yet I can't see.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:37.550
It must be dark in here, right?

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.890
This happens to us all the time.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.770
Anyone who is sighted, anyone
who has the ability to see,

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:49.370
yet can't see anything it's
usually because it's too dark

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.550 position:56%
or there's some kind of obstruction.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.130
So the brain confabulates out
of thin air an explanation

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.620
for Walter's blindness that
actually makes a whole ton

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.950
of sense considering the
brain itself doesn't know

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.660 position:56%
that the visual system is destroyed.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.030
It's neurological, that's a pun.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:15.490
Okay, so each chapter of the book

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.810
and though this part
is the pitch, right?

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:26.460
So is a question that addresses
these sorts of issues and some

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.690
of them are what do the
blind see when they dream?

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.820
Can your imagination make
you a better athlete?

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.970
Why do schizophrenics hear voices?

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.850
Why can't split personalities
wear prescription glasses?

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.150
Some of those.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.660
Does anyone want to
choose one to talk about?

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.770
Yeah.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:51.240
&gt;&gt; Number seven, someone can't
be hypnotized to commit murder

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.650
but only if they [inaudible].

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.950
&gt;&gt; Eliezer Sternberg: Oh.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.060
Well I'm not going to tell
you what the actual answer is,

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.240
but that's an interesting thought.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.500
We're going to talk about this one,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.800
because it's the only
prepared [brief laughter].

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.100
So, we're going to talk

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.030
about auditory hallucinations
and schizophrenia.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.770
This is Brandon, he is a patient

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.350
with schizophrenia
that's actually Brad Pitt.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.650
But we'll just say
his name is Brandon.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.260
So Brandon was a very,
well-educated guy.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.620
He was in his 30s, went
to Cornell University,

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.620
had you know a real charm to
him, but had a very serious case

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.660
of schizophrenia and we had
the following conversation.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.720
I said, "Do you ever hear
voices in your head?"

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.020
"All the time", he says.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.820
"Usually I hear them, I
hear him when I'm alone

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.370
but sometimes he talks
to me at other times.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.690
It gets better when I
scream at him to shut up.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.110
Sometimes he can't talk
if I interrupt him."

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.430
"Who do you mean by him?"

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.470
"Gerald, he's such an asshole.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.770
He works for the FBI.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.370
He spies on me all the time.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.670
He knows everything.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.100
It happened when I was a kid you
know when he put the spy chip

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.790
in my brain, but the doctors
here say that don't see

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.660
on it on their brain scans."

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.750
"Can you hear him now?"

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.530
"Yes."

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.540
"What does he say?"

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.720
"He's talking about you."

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.700
"What's he saying about me?"

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.080
"The devil.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.270
He sees the devil in your eyes."

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.420
That's the first time I've ever
been mistaken for the devil.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:38.150
I have been compared to Jafar
from, never the devil though.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.160
So, Brandon mentions a
couple of concepts here.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.370
He has this voice and it's
completely real to him.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.670
He has a name, has a profession.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.770
He had put a spy chip in his brain

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.610
and it's somehow associated
with the devil.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.780
And people with schizophrenia
who have these kinds

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.020
of auditory hallucinations often
come up with explanations sort

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.550
of in this vain and the
question that we're going to deal

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.860
with for the rest of this
talk is is this just crazy

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.260
as we might be tempted
to say from the outside,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.730
or can we find a logical
reason or a logical explanation

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:22.500
for why the voices are there
and why they say what they say?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.390
To preference things,
schizophrenia is very complicated.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.780
It has a lot of different facets

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.090
and we will not be
addressing them all here

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.930
and it's also a very poorly
understood disease, so the,

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.810
all the great seekers of
schizophrenia will not be revealed.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.590
Maybe, maybe one though.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.410
So here are some the symptoms.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.670
So on the top left, is disorganized
thinking making connections

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:49.620
between ideas that a healthy
brain might never make.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.150
The top right illustrates paranoia.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.700
The bottom left is the
symptom of thought insertion.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.390
The feeling that someone has
inserted thoughts into your brain,

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.100
into your mind and they're
not of your own makings.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.050
The bottom right is a similar
one called thought broadcasting.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.330 position:56%
This is a sensation that all your
thoughts are being heard by everyone

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.510
around you and center at the bottom
is the symptom that we're going

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.140
to be discussing of
auditory hallucinations.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:27.510
Anyone think that this animation
looks just like Steven Tylor?

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:32.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.620
So this is a huge building we're
in and I want you to imagine

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:40.470
that you are walking into the
building and you have instructions

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.470 position:56%
to get to a certain conference room,
and the instructions read "Proceed

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.260
down the second hallway to the
left, go through the double doors,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:52.710
and take elevator C to the
fifth floor suite 511."

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.770
So, as you're sitting there
before your morning coffee

00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:01.570 position:56%
and you're trying to picture in your
mind what second to the left means,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.190
somebody taps you on the
shoulder and says, "Hey,

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.770
you know elevator C is over there."

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.210
So what just happened?

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.300
You were thinking very deeply
about what I said on the card

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.320
and then accidentally you
broadcast your thoughts out loud

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.200
and that's called subvocal speech.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.770
When we think really-really hard
about something, once in a while,

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:30.710 position:56%
there's very gentle activation of
the vocal musculature which can lead

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.630
to unintended vocalization.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.610
So, subvocal speech
is very quiet mumbling

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.990 position:56%
that we all do this very quiet
mumbling, but it's only been studied

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.580
since you know the late 40s-50s
and it started to be studied

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.350
with EMG or electromyography.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.980
Electromyography is a
technique that neurologists use

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.590
that measures muscle activation
by putting a probe on muscle

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.730
and it measures voltage waves.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:05.070
So, physiologist Lewis Gould
[assumed spelling] he took two sets

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.990
of patients, half of them
with auditory hallucinations

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.390
and schizophrenia and half of them
without them, control subjects.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:16.040
And he used EMG to measure
their vocal musculature

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.100
to see what it was doing
during auditory hallucinations.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.910
And what he found is that 86%

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.940
of hallucinating patients had
activation of their vocal muscles

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:31.290
as compared to 10% of the patients
who are not having hallucinations.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:38.360
So Gould asked the
following question;

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.420
could auditory hallucinations
be subvocal speech?

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:49.080 position:56%
That when someone is hearing a voice
it's actually just their own very

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.100
quiet mumbling just somehow
getting into their heads,

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.730
really-really getting to them.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:04.750
So then he asked another question,
he said "If that were true,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:10.400
if auditory hallucinations are very
quiet, unintended mumbling and what

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.930
if he amplified that sound?

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.600
What if he made it louder?

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.550
Could we hear the voices
in people's heads?

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:23.270
So, in an experimental
set it looks something

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.790
like what you see on
the image there.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.530
He plays sound amplifiers up
to the throats of patients

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:34.890
who had auditory hallucinations
and then he waited by a microphone

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:40.320 position:56%
and then when a patient had auditory
hallucination, a voice actually came

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.060
out of the microphone
as a soft whisper.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:49.020
And the whisper said, "If you're
in this mind you come out of there,

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.280
but if you're not in
this mind, you won't come

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.360
out there, you want to stay there."

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.560
"Who said that", he asks.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.190
And the patient who
name was Roy says,

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:09.370
or she said "I said
that said the whisper.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:14.810
Are you talking to
yourself ", Gould asked.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.840
Roy, "No I don't" and
then he looks to himself

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.290
and the says, "What is it?"

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.720
"Mind your own business
darling", says the whisper.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.120
"I don't want him to
know what I was doing."

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.270
See that recess, I spoke to
her to ask what she was doing

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.630
and she said mind your business.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.560
And this is the first
time we've ever heard an

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.860
auditory hallucination.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:50.870
So, if that's true, if you believe
what these studies are getting at,

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:56.800 position:56%
that patients with schizophrenia are
really hearing their own voice just

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.400
their own sort of unattended
mumbling, then that should

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.190
in itself give us a way to stop it.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.380
We can only speak one
voice at time, right?

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.990
So, if the voice you're trying
to get rid of is your voice,

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.570
then you should audibly
vocalize your own voice

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.450
and that should prevent
the hallucination

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.830
for coming if that's true, right?

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.410
So they did this study
that looked at the duration

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:28.630
of auditory hallucinations
where the intervention was one

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.370
of these things keeping one's mouth
open, biting your tongue humming

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.460
which is using your own
voice, making a fist

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.900
or raising you eyebrows,
so when you go

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.840
down on the graph that's a
reduction in the duration

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.090
of the auditory hallucinations
and you can see

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:49.310 position:56%
that humming actually improved the
duration of auditory hallucinations;

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:57.530
decreased their length by about 60%
and this lends support of the idea

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:02.340
that when patients are
hearing voices in their heads,

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:08.050
the voice they hear is their own.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:12.560
But everybody mumbles
that's the problem,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.400
everybody has this subvocal
speech, everyone in this room

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.090
so how come we don't hear them
as auditory hallucinations?

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:24.140
This study tried to look at
that, again comparing patients

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.850
with auditory hallucinations
and patients without them.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:32.560
Each person in this study
wore a headset with headphones

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.060
and a speaker and everyone would
of sort of speak a passage into it

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.800
and then it would be routed
back into the headphones

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.920
and they would basically be
listening to their own voices,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:49.720
but voice was first
sent into a distorter

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.800
and the distorter can make
three levels of change.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.330
The first being, no change so you
speak, goes back into your ear

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.920
and you hear your voice
unadulterated;

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.770
second scenario some distortion

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.760
and the third scenario severe
distortion very-very difficult

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:10.110 position:56%
to recognize and then they
compared what the two groups thought

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.230
and they could push a
button to identify what

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:18.450
that voice sounded like; self, it's
my voice, other, a foreign voice,

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.330
a hallucination or unknown
I really just can't tell.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:27.690
And here's what they found.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:32.850
So the [inaudible] the percentage
of errors so the patient with,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.520
the patients with hallucinations
clearly had far more errors

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.870
in identifying the voice was their
own even with no distortion at all

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.930
and far more with moderate
distortion

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.990
and far-far more with
severe distortion.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.930
They could pick out what was
familiar about their own voices

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.770
because their distortions kept
some of the intrinsic cadences

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.980
of the voice, but there's
something about schizophrenia

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.900
that they were unable to
recognize their own voices.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:09.510
But why? Why can't they recognize
and what's stopping them?

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.400
And oddly enough, the answer
to this comes from research

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:19.670
on a very peculiar species of fish
called the mormyrid electric fish

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.270
and it communicated with other fish

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:27.550
by using electrical impulses called
EODs, or electric organ discharges

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.030
and this is a cartoon showing
two fish in a courtship

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:35.330 position:56%
that isn't working out because
there are so many different voltages

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.530
and that's actually true that,
you know, certain fish respond

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.100
to different types of
electrical impulses.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:52.960
And Curtis Bell did the following
study; he wanted to why some fish,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.170
how fish recognized their own
signals versus other signals.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.630
Because when you, when they would
fire this electrical discharge this

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:06.830
form of communication, it's not
like a laser-directed signal

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:10.290 position:56%
that you know pointed the fish they
wanted to talk to, it's like ripples

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:16.070
on a pond so every receptor in
range is going to pick-up on signal

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.120
that includes their own receptors.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:28.430
So from now on when I say, EOD,
electrical organ discharge,

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.210
I want you think fishes'
voice and every time I hear,

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.550
every time I say electroreceptor
or receptor I want you

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:40.230
to think fishes' ears because
this is a form of communication

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.450
and this is used study
communication in human beings too.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.290
So what Curtis Bell found is

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:52.040
that the way the fish distinguished
their own signals from those

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.230
of other is through something
called the command signal.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.000
And every time I say
"command signal"

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.440 position:56%
from now one you'll think intention.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.610
It's the intention to talk
just as each of us know

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.300
when we're about to speak.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.180
The fish knows it's contending to
speak because it's bringing fires

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.500
from something called the command
signal, the command to speak.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.200
So there you can see
the fishes' brain

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.040
which you can always recognize a
fishes' brain by the tail and fins.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.300
And the fish says I want to fire
the EOD, I would like to talk

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.350
to the firer command signal,
the command signal goes

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.230 position:56%
to the electrical organ which is
basically the fishes' speech muscles

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.220
and then I fires the EOD, it talks.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.630
So now we're going to
study the ear of the fish.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.260
So the next few slides are just
on the electroreceptor itself.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.200
This is what the receptor sees.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.970 position:56%
Whenever the receptor hears a signal

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:53.970
from another fish you see
a big spike of voltage

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:57.730
on this probe that Bell used.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.260
So he tried this long experiment.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.110
He took his own zapper and
the zapped an electroreceptor,

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:07.160
he sent his own mating
call to the fish and low

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:14.790 position:56%
and behold it detected the stimulus
and he said, "A, the fish hears me."

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.410
Then he put more electrodes
on the fish's brain

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.740
and he identified the
command signal.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.810
He found exactly when the fish
was intending to speak itself

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:32.110
and then 4 milliseconds or within
4 milliseconds after that intent

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:37.500
to speak, he fired an electro
impulse at the fish's ears,

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:43.230
at the receptor and this time, the
receptors detected nothing as if

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:51.280
to say, the fish intended to speak
and then heard but ignored it.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.530
So for some reason the fish a
mechanism built into its circuitry,

00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:01.160
into its brain and whenever it
hears a signal within milliseconds

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.630
of intending to send
that signal it ignores it

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.240
as if to say, I said that.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.330
I'm not going to make
a big deal about it.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.700
So, how does it dampen that signal?

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.860
How does it sort of nullify
the effect on its receptor?

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.360
It's not that, it has to
do with sort of the physics

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.860
of the electrical signals.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.550
The represents a sort of a
positive wave, this is it's hearing

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:34.010
in electrical form of
communication from another fish,

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:37.000
but if the fish intended to speak

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.010
and that 4 millisecond window was
respected, a second signal is sent

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.730
to nullify the first because
it is in the opposite direction

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.660
and they cancel each other out

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.180
and this has been demonstrated
in the literature.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.610
So that's the system.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:57.550 position:56%
Electric fish distinguish their own
speech, their own electrical firings

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:03.640
from those of others by having
a prediction of what it's going

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:09.300
to sound like, the negative one
and if it matches the positive one,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:15.750
and they cancel out and the fish
concludes that was me speaking.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.500
So that nullification
signal, that prediction

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.650
of what the signal is
going to feel like is known

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:26.690
in the animal literature as the
corollary discharge which is a sort

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.590
of a confusing concept, but
I'm going to summarize it

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:33.290 position:56%
for you this way; it's the predicted
sensory result of a motor act.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:40.010 position:56%
For example, if I want to raise my
arm my brain predicts how my sensory

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:45.220
system is going to feel when
I do that and so when I do it,

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:50.430
the actual sensation feels
like the predicted experience

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.370
and because they match, the
brain draws the conclusion

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:57.680
that I myself initiated
the act and so I don't feel

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.980
like someone else moved it.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.230
I feel like I moved it.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:06.660
So it's the system for matching
experience to expectations.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.900
It's been found in a lot
of different animals.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.710
For example, songbirds use it
to distinguish their own songs

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.550
from those of other birds.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:18.440
Crickets use it to distinguish
their chirps from other chirps

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:23.900
and this is sort of how we
think the whole system works,

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.900
so it starts from the brain.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.880
The brain sends the command signal,

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.580
the intention to fire,
the intention to speak.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.300
Simultaneously it alerts the
sensory system, I'm about to fire.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.710
I'm intending to talk.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.680 position:56%
This is what it's going to feel like

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.560
and that feeling is called
the corollary discharge.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.970
So then, the fish fires,
the prediction goes out

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.000
and then they go to comparator.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.810
This comparator function decides,

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:57.420
is the predicted experience
the same as the actual?

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.920
If so they're a match.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.530 position:56%
If they match, it dampens the signal
and the nervous system relaxes

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:06.350
that it's a self-generated signal.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.900
If they don't match, then the
fish concludes that signal

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.220
that I intended to fire does not
match the one that I'm hearing

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.540
so the one that I'm hearing
must be someone else's signal.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:23.980
And the same thing is thought
to happen in schizophrenia

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.510
and basically in all speech.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:32.090
So in our brain we have a motor
command to speak that goes

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:36.330
to the muscles of speech and at the
same time, there is a prediction

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.480
of what the voice is
going to sound like.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.620
And then at the same
moment we hear our voice

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:46.920
and then the brain compares,
there's a sound of my voice,

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.830
does the sound I just heard
match the way my voice usually

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:52.290
sounds like?

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.980
If not, it's not my voice.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.260
If so, it is.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.350
Now, what if there were a
problem with comparison function?

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:07.170 position:56%
What if every time you heard your
own voice the brain incorrectly gave

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:13.940
you the mismatch signal and you
weren't able to recognize it?

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.020
You wouldn't think
it was your voice.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.090
You would think it was that of
someone else, so that's sort

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:26.690 position:56%
of the basic premise, the basic part
of the argument as to why people

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:31.210
with schizophrenia can't
recognize their own voice,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.880
but there's a problem.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.740
If this is all about
voices then what

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.810
about schizophrenia in the deaf?

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.950 position:56%
Do they have auditory hallucinations
even though they can't hear their

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.250
own voice?

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:47.280
And the answer is they do have
auditory hallucinations in a sense.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.350
So this is an example of a
patient who has schizophrenia

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:55.740
and has been deaf since before
age 2, so basically as far

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.140
as we can remember and this
is a little blurb about him;

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.370
he says he claims to
have seen Jesus.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.500
He often hears a voice
communicating to him from London.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.300
When asked how he as a deaf
person could hear someone

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.910
from London he replies that
he can see the arms and hands

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:16.160
of the purple, excuse me of
the person signing to him,

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.660
so auditory hallucinations
in the deaf consist

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.940
of hallucinating sign language.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.900
Now this poses a problem
for the theory, right?

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:31.540
If auditory hallucinations
are all misinterpretations

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:36.500
or the brain misjudging
their own voices,

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.380
not recognizing your own
voices, then what explains this?

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.290
So we have to extend
the theory it's not

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.800
that patients can't
recognize their own voices,

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.410
they also can't recognize
their own thoughts.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:56.670
This is Syd Barrett who was a
member of Pink Floyd and, you know,

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.930
at a certain point in his life
he started having odd behaviors

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.950
and though he was never officially
diagnosed, it's long thought

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.870 position:56%
that he suffered from schizophrenia.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.290
There's some stories
in his biography

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.500
that detail the odd behavior.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.930
One example that comes to mind is
he locked his girlfriend in a room

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:19.730
for days and sort of slipped
her food under the door

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.020
and there was also some tell-tale
signs in some of his song lyrics,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.060
so this is an excerpt
from a song called

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.380
"Jugband Blue" that
Syd Barrett wrote.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.950
I'll read it to you.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.390
"It's awfully considerate
of you to think of me here

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:35.240
And I'm much obliged to you for
making it clear That I'm not here.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.520
And I never knew the
moon could be so big

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.690
And I never knew the moon could
be so blue And I'm grateful

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:44.400
that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.290
in red And I'm wondering who
could be writing this song."

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:52.520
So if you led any credence
to song lyrics

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.750
that this might be an
expression of his in some way.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.650
He's claiming that
he can't recognize

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.680
that he's the one who
wrote these lyrics.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:07.080
His entire creative process
of putting the song together,

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.320
the products of his own mind
he is unable to recognize.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:16.840
And that relates to another
syndrome of schizophrenia

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.920
that I mentioned earlier
briefly thought insertion.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.740
So this is an example of thought
insertion from an actual patient.

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:28.920
"I cry. Tears roll down my
cheeks and I look unhappy

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.370
but inside I have a cold anger
because they are using me

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.440
in this way and it is not
me who is unhappy but they

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.670
who are projecting
unhappiness onto my brain.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:43.790
They project upon me laughter for
no reason and you have no idea

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:47.840
of how terrible it is to laugh and
look happy and no it is not you,

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:54.210
but their emotions unable to
recognize one's own thoughts.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:35:01.330
So how far does this problem
of self-recognition go?

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:07.040
And here we can bring in the
well-known literature on tickling.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:12.210
The NIH apparently
funds this literature

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:15.570
which is amazing, but it works.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:19.540
So, here's the summary
of the tickling research.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:24.590
They have a tickling
robot which is controlled

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.750
by the user with a joystick.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.310
So imagine with your right
hand you have the joystick

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:31.930
and you can move it
in all directions

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:36.790
and that controls the operation
of a tickle finger which is a,

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:41.720
like a big sharp thing and
that tickles the opposite hand.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:47.060
Okay, so they did this
research in 3 scenarios;

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.870
scenario 1 is the movement of
the joystick perfectly correlates

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.460
with the movement of the
robotic tickle finger,

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:59.360
so when you move the joystick
up the tickle finger goes up

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.920
and tickles the other hand.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:08.020
That turned out not be very
tickly and the correct word is

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.740
"tickly" this took me probably
two weeks to figure out.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:16.840
Ticklish is the propensity to be
tickled, so if you are ticklish

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.750
that means you're able to be
tickled but tickly is the magnitude

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:26.850
of the sensation, just to clarify.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:32.680
So, scenario 2 is that the
joystick moves in the one direction

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.010
and then the tickle finger
moves in the same direction

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.460
but after a delay of a few seconds.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.350
So you move the joystick
up a few seconds as

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:44.750
and then the finger tickles
you hand in the same pattern.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.650
Now it's a little more tickly
and in the final scenario,

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.780
the movement of the
joystick had nothing to do

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.480
with what the tickle
finger was doing,

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.030
so you could move the joystick up

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.900
and then the tickle finger
would do its own thing

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.420
and that was very tickly, okay?

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.900
So, that's interesting.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:09.680
So now we know why we
can't tickle ourselves.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:16.210
The reason is when you intend
to tickle yourself, your body,

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:20.370
you brain has a sensory prediction
of what that tickle is going

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:23.780
to feel like, so if I take
my fingers and I rake them

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:29.600
across my ribcage just like that,
my brain predicts that sensation

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.470
and then when the actual
sensation I feel when I do,

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:35.900
when I do that motion
matches the prediction,

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.950
they cancel out the brain sort

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:41.000
of nullifies the signal
and makes it not tickly.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.720 position:56%
Because the nature of being tickled
is that it's an unexpected sensation

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.160
so when you can predict it,
when someone else does it

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.110
to you the brain doesn't nullify
this rather you feel the entire

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.210
sensation and it can
be very exciting.

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:05.590
And so again it seems like the
corollary discharge theory,

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:11.870
the same explanation for why we
can't tickle ourselves can relate

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:18.740
to why we can distinguish our
own voice from those of others.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:24.980
So now for the big-big connection,
why did I even bring this up?

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.870
Can patients with schizophrenia
tickle themselves?

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:33.690
So let me set the stage,
again, right?

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:38.940
We, none of us generally can tickle
ourselves but if we had a problem

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.930 position:56%
in self-recognition and inability
to recognize the intension to tickle

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.890
and the consequent inability

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:52.320
to nullify the sensory
signal then we should be able

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:56.770 position:56%
to tickle ourselves and that turns
out to be true, so there was a study

00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:00.420
and I swear this is true of
patients with schizophrenia

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.010
and in controlled patients where
they had them tickle themselves

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:09.230
and had other people tickle them
and patients with, and they had a,

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.980
I swear this is true, had like
a tickling; tickly rating scale

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:18.350
and they like put a number on it
and it turned out that patients

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:21.590
with schizophrenia are the
only group that's been studied

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:28.450
at least has been able to
reliably tickle themselves.

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:33.580
So, getting back we talked
about a couple of things

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.650
that that patient Brandon
mentioned to me

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.250
in our conversation, so the voice.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:41.600
That it's named Gerald.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.470
It has a profession,
it works for the FBI,

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.660 position:56%
spy chip in the brain and the devil.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:56.200
You know, you might see someone
like this on the street corner sort

00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:02.170
of raving about these things and
probably 99.9% or people who pass

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:07.090
that person say that person
is crazy for crazy things.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.970
But can we come up
another explanation?

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:15.300
The brain in the case of
auditory hallucinations has

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:20.230
to explain the following;
it hears a voice

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:23.780
and it doesn't recognize the voice.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:29.910
That voice has access
into consciousness.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:38.420 position:56%
That voice has an intimate knowledge
of the patient's memories, beliefs,

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.770
fears, weaknesses, everything

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:44.050
about them this voice knows
everything about them.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:50.250
And this voice for some reason
has a motive to spy on them.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.700
So what explanation can a brain put

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:58.250
in this circumstance come
up with to explain that?

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:05.130
And I can think of 3 explanations
that have some symbolism sense.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.350
The first is that the
voice was generated

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:12.720
by a text-savvy organization
or like the CIA or the FBI,

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.560
because they have technology.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.870
They can infiltrate your mind.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.880
They can spy on you and through

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.180
that spying they can learn
everything about you.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.430
Aliens or supernatural beings
so if you are the kind of person

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:30.810
who has those, you know, who maybe
wondered and actually as I talk

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.310
about it the book people
who believe in aliens are,

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.050
it's a very common belief
among everybody just

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:37.830
in the general population.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:41.200
So if that's a kind of belief
that you maybe predisposed to

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:47.170
and then you hear this voice that's
a natural place for the mind to go

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:50.200
and finally, divine
their religious entities

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.930
so God, angels, and the devil.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:58.130
So, a lot of people are religious
and even if you're not religious

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:02.570
and had this kind of experience
where you heard a voice

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:06.190
and this voice is not yours.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.280
Your brain cannot recognize
it no matter what you do,

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.630
no matter how hard you try to deny
it, the voice is in your mind.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.850
It knows you and it
got in there somehow.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.150
And thought of this way,

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.130
I think that these explanations
actually probably the best

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.220
that a brain can do in
these circumstances,

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.740
so I wouldn't call
them crazy I would say

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:33.880 position:56%
that under the circumstances they're
actually logical, neurological.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:42.400
So the 3 different disorders that
we talked about are pica syndrome,

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.340
Anton's syndrome and schizophrenia.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:50.080
What I argue is that in each
of these 3 cases you see really

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.080
"crazy" behaviors, crazy in quotes.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:58.650
Eating dirt, being blind and
denying it making excuses

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:02.050
or having auditory hallucinations
and claiming they're coming

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:06.300
from the devil or the CIA, each of
these seem so crazy on the surface

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.950
but when you look at the underlying
deficits that people are suffering

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:14.450
from in these cases, they
actually are logical forms

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:16.900
of compensation for their deficits.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.970
So what you're seeing
is not the disease.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:25.510
You're seeing the compensation for
something that is true suffering

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:31.060
and these sorts of cases have
led me to believe that the word

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.000
"crazy" itself is sort of a
wastebasket term for everything

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.150
that we just don't understand.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:41.570
You know, like a lot of times you
know as a neurologist we see people

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:47.160 position:56%
who come in with, you know, profound
psychiatric symptoms, you know,

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.000
people who are normal one minute

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.140
and then the next minute
they're you know throwing things,

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:58.310
they're throwing fits, they're just
acting completely insane and then

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:02.300
when we do the appropriate testing
we find out that they have sort

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.170
of an autoimmune condition that
is sort of affecting the brain

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.810
and those are very serious.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.060
They end up in the ICU
when we have to treat them

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.360
with very powerful medications
and nobody thinks they're crazy,

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.850
people will say "Wow, that's
just the progression of disease."

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.960
And I think that a
lot of things today

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.660
that we don't have an
explanation for are sort of lumped

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.590
into the category of crazy.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:28.370
I think that as the brain sciences
and brain research progresses,

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:32.090
we'll learn about the underlying
deficits that those sorts

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:36.780
of behaviors are compensating for
and maybe we'll stop using the word

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:41.790
"crazy" and we'll just talk
about the actual disease process.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:43.590
Thanks.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:53.360
[ Applause ]

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.520
Happy to take any questions
anybody has.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.730
&gt;&gt; You can ask me a question.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.820
&gt;&gt; So I just want to well
kind of two questions,

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.420
so first will be is practical
application of this what you said

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.620
in treatment of patients
with schizophrenia

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.710
because that's sounds really
groundbreaking and also

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:23.760
if this is all coming from people's
own heads why there's so many,

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.950
I mean because most of
the time we hear about it

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.940
that somebody committed a
crime like a murder claiming

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.630
that oh voices made me do that.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.670
Like so there is this some kind
of like maliciousness in our minds

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:38.760
that we kind of subconsciously
want to hurt other people?

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.060
&gt;&gt; Eliezer Sternberg:
Great question.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:43.390
So, there are two parts that
is I'll address them in turn.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:48.260
The first question was
clinical applications.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.210
They're in development so you know
one clinical application was trying

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:57.740
to use sort of suppression
of speech like in that sort

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.150
of humming example, but again,

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:03.000
it's if it affects your thoughts
also that's kind of difficult.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.260
I think that in sort of the
therapy, the therapy that's sort

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:10.540
of talked therapeutic
aspects for psychotherapy one

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.590
that can be drawn attention to.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.280
The problem is that in severe cases

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:19.080
of schizophrenia that's really
insufficient and there's no way

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.230
that you can give someone insight
in sort of those severe cases.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:24.840
So it's a work in progress.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.480
In the meantime, that
you still require sort

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.880
of the classical medications.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.990
The second part of your
question remind me was.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:36.590
&gt;&gt; Why was like people
usually do terrible things.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:37.890
&gt;&gt; Eliezer Sternberg: Right.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.190
&gt;&gt; Because of the voices?

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:40.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eliezer Sternberg: Well, you know

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:44.540
when people commit horrific crimes
it's pretty typical for someone

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:50.170
to say, oh that person is crazy
when that's not necessarily true.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:54.700
If they have, you know,
anybody crazy I think they mean

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.380
like they have some kind
of psychiatric diagnosis

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:00.580
and again that's just
not always true.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.910
Do voices say malicious things?

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.400
Absolutely they do.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:09.590
You know, schizophrenia is
not just an isolated disorder

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.110
of auditory hallucinations.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.760
There are a lot of other
components that lead

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.960
to very destructive thoughts
and are very painful thoughts.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.890 position:56%
So, your thoughts are going to be
saying those things and you're going

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.550
to hear them as something foreign,
so that's why you can get sort

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:29.760
of command hallucinations to
tell you to do terrible things,

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.180
but as you clarify that
doesn't mean that everyone

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:37.290
who commits a crime is having
auditory hallucinations

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:38.590
to tell them to do that.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:43.980 position:56%
I don't think that all crimes
should be blamed on sort of problems

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:48.310
with the brain, because
that's not true.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:52.780
&gt;&gt; In the example you use
with the deaf schizophrenic

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:56.160
who learns sign language.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:01.600
Did you ever have a case where the
person did not learn sign language,

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:05.950
so how did they get the
information in their heads?

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:09.890
&gt;&gt; Eliezer Sternberg: I've never
had, have never seen that case,

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:15.060
but I would imagine that if
it's a problem with recognitions

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.560
of one's own thoughts then the
thought could take any form even

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.860
an image.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.370
Our thoughts, every
time we think them,

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:24.320
we feel some kind of
ownership of them.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.700
It's an inevitable, but it's
like oh I thought of that.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.700
But you can imagine a situation
that even if you have no language

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.940
but you still have thought, which
is actually debated in literature,

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.950
can people really think if
they have no form on language?

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:42.400
That aside, you can have
images, you can have impulses,

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.870
and you can interpret
those as being foreign.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.270
Yes.

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:56.270
&gt;&gt; So, the idea that if you
can condition your brain

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.800
like couldn't you condition
a schizophrenic

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:06.890
to recognize these thoughts as
their own with the proper ideas

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:11.250
and so plant it into their
head to make them realize

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:14.870
that it's caused by schizophrenia?

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.960
&gt;&gt; Eliezer Sternberg: Everything
in medicine is about severity.

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:26.890
So, in very mild cases
you can and that goes for,

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:31.670
so a lot of things you know in
very mild depression, you know,

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:36.310
you may not need medication,
but in and similarly

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:41.900 position:56%
in very mild schizophrenia you might
be able to give someone insight

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.240
into that but in very
severe cases you can't.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:50.000
You have to think of it
as the brain you know,

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.190 position:56%
it's as clear as day to that person.

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:57.760
Just as it is as clear to you that
you're hearing your own voice,

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.330
is that it's clear to
them that they are not.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.840
And it would be like someone
trying to talk you out of believing

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:07.490
that you're hearing your own voice.

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:09.580
&gt;&gt; I think us here today.

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.400
Now, I have a small question.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:16.380
I'm from India and we, I believe
that I'm from the land of the Holy

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.950
and we have the biggest
neurological or treatment

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.060
for mad people in the world.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.360
It's in Bengaluru City and I know
we see there the [inaudible] valley

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.990
of India just like in California.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:32.760
So, who do you think has the
best authority in the world,

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.920 position:56%
is there some structure in the world
to say, hey it's enough is enough,

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.490
do not lie and you know the doctor
or the one the of the collaborators

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:43.130
who are doing bad things
that they better watch out

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.890
and whatever they need to do
in terms of taking care of

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:50.060
and chaperoning the whole world,
of course they are, you know,

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:54.780
they should be doing that I totally
respect that, but other than that,

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:59.800
the bottom you know the [inaudible]
or you know sponges or whatever

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:03.270
that they are benefiting, is
benefiting from collaboration

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:07.360
from [inaudible] like
voodoo to hypnosis and all

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:13.130
that so are they aware of that or
please educate us on how much is

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:17.820
under control by the godly
people, I should say, you know,

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.790
I know they're not God
but for us the [inaudible]

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:21.510
because when I have trouble

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:25.140
or if I have a brother who's
mentally ill how much I,

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.520 position:56%
pain I go through and you can't kill
him but we have to take care of him

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.440
and I've seen families that they
have to take care of their son

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.770
or husband or wife or you
know what I mean 24 hours?

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:41.150 position:56%
So I'm like, you know what is going
on and we have so much knowledge now

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:45.500
that why don't they do some
kind mediation and moderation

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.180 position:56%
as to you know rather than just
kind of you know selling the iPhones

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.310
or you know the Smartphones and
the Apple iPhones this and that.

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:55.780
So, please educate us on that
do we need to worry too much

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:59.020
that each individual of this
citizen and me being a citizen

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:03.810
of this great country I feel that
I have much more access, power,

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:08.360
knowledge, freedom to do something
rather than somebody in Ethiopia

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.810
or somebody in Sudan or somebody
in Haiti or you know or Jamaica

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:16.950 position:56%
or whatever and I'm from, again,
I'm a political refugee [inaudible],

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:21.050
but from I'm so grateful just
like I'm grateful to this country

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.390
that I'm from the land
of Holy in India.

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:27.280
I know in Silicon Valley in
California it's all Indians, right?

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.100
Okay, thank you so much.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.740
&gt;&gt; Eliezer Sternberg: So if I
understand what you're asking,

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.460
I would say that in terms of
how much control do we have

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:42.410
of certain disorders I
think again it's sort of a,

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:49.580
there is sort of a communication
between, you know, patients

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:53.280
and families that can
sort of help in recovery.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.010
There's a communication between
doctors and patients that can help

00:52:56.010 --> 00:53:01.060
in recovery and it has to be done
in sort of the proper setting

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:04.970
with medications and, you
know, families of patients

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:09.470
with these disorders should
sort of go the doctor visits

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:13.640
and have insight into
the disease itself

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.870
and that way hopefully they
can sort of help in the recover

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:19.920
and help in the dialogue.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.350
I'm told that we're out
of time for questions,

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:24.470
but I'm happy to take
someone on the side over here.

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:26.510
Thanks so much again.

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:29.590
