00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.290
We'll start with a common task for
many web developers.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.470
That task is to make CSS suck less,
and boy, does CSS suck sometimes.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.240
Prefixes, obscure syntax, the inability
to nest or use variables, all make

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.490
working with CSS a pretty unfortunate
part of being a web developer.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.230
But it doesn't have to be.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.747
When we write our style sheet in Sass,
a super set of CSS that gets rid of many

00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:26.631
of CSS annoyances, and
compile it to pure CSS.

00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:28.041
If you've never used Sass before,

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:31.130
check out the link in the notes
to learn more about it.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.010
Then, instead of prefixing
CSS properties for

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.260
every browser manually,
let's automate it with auto prefixer.
