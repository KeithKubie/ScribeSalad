00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.920
Often, our partner isn't necessarily

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.620
being terrible in any overt way

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.480
but we feel a growing sadness

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.720
about the character of our relationship.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.980
The partner isn't as focused on us as we'd hoped.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.960
There are often times when

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.960
they don't understand us properly.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.740
They're often busy and preoccupied.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.140
They can be a bit off-hand, or abrupt.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.500
They're not hugely interested

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.900
in the details of our day.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.240
They call their friends rather than talk with us.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.400
We feel disenchanted and let down.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.280
Love, was supposed to be lovely.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.880
But without any one huge thing having gone wrong,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.800
it doesn't feel much that way, day to day.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.300
This sorrow has a paradoxical source.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.360
We're upset now because

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.900
at some point in the past,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.880
we were really rather fortunate.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.880
We're sad, because we've been lucky.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.240
To explain this seeming paradox,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.360
we need to have a look at the intimate origins of love.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.380
Our idea of what a good, loving relationship

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.340
should be like

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.480
and what it feels like to be loved,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.860
doesn't ever come from what we've seen

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.980
in adulthood.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.640
It arises from a stranger, more powerful source.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.000
The idea of a happy couplehood

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.300
taps into a fundamental picture of

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.880
comfort, deep security, wordless communication,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.460
and of our needs being effortlessly understood

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.760
that comes from early childhood.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.360
At the best moments of childhood,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.060
if things went reasonably well,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.260
a loving parent offered us extraordinary satisfaction.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.580
They knew when we were hungry or tired.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.100
Even though we couldn't usually explain.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.760
We didn't need to strive.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.800
They made us feel completely safe.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.400
We were held peacefully.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.740
We were entertained, and indulged.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.820
And even if we don't recall the explicit details,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.760
the experience of being cherished

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.100
has made a profound impression on us.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.680
It's planted itself in our deep minds

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.340
as the ideal template of what love should be.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.340
As adults, without really noticing,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.900
we continue to be enthralled to this notion

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.700
of being loved.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.960
Projecting the best experience of our early years

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.200
into our present relationships.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.320
And finding them sorely wanting as a result.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.780
A comparison, that is profoundly corrosive,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.880
and unfair.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.620
The love we receive from a parent

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.900
can't ever be a workable model

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.280
for our later adult experience of love.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.780
The reason is fundamental,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.340
we were a baby then

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.060
we are an adult now.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.520
A dichotomy with several key ramifications.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.700
For a start, our needs were so much simpler.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.040
Back then, we needed to be washed and amused,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.680
put to bed..

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.380
But we didn't need someone to trawl

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.420
intelligently through the troubled corners of our minds.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.940
We didn't need a caregiver to understand

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.280
why we prefer the first series of a television show

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.100
to the second.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.600
Why its necessary to see our aunt on Sunday.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.840
Or why it matters so much to us that the curtains

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.860
harmonize with the sofa covers.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.380
Or that bread must be cut with a proper bread knife.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.440
The parent knew absolutely what was required

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.580
in relation to certain basic physical and emotional

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.420
requirements.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.400
Our partner on the other hand,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.960
is stumbling in the dark

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.380
around needs that are immensely subtle,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.960
far from obvious, and very complicated

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.320
to deliver upon.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.020
Secondly, none of it was reciprocal back then.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.440
The parent was intensely focused on caring for us

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.700
but they knew and totally accepted that we

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.020
wouldn't engage with their needs.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.000
They didn't for a second imagine

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.880
that they could take their troubles to us,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.980
or expect us to nurture them.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.600
They didn't need us to ask them about their day.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.880
Our responsibility was blissfully simple.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.140
All we had to please them, was to exist.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.740
Our most ordinary actions, rolling over on our tummy,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.920
grasping a biscuit in our tiny hand,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.700
enchanted them with ease.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.440
We were loved, we didn't have, to love.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.640
A distinction between kinds of love

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.100
which language normally artfully blurs,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.880
shielding us between the difference between

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.900
being the privileged customer of love,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.840
or its more exhausted and long suffering provider.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.180
Futhermore, our parents were probably kind enough

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.680
to shield us from the burden

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.080
that looking after us imposed on them.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.680
They maintained a reasonably sunny facade,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.240
until they retired to their own bedroom.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.320
At which, the true toll of their efforts could be witnessed

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.360
but, by then, we were asleep.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.240
They did us the honor of not quite showing us

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.140
what looking after us cost them.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.000
Which was immensely kind,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.060
but did us one lasting disservice,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.700
It may have unwittingly created an expectation

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.100
of what it could mean for someone to love us

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.680
which was never true in the first place.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.360
We might in later life,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.700
end up with lovers who are techy with us

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.840
who are too tired to talk at the end of the day,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.260
who don't marvel at our every antic,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.740
who can't even be bothered to listen to what we're saying

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.280
and we might feel, with some bitterness

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.680
that this is not how our parents were

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.600
The irony which has its redeeming side,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.900
is that in truth, this is exactly how our parents were,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.760
just up in their bedroom, when we were asleep,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.240
and realize nothing.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.400
The source of our present sorrow

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.640
is not, therefore, a special failing

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.600
on the part of our adult lovers.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.520
They are not tragically inept nor uniquely selfish.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.420
Its rather that we're judging our adult experiences

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.000
in the light of a very different kind of childhood love.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.440
We are sorrowful not because

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.240
we have landed with the wrong person,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.440
but because, we have sadly

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.780
been forced to grow up.
