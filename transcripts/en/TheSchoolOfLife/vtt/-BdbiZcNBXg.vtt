00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Being a good listener is one of the most important and enchanting life skills

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.900
anyone can have yet few of us know how to do it.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.000
Not because we are evil, but because no one has taught us how and, related point,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
no one has listened to us. So we come to social life greedy to speak rather than listen,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
hungry to meet others, but reluctant to hear them, friendship degenerates into a socialised egoism.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.960
Like most things it is about education: our civilization is full of great books on how to speak,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.660
Cicerus' 'Orator' and Aristotles'  'Rhetoric' were two of the grateast in the ancient world,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.000
but sadly no one has ever written a book called 'The Listener'. There is a range of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.940
things that the good listener is doing that makes it so nice to spend time in their company.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.940
Firstly, they egg us on.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.000
It's hard to know our own minds, often worrying in the vicinity of something, but do not quite close in on what's really

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.220
bothering or exciting us. We hugely benefit from encouragement to elaborate,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.580
to go into greater detail, to push just a little further. We need someone who rather than

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.440
launch forth on their own will simply say those two magic words "Go on".

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.880
You mention a sibling and they want to know a bit more, what was the relationship like in childhood,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.900
how has it changed over time. They are curious where our concerns and excitements come from.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.120
They ask things like "Why did that particularly bother you?", "Why was that such a big thing for you?".

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.240
They keep our histories in mind, they might refer back to something we said before

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.960
and we feel they building up a deeper base of engagement.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.100
Secondly, the good listener urges clarification.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.800
It is fatally easy to say vague things, we simply mention that something is lovely or terrible, nice or annoying,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.600
but we do not really explore why we feel this way. The friend who listens often has a productive,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.200
frendly suspicion of some of our own first statements and it is after the deeper attitudes  that they are

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.480
lurking in the background. They take things we say like "I am fed up with my job" or "My partner and I are having a lot of roughs" and

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.500
they help us to focus in what is really about the job we do not like or what the roughs are really about.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.200
They are bringing to listening and ambitioning to clarify the underline issues. They do not

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.100
see conversation as the swapping of anedoctes, they are reconnecting the chat that you are having over pizza with

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.400
with the phylosophical ambitions of Socrates, whose dialogues are records of his attempts to help

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.500
fellow athenians understand their ideas and values in a better way.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.600
Thirdly, good listeners do not moralise.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.000
The good listener is accurately aware of how  insane we all are. They know  their own minds

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.600
well enough not to be surprised or frightened  about this, they are skilled at making occasional

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.300
little positive sounds, strategic "MMMMMM..." that delicately signals sympathy without

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.860
intruding on what we trying to say . They give the impression that they recognise and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.200
accept our follies, they reassuring us that they are not going to shred our dignity.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.200
A big worrying in a competitive world is that we feel we cannot afford to be honest about how distressed we are,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.500
saying one feels like a failure could mean being dropped. But the good listener signals early and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.500
clearly that they do not see us in these terms. Our vulnerability is something they warm to, rather than they are appalled by.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.760
Lastly, good listeners separate disagreement from criticism.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.380
There is a huge tendency to feel that being disagreed with is an expression of hostility and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.280
obviously sometimes that is right. But a good listener makes it clear that they can really like you and,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.440
at the same time, think you are wrong. They make plain that their liking for you is not dependant on contant agreement.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:02.720
They are powerfully aware that a really lovely person could end up a bit muddled and in need of some gentle untangling.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.200
When we are in the company of people who listen well we experience a very powerful pleasure but

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.880
too often we do not  really realise what it is this person is doing that so nice. By paying strategic attention to

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.120
the pleasure we can learn to magnify it and offer it to others, who will notice, hear and repay the favour in turn.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.680
Listening deserves discovery as one of the keys to a good society.
