Oh satellite launch no I maybe it's just

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639
Oh satellite launch no I maybe it's just
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.249
Oh satellite launch no I maybe it's just
an amazing process to be I think it's

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259
an amazing process to be I think it's
 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.340
an amazing process to be I think it's
everybody at least my childhood dream to

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350
everybody at least my childhood dream to
 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.959
everybody at least my childhood dream to
actually go to to be a granted full

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
actually go to to be a granted full
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.999
actually go to to be a granted full
access get inside actually touch this

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
access get inside actually touch this
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.110
access get inside actually touch this
thing that's going to go into space and

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
thing that's going to go into space and
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.480
thing that's going to go into space and
work on it is absolutely amazing

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490
work on it is absolutely amazing
 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.450
work on it is absolutely amazing
but there are some quirks associated

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
but there are some quirks associated
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920
but there are some quirks associated
with that because this is this is an

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
with that because this is this is an
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.050
with that because this is this is an
extremely controlled environment there's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
extremely controlled environment there's
 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.730
extremely controlled environment there's
a few places like this anyone the earth

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740
a few places like this anyone the earth
 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.130
a few places like this anyone the earth
and the materials they're working with

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140
and the materials they're working with
 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.830
and the materials they're working with
solid rocket fuel and liquid oxygen

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
solid rocket fuel and liquid oxygen
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.860
solid rocket fuel and liquid oxygen
liquid hydrogen these are extremely

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
liquid hydrogen these are extremely
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.360
liquid hydrogen these are extremely
volatile fuels so in order to actually

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
volatile fuels so in order to actually
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.670
volatile fuels so in order to actually
gain access to the sort of inner sanctum

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
gain access to the sort of inner sanctum
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.639
gain access to the sort of inner sanctum
sanctorum the place where we build the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
sanctorum the place where we build the
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.760
sanctorum the place where we build the
rocket we had to go through some hoops

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
rocket we had to go through some hoops
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.350
rocket we had to go through some hoops
and one of the things that really came

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
and one of the things that really came
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.840
and one of the things that really came
through in the answer they were willing

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
through in the answer they were willing
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180
through in the answer they were willing
to grant me access but they wouldn't

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
to grant me access but they wouldn't
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.639
to grant me access but they wouldn't
necessarily grants the cameraman or

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
necessarily grants the cameraman or
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.040
necessarily grants the cameraman or
sound access nobody else can come into

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
sound access nobody else can come into
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.959
sound access nobody else can come into
some of the really sensitive places with

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
some of the really sensitive places with
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.689
some of the really sensitive places with
me so because of my history and some

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699
me so because of my history and some
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.889
me so because of my history and some
personal training and some of the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
personal training and some of the
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.060
personal training and some of the
training that I went through there they

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
training that I went through there they
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.700
training that I went through there they
were comfortable with me going in but

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
were comfortable with me going in but
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.080
were comfortable with me going in but
nobody else so I kind of became a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
nobody else so I kind of became a
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.670
nobody else so I kind of became a
one-man and bad man for someone out of

some of the operations bringing in the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
some of the operations bringing in the
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.480
some of the operations bringing in the
solid rocket boosters this is basically

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
solid rocket boosters this is basically
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.399
solid rocket boosters this is basically
a giant stick of dynamite right there's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
a giant stick of dynamite right there's
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.070
a giant stick of dynamite right there's
no it's a solid fuel if it gets igniter

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
no it's a solid fuel if it gets igniter
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.330
no it's a solid fuel if it gets igniter
if anything goes wrong there's no way to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
if anything goes wrong there's no way to
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.530
if anything goes wrong there's no way to
turn it off it's gonna burn til it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
turn it off it's gonna burn til it's
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.590
turn it off it's gonna burn til it's
gone

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600
gone
 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.850

fireproof clothing I've got everything

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
fireproof clothing I've got everything
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.100
fireproof clothing I've got everything
ready to go and I would go in with my

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
ready to go and I would go in with my
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170
ready to go and I would go in with my
own camera wired for sound and I would

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
own camera wired for sound and I would
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.870
own camera wired for sound and I would
try to document the process as I'm

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
try to document the process as I'm
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.730
try to document the process as I'm
working document myself but holding the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
working document myself but holding the
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.290
working document myself but holding the
camera out document the other guys that

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300
camera out document the other guys that
 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.450

this is pretty pretty jerky and it's got

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
this is pretty pretty jerky and it's got
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.890
this is pretty pretty jerky and it's got
odd angles and it's it has a real sort

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900
odd angles and it's it has a real sort
 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.450
odd angles and it's it has a real sort
of in the moment danger feel and that's

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460
of in the moment danger feel and that's
 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.920
of in the moment danger feel and that's
like that's not staged at all it's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
like that's not staged at all it's
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.630
like that's not staged at all it's
completely real so you'll see some odd

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
completely real so you'll see some odd
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.190
completely real so you'll see some odd
angles and you'll hear some some

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
angles and you'll hear some some
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.720
angles and you'll hear some some
scratchy audio but that's because I'm

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:08.730
scratchy audio but that's because I'm
 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.880
scratchy audio but that's because I'm
trying to produce a huge amount of this

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
trying to produce a huge amount of this
