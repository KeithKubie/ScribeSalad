00:00:00.314 --> 00:00:01.730
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.000
tackle a problem that would
be considered pretty difficult

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.192
for most first-year
physics students.

00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:08.650
And you, frankly,
probably wouldn't

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.320
be expected to solve
a problem like this

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.140
in most first-year
physics class.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.000
Or if you're in an
advanced or honors class

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.208
you might be expected or it
might be a bonus problem.

00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:18.224
But it's an interesting
type of problem.

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:19.640
Because what we're
going to do is,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.010
we're going to launch a
projectile on an incline.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.225
So maybe we're on
the side of the hill.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:26.850
So it's a hill.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.730
Let me do it in green.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.700
So let's say we're on the
side of the hill like this.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.250
And let's say that we know
the inclination of the hill.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.050
The hill's inclination is 30
degrees off the horizontal.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.470
So this is the horizontal
right over here.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.790
So that is the
inclination of the hill.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.450
And then we're going
to launch a projectile

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.060
at 10 meters per second.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.510
We're going to launch it
at 10 meters per second.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.690
And the angle with the
hill is 15 degrees.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.700
So at a 15 degree
angle with the hill.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.580
And the reason why
this is more difficult

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.395
than the traditional projectile
motion problems is, well, we

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:09.270
could think about it.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.080
The projectile is
going to be launched

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.330
and it is going to eventually
land at some point on the hill.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.770
But we can't do
the simple figure

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.390
out how long it's in the air
using its vertical velocity

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.880
because we don't know what
the vertical displacement

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.450
for this thing is
going to be, unless we

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.040
know how far down
the hill it lands.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.410
Because the further
down the hill

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.450
it lands, the higher the
vertical displacement.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.180
So we have to think
about both the horizontal

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.700
and the vertical displacement
at the same time.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.410
And as we walk
through this, you'll

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.320
see how that can be done.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.702
So I guess the first thing
that we really would always

00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:48.160
want to do whenever
you want to try

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.060
to solve this type of problem is
break up our velocity into both

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.970
the horizontal and
vertical components.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.820
So the vertical
component of our velocity

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.120
is going to be the magnitude
of our total velocity, 10

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.840
meters per second, times--
and be very careful here--

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.350
not the sine of 15 degrees,
but the sine of the angle

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.540
with the horizontal.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.430
So times the sine of 45 degrees.

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:24.430
And I go into it in a lot more
detail in previous videos.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.760
For the sake of time,
I won't go into it.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.500
But it really just
comes from sohcahtoa.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.010
If we were to draw the
vertical component,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.440
it would look like this.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.600
This is the angle.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.230
The sine of 45 degrees
is equal to the opposite

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.470
over the hypotenuse or
the hypotenuse times

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.530
the sine of 45 degrees is equal
to the vertical component.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.950
That's where it's coming from.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.700
Let me get rid of some
of the stuff I just

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.930
drew just so it makes
it a little bit cleaner.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.220
And the horizontal component
of our velocity is going to be,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.990
by the same logic, 10
cosine of 45 degrees.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.390
Now let's think about what
the horizontal displacement

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.180
is going to be.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.220
And I'm just going to go
straight to the formula

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.000
that we've derived in
the last few videos.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.470
The horizontal
displacement is going

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.220
to be our initial-- sorry.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.710
Let's do the vertical
displacement.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.475
The vertical
displacement-- I could

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:24.350
have done the horizontal
displacement first--

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.900
but the vertical
displacement is going

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.030
to be our initial
vertical velocity, which

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.575
we know as 10 sine
of 45 degrees.

00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:34.700
And by the way, we could
just solve that right now.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.020
What is the sine of 45 degrees?

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.270
Sine of 45 degrees is
square root of 2/2.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.100
Cosine of 45 degrees is
also square root of 2/2.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.340
So both of these values,
10 times square root of 2/2

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.452
is 5 square roots of 2.

00:03:50.452 --> 00:03:51.910
So this whole thing
right over here

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.000
is 5 square roots of
2 meters per second.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.160
That's our vertical velocity.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.810
And our horizontal
velocity is also

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.520
5 square roots of 2
meters per second.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.260
So that simplifies
things a little bit.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.650
But anyway, we
were talking about

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.420
our vertical displacement.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.550
Our vertical
displacement is going

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.899
to be our initial vertical
velocity, 5 square roots of 2,

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:27.785
times our change in time
plus the acceleration.

00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:29.410
Well, we know what
the acceleration is.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.670
It's negative 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.450
So let me write minus 9.8.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.560
I'm not going to write the
units here so that we say space.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.650
Times our change
in time squared.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.030
All of that over 2.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.530
We derive this in several
videos, especially the last few

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.160
where we do these two
dimensional projectile motions.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.720
So this gives us
our displacement

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.969
in the y direction.

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:53.510
And I can simplify
this a little bit.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.950
Our displacement in
the vertical direction

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.590
is equal to 5 square
roots of 2 times

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.050
delta t times-- let me do it in
the same-- times delta t change

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.020
in time minus 4.9 times
our change in time squared.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.320
So we know we have this
constraint right over here.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.530
So this gives us our
vertical displacement

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.200
as a function of time.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.320
Let's think about our
horizontal displacement

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.890
as a function of time.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.880
Our horizontal
displacement is going

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.880
to be equal to our
horizontal velocity, which

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.350
is 5 square roots of 2
times our change in time.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.000
Now what can we do next?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.690
Well, we have to have
some relationship

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.050
between our horizontal
displacement

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.870
and our vertical displacement.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.530
And that relationship
is going to be

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.830
given to us by this incline.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.330
So wherever we
land-- let's say this

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.405
is where we eventually
do end up landing.

00:06:03.817 --> 00:06:05.400
Well, let's think
about our horizontal

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.130
and our vertical
displacements and what

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.020
their relationship
would have to be.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.660
So if this is where
we land, then this

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.970
would be our-- let me do it
in the same colors-- that

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.490
right there would be my
vertical displacement.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.630
I would move that far up.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.040
And then our
horizontal displacement

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.540
will be this right over
here, will be that length

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.270
right over there.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.080
So that is our
horizontal displacement.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.020
So what is the
relationship between

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.850
our vertical displacement and
our horizontal displacement?

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.690
And we know that this angle
right over here is 30 degrees.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.030
So we can use some
basic trigonometry.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.460
We have a right triangle.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.630
We know the opposite
side from the angle.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.350
We know the adjacent side.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.570
And the trig function that uses
the opposite and the adjacent

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.300
is the tangent function.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.560
So we get the
tangent of 30 degrees

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.950
is going to be equal
to the magnitude

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.794
of our vertical displacement
over the magnitude

00:07:09.794 --> 00:07:11.085
of our horizontal displacement.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.930
And the tangent of
30 degrees, that's

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.304
the same thing as
the sine of 30 over--

00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:21.470
let me just do it over here.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.090
So the tangent of 30
degrees is the same thing

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.780
as the sine of 30 degrees
over the cosine of 30 degrees.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.730
Let me do this a
little bit neater.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.570
And the sine of
30 degrees is 1/2.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.240
This is equal to 1/2.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.820
And the cosine of 30 degrees
is the square root of 3/2.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:47.200
So this is equal to 1/2 times
2 over the square root of 3,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.110
which is equal to 1 over
the square root of 3.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.210
So we get the magnitude
of our vertical component

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.090
over the magnitude of our
horizontal component--

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.160
is our horizontal
component right over here--

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.430
is equal to 1 over
the square root of 3.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.600
What's useful about
this is it gives us

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.552
a relationship
between our horizontal

00:08:07.552 --> 00:08:09.510
and vertical component,
or between our vertical

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.250
and our horizontal components.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.260
And we can use this
constraint right over here

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.690
to then solve for
one of these two.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.520
And let me show you
how we'll do it.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.016
So let's just
explicitly write this.

00:08:23.016 --> 00:08:24.920
Well, let's do it this way.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.902
Let us cross multiply
here, which is really

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:29.360
the same thing as multiplying
both sides by the square root

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.820
of 3 and the magnitude of
our horizontal component.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.089
We get the square root
of 3 times the magnitude.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.850
And both of these are
going to be positive.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.490
Well, let me just
write it this way.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.290
Times the magnitude of
our vertical component

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.060
is going to be equal
to the magnitude

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.355
of our horizontal component.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.049
So right, just like that.

00:08:59.049 --> 00:09:01.590
So we now have a relationship
between the length of these two

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.510
vectors.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.090
And we can use this
relationship to substitute back

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.660
into the constraints
that we already have.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.390
So the second constraint
right over here,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.180
let's use this information.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.190
The second constraint says
that our horizontal component

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.600
of our displacement is
equal to 5 square roots

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.810
of 2 times our change in time.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.120
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.960
if we divide both sides
by 5 square roots of 2,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.930
we get our change
in time is equal

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:39.260
to the horizontal component
of our displacement divided

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.430
by 5 square roots of 2.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.590
But we also know that
the horizontal component

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.240
of our displacement
is the square root

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.520
of 3 times the vertical
component of our displacement.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.440
Here I explicitly wrote
the magnitude notation.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.460
When we start dealing with
either just the vertical

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.000
or the horizontal
component, I can just

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.940
write it like this,
because it's either

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.970
going to be a positive
or a negative value.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.580
And that specifies both the
magnitude and the direction.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.830
So what I'm going to do right
over here, and obviously

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.996
the way I've drawn it right
over here, both of these

00:10:08.996 --> 00:10:10.370
are going to be positive values.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.536
It's upwards displacement
in the vertical direction,

00:10:12.536 --> 00:10:14.330
so that's positive
by our convention.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.620
And we're moving to the right.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.120
So that's positive,
also, by our convention.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.050
So I can rewrite this
over here as being

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:32.500
equal to square root of 3 times
our vertical displacement.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.220
And all of that's over
5 square roots of 2.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.910
Now, the whole
reason why I did this

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.110
is, this expression right here
contains this information,

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.060
contains the ratio between
our vertical displacement

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.590
and our horizontal displacement.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.360
And it also contains
the information of,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.730
how does the horizontal
displacement, how does that

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.580
change as a function of time?

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.190
So our time needs
to be equal to this.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.060
So this is our
time as a function

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.700
of our vertical
displacement now,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.440
not time as a function of
our horizontal displacement.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.820
And what we can do is, we
can use this constraint

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.510
with our original
vertical displacement

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.680
as a function of
time to then solve

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.380
for our vertical displacements.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.150
So let's do that.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.530
Let's substitute this
business right here

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.190
for delta t in this top
equation right over here.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.630
So if we do that-- and
I'll write it big--

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:38.980
we get our vertical
displacement, right over there,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.880
is equal to 5 square
roots of 2 times delta t.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.140
So it's 5 square roots of 2.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.330
Delta t is all of this
business over here.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.480
So 5 square roots
of 2 times delta t.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.936
Delta t is square root of 3
times our vertical component.

00:11:52.936 --> 00:11:54.310
All of that, really
the magnitude

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.510
of our vertical component,
over 5 square roots of 2.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.579
So that's that right there.

00:12:00.579 --> 00:12:02.870
Or actually, we could look
at this one right over here.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.078
We could use this constraint.

00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:05.430
This is just simplified.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:11.150
So then we have minus 4.9
times delta t squared.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.700
So delta t squared is
this quantity squared.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.710
I'll just write it out.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.310
I don't want to
skip too many steps.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.060
So delta t once again is
the square root of 3 times

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.100
the vertical component.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.620
All of that over 5 square
roots of 2 squared.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.510
And now what does this give us?

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.050
So now we literally have
a quadratic equation

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.530
with only one variable.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.050
So we can solve for this.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.120
But let me rewrite it.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.060
Let me simplify it.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.920
So we have our
vertical component

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.249
is equal to-- now we have
a 5 square roots of 2

00:12:40.249 --> 00:12:42.040
in the numerator and
one in the denominator

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.270
and they cancel out.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:48.040
So we get the square root of 3
times our vertical component,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.010
the magnitude of our
vertical component.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.540
It's actually also specifying,
well, the magnitude,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.180
we can say, for now, although
I'm not using that notation.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.235
So then we have minus 4.9
times this quantity squared.

00:13:01.235 --> 00:13:03.360
So that's going to be, the
square root of 3 squared

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:10.340
is 3 times the vertical
component squared.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.561
And then over 5 squared,
which is 25, times 2.

00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.060
That's the square
root of 2 squares.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.230
So 25 times 2 is 50.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.490
And so we get, if we were to
simplify this a little bit

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.990
more.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.710
Let's subtract this
from both sides.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.140
We get-- I'll do it
all in one color-- 0

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:35.320
is equal to the square
root of 3 minus 1

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.790
times our vertical component.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.880
Because if we subtract
this from both sides,

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.520
that's square root of 3
times our vertical component

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.327
minus 1 times our
vertical component.

00:13:46.327 --> 00:13:48.160
So that's the square
root of 3 minus 1 times

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.570
our vertical component.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.290
And then we have all
of this business.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:14:01.800
Minus 4.9 times 3 over 50 times
our vertical component squared.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.540
And lucky for us, we
can just factor out

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.080
one of these s sub y's over
here, one of these vectors.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.040
And so we can get-- and I'll
just do that in place so that I

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.540
don't-- well, let me just-- I
don't want to skip many steps.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:20.080
So this is equal to the square
root of 3 minus 1, minus 4.9.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.410
Let me do it in that color.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.370
So let me do it like this.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:32.360
It's equal to the square root
of 3 minus 1 minus 4.9 times

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.910
3 over 50 times one of these,
times our vertical component.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.110
And then we factored one of
those vertical components out.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.160
So we factored one of them out.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.150
So the vertical component
of our displacement

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.350
could either be-- so we have
the product of two things that

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.404
equal 0.

00:14:51.404 --> 00:14:52.820
So our vertical
displacement could

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.230
be 0, which is true, because
at some point in the path

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.450
we literally had 0
vertical displacement.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:14:59.950
That was literally
where we started.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.280
But that's not the
answer we're looking for.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.480
We're looking for this
vertical displacement.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.050
So either this is going to be 0.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.841
But that's just kind
of the obvious answer.

00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:10.330
Or all of this business
is going to be equal to 0.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.520
But this is pretty easy
to solve for 0 over here.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:20.412
So we get square root
of 3 minus 1 minus 4.9.

00:15:20.412 --> 00:15:22.120
Let me just calculate
all of these things

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.490
just so that I don't have
to keep writing them.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:35.570
So we get the square root of
3 minus 1 is equal to 0.73205.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.920
So I'll just write 0.732 here.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.990
So this is equal to 0.732.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.810
That's that part
right over there.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.370
And then 4.94.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.629
I know this problem
is getting long.

00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:51.920
Just pause it and take a
break if you're getting tired.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:59.170
4.9 times 3 divided by
50 is equal to 0.294.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.580
So minus 0.294.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.710
I could put a 0 out front just
to make it clear where we are.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.820
Times this, times our
vertical component.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.650
This could also be equal to 0.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.480
Either this is 0 or that is 0.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.490
When this is 0, it gives
us the obvious answer.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.970
We're more interested in this.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:22.610
To solve for this, we can
add this to both sides.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:30.280
And we get 0.732 is
equal to negative 0.294

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.430
times the vertical component.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.380
We are in the home stretch.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:42.261
We divide both sides by
this, by negative 0.29.

00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:43.760
Oh sorry, this will
now be positive.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.520
I almost made a careless mistake
after 16 minutes of video.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:54.590
So now we divide
both sides by 0.294

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.130
and we get our
vertical displacement.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.480
So this, I think, a drum
roll might be in order.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.530
So we have 0.732 and
all of this business,

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:10.000
but I'll just round it there,
divided by 0.294 gives us

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.280
a vertical displacement of,
if we round, 2.50 meters.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.160
Or 2.49 meters, I should say.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:23.800
So this is equal to 2.49 meters.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.380
This is exciting.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.070
This is equal to 2.49 meters.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.280
And now we can figure out
the horizontal displacement

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.260
pretty easily,
because we know that

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.870
the horizontal displacement
is square root of 3 times

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.639
the vertical displacement.

00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:38.680
So let's figure that out.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.370
That's the vertical
displacement.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.510
Let's multiply that times
the square root of 3.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.550
And we get 4.31 meters.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.580
So we get the
horizontal displacement.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.580
The horizontal displacement
is equal to 4.31 meters.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.080
So this is equal to 4.31 meters.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.280
So we actually now know
the total displacement

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.834
in the vertical direction and
in the horizontal direction.

00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:05.000
And I'll leave it up to you.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.930
If you wanted to figure out
exactly how far along the hill

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.010
we traveled, you
can just use both

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.130
of these values in the
Pythagorean theorem

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.960
to essentially figure
out the hypotenuse

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.061
of this right triangle.
