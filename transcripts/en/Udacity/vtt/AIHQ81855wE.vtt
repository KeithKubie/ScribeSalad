00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's 0. The ball is only moving horizontally to begin with.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This 0 indicates we're talking about the beginning of the problem,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the y means vertical direction.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
There's no vertical velocity at the beginning of the problem.

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, V0y is 0 m/s.
