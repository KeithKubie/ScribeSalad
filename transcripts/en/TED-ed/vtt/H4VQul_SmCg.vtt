00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.586
Earthquakes have always been 
a terrifying phenomenon,

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:14.051
and they've become more deadly
as our cities have grown,

00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:17.720
with collapsing buildings posing
one of the largest risks.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.279
Why do buildings collapse 
in an earthquake,

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.756
and how can it be prevented?

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.994
If you've watched a lot of disaster films,

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:26.101
you might have the idea

00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:29.573
that building collapse is caused directly
by the ground beneath them

00:00:29.573 --> 00:00:32.977
shaking violently,
or even splitting apart.

00:00:32.977 --> 00:00:35.298
But that's not really how it works.

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:39.374
For one thing, most buildings
are not located right on a fault line,

00:00:39.374 --> 00:00:43.966
and the shifting tectonic plates 
go much deeper than building foundations.

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.316
So what's actually going on?

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:50.077
In fact, the reality of earthquakes
and their effect on buildings

00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:52.065
is a bit more complicated.

00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:55.282
To make sense of it,
architects and engineers use models,

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:59.778
like a two-dimensional array of lines
representing columns and beams,

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:05.432
or a single line lollipop with circles 
representing the building's mass.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:09.280
Even when simplified to this degree,
these models can be quite useful,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.009
as predicting a building's response
to an earthquake

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.553
is primarily a matter of physics.

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:16.868
Most collapses that occur 
during earthquakes

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:20.332
aren't actually caused 
by the earthquake itself.

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:23.259
Instead, when the ground moves
beneath a building,

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.284
it displaces the foundation 
and lower levels,

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:28.975
sending shock waves through 
the rest of the structure

00:01:28.975 --> 00:01:31.834
and causing it to vibrate back and forth.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:36.136
The strength of this oscillation
depends on two main factors:

00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:39.196
the building's mass, 
which is concentrated at the bottom,

00:01:39.196 --> 00:01:40.568
and its stiffness,

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:44.595
which is the force required 
to cause a certain amount of displacement.

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:48.155
Along with the building's material type
and the shape of its columns,

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:51.207
stiffness is largely a matter of height.

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:54.105
Shorter buildings tend to be stiffer
and shift less,

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:57.347
while taller buildings are more flexible.

00:01:57.347 --> 00:02:00.557
You might think that the solution
is to build shorter buildlings

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:02.843
so that they shift as little as possible.

00:02:02.843 --> 00:02:08.700
But the 1985 Mexico City earthquake is
a good example of why that's not the case.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.812
Durng the quake,

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:14.022
many buildings between six 
and fifteen stories tall collapsed.

00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:17.999
What's strange is that while shorter
buildings nearby did keep standing,

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.405
buildings taller than fifteen stories
were also less damaged,

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:24.555
and the midsized buildings that collapsed

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:28.730
were observed shaking far more violently
than the earthquake itself.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.590
How is that possible?

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.322
The answer has to do with something
known as natural frequency.

00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:35.988
In an oscillating system,

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:41.581
the frequency is how many back and forth
movement cycles occur within a second.

00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:43.731
This is the inverse of the period,

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:47.520
which is how many seconds it takes
to complete one cycle.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.763
And a building's natural frequency,
determined by its mass and stiffness,

00:02:51.763 --> 00:02:55.330
is the frequency that its vibrations 
will tend to cluster around.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.277
Increasing a building's mass slows down
the rate at which it naturally vibrates,

00:03:00.277 --> 00:03:03.835
while increasing stiffness
makes it vibrate faster.

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:06.192
So in the equation representing
their relationship,

00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:09.911
stiffness and natural frequency
are proportional to one another,

00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:14.184
while mass and natural frequency
are inversely proportional.

00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:17.658
What happened in Mexico City
was an effect called resonance,

00:03:17.658 --> 00:03:20.198
where the frequency 
of the earthquake's seismic waves

00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:24.535
happen to match the natural frequency
of the midsized buildings.

00:03:24.535 --> 00:03:27.456
Like a well-timed push on a swingset,

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:31.211
each additional seismic wave
amplified the building's vibration

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.052
in its current direction,

00:03:33.052 --> 00:03:36.616
causing it to swing even further back,
and so on,

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:41.303
eventually reaching a far greater extent
than the initial displacement.

00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:44.685
Today, engineers work 
with geologists and seismologists

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:48.702
to predict the frequency 
of earthquake motions at building sites

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:51.626
in order to prevent 
resonance-induced collapses,

00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:55.023
taking into account factors
such as soil type and fault type,

00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:57.947
as well as data from previous quakes.

00:03:57.947 --> 00:04:00.997
Low frequencies of motion 
will cause more damage to taller

00:04:00.997 --> 00:04:02.865
and more flexible buildings,

00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:05.789
while high frequencies of motion
pose more threat

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.553
to structures that 
are shorter and stiffer.

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:11.316
Engineers have also devised ways
to abosrb shocks

00:04:11.316 --> 00:04:14.947
and limit deformation
using innovative systems.

00:04:14.947 --> 00:04:17.423
Base isolation uses flexible layers

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:21.346
to isolate the foundation's displacement
from the rest of the building,

00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:25.225
while tuned mass damper systems
cancel out resonance

00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:28.536
by oscillating out of phase
with the natural frequency

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:30.303
to reduce vibrations.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:33.835
In the end, it's not the sturdiest 
buildings that will remain standing

00:04:33.835 --> 00:04:35.477
but the smartest ones.
