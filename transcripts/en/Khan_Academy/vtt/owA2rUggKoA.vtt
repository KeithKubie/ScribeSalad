00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.779
- [Voiceover] We're gonna talk about

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:05.160
the small x approximation.

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:10.471
The small x approximation
is an approximation method

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:14.705
used to solve equilibrium problems.

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:16.642
Maybe the most important thing to remember

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:20.021
that I'll start out with is
that the small x approximation

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:21.647
doesn't always work.

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:25.733
It works best and you should
generally try to use it

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.579
only when your reaction

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:34.607
is strongly product or reactant favored.

00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:38.566
So strongly product

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.001
or reactant favored.

00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:45.467
You might be asking at this point,

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:46.872
okay, well, how do you know

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:49.507
when your reaction is strongly favoring

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:52.409
either products or reactants?

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.847
The answer to that is
it depends on the value

00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:57.494
of your equilibrium constant K.

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:02.069
So if something is
strongly favoring product,

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.107
that means K is really
big, and by really big,

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.068
we usually mean, or I usually mean

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:13.776
it's on the order of 10
to the fourth or larger.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.869
We're talking about Kc here

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.505
where our equilibrium constant is interms

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:21.585
of molar concentration,

00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:26.375
and similarly, when we say
something is reactant favored,

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:30.340
that means that Kc is really small.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.650
So we have mostly reactants around it

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.519
and not very many products.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:39.519
And when Kc is very small,
I mean that Kc is less than

00:01:40.087 --> 00:01:43.901
or about equal to 10 to the -4.

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:48.771
So these are the situations
where the small x approximation

00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:51.453
works really well, and
then, anywhere in between

00:01:51.453 --> 00:01:54.947
where Kc is between 10 to
the -4 and 10 to the 4,

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.770
it actually doesn't work as well,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.151
and you'll wanna use a different method.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:01.518
You'll either usually wanna
use the quadratic equation

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:04.397
or you might wanna use
successive approximation,

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:06.057
which we're not covering in this video.

00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:08.390
We'll be covering those
things in separate videos.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.176
So how does the small
x approximation work?

00:02:11.176 --> 00:02:15.547
The first step is you assume
your reaction goes fully

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:20.052
to the side you know
it's gonna go based on K.

00:02:20.052 --> 00:02:24.266
So assume reaction goes 100%

00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:28.721
to either products or reactants

00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:34.793
depending on whether K
is really small or large.

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:41.591
Our second step is to use
this information from step one

00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:43.303
to make your ICE table.

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:48.556
So initial concentration,
change in concentration,

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:50.814
and equilibrium concentration.

00:02:50.814 --> 00:02:54.763
We'll then solve for
the x in our ICE table,

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:59.058
assuming that x is really small.

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:05.698
Hence the name of the method,
the small x approximation.

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:10.404
And we'll go into a
little bit more specifics

00:03:10.404 --> 00:03:12.425
about exactly what we mean by that

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.062
when we do an example.

00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:16.872
Then, the last step,
which is really important,

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:18.462
really, really, really important

00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:20.611
is to check your answer.

00:03:22.521 --> 00:03:25.678
I usually do that by plugging

00:03:27.048 --> 00:03:31.618
equilibrium concentrations back

00:03:31.618 --> 00:03:36.598
into the Kc

00:03:36.598 --> 00:03:38.072
or equilibrium constant expression

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:41.368
to make sure the
concentration that we did get

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:44.492
as our answers make sense
and we get the value of K

00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:46.113
that we thought we should get.

00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:48.052
So to make more sense
of all of these things,

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:50.397
we are going to go through an example.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.208
We're gonna go through an example

00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:55.308
of when we have

00:03:55.308 --> 00:03:58.042
a really small equilibrium constant.

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:03.666
That means that kc is less than or equal

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:08.666
to 10 to the -4, and that means

00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:11.568
since our equilibrium
constant is really small,

00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:14.621
that we have mostly reactants
and not very much product

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:18.069
in our reaction pot when
we reach equilibrium.

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:20.867
So the example reaction that
we're gonna talk about today

00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:23.769
is iodine gas, I2,

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:26.300
and it's going to be an equilibrium

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.881
with 2I-, also gas.

00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:33.168
The K value for this particular reaction

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:35.804
at the temperature we're interested in

00:04:35.804 --> 00:04:40.804
is 5.6 times 10 to the -12.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.419
So that's a pretty small number,
and it's definitely smaller

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.847
than 10 to the -4.

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:48.597
So we should be able to use
the small x approximation.

00:04:48.597 --> 00:04:51.638
We have a little bit more
information about our reaction.

00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:54.819
We know the initial
concentration of I2 gas

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.835
is 0.45 molar, and we know

00:04:58.835 --> 00:05:01.769
that the initial
concentration of I- is zero.

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:04.230
So based on this, we're
gonna go through the steps

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.308
for using the small x approximation.

00:05:06.308 --> 00:05:09.650
We're gonna assume reaction goes 100%

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.724
to either products or reactants.

00:05:12.724 --> 00:05:16.125
Here we know that we
have mostly reactants.

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:19.665
If we start out with all
reactant and no product,

00:05:19.665 --> 00:05:22.208
we assume that at equilibrium,

00:05:22.208 --> 00:05:24.925
we're still gonna have mostly reactant.

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.863
It's gonna change a little bit.

00:05:26.863 --> 00:05:30.149
So some of this is gonna turn into I-.

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:34.688
So we'll say -x for some
small concentration of I2

00:05:34.688 --> 00:05:36.127
that gets converted.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:41.127
And that -x will turn into 2 moles of I-,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.167
but we don't expect x to very big,

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:48.812
and that's the key to being
able to use this approximation.

00:05:48.812 --> 00:05:52.052
If we add these up to get our
equilibrium concentrations,

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:57.018
we get 0.45 molar minus x

00:05:57.018 --> 00:06:00.347
for I2, and we get 2x

00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:03.050
for our I- concentration.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.671
Now we can use our Kc expression

00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.924
to solve for x

00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:11.677
when we assume x is small.

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:14.556
Kc, for this particular problem,

00:06:14.556 --> 00:06:19.524
is the concentration of
our product, I- squared

00:06:19.524 --> 00:06:22.984
since we have a metric
coefficient of two there

00:06:22.984 --> 00:06:25.573
divided by the concentration of I2.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.464
And if we plug in our
equilibrium concentrations

00:06:31.464 --> 00:06:36.084
from our ICE table, we get
this 2x squared divided

00:06:36.084 --> 00:06:40.989
by 0.45 molar minus x.

00:06:42.283 --> 00:06:44.582
So far, we haven't made
any approximations.

00:06:44.582 --> 00:06:46.880
Now we can make our approximation.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.924
We're assuming x is small,

00:06:48.924 --> 00:06:52.337
and specifically, we're
assuming that x is a lot smaller

00:06:52.337 --> 00:06:54.717
than 0.45 molar.

00:06:54.717 --> 00:06:56.940
What that means is we can assume

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.526
that 0.45 molar minus x is approximately

00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:04.045
equal to 0.45 molar.

00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:07.063
So x doesn't really change
the concentration of I2

00:07:07.063 --> 00:07:08.782
at equilibrium very much.

00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:12.614
So that simplifies our
expression for Kc quite a lot.

00:07:14.048 --> 00:07:16.927
We have 4x squared in the numerator

00:07:16.927 --> 00:07:19.620
from squaring two and squaring x,

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.884
and in the denominator,
we no longer have x.

00:07:21.884 --> 00:07:24.380
So this makes a much
easier equation to solve,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.258
and this is all equal to
5.6 times 10 to the -12.

00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:30.454
Awesome.

00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:34.134
So now what we can do is we
can multiply both sides by .45,

00:07:34.134 --> 00:07:36.885
and we can divide both sides by four,

00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:40.136
and what that gives us is
that x squared is equal

00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:45.136
to 6.3 times 10 to the -13,

00:07:45.452 --> 00:07:47.414
and if we take the square root of this,

00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:50.272
we get that x is equal to

00:07:50.272 --> 00:07:55.272
7.9 times 10 to the -7 molar.

00:07:56.622 --> 00:07:59.304
So that is what we get for x.

00:07:59.304 --> 00:08:02.891
Here is the second most important step.

00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:05.131
Besides making our approximation
in the first place,

00:08:05.131 --> 00:08:07.883
we need to make sure that our
approximation makes sense.

00:08:07.883 --> 00:08:09.322
We've made a change somewhere.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.331
We've decided x is small,
and we've ignored it

00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:14.523
in our equation, in one
part of our equation.

00:08:14.523 --> 00:08:17.321
So we have to make sure
that our original assumption

00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:19.887
gave us a common sense answer.

00:08:19.887 --> 00:08:23.822
We see that x is 7.9 times 10 to the -7.

00:08:23.822 --> 00:08:26.747
We assumed that was a
lot smaller than .45,

00:08:26.747 --> 00:08:28.779
which looks to be about true.

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:36.456
It's about six orders of
magnitudes smaller than .45.

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:37.895
So, so far, so good.

00:08:37.895 --> 00:08:40.554
We can make sure that it really is right

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:42.016
by checking our answer.

00:08:42.016 --> 00:08:46.242
We can plug in our x
and calculate Kc again.

00:08:46.242 --> 00:08:48.819
So then, we get that Kc is equal to

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:51.456
two times our x value,

00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:55.937
7.9 times 10 to the -7 molar,

00:08:55.937 --> 00:08:57.748
and all of this squared

00:08:57.748 --> 00:09:02.723
divided by 0.45 molar

00:09:03.588 --> 00:09:05.654
minus our x value,

00:09:05.654 --> 00:09:09.741
7.9 times 10 to the -7 molar.

00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:11.737
If you multiply this all out,

00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:15.162
what you get for Kc, or what I got for Kc

00:09:15.162 --> 00:09:19.701
is 5.6 times 10 to the -12.

00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:22.622
That matches what we had
originally in our problem.

00:09:22.622 --> 00:09:25.245
So this tells us that

00:09:25.245 --> 00:09:27.706
A, our approximation was pretty good.

00:09:27.706 --> 00:09:30.249
It gave us an x value that
gave us concentrations

00:09:30.249 --> 00:09:31.491
that make sense,

00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:33.228
and B, which is another reason

00:09:33.228 --> 00:09:34.447
why we wanna check our answer.

00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:37.163
B, it tells is that we didn't
make any silly math errors,

00:09:37.163 --> 00:09:39.036
which is really easy to do
in this kind of problem.
