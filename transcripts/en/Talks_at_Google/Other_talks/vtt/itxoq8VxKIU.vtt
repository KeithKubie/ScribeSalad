00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:01.720
CHRIS: All right.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.420
Thanks everybody for coming.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.029
So I'm going to do a quick
intro, a few minutes.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.740
Then Sal and Erik are going to
chat up here for 30 minutes,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.270
and then we'll take questions.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.670
If you're joining from the
live stream, thanks very much.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.660
You can ask questions on
the Google+ events page.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.520
And then Eric and Sal
will take them live.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.960
So not often that I get
to introduce two people

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.140
that don't need introductions,
so this will be quite brief.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.576
Eric Schmidt is the
executive chairman of Google,

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:33.200
and perhaps more
importantly for today,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.890
he's on the board
of Khan Academy.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.420
Sal Khan is the
founder of Khan Academy

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.870
and its executive director.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.130
And me, let's talk about me.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.220
Actually, let's talk
about google.org.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.850
Next slide.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.457
So google.org is the
philanthropic arm of Google.

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:54.040
I work for it.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.748
My name is Chris.

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:57.670
I've been with google.org
since the inception.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.010
Click, please.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.770
Thanks.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.790
We donate over $100
million a year.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.950
We are the major grant
giving arm of Google,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.570
investing in non-profits
around the world.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.680
Couple of clicks, please.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.260
And one more.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.780
Next slide.

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:19.750
If we have a
clicker, I'll use it.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.900
One more click.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.144
So Khan and google.org.

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:29.310
Let me tell you about my
favorite product at Google.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.300
It's the Time Machine.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.700
And before you get on
social media talking

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.360
about how a Googler just
announced Google X's latest

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.940
project in a very
career limiting move,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.774
the time machine
is simply Gmail.

00:01:40.774 --> 00:01:43.190
Gmail, for me, is fun because
you can go back in your life

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.630
and see when did you first
start talking about something,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.930
in this case, Khan Academy.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.080
No surprise.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.070
Next slide.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.240
In 2008, perfect, I was
having lunch with Herman.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.770
A friend of mine at Google.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.600
We eat lunch a lot at Google.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.460
And we were talking about
YouTube and how cool

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.280
it would be if someone
would take advantage of it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.002
to disrupt education and put
videos online, and make them

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:07.710
accessible to everybody
around the world,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.930
and in every language,
and every subject,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.917
how neat would that be, and
maybe we should just do it.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:16.000
Well, now I have a clicker
and it's not my slides.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.710
So Herman emails me a few hours
later and he says, it exists.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.970
khanacademy.org, you
can see I'm not lying.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.390
2008.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.950
It's a long time ago.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.040
And I went to the
Khan Academy site

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.604
and I said, yes, very cool.

00:02:35.604 --> 00:02:36.770
Let's get together with Sal.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.960
I don't think he's seen this
because his eyes are wide open.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.080
Jaw's dropped.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.502
And I pasted in his bio
on the Khan Academy page,

00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:46.210
which I got a chuckle
out of this morning

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.260
because it said he's
currently working

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.800
at a hedge fund as
portfolio manager.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.769
Herman wrote back and in
typical Googler fashion he said,

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:56.560
let's get together.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.090
Let's share ideas.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.040
See if we can help find
a way to work together.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.140
And the best part of it, expand
his idea and work even further.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.280
Very, very quite
arrogant of us, actually.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.170
So we didn't do that, but we
did write Sal a big check.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.980
So what I do, in part,
at Google and google.org

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.320
is do our education giving.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.569
We wrote Sal his first check
out of, not the garage,

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.110
because he couldn't afford to
work out of a garage like Larry

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.610
and Sergey.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.950
He worked out of
his walk in closet.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.035
Wrote them a $2
million check in 2010

00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:33.800
and became their
first major funder,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.010
which we're very proud of.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.570
And we've gone on to support
other non-profits working

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.760
education around the world,
Khan Academy, Raspberry

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.130
Pi in the UK, one
of my favorites,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.080
Equal Opportunity Schools
working in Seattle

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.020
and doing some great equity work
in our schools, and code.org.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.930
So without further
ado, Sal and Eric.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.395
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:03.370
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank
you very, very much.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.450
And the early decision to invest
in Khan, I think has really,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.020
really helped them a lot.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.220
I've enjoyed working
with Sal for a long time.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.279
And it's easier if I just
say my bias right up front.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.070
I think that 50
years from now people

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.630
will say you are the most
effective and greatest educator

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.880
on the planet.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.860
If you don't do that,
I'll be disappointed.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.290
He has a special gift and
you'll hear that today.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.570
But starting with
the news of the day,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.920
we have something to announce.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.635
Let's talk about
what we're doing.

00:04:39.635 --> 00:04:40.260
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.480
And as was introduced,
and actually, it's funny.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.380
Even this actual
physical location,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.360
we saw the email thread
that eventually--

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.440
and I didn't view it
all arrogant for you

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.880
guys to reach out to me
and ask if there were ways

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.790
that you could help me get
out of my walk in closet.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.530
And it was actually
the conference room--

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.640
we have some Khan Academy team
members with us right here

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.990
and I was pointing out
that that conference

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.490
right on the other
side of that wall

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.720
was where I first walked with
my kind of my laminated slides

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.480
with what we could do
with more resources.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.410
So it's fun a be here.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.493
ERIC SCHMIDT: We use
digital tools now.

00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:11.951
SAL KHAN: We do,
but, yeah, there's

00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:13.640
sort of a reliability
in, anyway,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.689
but the-- stain resistance.

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.230
But, yeah, the big
thing we're doing.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.290
Very, very exciting.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.860
So Khan Academy, obviously we're
been around for a little bit

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.360
now.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.390
A lot of people associate
us with the videos.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.931
A lot of what we've
been investing in

00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:33.050
in the last four years is a
personalized exercise platform.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.110
Students can learn at their
own pace, grade levels aligned.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.490
And we've been
thinking, is there a way

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.415
that we can get
students to use us as a,

00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:45.510
I guess you could say a
mindset altering tool.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.230
And a lot of this
is based on the work

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.794
of Carol Dweck at Stanford.

00:05:48.794 --> 00:05:50.710
How many of you all are
familiar with the idea

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.830
of growth mindset?

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.560
A few?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.190
OK.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.910
It's this idea, for those of you
all who didn't raise your hand,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.900
is people tend to, if
you, broadly speaking,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.822
you can have a growth
mindset or a fixed mindset.

00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:05.280
Fixed mindset means that you
think you're either born smart

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.780
or not.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.560
You're either born
good at math, or not.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.820
You're either born good at
basketball or you're not.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.780
While a growth mindset
believes, well, no.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.190
If I persist at something and if
I push myself out of my comfort

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.600
zone, and I try, and I
fail, and I try again,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.950
I can actually get
good at anything.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.790
And that, by itself,
is interesting

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.380
and they've shown that
disproportionately people who

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.615
do well in life have
a growth mindset,

00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:28.990
but the exciting
thing is they've

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.250
shown that you can
actually intervene.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.830
You could actually
change people's mindsets.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.810
They call them growth
mindset interventions.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.950
So we started this campaign
about six, seven months ago

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.260
called the You Can Learn
Anything campaign, which

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.154
is we created some
even PSA spots, which

00:06:43.154 --> 00:06:45.070
were about promoting
people's growth mindsets.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.970
And we said, can
we create a program

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.762
where people can apply
this growth mindset?

00:06:48.762 --> 00:06:50.594
ERIC SCHMIDT: By the
way, was this your idea

00:06:50.594 --> 00:06:52.770
or did this come out of
teachers and students who

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.950
were using Khan or not?

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.531
SAL KHAN: So the growth
mindset work, this actually,

00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:01.280
I mean, I remember
Angela Duckworth, who's

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.900
a researcher at University
of Pennsylvania,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.080
she kind of accosted me
at a conference once.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.090
And I didn't know
about her work.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.277
And I didn't who she was.

00:07:09.277 --> 00:07:11.860
I thought oh, she's a professor
at University of Pennsylvania.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.350
And she's like, no.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.900
There's this work I do on grit,
and mindset, and perseverance.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.595
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:17.260
ERIC SCHMIDT: And there's
a whole movement now.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.884
People understand
that a lot of success

00:07:18.884 --> 00:07:21.619
is related to actual
steadfastness, grit,

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:22.660
whatever you want to say.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.990
And there's a fair amount
of academic research

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.370
that shows it as well.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.160
And that this stuff
can be taught.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.552
SAL KHAN: Exactly.

00:07:29.552 --> 00:07:31.760
So that was the first time
I had interacted with her.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.709
I think simultaneously
we discovered

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:35.250
that some folks on
our analytics team

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.333
we're working with Carol
Dweck's group at Stanford

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:39.550
to actually run some
very large scale

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.600
experiments on Khan Academy
around growth mindset

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.520
interventions.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.050
So, yeah, there's just,
I think there's probably

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.220
four or five
different directions

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.720
that it just emerged
as something we

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.430
started to really care about.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.570
And so what we've launched
in the last few weeks,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.350
and Google is the
primary sponsor for this,

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.400
is we're calling it LearnStorm.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.070
And it is a, I'll call
it a math competition,

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.644
but I'll then give
a bunch of caveats

00:08:02.644 --> 00:08:04.810
because the intent is not
to be the traditional math

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.810
competition that I'm
guessing a lot of the folks

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.480
in this room used
to participate in,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.739
which is two or three kids in
the school represent and tackle

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:13.780
a bunch of hard problems.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.990
We're going to have that
aspect, so the kids who

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.420
are racing ahead,
they'll be recognized,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.970
but we're also going to
recognize students around grit,

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.510
and perseverance, and mindset.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.010
If you give someone
a test you can't

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.910
measure their grit
or perseverance,

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.000
but on Khan Academy, we can.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.799
ERIC SCHMIDT: How
do you decide grit?

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:38.549
SAL KHAN: So we're keeping
the actual algorithm secret,

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:43.360
so it does not get gamed, but
I can give you the broad brush

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.150
strokes.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.570
You can imagine
someone with grit

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.885
is someone who is
doing a lot of work,

00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:49.260
but not getting
everything right.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:49.620
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.286
SAL KHAN: They're
working on stuff where

00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:52.587
they are getting things wrong.

00:08:52.587 --> 00:08:54.170
They are right at
their learning edge.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.730
They're working.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.270
They're stepping out
of their comfort zone.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:56.510
So someone's--

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.860
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
then they keep trying.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.151
SAL KHAN: And they keep trying.

00:08:59.151 --> 00:09:01.070
So inputs into
the algorithm, you

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.000
can imagine are how much time
you spend total, how much you

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.314
progress, but also
some degree of,

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:10.730
are you getting things wrong,
are you challenging yourself

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.140
relative to your ability level?

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.140
So we're calling that our Hustle
leader board, grit or hustle.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.110
And so we're starting a pilot
this year in year the Bay Area

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.340
with y'all's help.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.589
And we just this last--

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:26.130
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
by the way, we have

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.630
a huge number of schools have
already started and signed up.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.420
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.440
50% of the schools
in the Bay Area

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.450
already have at least one
student in LearnStorm.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.300
We already have
35,000 students total.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.910
So it's actually
already, I think

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.790
2% of the kids in the Bay Area,
and we're only a few weeks

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.501
into it of three months.

00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:43.000
But yeah.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.141
ERIC SCHMIDT: And you
want more to sign up.

00:09:45.141 --> 00:09:46.390
You want everybody to sign up.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.750
SAL KHAN: We want
everyone to sign up.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.850
Our goal, which it seems
like we're hitting right now,

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.420
is at least 30% of
the students are

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.967
from schools with a majority
free and reduced lunch.

00:09:53.967 --> 00:09:55.800
So we want to make sure
that it's definitely

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.425
reaching everyone,
especially the folks

00:09:57.425 --> 00:09:58.471
that they need it most.

00:09:58.471 --> 00:09:58.970
Yeah.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.240
But we just launched it.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.390
What we're announcing today is
that we have our first preli--

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.640
this is not the final results.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.820
We're only one week into it.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.880
So what we're going
to be doing is--

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: This is Google.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.688
We do everything immediately.

00:10:08.688 --> 00:10:10.360
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.650
We have the finals, which we're
co-hosting with y'all, is going

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.727
to be in three months, but every
week we're publishing these

00:10:17.727 --> 00:10:18.310
leader boards.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.365
And today we can
publish the first leader

00:10:20.365 --> 00:10:22.079
boards, which we actually have.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:23.620
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
what did it is say?

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:23.940
SAL KHAN: Well, we could--

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.590
ERIC SCHMIDT: Did I win?

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.460
SAL KHAN: Are you in it?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.316
You have a secret alias
as a third grader in a--

00:10:30.316 --> 00:10:33.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.930
SAL KHAN: So this is it.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.888
And this is neat because
this is the first time

00:10:36.888 --> 00:10:38.050
that anyone is seeing this.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.075
And we're going to be emailing--

00:10:39.075 --> 00:10:40.350
ERIC SCHMIDT: By the way,
isn't that a great phrase?

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.456
You can learn anything.

00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:42.830
SAL KHAN: You can
learn anything.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.371
ERIC SCHMIDT: Isn't
it a great motto?

00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:45.160
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:53.920
It's very-- So right over
here is the individual.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.377
ERIC SCHMIDT: So Hustle is a
different place than Mastery.

00:10:57.377 --> 00:10:57.960
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.850
So Mastery is literally
a raw count of which--

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.980
so this is the
individual leader boards.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.500
Mastery's just raw count of
the mastery's they've gotten.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.130
Hustle is that magic
curistic that we

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.760
talked about that involves
how much grit and perseverance

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.620
you're putting in.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.370
You can see there's
a student at--

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.450
ERIC SCHMIDT: Oh, in Hustle
you've got Fairfield,

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.426
you've Vallejo.

00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:20.050
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:20.600
ERIC SCHMIDT: You got
some interesting results

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:20.840
right there.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.423
SAL KHAN: Yep.

00:11:21.423 --> 00:11:24.250
And especially, if
we go to schools,

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.290
start looking at
the schools, and so

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.200
you can see there the top school
on the Hustle dimension right

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.000
now is a school,
that's 49ers Academy.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.083
That's in East Paolo Alto.

00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:36.020
They're 90% free
and reduced lunch.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.874
We see over there
Oakland Unity School,

00:11:37.874 --> 00:11:40.040
that's another school in
Oakland that we're actually

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.623
familiar with.

00:11:40.623 --> 00:11:42.990
We actually hadn't worked
formally with 49ers Academy

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.490
before.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.640
So it's super exciting
to see the schools.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.830
And this is Bay Area wide.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.780
There's 244 cities
in the Bay Area.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.472
I didn't realize there were that
many cities in the Bay Area.

00:11:51.472 --> 00:11:53.555
ERIC SCHMIDT: Just try
governance of the Bay Area.

00:11:53.555 --> 00:11:54.040
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.670
So this is a big deal
to even just even

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.420
be in the top 10 of it.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:56.970
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's phenomenal.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.820
SAL KHAN: We're talking
about on the order

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.840
of close to 1,000 schools.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.470
And then since we're
in Mountain View

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.660
we can look at the Mountain
View leader boards.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.352
We have the mayor of
Mountain View here,

00:12:06.352 --> 00:12:08.810
who also owns the Baskin Robbins
on the corner of El Camino

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.414
and Miramonte, which--

00:12:11.414 --> 00:12:12.830
ERIC SCHMIDT: In
case the students

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.480
wish to visit Baskin
Robbins after school.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.730
SAL KHAN: I just learned that.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.940
My daughter is, she's
literally addicted.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.690
I can't pass that Baskin Robbins
without it being a family

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.925
crisis, so I was impressed
for both of his titles.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.980
But yes.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.559
So you see in Mountain View
there's some neat things here.

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.600
These are all the local
schools and this actually

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.080
includes both the public and
the private schools there.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.940
And then maybe the most fun of
all is we can look at cities

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.819
and we can see how the cities
are comparing to each other.

00:12:41.819 --> 00:12:43.360
And we actually have
two mayors here.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.470
We have Jan.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.900
She's the mayor of Los Altos.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.027
And we see Los Altos Total
mastery doing quite good.

00:12:49.027 --> 00:12:50.110
It's only week one though.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.734
Mountain View, I
think, will come back.

00:12:54.151 --> 00:12:55.650
And then Total
hustle, number seven.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.780
Once again, to even be in the
top 10 here is a very big deal.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.240
This is out of 244
cities in the Bay Area.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.240
So we're hoping
that what this does

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.490
is this kind of creates a
culture in the broader Bay

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.400
Area around hey, let's
city versus city,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.840
school versus school kind of
a very positive celebration

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.849
of people's growth mindsets.

00:13:15.849 --> 00:13:17.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
so what will happen

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.060
is there is eventually
a final event here.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.240
What's the final event
going to look like?

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.600
SAL KHAN: So the students are
going to be working hopefully

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.810
a lot over the next few weeks.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.880
We're going to give these
weekly leader boards.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.060
We're also going to be
giving monthly challenges

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.100
to the different schools.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.600
And these are things
that they could

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.683
be doing in the classroom.

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:39.190
It could be hands on projects,
puzzles, whatever else.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:44.546
And then the students, schools
that are doing well-- actually

00:13:44.546 --> 00:13:46.920
all of the schools will be
represented at the finals that

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.920
reach a certain threshold,
but the students that

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.630
have done well in both the
Hustle and the Mastery things

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.100
will come here and then we'll
have kind of a celebration

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.600
together.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:54.980
There will be--

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.140
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's going
to be seriously wild.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:56.723
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:13:56.723 --> 00:13:58.090
It will be.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.064
It'll be a bunch of
crazy math students.

00:14:01.064 --> 00:14:02.730
ERIC SCHMIDT: So let's
talk a little bit

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.070
about sort of your arc.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.010
And I think people very well
know the story that you got

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.180
into this sort of by accident.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.610
You were busy earning a proper
living in proper things.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:17.900
And after an opportunity
to educate a relative

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.580
you sort of seized
upon this notion

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.450
of using the world's most
popular video distribution

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.820
system, also known as
YouTube, to educate the world.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.090
And we, of course, participated
with helping you doing this

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.660
and we're happy
to have done that.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.900
You sort of begin
doing these videos.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.200
And they are short videos.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.540
And you are often in
these videos, right?

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.090
You've learned every
conceivable high school topic

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:46.650
SAL KHAN: Yes

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.150
ERIC SCHMIDT: To
the point where you

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.310
could teach every single
one of them, right?

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.930
It's a very sort of
extraordinary achievement

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.280
on a human being.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.000
And so you've become sort of
the teacher of high school,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.560
if you will.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.101
You can sort of do
this in your sleep

00:15:00.101 --> 00:15:02.300
and you probably dream it.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.460
So you did that for a while.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.250
And you've gotten
now to the point

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.460
where an enormous
number of people

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.520
globally use these things to
supplement their knowledge.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.200
They're in trouble
in some subject,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.074
whether it's math,
science, physics, English,

00:15:16.074 --> 00:15:16.660
what have you.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.210
And they come to Khan Academy
for assistance, if you will.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.950
But then you started working
on programmatic things, right?

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.340
A most recent
example is that Khan

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.480
has been selected as
the preparatory tools

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.030
and technology for
the 2016 SAT, which

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.280
complicated and interesting.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.190
Turns out that Khan is
one of the best ways

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.820
to prepare for the Common
Core testing and standards

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.769
that are now in 43 states.

00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:46.560
Take us through this
sort of transformation

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.101
from the videos,
which I think people

00:15:48.101 --> 00:15:50.200
are pretty familiar with,
to this other model.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.755
And what does it sort of
look like going forward?

00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:54.380
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.046
And as you mentioned,
I mean, the videos

00:15:56.046 --> 00:15:58.060
are what, kind of
how we got started.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.670
It's what got us on
people's radar apparently

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.150
back in 2007, 2008.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.344
And in 2010 when
folks like Google,

00:16:06.344 --> 00:16:09.010
literally in the conference room
on the other side of this wall,

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.300
came and said, what would
you do with more resources?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.100
My pitch was, and I'd set it
up as a not for profit the year

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.646
before, and when
the IRS asks you,

00:16:16.646 --> 00:16:18.145
there's a part of
the form, it says,

00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:20.070
mission colon, and
in the line and half

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.882
I filled out, a free world class
education for anyone anywhere.

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:25.840
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's a
Google level aspiration.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.390
SAL KHAN: There you go.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:27.020
Yes.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.020
ERIC SCHMIDT: Repeat it.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.120
A free first class edu--

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.550
SAL KHAN: Free world class
education for anyone anywhere.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.050
ERIC SCHMIDT: For
anyone everywhere.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.133
SAL KHAN: Anyone anywhere.

00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:36.837
ERIC SCHMIDT: That includes
everyone in the entire world.

00:16:36.837 --> 00:16:37.420
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.510
ERIC SCHMIDT: You're sure?

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.470
SAL KHAN: That's the goal.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.178
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:16:40.178 --> 00:16:42.080
And how many languages
do you support?

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.730
SAL KHAN: We're not there yet.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.360
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's not enough.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.440
SAL KHAN: As I say, we're
going to be working on it.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:45.760
We're not going--

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.343
ERIC SCHMIDT: One
of the things that I

00:16:47.343 --> 00:16:49.570
know is that we've had
phenomenal donors who

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.220
have been helping fund the
translation of the videos

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.140
and the non-video technology
into other languages, right,

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.345
for obvious reasons.

00:16:57.345 --> 00:16:57.970
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:58.520
Exactly.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.550
We already actually are
making pretty good headway.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.380
And Yin, who's our head
of international is here.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.296
And she's going to be
driving it even further,

00:17:04.296 --> 00:17:08.319
but we have a fully
Spanish Khan Academy.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.099
We have a fully Brazilian
Portuguese Khan Academy.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:12.329
We have partners in France.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:13.460
We have partners in Turkey.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.160
So the goal is
hopefully in the next 5,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.771
10 years we have
significant presences in--

00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:20.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: And the good news
is that's a scalable problem

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.353
once the content is there.

00:17:21.353 --> 00:17:21.980
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: Coming back to
the focus though, at some point

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.300
you decided to do
more than just videos.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:26.770
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:27.420
ERIC SCHMIDT: What happened?

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:27.740
SAL KHAN: So yeah.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.198
The pitch was,
well, look, in order

00:17:29.198 --> 00:17:32.030
to actually learn, to get
an education it can't just

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.630
be 5, 10 minute videos.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.170
It's got to be
real interactivity.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.670
And there's always
been this thesis,

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.378
and this goes back to
when I was tutoring

00:17:38.378 --> 00:17:39.892
my cousins, which
was really kind

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.100
of the start of Khan Academy.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.891
ERIC SCHMIDT: How is
your cousin doing now?

00:17:45.725 --> 00:17:46.350
She's grown up.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.391
SAL KHAN: She's grown up.

00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:49.810
I tell her there's a lot
riding on her future.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:54.010
So she's-- actually the
first three cousins.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.506
They're doing just fine.

00:17:55.506 --> 00:17:57.380
I'm obviously very
invested in their success,

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:03.790
but Nadia, she just graduated
from Sarah Lawrence last year.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.270
And she's working
as a researcher now.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.020
And I think she wants
to go to med school.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.030
ERIC SCHMIDT: So
she's a proper adult.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.340
She managed to make it
through Khan Academy.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.230
SAL KHAN: She's proper.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.760
ERIC SCHMIDT: And grow up.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.343
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:18:12.343 --> 00:18:14.821
And she's fulfilled all her
South Asian stereotypes just

00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:15.320
perfectly.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:22.881
And her younger brother,
he's a sophomore at MIT.

00:18:22.881 --> 00:18:25.130
And his younger brother's
going to be a freshman there

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.140
next year, so
they're doing good.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: So what happens
is you get through this,

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.730
you're seeing all these wins.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.945
And what was the decision
to do something different?

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.320
SAL KHAN: Well,
it was that I saw

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.580
that they all-- even
the ones that they

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.105
thought they were good students,
A minus, B plus students.

00:18:39.105 --> 00:18:40.480
They still ended
up hitting walls

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.854
when they got into
algebra class,

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:43.330
or trigonometry, or calculus.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.960
And they often thought it was
because I'm not good at math,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.945
or math is hard.

00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:49.320
But when I sat
down with them, it

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.300
was pretty clear that they
were having trouble in calculus

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.400
because they didn't
master their algebra,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.900
or they're having
trouble in algebra

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.760
because they were a little foggy
on exponents, or whatever else.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.150
And so the first version of
Khan Academy, my background's

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.180
in software, it had
nothing to do with videos.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.620
This was in 2005 when
I got the domain name.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.800
It was just literally
an exercise platform

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.410
that would allow my cousins
to fill in their gaps

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.600
and then guide them ahead.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.110
And this was something that
I had hacked together on.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.710
And the videos
were just something

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.090
to complement those things.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.140
And so when y'all reached out on
what we would do, I said, well,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.560
we'll get a real team to work
on this software platform where

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.850
students can go
remediate their gaps.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:29.449
It understands where they are,
and then it can guide them up

00:19:29.449 --> 00:19:30.740
to the appropriate skill level.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.160
And keep them in their kind of
one step out of their comfort

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:34.660
zone.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.280
They're kind of zone of
proximal development,

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.488
kind of what we want for
the students who are winning

00:19:38.488 --> 00:19:40.310
the Hustle leader board.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.560
ERIC SCHMIDT: So I was struck.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.130
One of the things that you did
a couple of years ago is you

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.931
started to look at the
problem of math problems.

00:19:46.931 --> 00:19:48.680
And everyone struggled
with math problems.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.610
And you actually back
correlated which problems would

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.850
produce the quickest learning.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.550
And I thought that was the first
example of machine intelligence

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.303
that everyone could relate
to, because nobody likes some

00:20:00.303 --> 00:20:02.610
of these hard and
impossible problems

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.410
that nobody can actually answer.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.000
So what happened with that?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.410
Did that work?

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.220
Is that now a part of my math
experience as a 12-year-old?

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:11.930
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.900
And we have members of
our analytics team here.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.120
And what they're
constantly doing, I mean,

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.550
this is the thing.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.530
I mean everyone here is familiar
with the notion of A/B testing.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.730
In a traditional world A/B
testing is literally just

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.460
about how to get
more time on site,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.952
prevent the bounce rate, or--

00:20:24.952 --> 00:20:26.910
ERIC SCHMIDT: A/B testing
is taught in schools,

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.430
but never applied to schools.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.860
SAL KHAN: Is it
taught in schools?

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.140
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.129
It's called statistics.

00:20:33.129 --> 00:20:34.170
SAL KHAN: Oh, statistics.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:34.670
That's right.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.230
ERIC SCHMIDT: You forgot.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.440
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.090
No, that's right.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.506
ERIC SCHMIDT: They
actually teach.

00:20:37.506 --> 00:20:40.690
There are thousands of people
who teach testing A versus B,

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.990
but no one in education
ever actually does that.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.330
SAL KHAN: That's right.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:43.610
Yes.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:44.240
There's a whole movement--

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.906
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's how the new
math became the old math, which

00:20:46.906 --> 00:20:48.084
became the new math again.

00:20:48.084 --> 00:20:49.500
You're too young
to remember that.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.125
SAL KHAN: No, I'm
older than you think.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.165
So yeah.

00:20:56.165 --> 00:20:58.440
They're constantly running
these experiments on

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.000
if we give students questions
that are harder then

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.694
what is the accuracy that
kind of optimizes students'

00:21:04.694 --> 00:21:07.110
engagement, or their ability
to get to some learning stage

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.990
further on.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.880
We're measuring
correlations between what

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.950
we call mission completion, you
mentioned-- we literally have,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.170
and we're working with the
authors of the Common Core

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.840
on this, on making sure that our
collection of 200,000 exercises

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.644
are actually representative of
what the Common Core should be.

00:21:23.644 --> 00:21:25.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
what is the alignment?

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.920
I mean, are you now training
to the test as the critics say?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.670
SAL KHAN: So what
was good about it,

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.170
I was actually skeptical of the
Common Core three years ago.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.710
And to a large
degree, regardless

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.226
of the standard,
what matters more

00:21:37.226 --> 00:21:38.600
is how it's actually
implemented.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.934
You could do a very bad
implementation of any standard.

00:21:40.934 --> 00:21:42.850
And you can also do a
very good implementation

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.510
of most standards,
but when we actually

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.130
started to look at what
the Common Core was saying,

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.590
it really is just good math.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.550
I mean, I know it's a
political hot potato,

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.400
but it really is based off of
a lot of the good ideas that

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.820
come out of Singapore.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.280
Have fewer concepts, but
teach them really well.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.509
And have really good conceptual
underpinning on them.

00:22:02.509 --> 00:22:04.550
So that's just the basic
gist of the Common Core.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:05.860
I mean, there's
some details, but we

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.390
looked at it and obviously
that 43 states were adopting it

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.931
and was like, this
is an opportunity.

00:22:09.931 --> 00:22:11.990
We are at least national,
if not international.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.050
Let us focus around this.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:16.490
So we did a very deep investment
starting almost three years ago

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.144
on making sure that our
exercises, our videos also,

00:22:19.144 --> 00:22:21.560
but especially our exercises
aligned with the Common Core.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.820
But to your point,
then measuring that,

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.500
hey, if you get to
what we would call

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.476
full mastery of the eighth
grade mission on Khan Academy,

00:22:30.476 --> 00:22:33.100
what does that mean if you were
to go take a standardized test?

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.360
And we now see that
you're very likely to rock

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.450
that standardized test.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.076
And that's part of
the LearnStorm pitch

00:22:38.076 --> 00:22:39.700
that we make to
schools because schools

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.910
have a million things to do.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.076
But we can say hey, this
is something you care about

00:22:43.076 --> 00:22:43.750
and it's fun.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.680
ERIC SCHMIDT: A
couple more questions

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.888
about this, then we'll move
on to audience questions.

00:22:46.888 --> 00:22:48.880
But let's talk a little
bit about the SAT.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.510
SAT is fighting ACT.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.660
There's a new leader.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.360
You all did a deal
to do essentially,

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.030
to be one of the
test prep, I guess

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.800
for the-- why did you do that?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.000
What is the relationship of the
Khan Academy mission and test

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.675
prep to SATs?

00:23:07.675 --> 00:23:08.300
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.760
Well, the College Board
reached out to us.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.430
They're launching
a new SAT in 2016.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.390
And this new SAT
is being designed

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.350
to be more aligned with
what students actually

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.700
learn in school.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.760
And part of this thing,
and College Board's

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.200
been around for 100 years,
is for the first time

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.640
with their new leadership
publicly calling out

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.162
that this has been
unequal, that middle class,

00:23:30.162 --> 00:23:32.620
upper middle class kids have
access to Kaplan and Princeton

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.124
Review, tutors, whatever else.

00:23:35.124 --> 00:23:36.540
And so they wanted
to do something

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.159
to help level the playing field.

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:40.450
And we didn't know they had
been quietly looking at all

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.120
of our work on the Common Core.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.060
And saying this
thing that was kind

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.080
of this the startup-y
thing a couple years ago,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.755
they're doing serious work
now based in real science.

00:23:50.755 --> 00:23:52.130
And so they reached
out, said, we

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.605
would like you
guys to actually be

00:23:53.605 --> 00:23:58.120
the official exclusive
provider of free test

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.530
prep for the new SAT.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.156
And the whole point
here is test prep--

00:24:01.156 --> 00:24:02.863
ERIC SCHMIDT: So it's
important that it's

00:24:02.863 --> 00:24:05.760
free for everyone who's going
to take the SATs, which is

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.290
presumably everyone in the US.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.560
SAL KHAN: It's free
and best in class

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.670
is the goal, because no one
else before had direct access

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:14.950
to the College Board.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.480
We're vetting items together.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.990
And this, once
again, it's not going

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.600
to be just your classic test
prep, where it's like, hey,

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.200
when in doubt, pick
C, or this is what

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.430
you-- test taking strategies.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.330
The SAT, the goal is to measure
college readiness and the best

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.650
way to do well on that is
to just be college ready.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.257
And so we are a
big part of this.

00:24:32.257 --> 00:24:34.090
And this is why they
wanted to work with us,

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.950
is that we actually
want to teach people

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.450
the mathematics, or the
reading, or the writing,

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.390
or whatever else.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:43.927
ERIC SCHMIDT: Now another thing
that you've been doing is,

00:24:43.927 --> 00:24:46.010
you've been doing this
with a number of educators,

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.884
is you've been trying
to look at the totality

00:24:47.884 --> 00:24:49.820
of the educational experience.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.780
So a simple question is people
get so mad at the school

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.290
system, they say, I want to
sort of homeschool my child

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.724
and I want them just
to use Khan Academy.

00:24:59.724 --> 00:25:01.140
And there are some
things that you

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.500
don't learn by sitting in front
of a computer all day, right?

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.520
As much as we would like to
not believe that as a child

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.500
and growing up into
a proper citizen.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:14.580
So you've actually done some
partnerships in various states.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.820
You want to take through
some of your lab ideas.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.910
Give me a model of how
the ideal school will

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.600
look like in 5 or 10 years.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.824
What will the teacher do?

00:25:23.824 --> 00:25:25.740
Because it's pretty clear
that teachers matter

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.040
is even more than they used to.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.290
And they've always mattered.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.210
And it's pretty important
that Khan Academy

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.503
matters a lot to them.

00:25:32.503 --> 00:25:33.250
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.560
So if you take education as
kind of this full spectrum

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.090
of things.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.520
At this end of
education you could

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.310
say this is your history facts
and your multiplication tables.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.450
And as you get
further and further

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.870
you get into more and
more open ended things.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.660
Out here might be
entrepreneurship,

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.940
or your growth mindset,
or your ability to write

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.660
a novel, whatever it might be.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.530
The traditional school
system has been very focused

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.480
right around at this range.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.069
And because they've
been doing it in,

00:25:56.069 --> 00:25:58.610
for lack of a better word, this
Prussian factory model, where

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.410
even if you have gaps
in a basic concept,

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.701
we're going to move you onto
the next more advanced one

00:26:02.701 --> 00:26:05.150
because the assembly line
is just moving at that pace.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:06.270
And we're going to
grade you and when

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.610
we identify gaps
we'll keep pushing you

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:08.340
along and at some
point you're going

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.410
to hit a wall like
my cousins did.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.510
So even on that it's not really
personalizing and making sure

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.720
that students learn it
as well as they could.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.770
And it's the model more
than any individual's fault.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:24.310
And so the view is if
things like Khan Academy

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:28.190
can tackle a lot of this, but
do it in a personalized way

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.470
so students can build
their foundations, progress

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.540
at their own pace,
and actually even

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.665
a little bit of this stuff.

00:26:32.665 --> 00:26:35.240
We have a programming
platform where students

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.690
can create things, have
peer review, make games,

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.599
very creative.

00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:41.390
It's not to replace
what was going on here.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.400
It allows the teachers
to move up here.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.880
And so now the teachers
can spend a lot of time

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.782
mentoring students,
intervening in their lives,

00:26:49.782 --> 00:26:51.740
having that one on one
time, being their coach.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.031
Frankly, the type of thing
that I was doing with Nadia,

00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:56.150
and Armon and Ali was
taking interest in what they

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.449
were doing and motivating them.

00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:59.490
ERIC SCHMIDT: But we forget
that schools are also

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.330
where an awful lot of
social issues get resolved.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.555
And the people bring problems
from home to school and on

00:27:05.555 --> 00:27:07.070
and on and on.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.470
You talked a lot about it in
your first book, the notion

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.260
of inverting the classroom.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.960
So are we still on an
inverting the classroom model?

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.530
And how would one look like?

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:21.950
SAL KHAN: The inverting
the classroom idea,

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:22.950
and this wasn't my idea.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.300
This was other teachers had
emailed me back in as early

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.120
as 2007.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.389
[INAUDIBLE] yeah, you've
given videos on some things.

00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:30.430
We don't have to waste
class time giving lecture,

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.400
information delivery anymore.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.080
We'll use class time to
actually interact and do

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.850
problem solving.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.683
And then kids can get
videos if they need it

00:27:35.683 --> 00:27:37.070
at their own time and pace.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.660
In my mind, that's
been distilled

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.680
further is that when
humans get together,

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.250
the general principle
is leverage the humans.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.580
And so make them
interact with each other.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.720
Make them do projects.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.186
Make them have
Socratic dialogue.

00:27:48.186 --> 00:27:49.560
And then they can
do other things

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.810
at their own time and own place.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:51.976
It might be watching videos.

00:27:51.976 --> 00:27:53.260
It might be doing exercises.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.490
And it might be even doing some
other projects or programming.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.000
But if they're in
a room together,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.458
make them interact
with each other.

00:27:58.458 --> 00:28:00.690
So the school of the
future, and as you

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:03.650
mentioned we're working with a
bunch of schools in this area

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:06.265
and around the country that are
moving in this direction, some

00:28:06.265 --> 00:28:07.350
of them very aggressively.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.850
Yeah.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.310
Students spend two,
three hours a day

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.893
on core skills, the
kind of stuff that

00:28:10.893 --> 00:28:12.310
used to be eight
hours of the day,

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.101
but they're learning
in a personalized way,

00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:15.630
and hopefully much
more effectively.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.534
But then the rest of
the day is open ended.

00:28:17.534 --> 00:28:18.700
They're working on projects.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.310
They're having
Socratic dialogue.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.600
They're doing peer to peer.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.530
ERIC SCHMIDT: So if
you're wildly successful

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.540
here in the Bay Area
and in other places

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:31.090
you might get 0.5% or 1% of
the schools to start this.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:35.120
How do you get to scale given
the way in which education

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.450
is run in America, heavily
unionized, heavily regulated,

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.900
department and department of
policy, all sorts of rules,

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.740
the textbooks take five years
to get approved, on and on.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.270
How do you break that?

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.140
Is your strategy just
to be an insurgent

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.985
and get these ideas in and
then hope for the best?

00:28:51.985 --> 00:28:53.610
SAL KHAN: There's a
little bit of that.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.542
And I don't have
the crystal ball.

00:28:58.542 --> 00:29:00.250
I don't know the exact
right answer here.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.910
I think we have
several kind of angles

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.100
of approaching this problem.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.640
One is continue to do what we're
doing, have a lot of reach.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.120
Last year our estimates are that
20% to 30% of all US students

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.460
at least used Khan
Academy once in the year.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.760
So the reach was there.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.680
And obviously we're
working on ways to getting

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.950
them to use it even more.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.430
So there's one
model where, look,

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.070
you just have a large
percentage of the students

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.630
in a country and eventually
the world using this thing.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.491
That creates change.

00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:31.740
And we see that happening,
that a teacher might use it

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.200
in their classroom because
a parent, or a student,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.280
or a lot of their
students are using it.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.700
That's one way to approach it.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.410
The partnership with
the College Board

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.210
is a big deal for us,
hopefully a big deal for them

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.610
as well because it
completes a picture.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.640
To a large degree
there's probably

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.170
parents here who homeschool.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:53.920
And your child, the grades,
it's from your mom or dad.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.810
The colleges aren't going
to take it too seriously,

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.955
but if your child does
well on the AP test, which

00:29:58.955 --> 00:30:01.880
are administered by the College
Board and does well on the SAT,

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.786
and has a portfolio
of good projects

00:30:03.786 --> 00:30:05.410
that they worked on
and can write well,

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.330
they can get into Harvard.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.020
ERIC SCHMIDT: You actually told
me the story about the AP tests

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.640
are a relatively new idea.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.440
They were invented
roughly 50 years ago

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.890
in some elite schools.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:16.242
And they became sort of a
new level of expectation

00:30:16.242 --> 00:30:17.200
across the [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.560
SAL KHAN: They're actually
probably the best example

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.290
of in the last 40 years actually
a transformation happening.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:24.862
40 years ago Phillips Andover,
elite of the elite schools,

00:30:24.862 --> 00:30:26.820
they said, hey, our
seniors are taking calculus

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.480
at the same level as
they would if they

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.750
were at Yale or Harvard.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.460
Let's talk to Yale or
Harvard because they could.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.584
And let's make sure our
students get credit for it.

00:30:33.584 --> 00:30:35.977
And then Exeter, and
Choate, and Deerfield,

00:30:35.977 --> 00:30:38.560
and all these very elite schools
said, oh, we're just as good.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.801
And because education is
an aspirational thing.

00:30:40.801 --> 00:30:43.300
It is kind of like, oh the movie
star's wearing those jeans.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.840
I want to wear it, too.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.220
That it eventually,
the great majority

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.750
of the schools in
the country say,

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.810
I want to offer AP
classes as well.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.140
ERIC SCHMIDT: Final question
involving programming.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.450
About a year and a half ago you
brought out some initial tools

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:01.830
for teaching programming.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.710
Obviously that's
your own background

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.890
and obviously ours
here in the room.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.570
How's that going?

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:08.830
What your vision of that?

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.345
We care a lot about
producing great programmers.

00:31:11.345 --> 00:31:11.970
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.011
No, that's close to our heart.

00:31:14.011 --> 00:31:15.760
I even think of this
with my own children.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.635
I mean, there's reading,
writing, arithmetic,

00:31:17.635 --> 00:31:20.090
and the fourth R is programming.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.170
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.170
Can we just review that
high school mastery again?

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.091
SAL KHAN: There's an R in it.

00:31:27.091 --> 00:31:27.590
Yeah.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.940
So we take this very seriously.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.340
And the way we did
programming, if you

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.560
take CS 101 at
almost any university

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.190
they start with,
this is a variable.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.880
This is a loop.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.680
This is a conditional.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.560
And I was like that's not
how we learned to program.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.410
Most of us learn programming--
I want to create a game.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.639
I want to create screensaver.

00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:44.680
I want to create something
I can show my friends.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.430
And so John Resig, who's one
of the architects of jQuery

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.680
on our team, we kind
of gave him some space

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.530
to think of this in a
very open ended way.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:53.980
And we came up with a model.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.950
And we piloted it at
some schools in Los Altos

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.520
with fifth graders, both
genders to make sure

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.250
that it's equally
appealing, and actually

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.760
our CS platform is
50-50, male, female.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.720
And the whole point of
it is you create things.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.262
And so you have a coding
window, and then you're

00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:11.220
doing it in JavaScript.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.570
And then you have your
canvas, but then you

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:13.650
share it on your profile.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.000
You get peer to peer feedback.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.730
You can browse other
people's games.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.030
You can spin off of games.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:18.530
So yeah.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.360
It's something that we take
very seriously because we think

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.860
it's-- yeah.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.686
I mean, it's funny.

00:32:23.686 --> 00:32:25.310
We've actually already
hired two people

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:28.530
based on what their portfolios
were on our programming

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:29.030
platform.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.440
So it could be an interesting
recruitment strategy.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.440
ERIC SCHMIDT: Excellent.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.110
Let's move to our
audience questions.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.920
We have some Dory questions,
which are our internal board.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.187
And let me just read the first
one while people-- there's

00:32:43.187 --> 00:32:44.020
a microphone coming.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.850
If you would come up here.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.250
From your perspective what
could or should Google

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.450
be doing in education
that we currently are not?

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.210
And before you
answer that question,

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.790
make sure everybody
knows that we

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.300
have a very successful program
around something called

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.880
Chromebooks.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.980
Many, many students now
will get the Chromebook.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.950
They'll check it
into their classroom.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:03.790
They log in.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:06.720
When they're done they check
it back out into the school.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.670
It's essentially a
Chrome 1 hardware.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.420
It's the number one
most successful computer

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.860
in education.

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.350
We've also introduced in the
last year a product called

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.990
Google Classroom, which the
customer of Google classroom

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.450
is essentially a teacher
who's doing lesson plans,

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.602
wants to sort of work
digitally with the students

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:25.560
and so forth and so on.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.095
Go ahead.

00:33:26.095 --> 00:33:26.720
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.840
Well, as you mentioned, I mean,
Google's already doing a lot.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.900
And even some of the things that
y'all aren't explicitly doing

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.829
for education, like things like
project Loon and whatever else,

00:33:33.829 --> 00:33:35.120
I think have huge implications.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.050
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well,
connectivity is huge.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.610
SAL KHAN: Connectivity is when
we think about the world in 10

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.435
years, we see ourselves.

00:33:40.435 --> 00:33:42.060
We're going to create
a lot of content.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.360
And hopefully that
motivates more people

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.830
and they'll be hopefully
on mobile devices

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:45.790
and whatever else.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, they will
only be on mobile devices.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.210
SAL KHAN: Exactly.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.680
ERIC SCHMIDT: And in a
decade the vast majority

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:56.580
of your global customers will be
on smartphones run by Android.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.640
SAL KHAN: We don't disagree.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.514
And so that's
actually a huge thing.

00:34:01.514 --> 00:34:03.180
And that's the kind
of thing that Google

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.671
can tackle that we would
never be able to tackle.

00:34:05.671 --> 00:34:07.420
And all of the other
things you mentioned.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:12.300
And I would say beyond that is a
lot of what we've done together

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.250
and starting to do together is
figure out programmatic ways

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:18.239
to build awareness, to build
energy around this very

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.420
important direction, whether
it's narrow, if we just think

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.250
only about computer programming,
which both groups are

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.910
interested in, but also broader
spectrum around education

00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:27.409
generally.

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.034
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well,
I've always thought

00:34:29.034 --> 00:34:31.750
that education was sort of the
last industry to get automated.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:34.460
And now with digital
connectivity, everybody

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.100
being connected, it should be
possible to get the like minded

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.391
people to start building
these interesting and powerful

00:34:39.391 --> 00:34:42.690
platforms, which include machine
intelligence, various forms

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.340
of testing, and A/B testing.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.300
Yes, ma'am?

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.929
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Lizzie.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.929
Before I came to
Google I was a teacher.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.389
ERIC SCHMIDT: Who did you teach?

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.460
AUDIENCE: I taught middle
school math, so eighth

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.940
and ninth graders in Boston.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.350
And one of the
things that I noticed

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:01.930
was that despite
access to resources,

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.130
so many of these
kids had smartphones.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.780
So I just wanted to
follow up on something

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.280
that you just started
talking about,

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.910
but specific to
LearnStorm, and the sort

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:16.190
of mobile accessibility there,
and how soon students can start

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.900
doing this on their phones.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.490
SAL KHAN: The simple answer
is hopefully within the year.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.980
Matt, who's driving a lot of
our mobile stuff is there.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.080
So you all can talk
to him, but yes.

00:35:28.915 --> 00:35:31.610
We have big plans.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.300
The writing's on
the wall, obviously.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.660
And so we have big plans in
this upcoming year to, yeah.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.339
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, and there's
an iPad product already.

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:42.755
SAL KHAN: Yeah.
we just launched--

00:35:42.755 --> 00:35:45.370
ERIC SCHMIDT: We're working
on the smartphone technologies

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.064
in the more popular of
the operating systems.

00:35:48.064 --> 00:35:49.900
SAL KHAN: That is right.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.280
But I encourage
you all to sample

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.350
the one that is out there.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.260
So we had an old iPad
app that was just

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.260
enriched video viewing,
but we just launched one

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.770
a few weeks ago where students
can enter their answer

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.420
with free hand and all that.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's
question him together

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:06.832
until we get the right answer.

00:36:06.832 --> 00:36:08.580
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.080
Get serious.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.300
ERIC SCHMIDT: Is there
something interesting

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.000
that you can do on a smartphone
from an education perspective

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.333
that you can't do on a computer?

00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:16.860
SAL KHAN: Well,
from a smartphone

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.014
there's all sorts of
things that you know.

00:36:19.014 --> 00:36:20.930
Idea-- they could take
a picture of a problem,

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:22.430
and then they could
have an example.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.040
This is actually
screenshots the iPad app,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.520
which in the not too
long future will also be

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.940
on the more popular platform.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.620
Yeah.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.320
I mean, you can imagine.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.590
I mean, you have a camera.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.810
You have a way that they
can interface on touch.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.485
So you know where
they are potentially.

00:36:39.485 --> 00:36:40.318
ERIC SCHMIDT: Right.

00:36:40.318 --> 00:36:41.236
You have location.

00:36:41.236 --> 00:36:42.610
And they can also
move it around.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:44.235
SAL KHAN: They can
also move it around.

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:45.760
So we're just
scratching the surface

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.176
on what's possible on mobile.

00:36:48.176 --> 00:36:50.300
And we're just starting to
open our minds, frankly,

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.160
to what it is.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.394
AUDIENCE: It would be
amazing if also just shifting

00:36:53.394 --> 00:36:55.060
some of the time that
those students are

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.870
spending on their
mobile phone from less

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.079
productive activities, too.

00:36:58.079 --> 00:36:58.870
ERIC SCHMIDT: What?

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:01.230
Like texting?

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.335
AUDIENCE: Like bullying.

00:37:02.335 --> 00:37:02.876
SAL KHAN: Oh.

00:37:02.876 --> 00:37:03.584
ERIC SCHMIDT: Oh.

00:37:03.584 --> 00:37:04.810
AUDIENCE: I'm leaving now.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.600
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.470
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.090
Yes ma'am?

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.599
Next question.

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:12.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.410
I'm Toni from Android Test.

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.960
My question is
around your platform

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.780
that supports using Java
to code and basically show

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.460
what they code on the right.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.250
I'm aware of a different
language called Scratch, which

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.050
enables pretty much
similar things,

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:32.430
but is more block based, and
potentially easier for younger

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.180
kids to interact with it.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.480
I'm wondering what's the
rationale behind choosing Java

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.575
versus expanding on Scratch.

00:37:39.575 --> 00:37:40.200
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.116
No, and we're very close
to the Scratch folks.

00:37:42.116 --> 00:37:43.660
Mr. Resnick at
the MIT Media Lab.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.034
And when we did this, one,
Scratch already was there.

00:37:47.034 --> 00:37:49.200
And we're like Scratch is
actually doing a great job

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.060
at block based programming.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.290
But we kind of
introspected again,

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.110
like when we all first
had learned to program,

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.930
you actually don't see a lot
of folks-- a lot of folks,

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.870
they will do they--
when I was a kid

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:05.880
you had the-- what was the one
with the turtle and the-- Logo.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.220
You had things like that,
which were a very basic form

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.000
of programming.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.374
But you don't see
a lot of people

00:38:10.374 --> 00:38:13.070
make the jump from
that, or even the block

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:16.420
base to for lack of word,
real syntactic programming.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.310
And so we thought
it was important,

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:21.130
not that that isn't important,
but that's kind of step one,

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.652
but to step two is to
really cross that gap where

00:38:23.652 --> 00:38:25.610
students are saying,
actually the syntactic one

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:26.410
isn't that bad.

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.784
And that's actually what most
of the programming that you

00:38:28.784 --> 00:38:31.170
will do in the world
today actually looks like.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.210
But with that said, we
actually have an overlay

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:36.480
on the JavaScript
with using Blockly

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.900
that it is also block
based, but our thesis

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.690
was it is important for
the kids to actually

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.420
get used to syntactic.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.740
ERIC SCHMIDT: So
a Google employee,

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.200
in fact, did a lot of
the work to take Scratch

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.110
and put it onto the
proper web platform.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.220
He's a real hero
inside the company.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.635
And Google has been
funding a lot of these sort

00:38:57.635 --> 00:39:00.290
of Scratch programs in schools.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.540
And they target it at
10, 11, 12 year olds.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.620
And they really work.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.124
SAL KHAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:06.124 --> 00:39:08.040
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was
wondering if you have data

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.190
on how young of
an age could they

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.140
start interacting
with actual Java

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.390
and not be intimidated by it.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:16.140
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.810
I don't have any
formal data on it.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:20.540
I mean, it would be actually
be interesting for us to study.

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.060
We kind of designed it
almost at the young age,

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.840
for third, fourth graders.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.730
But we've seen even
younger students.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:28.560
And there's some neat things.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.476
I mean, it seems like
you're familiar with it,

00:39:30.476 --> 00:39:33.020
where if you change a color
it changes in real time.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.330
It's based on some of the
work that Bret Victor did

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:37.550
around kind of
instant, you don't

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.820
have to re-run your program.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.680
It just kind of
changes in real time.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.120
But yeah, those
are a good point.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.560
I mean, what' s exciting is
that there's kind of Cambrian

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.790
explosion and new platforms
where kids can learn.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.351
So it's pretty neat.

00:39:49.351 --> 00:39:50.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.060
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let me ask
the next internal question.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.380
Some or much of Khan
Academy's content

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.350
is structured around a typical
American secondary school

00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.430
curriculum.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:02.090
Is the Academy analyzing this
curriculum's effectiveness

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.930
or experimenting with
different curricula?

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.910
SAL KHAN: So at
Khan Academy proper,

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.330
there's two lines of
attack, so to speak.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.280
One is where is the market?

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.310
And this is, hey, kids
are taking calculus.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.815
And we have statistics
as well, but we

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:20.190
could debate on the utility
of calculus versus statistics

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.250
versus something else, but
that is just what students

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.780
are learning.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:23.988
And it's a beautiful subject.

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:25.760
And we like creating
that content.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.260
With that said, we
are also creating

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:31.110
other content that is, I
guess, broader or maybe

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.422
more cross domain.

00:40:32.422 --> 00:40:34.380
And the other thing that
we're doing is we are,

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.420
you mentioned kind of some
of these labs we're doing

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.650
and we're piloting with schools.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.520
That is more open lens,
where we're trying,

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.478
when we're working with
these physical schools,

00:40:41.478 --> 00:40:43.920
we're trying to see, well, if
we could reboot everything,

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.790
ERIC SCHMIDT: But you
have all these constraints

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:46.498
on these schools.

00:40:46.498 --> 00:40:48.540
So you have to come
up with a school that

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.030
has the ability to grant
a degree against a very

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.260
different curriculum.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.540
Is that possible?

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.360
SAL KHAN: Well, it's
actually interesting is

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.270
a lot of the constraints are--
if you're a public or charter

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:01.817
school, yes.

00:41:01.817 --> 00:41:03.400
There's obviously
funding constraints.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.941
And then there's a
lot of constraints

00:41:04.941 --> 00:41:07.330
on time in the classroom.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:12.182
But in terms of giving a
high school credential,

00:41:12.182 --> 00:41:13.140
it's fairly open ended.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.680
I mean, homeschoolers,
once again,

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.630
as long as your child
learns to write well,

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.320
performs well on things
like the SAT, AP test,

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.900
and has a portfolio of
interesting experiences,

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.500
they can compete
or out compete some

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.232
of the students who are
going to traditional schools.

00:41:29.232 --> 00:41:30.630
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes, ma'am?

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.520
AUDIENCE: This is
about content also.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.311
I'm a software engineer
and I studied math,

00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:37.250
so my kids are getting a lot
of math and coding at home.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.807
So we were interested
in, I think

00:41:38.807 --> 00:41:41.390
they're not learning much about
writing and critical thinking.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:42.605
So I was like, well,
let's go on Khan

00:41:42.605 --> 00:41:44.771
since you're supposed to
be doing anyway for school,

00:41:44.771 --> 00:41:45.710
but never do.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.940
And we up anything
around the humanities.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.390
And we loved the
only thing we found,

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:53.275
which was the crash course in
modern history, which probably

00:41:53.275 --> 00:41:56.610
isn't for nine-year-olds,
but he loves it.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.632
It's really funny.

00:41:58.632 --> 00:42:00.340
And you have to pause
it every 10 seconds

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.510
and we talk about it.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:05.480
And think about fun
things to do around it,

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.920
like invent your own cuneiform.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.250
But I just think
there's this whole gap,

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.870
and this is
important for kids up

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.250
from all levels of
socioeconomic status,

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.860
about reading something and
thinking about it and writing.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.100
I know writing is really hard
to do in the automated fashion,

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.390
but I'm just curious
about any of your thoughts

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:24.890
around humanities and how you
could extend some of this work

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:25.450
to the humanities.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:26.575
SAL KHAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:26.575 --> 00:42:29.750
And it's in our mission
to eventually get to that.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.130
And for us it's weighing
that and the importance

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.270
of reading comprehension,
writing, and humanities

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:39.870
broadly to what we're capable
to do using existing tools.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:40.760
But, yeah.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.390
I imagine even
something like writing

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.060
could actually be very similar
to our computer science.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.640
There's a lot more
commonality between something

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.920
like programming and writing
than most people normally

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.420
associate.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.650
You're creating
something from scratch.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.130
There's kind of a subjective
open ended aspect to it.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:56.069
So you can imagine something
like that, peer review.

00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.610
You're right.

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:58.100
On the video side right
now we're very limited.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:58.890
We have a little bit of history.

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:01.000
ERIC SCHMIDT: I mean,
eventually machine intelligence

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.380
can read the paragraphs and
sort of make recommendations.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.005
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:43:04.005 --> 00:43:07.090
I mean, there's definitely--
I know the folks at edX are--

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:10.250
I haven't tested it to
see how good it is, but--

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: But you
would start with review

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:13.810
by other humans.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:15.227
And eventually
review by computer.

00:43:15.227 --> 00:43:17.768
SAL KHAN: I actually think the
peer review's a double benefit

00:43:17.768 --> 00:43:20.470
because I think critically
reviewing other people's work

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.280
is actually probably even
more valuable than having

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.160
your [INAUDIBLE]--

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.868
ERIC SCHMIDT: But we
talked some time ago

00:43:25.868 --> 00:43:28.920
that you were interested in
history and also religion,

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.432
right?

00:43:29.432 --> 00:43:30.640
SAL KHAN: That was your idea.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.500
ERIC SCHMIDT: Because
those are vast subjects

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.134
and their relatively
structure-able.

00:43:38.134 --> 00:43:39.425
SAL KHAN: And there's a market.

00:43:39.425 --> 00:43:40.258
ERIC SCHMIDT: Right.

00:43:42.885 --> 00:43:43.510
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.560
Well, and history, we've
already started a lot.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.270
And actually we have a
partnership with the Aspen

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.990
Institute, where we're starting
to get-- I mean, we literally,

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.198
Justice Kennedy has made a
few videos for us already.

00:43:52.198 --> 00:43:55.190
So that's just
kind of ramping up.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.009
And we hope to have
a lot more of that.

00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:59.300
We actually have a fairly
large art history collection.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.340
And this was just kind of one
of these random opportunistic

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.260
things that we did.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.718
These two art
historians were doing

00:44:03.718 --> 00:44:06.297
this incredible
collection of videos.

00:44:06.297 --> 00:44:07.880
And then we reached
out to them and we

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.820
did what we call a
not for profit merger.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.094
We gave them jobs.

00:44:12.094 --> 00:44:13.760
But Beth and Steven
have been incredible

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.718
and actually they are
two of the primary voices

00:44:15.718 --> 00:44:18.225
behind the Google
Art Project, as well.

00:44:18.225 --> 00:44:20.350
So that's another point of
intersection between us.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:22.430
So, yes.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:24.770
The good thing is we
now feel that we're

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:28.710
getting pretty close
to-- in K through 12,

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:31.687
I would say even K through
14 math and science.

00:44:31.687 --> 00:44:33.270
In the next year or
two we're getting,

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.820
it's pretty filled out now.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.784
So we're just starting
to kind of start

00:44:36.784 --> 00:44:39.200
thinking about, well, we can
start to invest significantly

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.642
in some of these other domains.

00:44:40.642 --> 00:44:41.849
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:41.849 --> 00:44:43.140
ERIC SCHMIDT: Another question.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.223
Many people coming online
today for the first time

00:44:45.223 --> 00:44:48.870
are doing so through smartphones
on slow cellular networks.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:50.960
What are you doing
to bring your content

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.345
and learning tools to
these internet users?

00:44:53.345 --> 00:44:53.970
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.050
And we've been having a lot
of interesting conversations.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:57.780
I mean, Matt's really
the expert here.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.770
And we have some
other folks who've

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:00.100
been thinking deeply about it.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.700
There are high tech solutions.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.520
For any of y'all
who've seen the videos,

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.730
we've even thought about
creating a new compression

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:12.290
algorithm for these videos
because in a lot of ways just

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.955
using a [? mpeg ?] or whatever,
if you just literally record

00:45:14.955 --> 00:45:17.330
where the mouse is and stuff,
you could probably compress

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:19.690
our entire library
down to under a gig,

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.030
in which case you could just
bundle them with the phone.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:24.834
And then the actual
data for, did

00:45:24.834 --> 00:45:26.250
you get a question
right or wrong,

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.590
that's very lightweight data.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.280
That could even be
batched or whatever else.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.390
So there's stuff like that.

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.132
The good thing is, well, y'all
are working on and other people

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:36.340
are working on accessibility.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.300
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well,
as an example,

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.652
you could just use an SD card.

00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:40.110
SAL KHAN: You could
use an SD card.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:40.810
Memory is getting to the point--

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:41.910
ERIC SCHMIDT: Don't have to
give you money for SD cards.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:42.910
Just hand them out.

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:45.250
SAL KHAN: If in 5 or 10
years, the default phone

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:50.172
has 16 gigabytes of memory, you
could just bundle the content.

00:45:50.172 --> 00:45:51.130
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:52.000
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
Vincent [? Chug ?].

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.940
I work on Chrome.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:53.870
I'm also a parent.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:55.444
I'm just taking
some young children

00:45:55.444 --> 00:45:57.110
and getting them
started on Khan Academy

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.290
and it makes me
wonder about children

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:03.090
who are in a daily curriculum
that isn't planning for Khan

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:06.380
Academy, who then have children
at home who are enthused

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.400
about it, and kind of racing
ahead on all the subject

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:09.960
material.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.660
I'm already seeing
a divergence, right?

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.090
And I'm already seeing
that in the classroom

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:16.640
they're saying,
well, I've sort of

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.570
covered this material already.

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:22.000
Do you know what is happening
with the population that's

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.570
out there in this kind
of an environment?

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:27.722
And what to expect, or what to
do what to do with that, right?

00:46:27.722 --> 00:46:29.430
SAL KHAN: Well, I
think that goes-- look,

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.760
to some degree we don't know
exactly what's going to happen,

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.940
but hopefully it creates
some of these pressures

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.960
in a very healthy way.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.610
That if the children
are racing ahead,

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.270
and then the teacher thinks,
well, what other ways can

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:47.754
I cater to this student
without-- hopefully and whoa,

00:46:47.754 --> 00:46:50.170
there's other students who are
actually behind where I am.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.711
There's actually studies that
the average teacher is teaching

00:46:52.711 --> 00:46:54.390
to the 23rd percentile.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:56.750
And you might say,
oh, that's great.

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:58.920
Well, it actually
tells you it's only

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.100
catering to 1% of the
students because 22%

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.320
are going to be lost.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.867
And then the remainder
are going to be bored.

00:47:05.867 --> 00:47:07.450
And it's only 1% are
going to be like,

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:08.991
wow, the teacher
knows exactly what--

00:47:08.991 --> 00:47:10.727
ERIC SCHMIDT: Is
it really that bad?

00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:11.810
SAL KHAN: That's the 23rd.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.220
That's the research I've read.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.260
ERIC SCHMIDT: Not
even to the midpoint?

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.730
SAL KHAN: It's to
the 23rd percentile,

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:16.840
which kind of makes sense.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.989
ERIC SCHMIDT: It
supports your point.

00:47:18.989 --> 00:47:21.530
SAL KHAN: I mean, if you see
the students who are struggling,

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:23.670
no one wants to leave
behind students.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.048
And so there's obviously more
kind of emotional empathy

00:47:26.048 --> 00:47:26.240
with those students.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.250
ERIC SCHMIDT: So it's
the Prussian model again.

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.666
SAL KHAN: It's the
Prussian model.

00:47:29.666 --> 00:47:32.251
And so if you have students
at either end of the spectrum,

00:47:32.251 --> 00:47:34.500
and we've even seen it that
the student that you think

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.875
is at this end of the spectrum,
if you let them remediate

00:47:36.875 --> 00:47:38.490
their gaps and move
at their own pace,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:39.870
a few months later, they might
be at this end of the spectrum.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:41.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: You
actually had a result that

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.310
was quite interesting
where Khan Academy was

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:47.070
pretty good for well-to-do,
and average sort of kids.

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.820
But the gains were
phenomenal for students

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.524
who had been lost, right?

00:47:51.524 --> 00:47:53.690
The ones that had been told
they were no good at it.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.290
And when they would
hit these blocks,

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.665
and then you, in fact, gave
a speech at Google some years

00:47:57.665 --> 00:47:59.880
ago on the subject, that
when they would get blocked,

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.480
if you unblocked
them you had data

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.950
that showed that they
would eventually catch up

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:08.060
and perhaps surpass the
median and upper student.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:08.960
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.180
I saw it frankly with Nadia.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.960
She went from being
a remedial student

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.790
to a student who a year
later was taking literally

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:17.456
university courses at
University of New Orleans.

00:48:17.456 --> 00:48:19.330
The first year that we
worked with Los Altos,

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:22.460
the first pilot, some of them
were kind of normal fifth grade

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:23.960
classes, but we
worked with a couple

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.774
of, for lack of better word,
remedial seventh grade classes.

00:48:26.774 --> 00:48:28.690
And we were afraid of
what might happen there,

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.166
but we actually saw-- and they
had never seen this before.

00:48:31.166 --> 00:48:33.540
One of the students actually
jumped into an advanced math

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:33.800
class.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.217
Usually the remedial class is
your intellectual graveyard.

00:48:36.217 --> 00:48:37.133
You're kind of behind.

00:48:37.133 --> 00:48:38.240
And you'll stay behind.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.550
But because that student
was able to fill their gaps

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.650
and move ahead.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.233
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
you can combine that

00:48:42.233 --> 00:48:44.850
with your work on persistence,
grit sort of learning,

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:45.300
SAL KHAN: The mindset study.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.950
ERIC SCHMIDT: You could
actually completely change

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:49.370
the mindset of people who
have been quote "written off."

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:50.320
SAL KHAN: I mean,
a lot of what we're

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.560
trying to think about as
a team is in our product,

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.130
in everything we do, can
we do little interventions.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:58.078
Even now if you use our
website, or the mobile app,

00:48:58.078 --> 00:49:00.703
you get these little, your brain
is like a muscle, the more you

00:49:00.703 --> 00:49:02.520
use it, the stronger it
gets, and these are literally

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.900
statements that were
engineered by folks

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.490
like Carol Dweck,
which have shown,

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:07.490
and we've even seen it
on our own platform, that

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:08.448
actually move the dial.

00:49:08.448 --> 00:49:09.910
People engage more.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:11.016
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:11.016 --> 00:49:12.140
ERIC SCHMIDT: Hi, Go ahead.

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.635
AUDIENCE: Hey, my name's Adrian.

00:49:15.635 --> 00:49:17.240
I don't know much
about education,

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.656
but I've been reading some of
the kind of Gates Foundation

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:20.669
research on education.

00:49:20.669 --> 00:49:22.210
One of the things
that they've found,

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:23.600
at least my
interpretation of it,

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.410
was that in classroom technology
typically gets a lift of 10%,

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.300
20%, but really the
majority of the lift

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.340
comes from either the home life
or ironically the back office

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.280
technology.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.500
And this is why you see
startups, like AltSchool,

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:41.520
or [? SAP ?] startup trying
to fully integrate the school.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.960
And I'm wondering when you
guys are seeing these effects

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.680
on kids, are you
mostly seeing them

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.910
in kind of the rich kids where
their families are pretty

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:50.336
much already on top of it?

00:49:50.336 --> 00:49:51.710
They see some
problem and they're

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:55.490
going to go look for some
additional support for the kid?

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:57.820
Or are you finding
this lift in the kids

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:01.550
that honestly were lost and
don't have a strong home life?

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:02.960
SAL KHAN: I'd say both.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.122
Obviously, a lot
of the, especially

00:50:06.122 --> 00:50:07.580
even the early
adopters, these were

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.750
the folks that read
the news stories that

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.400
were writing about us.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.770
They had internet access and
broadband, and all of that.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.320
And so that might have been
some of the former groups,

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.220
but a lot of what we see
in Oakland Unity, which

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.610
is on one of those
leader boards,

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:20.151
this was a school,
literally, I mean,

00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:22.740
if you visit it it doesn't
feel like the Bay Area, much

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:23.880
less the US.

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.004
It really is a very
under-served school.

00:50:27.004 --> 00:50:28.670
But they have incredible
teachers there.

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:32.850
And they literally went from the
22nd percentile four years ago

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:35.279
to the 99.7th percentile.

00:50:35.279 --> 00:50:37.070
And it was just on a
very simple principle.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:40.870
Their teacher Peter Macintosh
saw that he had ninth graders,

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:43.120
and this isn't any judgment
on the kids' intelligence,

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.640
but they just didn't know
their multiplication tables.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.280
And why should I
pretend to teach algebra

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.370
to kids if they don't know
their multiplication tables.

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.360
Let me let them remediate
at their own time and pace.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.090
And those same students, let
them learn their multiplication

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:52.590
tables.

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:55.014
They can then race
ahead and more likely

00:50:55.014 --> 00:50:55.930
reach their potential.

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:59.326
So I think we have
a lot of work to do

00:50:59.326 --> 00:51:00.950
and, in fact, to the
previous question,

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:02.580
I think that's something
that I would love to--

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.450
and we're already doing
it with this LearnStorm,

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:06.570
work more with Google of how
do we make sure that we reach

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.690
and have access to the
kids who need it most.

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:12.729
ERIC SCHMIDT: In America
today there's a growth boom

00:51:12.729 --> 00:51:14.145
and there are many,
many jobs that

00:51:14.145 --> 00:51:16.950
are unfulfilled because they
can't get the people who

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:17.950
are capable of doing it.

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:20.950
If you talk to colleges, the
colleges talk about how many

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:23.920
of the students are coming in
needing remedial work in order

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.927
to operate in freshman
year in college.

00:51:25.927 --> 00:51:28.260
So we know we have a very,
very deep problem in the area

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.528
that Adrien is talking about.

00:51:29.528 --> 00:51:30.194
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:51:30.194 --> 00:51:32.010
Thanks.

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:35.450
ERIC SCHMIDT: Another question
from our virtual audience.

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:39.040
Education quote "for free
for everyone forever.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.110
That's a great mission.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:43.030
How do Khan Academy
employees get paid?

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.340
Are all expenses covered
through donations?

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.060
Do you believe that model
is infinitely sustainable?"

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.450
SAL KHAN: Very good question.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:52.715
And other ways that
Google could help--

00:51:52.715 --> 00:51:54.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:56.710
SAL KHAN: I'm actually
not kidding, but the--

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:58.657
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:58.657 --> 00:52:00.490
SAL KHAN: Maybe it would
be round-off error.

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:04.660
Anyway, no.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:07.770
The simple answer is yeah.

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:11.000
I mean, we're primarily
philanthropically funded.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.800
And the lucky thing is
we have a board that

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.260
understands what it means
to hire great talent

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.885
in a place like the Bay Area.

00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:19.760
And so we obviously
can't give stock options.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.949
We joke everyone gets the same
stock option package I have.

00:52:22.949 --> 00:52:25.240
ERIC SCHMIDT: And in fact
you have some ex-Googlers who

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.520
have come over to work for you.

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.186
SAL KHAN: We do.

00:52:27.186 --> 00:52:28.150
We have a bunch.

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:31.450
Most famously Craig, I
called him our Hari Seldon

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:33.424
because he's my oracle.

00:52:33.424 --> 00:52:35.340
ERIC SCHMIDT: Craig was
employee number three,

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.380
I believe at Google.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.364
And retired to
work with Sal to do

00:52:39.364 --> 00:52:41.030
many of the algorithms
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.090
SAL KHAN: And make bread.

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:45.090
ERIC SCHMIDT: Which is
how he started at Google.

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:45.673
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:52:45.673 --> 00:52:47.040
But yeah.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.790
We're a not for
profit, but we are

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:52.650
able to compensate
people competitively,

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:55.140
which is, I think, which
we are finding is working.

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.681
ERIC SCHMIDT: But the general
answer is you need fund raising

00:52:57.681 --> 00:53:00.690
and you need eventually
bigger and bigger amounts.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:04.240
And the question
cited our mission,

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.700
or a synopsis of our mission,
we want to be free forever.

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.810
But we think that
we've inadvertently

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:12.330
found ourselves building a
brand in this very large space.

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:14.940
So we think there might be way
through brand partnerships,

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.580
or whatever else, I mean, some
of y'all might have seen some

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.704
of these adds with Bank of
America and other folks,

00:53:18.704 --> 00:53:21.430
where we might be able to find
other sources of revenue that

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:24.580
in no way make us compromise the
free of the non commerciality.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:25.538
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:53:25.538 --> 00:53:26.290
Yes, sir?

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:29.670
AUDIENCE: So you guys
are helping people learn

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.110
at their own pace really well.

00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:35.210
Kids have the tools to do
that, but American schools,

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:37.770
there's a lot of social
and cultural reasons

00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:41.000
why people wouldn't want
to move at their own pace.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.030
Like you were talking about
kind of the factory model.

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:47.449
If a kid is behind in
the specific subject,

00:53:47.449 --> 00:53:48.490
they might get held back.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:49.600
If they're doing
too well and they

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:52.270
skip, then there with people
who they're different ages with.

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:54.450
What's your vision
for how classrooms

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.396
will look when people are
really given the ability

00:53:57.396 --> 00:53:58.520
to learn at their own pace?

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:02.270
And how destigmatize
for kids, especially

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:04.710
making them want to
learn at their own pace?

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:05.825
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:07.200
I mean, that hits
the crux of it.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.100
I think a lot of it, I mean
some of this mindset work

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.410
that we're working
on, there's actually,

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:11.870
if you look at
the ed literature,

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.260
it's amazing how much
actionable literature there

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:17.000
is around the mindset
growth, mindset perseverance.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.470
So I think there's a lot
of stuff around that.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:22.300
But the ideal is to
do a first principles

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.730
reboot of what is possible.

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:30.054
We have a little mini lab school
downstairs from our offices

00:54:30.054 --> 00:54:32.345
literally, where we're trying
some of this stuff, where

00:54:32.345 --> 00:54:34.160
we're doing mixed age.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.660
As soon as it's mixed age, then
a lot of the stigma of going

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.480
ahead or behind, and it's OK if
you're in math and you're five,

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.990
but you're operating
at a third grade level,

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:42.520
but you're reading at
a kindergarten level.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.130
It's completely
cool in that world.

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:46.640
And then you get all the
benefit of the mentorship.

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.418
One of the reasons why I think
a lot of, for lack of a word,

00:54:49.418 --> 00:54:51.043
a broken culture in
a lot schools is it

00:54:51.043 --> 00:54:52.270
is a very unnatural environment.

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:54.830
It literally is setting up a
"Lord of the Flies" environment

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:57.560
where you have a
bunch of 13-year-olds.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.470
And they define
all of the norms,

00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:02.669
while most of human evolution,
we were in our tribe.

00:55:02.669 --> 00:55:03.710
We were with our cousins.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:05.420
We were learning from
people slightly older

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.350
and we were mentoring, even
when we were 9 or 10 years old,

00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:09.808
we were mentoring people who
were slightly younger than us.

00:55:09.808 --> 00:55:13.330
And I think that responsibility,
it gives you more agency.

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:15.440
It gives you an outlet
for a lot of your energy.

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.270
It makes you mature faster.

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:20.000
And frankly we've
already started

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.414
to see a little bit of that.

00:55:21.414 --> 00:55:24.399
AUDIENCE: Do you see
a path to get there?

00:55:24.399 --> 00:55:25.690
SAL KHAN: It's a hard question.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:28.275
I think that the best
we can do is, ourselves

00:55:28.275 --> 00:55:29.650
and work with a
bunch of partners

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:31.150
to create a lot of
examples of this.

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:35.960
Use our soapbox to disseminate
it as much as possible.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:41.240
And I think we have a very real
shot that in the next 10 or 15

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.270
years some of what we're talking
about, in fact, a lot of it

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:45.996
has even changed in
the last 5, 10 years,

00:55:45.996 --> 00:55:48.370
but in the next 10 or 15 years
if you ask a random person

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.130
on the street, what
is the best practice,

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:52.170
just like right now if you say,
what's a sign of a good school,

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:53.970
they might say, oh,
they teach AP classes.

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:56.490
But if in 5 or 10 years you
say, what is a best practice,

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:58.671
people say, oh, class
is not lecture-based.

00:55:58.671 --> 00:56:00.670
Students are allowed to
learn at their own pace.

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:01.804
It's a mastery-based model.

00:56:01.804 --> 00:56:04.220
Significant amount of class
day is building your portfolio

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.580
of [? created ?] projects.

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.610
There's peer to peer
learning and peer review.

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:12.190
And it's mixed age so that
you can mentor others.

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:14.440
If that becomes people's
mantra, and I think

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.270
it will in the next 10 years.

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:17.920
ERIC SCHMIDT: We have a few more
questions and we'll finish up.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.580
Thank you.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.769
Go ahead.

00:56:19.769 --> 00:56:20.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.400
My name is Evan Rappaport.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.060
I'm a product
manager at Google X.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.260
And I've been really
lucky in my life

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.780
to have some amazing mentors who
have helped me not necessarily

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.946
with academic learning, but
with helping to guide me

00:56:28.946 --> 00:56:32.370
in my career so I could be
happy and work here at Google.

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:34.605
So I give a lot of
mentoring advice to students

00:56:34.605 --> 00:56:36.120
and I try to give
back, but I don't

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.350
find that even students with
a really good academic history

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:41.714
have any mentoring
on their career.

00:56:41.714 --> 00:56:43.880
So what could Khan Academy
do to sort of help people

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:47.280
be happier in life and their
careers, not just in academics?

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.067
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:56:48.067 --> 00:56:49.900
There's some lightweight
things we could do,

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.960
which I think actually
will have an impact.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.710
And then there's some
more intense things.

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:56.705
One is literally
interviews with people.

00:56:56.705 --> 00:56:58.580
One of the best things,
I had an older sister

00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:00.670
who kind of navigated
the system ahead of me.

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:03.209
And if you have interviews
with folks like yourself,

00:57:03.209 --> 00:57:05.000
or with people at all
different age levels,

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.416
like how did you
navigate it, what

00:57:06.416 --> 00:57:09.480
were your insecurities, and
people from every gender,

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.802
ethnicity, race, income level.

00:57:11.802 --> 00:57:13.510
So you can find people
you identify with,

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:15.700
but they're kind of
virtually giving you ways

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.260
that you can
navigate the system.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.660
We've already started
that a little bit.

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.451
We started this whole
college access thing.

00:57:20.451 --> 00:57:21.694
It's on Khan Academy.

00:57:21.694 --> 00:57:23.360
That was a start, but
I can imagine this

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.860
across all kind of life things.

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:27.160
Most people don't even know
half of the careers that

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.160
exist out there, especially
these high-growth careers.

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.344
ERIC SCHMIDT: How did you?

00:57:30.344 --> 00:57:31.260
SAL KHAN: How did you?

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.080
ERIC SCHMIDT: How did
you deal with this?

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.040
SAL KHAN: And then
there's other things

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.873
that, once again, it's
still pie in the sky,

00:57:34.873 --> 00:57:38.025
but the technology exists
where you can pair people up.

00:57:38.025 --> 00:57:40.782
You could have mentors
that you virtually find.

00:57:40.782 --> 00:57:43.240
I think there's a project called
grandparents in the cloud,

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.560
or something like that,
where it's literally you

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.352
get a grandparent on demand.

00:57:47.352 --> 00:57:48.562
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:48.562 --> 00:57:49.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.910
Next question.

00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:50.760
Thank you very much.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:51.440
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.370
ERIC SCHMIDT: And,
Jennifer, we'll

00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:53.721
have you be the last question.

00:57:53.721 --> 00:57:54.470
AUDIENCE: Hi, Sal.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.910
I have a brief question.

00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:58.810
So I thought a little bit about
connectivity in rural areas,

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:00.740
and how you can get a
[? connection ?] there.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.470
One of the things
I thought it was,

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:05.690
have you considered
using broadcast medium

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:08.310
to kind of publish the
content that you have?

00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.850
So when I thought about
this I was actually

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:13.780
working a little bit in public
health care in those areas,

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:17.740
and when I think of Khan Academy
a lot of the video content

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.860
and also the HTML
content I think

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:21.860
can actually just be
pushed on because it's just

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.180
push based information.

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:25.660
It's only the feedback
of interactiveness

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.800
that's actually
pull based, that has

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.142
to be sent back to the Cloud.

00:58:29.142 --> 00:58:31.600
And have you considered using
broadcast medium because that

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.310
just totally avoids the problem
of having internet connectivity

00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:36.110
in these places.

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:36.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:37.800
No, I think there are
some partners that

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:38.790
have started doing that.

00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:39.700
And we're very open to it.

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:41.050
It's still obviously
a sub optimal

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.690
because even for
something like videos,

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:44.773
we would want someone to
be able to pull and pause

00:58:44.773 --> 00:58:46.830
and, I already know
that, let me watch this,

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:48.150
or let me review that.

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.650
But, yeah.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:49.191
You're right.

00:58:49.191 --> 00:58:52.020
I think that's something
that could happen today.

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.490
There's one of
our ex-interns has

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.156
started this thing
called KA Lite, which

00:58:55.156 --> 00:58:57.510
is a completely offline
Raspberry Pi based

00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:59.560
Khan Academy.

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.164
So yeah.

00:59:00.164 --> 00:59:01.580
I think all of
these permutations,

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:04.789
but my hope is that in
the next 10 or 15 years,

00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:06.580
and hopefully Google
plays a big role here,

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.650
is that a lot of the
accessibility and device issues

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:09.650
are actually going to be solved.

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:10.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: And I hope
that people in the room

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.710
know that Raspberry
Pi is a phenomenally

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:15.827
inexpensive computer that isn't
often used for early learning.

00:59:15.827 --> 00:59:17.910
And so forth Google has
been a big sponsor of that

00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:19.450
through google.org.

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:20.366
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:22.049 --> 00:59:23.340
AUDIENCE: Hi, name is Jennifer.

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:24.680
And I manage our Ocean Program.

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:26.910
I just had a question
about traditional--

00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:30.210
a lot of ocean information isn't
covered in current curriculum

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:30.720
standards.

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.930
And do you ever kind of
push that the testing

00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:37.082
platforms include additional
information about the oceans,

00:59:37.082 --> 00:59:38.290
and climate, and coral reef--

00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:39.456
SAL KHAN: Oh, really oceans.

00:59:39.456 --> 00:59:41.361
I thought it was some
acronym for some--

00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:43.360
AUDIENCE: There is that,
but no, it's different.

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.170
Real ocean.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:47.800
ERIC SCHMIDT: 70% of
the earth is oceans.

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:51.000
SAL KHAN: I know that,
but you guys are--

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.400
ERIC SCHMIDT: The largest
amount of biodiversity

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.480
is in the ocean.

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.800
We are planning on connecting
the fish to the internet.

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.600
SAL KHAN: There we go.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.100
ERIC SCHMIDT: This
here is Jennifer.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:06.100
Jennifer and her team have built
a number of things, including

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.750
Google Ocean, and so
you can, for example,

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:11.572
go visit shipwrecks
underneath visually.

01:00:11.572 --> 01:00:12.280
SAL KHAN: Really?

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.738
ERIC SCHMIDT: They're doing a
tremendous amount of mapping.

01:00:14.738 --> 01:00:16.830
They called up the Navy
and convinced the Navy

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:19.890
to give us all the maps
of the ocean and so forth.

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:20.570
SAL KHAN: Wow.

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:21.600
So, OK.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.690
That's exciting.

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:24.710
ERIC SCHMIDT: So
the answer is, yes.

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:27.460
You're going to do a new module
based on this new knowledge.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.085
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

01:00:28.085 --> 01:00:30.570
Well, the simple answer
is we do have partners.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:33.111
And actually we have a little
bit of-- we've already started.

01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:35.300
We have a partner--
Cal Academy of Sciences

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.310
has started to do some
stuff around the oceans,

01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:39.040
and ecosystems, and
things like that.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.400
And I think we're always
happy to partner with folks

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.047
and see if we can put
more content out there.

01:00:45.047 --> 01:00:45.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.380
ERIC SCHMIDT: I
think everybody sees

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:50.750
why I like to work with him.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.380
SAL KHAN: I like
to work with you.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.838
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's
not the point.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:58.780
If you think about
people who are going

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.600
to have an impact
on the world, I

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.040
would argue Larry and Sergey
will have had that impact,

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.870
but I will argue that Sal
Khan will have it as well.

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:09.820
The reach and the impact that he
and his vision, and the team he

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:14.690
has assembled is a Google level
scale, world scale impact.

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:18.060
I know of no other group that
has the kind of engineering

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.795
possibilities and the
scale in front of it

01:01:20.795 --> 01:01:22.050
as your organization.

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:25.730
It is a testament to you as
a computer scientist, failed

01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:27.895
hedge fund manager, now
educator to the world.

01:01:27.895 --> 01:01:28.895
SAL KHAN: I didn't fail.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.540
ERIC SCHMIDT: You
just got bored.

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.276
SAL KHAN: Well, fair enough.

01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:39.400
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you
very, very much for coming.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.500
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.550
