00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.370
Welcome to a new lecture on the binomial theorem.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.781
In this lecture, we will look at certain divisibility
results which can be derived based on the

00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:10.950
binomial theorem.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:20.460
Once again, recall the binomial theorem is
given by (x+y)^n = \sum{r=0}^{n}{C_r x^{n-r}

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.400
y^r}, where we use C_r to denote nC_r.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.630
To give you a flavor of the kind of results
we will be looking at today, let's look at

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:56.770
the first example which asks you to show that
3^{2n+2} - 8n - 9 is divisible by 64 when

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.420
n is a natural number.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:10.560
It asks you to show that this term is divisible
by 64 for natural numbers n.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.530
At first sight, there doesn't seem to be a
binomial expansion you can apply to generate

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.440
this result so we would like to create a binomial
expansion to derive this result.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.580
Notice that you have an exponent here, but
you also have some terms here and these terms

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.408
are, in general, not divisible by 64 for n
being a natural number.

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:40.800
You can plug in certain natural numbers and
you can see that this term, which is being

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.030
subtracted from 3^{2n+2}, is not going to
be divisible by 64 and therefore we would

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.170
like to somehow get rid of these terms and
leave the remaining term to be divisible by

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.280
64.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.840
Let's look at a way of re-expressing this
term.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:10.649
3^{2n+2} - 8n - 9 can be written as 9^{n+1},
where I've just taken a power of 2 into 3

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.579
and written 3^2 as 9, and you still have - 8n
- 9.

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.550
So now, this looks a little more promising
because you have 9^{n+1} and you have a 9

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.550
and you have an 8n.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:35.730
You can get rid of the 8n potentially by writing
9 as (1+8)^{n+1} and you have - 8n - 9.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.030
So this looks a little more promising, and
now you have a term which you can expand using

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.410
the binomial theorem.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.390
Let's try and expand this term.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:03:19.210
This is nothing but (n+1)C_0 1^{n+1} + (n+1)C_1
1^n 8 + (n+1)C_2 1^{n-1} 8^2 + .... We'll

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:26.160
be concerned about the higher-order terms
later, and we have/we're still subtracting

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.030
8n and 9 from this term.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.290
Let's see what this simplifies to.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:43.370
This is nothing but: the first term is 1;
the second term is (n+1)*1*8; and the remaining

00:03:43.370 --> 00:04:04.280
terms can be succinctly written as summation
\sum_{r=2}^{n+1}{(n+1)C_r 1^{n+1-r} 8^r}.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.020
You still have to subtract 8n and 9 from this
expression.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.030
This looks a little more promising, because
notice that these first two terms add up to

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.320
exactly 8n+9 and you can cancel these two
terms.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:35.590
So, you're just left with summation \sum_{r=2}^{n+1}{(n+1)C_r
1^{n+1-r} 8^r}.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.860
This is what we're left with, and we want
to show that this is divisible by 64.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:05:03.000
Notice that this summation runs from r=2,
so let's rewrite this as \sum_{r=0}^{n-1}{(n+1)C_{r+2}8^{r+2}}.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.940
We've just used a change of indices to rewrite
this summation.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.140
Notice that there is a 8^2 here; you can pull
that out.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:26.010
This is going to be 64*[\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}{(n+1)C_{r+2}
8^r}].

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.350
So you have a 64 here, and you wanted to show
that this term is divisible by 64: so that

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.410
is good.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:38.960
What we have to show is that this term is
an integer, that's all is what remains.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.700
That term is clearly an integer because you
have a summation of several terms, where each

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.820
term is made up of two integers themselves.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.870
8^r is an integer and (n+1)C_{r+2}, again,
is an integer.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.409
We have summations of integers and so this
term is an integer.

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:05.380
So we have that this overall term is divisible
by 64, which is the desired result.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:12.330
We've seen an application of the binomial
theorem where we somehow re-expressed our

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:20.750
given term in terms of an expression from
where we could use the binomial expansion

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.460
and derive a divisibility result for the original
term.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.110
Let's look at a second example.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:56.860
This example asks to show that 2^{4n} - (2^n)*(7n+1)
is divisible by 196 whenever n is a natural

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.080
number.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.240
This example is very similar to the previous
one, and once again we have to figure out

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.660
how to rewrite this original term in a form
which is amenable to the binomial expansion.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:19.000
Notice, now, that we want to show that this
term is divisible by 196, and 196 is nothing

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.510
but (14)^2 and you have a 7 here and a 2^n
here, so that looks promising.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.430
Let's see what we can do.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:43.100
2^{4n} - (2^n)*(7n+1) can be rewritten as
(16)^n - (2^n)*(7n+1), where we've just rewritten

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.380
2^{4n} as (16)^n.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:08:00.760
Now, 16 can somehow be split into 14 and 2;
so, we can rewrite this as (2+14)^n - (2^n)*(7n+1).

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:07.770
This looks promising because, now, we have
a 14 appear in the binomial term and we want

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:14.380
to show that this whole term is divisible
by 196 which is (14)^2.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:20.400
Let's go through the motions again and use
the binomial theorem to show that this is

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:34.830
nothing but nC_0 2^n (14)^0 + nC_1 2^{n-1}
(14)^1 + (let's rewrite the higher order terms

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:48.990
as) summation \sum_{r=2}^{n}{nC_r 2^{n-r}
(14)^r} ,and we subtract the original (2^n)*(7n+1)

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.400
from this expansion.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:09:03.490
Once again, you can rewrite this as 2^n +
n*(2^{n-1})*14 + \sum_{r=2}^{n}{nC_r 2^{n-r}

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:18.610
(14)^r} and you
still have to subtract (2^n)*(7n+1).

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:33.510
This is nothing but 2^n + n*(2^n)*7, where
I've factorized 14 as 2*7, and you have a

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:48.690
resulting summation \sum{r=2}^{n}{nC_r 2^{n-r}
(14)^r}, and you subtract (2^n)*7n and a 2^n,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.880
where I've just expanded this term.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.070
Notice once again that you can cancel the
first two terms with the terms being subtracted,

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:04.160
and you're still left with/you're only left
with the summation \sum_{r=2}^{n}{nC_r 2^{n-r}

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.560
(14)^r}.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.640
Now the arguments are quite similar to the
previous one/previous example we've seen,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.000
so I won't go through this in detail.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:49.810
You can just rewrite this as (14^2)*[\sum_{r=0}^{n-2}{nC_{r+2}
2^{n-r-2} (14)^r}], where here you started

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:58.350
with 2^{n-2} so you're starting with 2^{n-2}
again; and here you started with (14)^2 whereas

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:05.620
here you start with (14)^0 since I've pulled
out a (14)^2 here.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.220
This is what we're left with, and notice that
this summation again is an integer and we

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:16.089
have this summation being multiplied by (14)^2
which is 196 and which is again an integer.

00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:20.810
We wanted to show that this term is divisible
by 196, and that's exactly what we've shown

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:27.180
since we've factorized it into a form where
we have a leading coefficient of (14)^2 and

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:32.690
so, we've once again shown that this term
is divisible by 196 whenever n is a natural

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.190
number.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:46.180
Let's look at a multiple choice question which
is based on this flavor of problems.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:12:10.950
The question asks you to show/asks you when
5^{99} is divided by 13, the remainder is:

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.670
it asks you to compute the remainder when
5^99 is divided by 13.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:31.490
The options are 8, 9, 10, and "none of these".

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:36.020
This is a kind of problem where it's hard
to eliminate the options without actually

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:42.230
solving the problem because you have "none
of these".

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.580
Even if you determine that this remainder
is going to be even or odd, you are not really

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:52.050
sure which option it is since there's a "none
of these" and, even if the remainder is odd,

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.080
you can't just conclude that the answer is
9.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.959
So you would actually have to derive the result
for this example.

00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:06.110
Let's see how we can rewrite 5^{99} to obtain
an amenable result.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:15.720
To arrive at the solution, let's try computing
some powers of 5 to see where that gets us.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:23.740
5^1 is 5, which is quite far from 13: there's
not really much you can do about it.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:33.940
5^2 is 25, which is close to a multiple of
13 (13*2 is 26, so this looks promising).

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:43.470
But 5^{99} is not a direct power of/not an
integral power of 5^2, and so let's try this

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:52.260
approach: let's write 5^{99} as 5*(5^{98})
where I've just factorized 5^{99} into a more

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.790
suitable form.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.010
Now I can write this as 5*((5^2)^{49}).

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:11.250
Since I know that 5^2 is close to a multiple
of 13, this is nothing but 5*(26 - 1)^{49}.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:26.680
26 is a multiple of 13, so the divisibility
results are going to be fairly easy to derive.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:35.240
This is nothing but 5*..., and now you use
the binomial expansion of (26-1)^{49}.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:43.100
Let's see how we can write this.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:53.190
5*[49C_0 (-1)^{49} (26)^0 (I'm starting off
with (-1)^{49} and (26)^0 since we're only

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:58.550
concerned with the power of 26 which is 0,
since all other terms are going to be divisible

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:15.430
by 13) and you have + 49C_1 (-1)^{48} (26)^1
+ ...]. This is going to be the expansion

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:22.390
of (26-1)^{49}, and you have a leading term
which is 5 in this expression.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.790
Notice that all of these higher powers, as
I mentioned, are going to be divisible by

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:32.200
13, and, since we only care about the remainder
that this term leaves when divided by 13,

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.670
we don't really care about these terms which
are exactly divisible by 13.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:43.970
This is the only remaining term, which is
going to give us the remainder when you divide

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.230
5^{99} by 13 so let's see what that gives
us.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:56.750
5*[49C_0, which is 1, times (-1)^{49}, which
is -1, times (26)^0, which is 1], and so this

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.570
gives us -5.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:04.839
Therefore, the remainder when 5^{99} is divided
by 13 is -5.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:09.420
For those of you who aren't used to this kind
of notation, this might seem a little strange

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:15.260
that you get a negative remainder but, to
get a positive remainder, you just add a multiple

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.260
of 13.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.230
Since we've ignored so many multiples of 13,
you get a negative number but, if you add

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.340
a multiple of 13, you get 8.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:29.709
The remainder when 5^{99} is divided by 13
is 8.

00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:35.120
For those of you who are familiar with modular
arithmetic, notice that the approach we took

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.290
is very similar to the approach you take when
you use/when you do such kinds of problems

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:48.230
in number theory where you try to get at a
power of 5 which is close to a multiple of

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:56.240
13 and you just use remainder arguments, where
you ignore terms which were multiples of 13,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.550
and so you're only left with one term since
you only care about the remainder.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:07.169
This is a sample of a problem which could
appear in an exam-type situation where you

00:17:07.169 --> 00:17:15.269
are asked to derive a result based on the
divisibility of a term by a natural number

00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:17.789
using the binomial theorem.

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:19.160
That's it for this lecture.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.659
Hope you enjoyed watching this lecture.

00:17:21.659 --> 00:17:27.319
In the next lectures, we will look at some
example problems based on the binomial theorem.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:31.210
I thank you for your attention, and hope you
can join us next time.
