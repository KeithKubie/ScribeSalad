00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.260
I've talked a lot
about precession

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.890
and the changes in the
inclination of Earth's orbit,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.172
but I haven't told you
why they are happening.

00:00:07.172 --> 00:00:09.130
And I'm not going to go
into the physics of it.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.260
It's a little bit beyond this
discussion right over here.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.020
But they're really a
byproduct of the Earth

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.560
and sun's interactions with
Earth and with the fact

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.700
that Earth is not
a perfect sphere.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.490
So if I draw Earth-- so this
is my little drawing of Earth,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.130
and let me put the poles over
here, North Pole and South

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.250
Pole, it actually turns
out that Earth is fatter

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.700
than it is taller.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.490
So if you were to
measure Earth's diameter

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:43.240
along the equator,
it is 43 kilometers,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.040
which is approximately 27
miles longer than if you

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.440
were to measure its
diameter from pole to pole.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.530
So longer than the
pole to pole diameter.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.590
And the fact that Earth has this
equatorial bulge, that it's not

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.280
a perfect sphere--
and once again, I'm

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.780
not going to go
into the math here--

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.740
it's the interactions
between that,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.040
I guess you could call it, that
one asymmetry of the Earth,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.950
it's that interaction
between that

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.050
and the pull of gravity
between the Earth and the sun

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.320
and the moon that
causes these long term

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.260
cycles, this axial
precession and other less

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.250
noticeable changes
in Earth's orbit.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.740
And as we'll see
in the next video,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.670
these aren't the only types
of changes in orbits we have.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.580
We also have changes
in the actual ellipse

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.870
that Earth's orbit has
actually rotates over time.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.020
But that's due more
to interactions

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.080
with Earth's orbit,
and the orbit

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.622
of other planets in
our solar system.

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:44.496
And once again, it's
one of those things that

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:46.830
happened over thousands
and thousands of years.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.330
So all of these changes,
they're because Earth

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.230
isn't completely symmetrical,
more fat than it is tall,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.680
those interactions
between the gravity

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410
of the sun and the moon.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.440
And Earth's orbit, as a whole,
changes because of interactions

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.950
with other objects inside
of our solar system.
