[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.090
SPEAKER 1: So welcome, everyone.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.880
Our speaker today--
this is the first time

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.180
she has missed a very
special engagement,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.420
and that is the
Vancouver Ukulele Circle.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.700
So Stephanie Gray is actually
an avid ukulele player.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.480
But in addition to
that, she is a Canadian

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.240
who has spent more
than 15 years giving

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.990
over 800 talks and debates
as well as hundreds of media

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.150
interviews on abortion to
diverse audiences in the United

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.810
States, Canada, Austria,
Latvia, England, Ireland, Costa

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.090
Rica, and Guatemala.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.380
In university settings
she has debated

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.790
Dr. Fraser Fellows, a
late-term abortionist;

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.540
Ron Fitzsimmons, then executive
director of the National

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.710
Coalition of Abortion
Providers; Elizabeth Cavendish,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.670
then legal director for
NARAL pro-choice America;

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.700
and Doctor Malcolm Potts,
the first medical director

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.310
for the International Planned
Parenthood Federation.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.330
She's the author of "Love
Unleashes Life, Abortion

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.430
and the Art of
Communicating Truth,"

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.790
and we have copies
of her book available

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.650
for a subsidized price of $5.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.860
So if you're interested, come
and buy a copy after the talk.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.645
So with no further delay I will
introduce miss Stephanie Gray.

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:31.375
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:32.640
STEPHANIE GRAY: Thank you.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.140
Thank you.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.640
It's wonderful to be here.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.100
I love asking questions.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.980
In fact, I have a
friend who has nicknamed

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.500
me Inquisitive Stephanie.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.380
And in my vast travels
around the world

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.810
I have asked a lot of people
the following question, who

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.790
inspires you?

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.960
And whenever someone answers
that question for me,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.250
I then followed up with, why?

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.560
And here's what I've discovered.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.080
Very often there are
different answers

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.010
for who inspires the
individuals I've encountered,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.970
but I've begun to notice
a trend, a theme, when

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.320
it comes to why certain
individuals inspire us.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.480
And as I have asked people
for the reasons for why

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.140
certain people inspire
them, what I've discovered

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.110
is it seems, generally, the
people who are inspiring

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.430
have suffered in some way or
they face some sort of obstacle

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.180
or some sort of challenge
or some sort of difficulty.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.190
And what sets them apart
from those who don't inspire

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.900
is how they respond to their
suffering, to the challenge,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.130
to the difficulty.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.020
And what I've
noticed, this trend,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.080
is that it seems inspiring
people in the face of obstacles

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.210
and suffering and
difficulty have at least

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.340
three qualities in common.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.160
They put others
ahead of themselves.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.100
They have perspective.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.630
And they do the right
thing, even when it's hard.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.760
They do the right thing,
even when it's hard.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.220
And so what I wanted
to do today was look

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.760
at each of those
qualities in more detail

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.760
and relate them to the
very controversial topic

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.810
of abortion.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.670
And in particular, I
want to share with you

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.970
various conversations
and encounters

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.460
I have had with people of
all different backgrounds

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.860
and viewpoints when
it comes to abortion,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.210
and how I have been able to
use those three qualities

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.840
and show how they align very
much with the perspective

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.352
that I hold, which is
the pro-life perspective.

00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:37.060
When it comes to that
first quality, that

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.070
of putting others
ahead of ourselves,

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.340
I would suggest that
regardless of someone's

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.350
political persuasion love
is universally attractive.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.090
It is universally magnetic.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.620
And ultimately, that's what
putting others ahead of ourself

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.350
is.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.210
That's what love is.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.340
It's willing the other's good.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.440
And I would suggest
that again, regardless

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.500
of our political
persuasion, each individual

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.860
has a battle internally between
times where they put others

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.470
ahead of themselves and
times where they don't

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.570
put others ahead of themselves.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.859
I was once debating with a
college student in Florida

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.400
a few years ago,
and we were debating

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.600
on the topic of abortion.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.700
And in our conversation,
I'll admit,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.210
I was thinking to myself,
he sounds selfish.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.910
Now, perhaps I could identify
that so readily because I

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.754
knew that there were many
times I have been selfish.

00:04:27.754 --> 00:04:29.170
And in fact, I can
think of a time

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.420
recently on one of
my frequent flights.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.990
I had settled into my seat and
there was one empty seat next

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.150
to me, and sure enough
that passenger came along

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.260
to sit down.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.850
And as she was
coming down the aisle

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.710
she was talking
with someone else

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.517
and it was very clear that
they were traveling together.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:46.600
And it was very clear that
the person she was with

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.850
was further at the back of
the plane and this thought

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.260
entered my head.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.989
I should offer my seat.

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:52.780
That would be nice.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.710
I'm traveling alone.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.450
I can take her
friend's seat so they

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.600
can sit next to each other.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.690
But then I thought
to myself, I don't

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.270
like sitting near
the back of the plane

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.250
and I don't feel
like getting up,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.029
and so I didn't offer my seat.

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.570
And I have to admit,
later that day I

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.300
was kind of reflecting
on my day and I

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.692
regretted that decision
of inaction and I thought,

00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:15.400
that was selfish.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.830
And my overarching
thought was, if I

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.590
move how will this impact me?

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.310
That's self-interested.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.950
Instead of, if I move how
will this impact them.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.950
That's other-oriented.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.980
So I recognize that
weakness within me

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.900
and that that wasn't attractive.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.300
The attractive quality is the
one that is other-oriented.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.200
So I bring that up, taking
us now back to my encounter

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.450
with this college student,
talking about abortion

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.010
where he sounded selfish.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.510
And I was thinking
to myself, even

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.000
though I have made selfish
choices, even though he sounds

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.840
selfish, I believe deep down we
are all drawn to selflessness.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.610
How can I draw this out of him?

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.807
And besides loving questions,
I also love stories.

00:05:55.807 --> 00:05:57.640
And as it should happen,
as I was dialoguing

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.190
with this student, this
story came to my mind

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.720
that I had read
about in the news.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.050
The year was 2012 that this
student and I were talking,

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.760
and around that
time there had been

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.594
that Costa Concordia cruise
ship accident where the cruise

00:06:10.594 --> 00:06:12.010
ship had been
steered a little too

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.230
close to shore near an Italian
village and hit ground and sank

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.710
and people lost their lives.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.700
And so I said to this student
that I was dialoguing with,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.170
do you remember hearing
about that in the news?

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.430
He said, yes.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.480
And I said that made
international attention.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.080
And I said it drew international
attention not just because it

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.350
was a major passenger vehicle
that had an accident, not just

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.450
because people
died, but there was

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.140
another element to this
story that shocked people

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.130
around the world.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.158
Who remembers what it was?

00:06:45.158 --> 00:06:46.307
Anyone?

00:06:46.307 --> 00:06:47.390
The captain left the ship.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.015
And that's what the
student said to me.

00:06:49.015 --> 00:06:51.590
He answered my question about
this story by saying, well,

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.120
the captain abandoned ship.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.670
Now, apparently the captain
says that the ship fell over

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.930
and he fell into a boat.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.190
But the point was, the news
had been reporting it this way

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.020
and so the student
remembered that.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.680
So then I said to him, and
how did our world respond?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.360
Did our world respond
by saying, hey,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.020
that was a really brilliant
choice of that Captain?

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.270
Or did the world
respond by saying,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.930
how could he have done that?

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.720
And he said, well,
it was the latter.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.240
Our world was saddened
by that kind of reaction.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.920
So then I said,
let's contrast that

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.520
captain with another captain,
not of a cruise ship,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.750
but of an airplane.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.186
And I said to this
student, a few years ago--

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:31.310
now this was many years
ago now-- but back in 2012,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.384
a few years prior to
that in 2009 there

00:07:33.384 --> 00:07:35.300
had been a US airways
plane that had taken off

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.080
from LaGuardia, when my country
of Canada got in the way.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.257
We have this really
annoying Canadian geese,

00:07:41.257 --> 00:07:43.340
and I don't know if they
make their way down here,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.350
but they certainly made
their way to New York

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.630
and so there was a whole
flock of Canadian geese

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.640
that were flying around
the exact same flight

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.110
pattern as this
US airways flight.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.710
And so I said to this student,
as this plane was taking off

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.870
and these Canadian geese
we're flying nearby,

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.680
they got sucked into the
engines of the airplane

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.035
and it caused immediate
engine failure.

00:08:03.035 --> 00:08:04.910
Do you remember that,
I said to this student.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.260
He said, yes I do.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.470
I said the captain of that
airplane, Chesley Sullenberger,

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.810
realized that he needed
to make an emergency

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.180
landing because if he
didn't control the landing

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.600
the plane was going to crash
with the dual engine failure.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.726
And he realized he could
not get back to LaGuardia.

00:08:19.726 --> 00:08:22.224
He couldn't get to Teterboro
or any of the other surrounding

00:08:22.224 --> 00:08:23.930
airports, and so he
thought, I'm going

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.790
to try to do a water landing.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.270
And he managed to safely
land that US airways plane

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.190
on the Hudson River
in what became known

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.350
as the miracle on the Hudson.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.260
And I said to the student,
when that plane came to a stop

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.960
and everyone inside would
have gone to the nearest exit

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.230
to get off, that meant the
people at the back of the plane

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.975
would have gone
to the back exit.

00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:46.100
But one of the first people
to get to the back door

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.770
didn't realize that the
tail of the airplane

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.490
was tucked in the water, so when
they whipped that door open,

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.330
the Hudson River starts
flooding into this airplane.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.610
So I said to the
student, now everyone

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.460
is getting away from
the back of the plane

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.320
and they're escaping
out the middle doors

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.420
and the front doors,
and they're getting off.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:11.959
Except for one person,
Captain Chesley Sullenberger.

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:14.000
As everyone's getting off
and away from the back,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.340
he's staying on and
walking towards the back.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.220
And as water was filling the
cabin about to waist level,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.910
he walked the aisle not
just once, but twice,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.800
to make sure no one
was left on the plane.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.600
And he was the last
person to get off.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.720
What did our world say about
him, I asked this student.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.670
And he said, a hero.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.440
Correct, I said.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.820
Why?

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.460
And he said, well, because
he had dependent passengers

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.630
and he cared for them.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.800
He prioritized their need.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.981
He put them ahead of himself.

00:09:44.981 --> 00:09:47.480
And I said, do you think that's
an example we should follow?

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.340
He said, yes.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.600
And so I knew by his
reaction to that story

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.420
that he shared the view I
have, that even if we sometimes

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.000
fail in being
other-oriented, we know

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.340
that that's how we
ought to be, and that's

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.170
the example to follow.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.140
And so once we can
establish that,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.810
I then brought it back
to the topic of abortion

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.040
that we were debating.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.930
And I said, if you agree that
it was correct for the pilot

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.660
to put the passengers
ahead of himself,

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.660
to prioritize the needs
of his dependents,

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.550
then wouldn't it
follow that when

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.230
it comes to the
topic of abortion

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.830
in an unplanned pregnancy
that a pregnant woman ought

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.690
to prioritize the needs of her
dependent, her pre-born child,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.580
much like a passenger
in the airplane who's

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.010
in a vulnerable position
and needs someone who's

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.740
more skilled and older
and capable of helping

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.320
them to help them out?

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.659
Now some people respond
by saying, well, wait.

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:42.950
There's a big difference there.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.080
You're comparing
apples to oranges.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.000
The people getting
off of the airplane--

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.310
those passengers
were human beings.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.260
Embryos and fetuses aren't.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.840
So you can't make
that comparison.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.000
And I would suggest that that
comparison is valid or invalid

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.660
depending on, indeed, whether
embryos and fetuses are

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.000
human beings, like the
passengers on the airplane.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.550
And so in my work
I often wrestle

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.260
with that question
in conversations

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.440
with people, trying to
discern when does life begin.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.140
And a good question-- because,
remembering I love questions--

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.560
a good question that I'll
often ask people is this,

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.890
do you believe in human rights?

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.430
And I can tell you, I have asked
that question around the world,

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.800
and consistently I
get one answer, yes.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.870
And if someone believes in human
rights I then like to say, OK.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.530
Well, what about
this human's rights

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.440
in the case of this
seven-week embryo?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.770
Now sometimes people will look
at an image like that and say,

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.990
that's not a human.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.780
And if that's someone's
reaction then in conversation

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.360
I think rather than
preaching at an individual,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.840
a good strategy to take
is to just ask a question.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.550
And the question I like to
ask is, what are her parents?

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.030
Is the pregnant woman human?

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.350
Is her partner human?

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.950
If yes, wouldn't
it logically follow

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.499
that their offspring must
be of the same species?

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:13.290
So then someone might
object and say, well,

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:18.740
even if biologically that's
human, it's not alive.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.330
Well, I found myself
in a conversation

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.800
with another college
student a few years ago,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.010
and I asked him what he
thought about abortion.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.510
He said, I'm pro-choice.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.490
I said, why are you pro-choice?

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.010
And he said, well, because
the fetus isn't alive.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.170
And so I just asked
another question.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:38.060
If the fetus isn't alive, why
do you need to do an abortion?

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.540
And he stopped and he looked
at me and he said, huh.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.459
I'm going to talk to you.

00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:45.750
I never thought of it that way.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.990
And so we spent about
30 minutes engaging

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:52.640
in a friendly, civil dialogue
as a result of a question.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.670
If someone objects to the
idea that the embryo is alive,

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.670
I think another good
question to ask is this,

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.190
is the embryo growing?

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.690
At the moment of
fertilization, when

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.510
you have a one-celled embryo, is
that one cell growing into two,

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.399
and are those two growing
into four and eight and 16,

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:08.940
and so forth?

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.510
And if yes, wouldn't
it follow by virtue

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.410
of the embryo's growth,
the embryo must be living?

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.510
And if the embryo
has human parents,

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.290
wouldn't it follow by virtue of
that the embryo must be human?

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.370
And if we believe in human
rights then wouldn't it

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.050
follow what we
know to be a living

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.320
human has the same human
rights as you or me?

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.320
Now, someone might object
at that point and say,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.910
but it's just a fetus,
or it's just an embryo.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.940
And so I think a
good question to ask

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.610
that I've asked many people
is this, what kind of fetus?

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.020
If you think about that
term for a moment, fetus,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.880
that's not species-specific.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.990
So other species have fetuses.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.050
Dogs have fetuses,
dolphins have fetuses,

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.820
and humans have fetuses.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.630
So the word fetus
doesn't so much

00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:01.200
tell us what something is, but
tells us how old something is.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.820
So again, with my
love of questions,

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.860
I'll often ask people when a
fetus is born to human parents

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.130
and is in the arms of the
mother, what do we now

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.190
call the fetus at that moment?

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.820
And people will
say, well, a baby.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.281
And then when the baby turns
two, what do we call the baby,

00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:17.780
I'll ask.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.950
And, toddler, is
what people say.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.930
And then when the
toddler turns 13,

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.532
what do we call the toddler?

00:14:23.532 --> 00:14:25.740
I was once giving a talk--
an elderly woman piped up,

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.070
impossible.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.800
That's what we call
that individual.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.610
[CHUCKLES]

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.120
And then when impossible turns
21, what do we call impossible?

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.340
Even more impossible, right?

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.010
So the point is,
that we humans have

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.910
words to refer to age
ranges within our species.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:48.420
And so the words adult or
teenager, toddler, baby, fetus,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.670
and embryo simply tell
us how old an entity is,

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.050
not what an entity is.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.730
If we want to know
what that entity is,

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.190
we have to ask what
are the parents.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.130
Now, when it comes to the
abortion debate, one thing

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.640
that I have found that
provokes a lot of conversation

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.020
is defining the exact moment the
fetus or the embryo came to be.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.020
And a lot of times
we, as a culture,

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.670
will resist the idea that,
when debating abortion,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.070
that life would begin
at fertilization.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.660
And so what I'd
like to suggest is

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.980
that, if we weren't talking
about abortion, we as a society

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.620
would more readily accept that
life begins at fertilization.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.470
In fact, we already do.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.680
And a good question to consider
involves this, the following.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.890
Imagine someone is not pregnant
with an unwanted pregnancy.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.300
Imagine they're trying
to achieve a pregnancy.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.730
They desperately
want to be pregnant,

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.870
but they're struggling
with infertility.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.980
So imagine this person goes
to an infertility specialist,

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.870
and that physician recommends
in-vitro fertilization, or IVF,

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:59.310
where an egg will be fertilized
by a sperm in a Petri dish

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.120
in a lab.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.710
Now, setting aside
the ethics of that,

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.910
which could be a whole
other talk at Google--

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.780
setting aside the
ethics of that,

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.150
imagine the individual then
goes to an IVF specialist.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.800
Have we as a society
ever heard someone

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.040
who's in the business of making
life, someone who is an IVF

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.620
specialist, have we
ever heard them say,

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.630
I just don't know
when life begins.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.160
If you think about
it, when someone

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.770
is in the business
of making life

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.520
we never claim to not
know when it begins.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.110
We know exactly when it begins.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.930
The one moment that
the IVF specialist

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.990
is trying to
replicate in the lab

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.420
is the moment of fertilization.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.670
The IVF specialist is not
happy with just a sperm.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.430
Sample they're not happy
with eggs harvested

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.280
by perhaps a student
in debt trying

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.610
to get $10,000 or $20,000
for such a procedure.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.207
They're not satisfied with just
the eggs or just the sperm.

00:16:51.207 --> 00:16:53.290
The one moment they're
trying to create in the lab

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.600
is not three weeks
where you have

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.250
a heartbeat or six
weeks where you

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.880
have brain waves or a
nine-month gestated fetus.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.220
The one moment
the IVF specialist

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.640
is trying to create in
the lab is the moment

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.520
of fertilization,
which I think tells us

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.530
we do know when life begins.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.800
We know it begins
there, particularly when

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.310
we think about other species,
a little less-controversial

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.550
than our own.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.960
We never hear
horse breeders say,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.609
I just don't know
how to breed a horse.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.760
I don't know when a horse
becomes a horse, or someone

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.790
who's breeding dogs or a
veterinarian in general saying,

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.380
I don't know when a
dog becomes a dog.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.930
With other species we
have great clarity.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.300
So why with our own species,
when it comes to abortion,

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.300
do we claim to not know
when life begins or we

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.080
claim that it's confusing
when, with these other species

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.050
or this other topic like
IVF, we have great clarity?

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.060
And we know that moment
to be fertilization.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.550
When it comes to the
debate about abortion,

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.940
what I have found in debating
people formally and informally

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.800
all over the world is that it's
less of a scientific debate

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.110
and more of a philosophical one.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.350
Less a question of, when does
life begin because really we

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.930
know the answer to
that, fertilization,

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.630
but more of a question
about personhood,

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.330
which is not really a
scientific discussion

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.250
but a philosophical one.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.130
And there's a whole school of
thought by a philosopher, Peter

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.280
Singer, from Princeton
University, who

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.770
argues abortion is justified.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.100
And even argues some
infanticide would be justified.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.530
His school of thought
comes from the perspective

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.540
of a definition of personhood
that would exclude pre-born

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.580
and some born children.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.930
And he would say a person
is someone who is rational,

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.870
conscious, and self-aware.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.510
And so I have encountered
people, and perhaps some

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.580
in the room today,
some listening in,

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.070
who would argue that
even if biologically

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.440
the embryo and the
fetus are human,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.870
that philosophically
they are not persons

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.750
and that's why we
could justify abortion.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.820
That's why we wouldn't
have to protect

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.350
embryos and fetuses
the way it was

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.870
good for Captain
Sullenberger to protect

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.430
the passengers on the airplane.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.976
Because they're people but
embryos and fetuses aren't.

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:06.600
So then the question
we have to wrestle

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.530
with is, what is the right
definition of a person?

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.570
Is a person someone who
is rational, conscious,

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:16.950
and self-aware, so that
if you're not those things

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.110
you're not a person?

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.420
Well, what I like to
do is ask the question,

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.385
why isn't, let's say, a
one-celled human embryo,

00:19:25.385 --> 00:19:26.970
at fertilization--

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.822
why isn't that embryo rational,
conscious, or self aware?

00:19:30.822 --> 00:19:32.280
I think we know
the answer to that,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.130
is, well, the embryo is lacking
the organ necessary to be

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.630
rational, conscious,
and self-aware,

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.595
and that's the brain.

00:19:37.595 --> 00:19:39.720
So then if we step back
for a moment and say, well,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.906
why doesn't the embryo at
fertilization have a brain?

00:19:43.906 --> 00:19:45.030
We know the answer to that.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.800
Well, the embryo hasn't had
time to develop the brain.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.190
And time is
reflected in our age.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.740
So the one-celled
human embryo, yes,

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.410
isn't rational, conscious,
or self-aware in that moment,

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.830
but ultimately isn't
able to do those things

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.820
or be that way because
of how old she is.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.160
Now, let's contrast that
with, let's say, an amoeba.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.400
An amoeba is not rational,
conscious, or self-aware.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.510
Why?

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.640
Well, because the amoeba
doesn't have a brain.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.890
Well, why doesn't the
amoeba have a brain?

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.410
Not because it hasn't
developed it yet,

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.950
but because it's not within
its nature to develop a brain.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.520
Because it's not within its
nature to be a thinking thing.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.910
So in other words, an amoeba
is not rational, conscious,

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:35.590
or self-aware because of what
it is versus a human embryo who

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.450
is not rational,
conscious, or self-aware

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:41.740
because of how old she is.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.680
So then that brings me
back to the question

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.180
about human rights.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.490
Who gets human rights?

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.820
Isn't the necessary
criteria simply being human?

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.160
If we were talking, for
example, about women's rights,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.993
the necessary criteria
for getting the right

00:20:55.993 --> 00:20:57.270
would be being a woman.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.020
If we were to talk
about children's rights

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.600
the necessary criteria
would be being a child.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.160
So when we talk
about human rights,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.300
the necessary criteria simply
is being human, not being human

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.040
in a certain age.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.110
And so the question
is, should personhood

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.740
be grounded in how old we
are, or should personhood

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.360
be grounded in what we are?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.280
Well, to answer
that question I find

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.570
it helpful to go to
the United Nations.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.310
United Nations has a number
of different documents

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.414
on human rights.

00:21:26.414 --> 00:21:27.830
And as I have read
these I've been

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.080
astounded by several things
that have stood out to me.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.810
The first is that, in
the Universal Declaration

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.250
of Human Rights--

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.620
that is a document by
the United Nations--

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.580
it very clearly says, all
members of the human family

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.110
have the right to life.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.500
So in other words, to
get the right to life

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.860
all that matters is that you're
a member of the human family.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.340
But that document does
reference persons.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.240
And it references
persons in Article VI.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.760
And in Article VI of the
Universal Declaration

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.370
of Human Rights,
it says, everyone

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:05.780
has a right to recognition
everywhere as a person

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.812
before the law.

00:22:07.812 --> 00:22:09.020
Well, let's define our terms.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.250
Who's everyone?

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.960
Earlier in the document,
in the preamble,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.000
"everyone" is defined as "all
members of the human family."

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.760
So this document is
essentially declaring,

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.810
if you're a member of the human
family you should automatically

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.730
be considered a person.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.780
To understand why the
UN would say that,

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.040
I think we need to put
that document into context

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.680
and understand the history
of how it came to be.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.600
The Universal Declaration
of Human Rights

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.620
was adopted in the late 1940s.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.740
Of course, we know
in the early 1940s

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.620
we had the Holocaust
where-- what happened?

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:45.480
Some humans were deprived
of personhood status

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.270
based on some feature about
them, ethnicity, religion,

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.450
sexual orientation.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.422
And so the UN comes
up with this document

00:22:53.422 --> 00:22:55.380
to say, no, the one thing
we all have in common

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.670
is our human nature.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.130
And to ensure that
we don't repeat

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:02.190
the injustices of the
past, it codifies,

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.980
it puts in writing,
this idea that if you're

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.650
a member of the human family
you ought to automatically

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.390
be considered a person
and you should not

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.730
be deprived of your
personhood rights

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.740
based on some quality like
ethnicity, religion, sexual

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.370
orientation.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.962
And in the same
way, if that's true,

00:23:20.962 --> 00:23:22.420
then we ought to
say the same thing

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.510
about what we know to be a
human embryo and a human fetus.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.350
The quality of age shouldn't
be the basis for which someone

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.290
has personhood status,
and therefore they

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.060
ought to be considered
persons according

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.760
to Article VI by
virtue of being human,

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.520
not by virtue of being a
certain age that enables them

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.070
as a result of their age
to be rational, conscious,

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.590
and self-aware in that moment.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.260
Their humanity is
what is consistent

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.980
as their age, and therefore
abilities, change.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.106
If you think about the question,
when do we become persons,

00:23:54.106 --> 00:23:55.480
I think what's
helpful is to look

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.640
at the timeline from the
moment of fertilization

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.320
to the moment of birth.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:04.990
And if we draw the line
anywhere after fertilization,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:10.390
we're ultimately basing it
based on a developmental stage,

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.900
or based on an age, which would
fly in the face of human rights

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.320
doctrines, which aren't to
acknowledge human rights based

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.460
on abilities or age, but instead
acknowledge human rights based

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.390
on being human.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.250
And we know at the
moment of fertilization,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.910
the one-celled embryo has
all the genetic material

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.784
distinguishing her from
the mother and the father,

00:24:30.784 --> 00:24:32.200
and from that point
forward you're

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.340
going to change your
appearance, you're

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.923
going to change your
abilities, you're

00:24:34.923 --> 00:24:37.030
going to change your age,
but your human identity

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.830
distinguishing you
from everyone else

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:42.660
is going to be what
remains the same.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.190
As I have dialogued
with a lot of people

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.230
over the years, not
only have I found

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.980
the question of personhood
being raised in conversation,

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:55.750
but I have also found the
question of the dependency

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.904
of the pre-born child being used
as grounds to justify abortion,

00:24:59.904 --> 00:25:02.320
where some people will say,
look, if someone has an infant

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.600
and they don't want the
infant, any of us in the room

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.550
are capable of caring
for the infant.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.500
But if someone doesn't
want their fetus,

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.600
none of us in the room
are capable of caring

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.800
for the fetus.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.957
Therefore, a woman should have
a right to have an abortion.

00:25:15.957 --> 00:25:17.540
When I hear that
argument what crosses

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:23.780
my mind is, does the greater
dependency of the fetus

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:31.020
make the mother less
responsible or more responsible?

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.720
Well, I found myself
in conversation

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.840
a few years ago with
a different student,

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.280
and this young woman
said to me, look,

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.740
if you have a baby in one hand
and a fetus in the other hand,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.560
you obviously pick the baby.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.440
And I thought to
myself for a moment

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.607
about babies versus fetuses.

00:25:48.607 --> 00:25:50.189
As I just said a
moment ago, you know,

00:25:50.189 --> 00:25:52.120
if there was a baby
in this room napping

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.610
we could all leave and come
back and the baby would be fine.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.660
But if there was a fetus
left out on the podium here

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.580
and we all leave and come back,
the fetus is going to be dead.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.510
So I thought, in a sense,
babies are stronger

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.280
and fetuses are weaker in
relation to each other.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.070
So I thought, what
this student actually

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.830
said to me, although she
didn't verbalize it, was this.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.300
If you have a strong
person in one hand

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.660
and you have a weaker
person in the other hand,

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.400
you obviously pick
the stronger person.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.430
And when it kind of
translated in my mind what

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.320
she'd said to that,
I thought to myself,

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.180
civil societies actually
do just the opposite.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.021
We tend to prioritize weaker
people rather than stronger

00:26:31.021 --> 00:26:31.520
people.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.540
Again, the captain prioritizes
the passengers, or ought to,

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.550
and so forth.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.610
And so I thought to myself,
how do I communicate

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.770
that I think civil
societies actually

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.259
would prioritize weaker people
ahead of stronger people?

00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:47.300
And as it should happen,
a story came to my mind.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.580
And again, as I said,
I love telling stories.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.027
And the story that came to
my mind relates to this.

00:26:53.027 --> 00:26:54.860
And so I said to this
student, what you just

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.900
said about babies versus
fetuses reminds me of a picture

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.110
my friend posted on Facebook.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.717
And I said, it was a
picture of a river,

00:27:02.717 --> 00:27:04.550
and in the middle of
the river was something

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.500
slightly curvy sticking up.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.630
And, in reality, it
was the kind of picture

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.340
that I would keep
swiping away if it

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.170
hadn't been for the caption.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.230
And the caption my friend posted
with this picture was this,

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.320
my husband is a hero.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.120
And then my friend
went on to explain why,

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.500
as I then explained
to this student.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.040
My friend wrote, my
husband is a paramedic

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.300
and at midnight he was called
to the scene of a car accident.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.400
A woman had been
driving down the road.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.220
She lost control of her vehicle,
and as it spun out of control

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.220
it landed in a nearby river.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.260
When my friend's
husband got to the scene

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.030
he saw that that
woman driver was

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.970
sitting on the roof
of her sinking car,

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:48.250
holding her 10-month-old
baby in her arms.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.070
My friend's husband jumps in
the water, swims towards the car

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.340
and then realizes he
can only take one person

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.916
at a time to shore.

00:27:56.916 --> 00:27:58.790
I looked at the student
I was dialoguing with

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.810
and I asked her a question.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.369
Who do you think
he picked first?

00:28:03.369 --> 00:28:04.660
Obviously, she knew the answer.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.340
Well, the baby.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.690
Correct, I said.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.736
Why?

00:28:08.736 --> 00:28:10.360
If you had to explain
the reasoning why

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.812
he picked the baby over
the mom to take first,

00:28:12.812 --> 00:28:13.520
what would it be?

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.145
She said, well,
obviously because if he

00:28:15.145 --> 00:28:16.780
pick the mom first
then by the time

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.238
he got back the car the baby
could have rolled in the water

00:28:19.238 --> 00:28:19.810
and drowned.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:20.560
Correct, I said.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.760
So would you say it's fair
to summarize your response

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.550
to this story by acknowledging
that you believe when you

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.170
have a strong
person in one hand,

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.050
like the mom, and a weaker
person in the other hand,

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.901
like the baby, that we ought to
prioritize the needs of weaker

00:28:35.901 --> 00:28:36.400
people?

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.960
She said, of course.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.060
And then I brought it
back to her original point

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.740
about babies versus fetus.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.260
And I said, anyone could care
for a baby and a baby could be

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.380
left alone for a while, but
only one person could care

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.450
for a fetus and
cannot be left alone.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.900
So, in a sense, the
baby is stronger,

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.720
like the mom in the story,
whereas the fetus is weaker,

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.490
like the infant
in the mom's arms.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.480
And since you believe
that we should prioritize

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.450
weaker and more vulnerable
people ahead of stronger

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:09.800
people, then shouldn't we
actually prioritize the needs

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.040
of the pre-born child?

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.600
That point was something that
was emphasized very clearly

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.260
in a different encounter that
I had through what someone

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.970
shared with me.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.690
I was once at an
exhibit that was looking

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.350
at parallels between
historical injustices

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.510
and present-day injustices.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:38.030
One of the parallels being the
Rwandan genocide and abortion.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:42.350
The argument being that,
at the time the Tutsis were

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.990
slaughtered they
weren't deemed to be

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:49.550
equal to the Hutu extremists,
but rather inferior.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.230
And because they were
deemed to be inferior,

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.670
the dehumanizing
actions were justified.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.610
The parallel then being
that someone generally

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.680
who supports abortion
does not say,

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.790
I think embryos and fetuses are
equal to us and I want to kill.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.910
Not at all.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:09.140
But instead, deem the embryo
and fetus to be inferior,

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.360
and therefore
rationalizes actions

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.890
which would take away
that human's rights

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.680
because they don't
consider them equal.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.110
The argument then being, if
we were wrong in the past

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.480
about dehumanizing
one group of humans,

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.880
could we be wrong in the
present about dehumanizing

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.260
another group of humans?

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.270
So one of the signs
at this exhibit that I

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.940
was standing with was this one.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.950
And a woman came
past and stopped

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.080
and began to speak with
me, and she told me

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.600
that she was from Rwanda.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.640
And she told me that
most of her family

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.610
had been killed in the
genocide from the mid '90s.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:45.830
And I will admit, I became
very self-conscious standing,

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.020
representing this
sign, because I

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.570
began to wonder if
perhaps this woman would

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:54.650
be offended by the
comparison that I was making.

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.840
But instead of
assuming and wondering,

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.580
I thought the best
thing I can do

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.742
is seek to understand
and ask her a question.

00:31:01.742 --> 00:31:03.200
And so I looked at
this woman and I

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.710
said, given all you have
told me about the brutality

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:11.270
that your family
members were victims of,

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.640
what you just barely
escaped by fleeing

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.200
the country before things got
really bad, how do you feel,

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.190
I said, about this
comparison I'm making?

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.310
And she stepped back and she
moved her gaze really from me--

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.560
she hadn't really looked
that closely at the picture--

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.010
and then she just stood in
silence for about 20 seconds

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:34.370
as she looked at this poster.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.800
And then finally she
pointed to the picture

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:43.270
of the aborted child and
she said, that's worse.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:47.980
Because at least my family
could try to run away.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.390
This woman recognized
the greater

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:58.840
a human's vulnerability,
the greater another's

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:04.040
responsibility towards
that individual.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.250
So if we think about
that, that first quality

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:10.870
that I have identified, that
inspiring people seem to have,

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.160
that people I've dialogued
with have shared with me,

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.392
it is the idea that we ought to
put others ahead of ourselves.

00:32:17.392 --> 00:32:19.600
Even when we've failed, we
know deep down that that's

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.850
something to aspire towards.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.390
And it's clear that the
human embryo and fetus

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.530
are an other just like the
passengers in the airplane.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.960
The next point that I
wanted to address today

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.580
is the second
quality I have found

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.350
in inspiring people, which is
that they have perspective.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:41.620
One of my favorite authors
is Dr. Victor Frankel,

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.190
who has written the book,
"Man's Search for Meaning."

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.700
I love books and I love
gifting books to other people.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.970
And "Man's Search for
Meaning" is probably one--

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:56.090
the leading book that I have
given to a lot of people.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.496
The other one would be
"Essentialism" by Greg McKeown,

00:32:58.496 --> 00:32:59.620
which is a phenomenal book.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.580
But not what I'm here
to talk about right now.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.038
But "Man's Search
for Meaning" I've

00:33:03.038 --> 00:33:04.630
given away to so many people.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:08.950
And this book was written
by a man who was a Holocaust

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:11.680
survivor and a psychiatrist.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.330
And so "Man's
Search for Meaning"

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.560
is really a two-part book.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.300
The first part is
about his experiences

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.300
in the concentration camps,
and the second part of his book

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.182
is his theories in psychology.

00:33:21.182 --> 00:33:23.140
And one of the points
that he makes in his book

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:23.848
is the following.

00:33:23.848 --> 00:33:26.244
He said that he observed
both as a prisoner

00:33:26.244 --> 00:33:27.910
and as a psychiatrist--
who, in a sense,

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.880
as a prisoner was studying
human behavior as he

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.580
was being victimized in
the concentration camps.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.160
One of the things he observed
is that, he would have expected

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.840
all of the guards to be cruel.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.580
And most of them were.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.580
But he said every now
and then, surprisingly,

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:47.200
amidst all the cruel guards
there was someone who was kind.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.340
And then he said,
amongst the prisoners

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.480
there were some who, when
treated like animals,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.060
became like animals
and were cruel

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.070
to their fellow prisoners.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:01.210
But there were others, he said,
regardless of how brutally they

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.550
were treated, maintained
their humanity,

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:07.360
and in their starving state
would save morsels of food

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.690
not for themselves but
for a fellow prisoner.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.420
And when Dr. Frankel
makes this observation

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.300
it draws him to this conclusion.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.659
Someone can have a
similar experience

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:26.360
but still choose a different
response to the experience.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.060
And he says, the last of the
human freedoms that can never

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:35.179
be taken from us is the freedom
to choose how to respond

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:38.989
to the situation that we're in.

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:40.850
That is what perspective is.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.739
Inspiring people
who have perspective

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.659
can be in a horrible
circumstance,

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:48.080
in a sense beyond their
control, but they recognize

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.330
what is still
within their control

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:53.270
is their response to
that circumstance,

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.650
is their attitude.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:59.060
And Dr. Frankel has come up
with a mathematical equation

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.570
that explains the
power of perspective.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.490
Because in the
concentration camps

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.980
he saw a lot of
suffering, suffering

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.100
that was so bad that some
people sought to commit suicide

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.630
because they despaired.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.540
And Dr. Frankel said,
early on in his time

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.580
at the concentration
camps he decided

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.200
he would never kill himself.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.300
Moreover, would he
not commit suicide,

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.060
but he was going to try to
dissuade his fellow prisoners

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.020
from doing that.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:29.110
And he discovered the way to try
to convince them not to despair

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.510
was to help them find meaning.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.320
And so his mathematical
equation was this.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:41.290
D equals S, minus M. Despair
is suffering without meaning.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:44.110
He recognized, in the present
circumstances removing

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:47.860
the suffering was
near impossible,

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.850
but he could decrease
despair to the extent

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.820
that he increased meaning.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.850
And Dr. Frankel, years after
coming out of the concentration

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.450
camps, cites an example where
this equation, in a sense,

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.480
was brought to life
with a young teenager he

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.422
learned about in Texas who
had become a quadriplegic.

00:36:08.422 --> 00:36:10.510
A lot of times when
people are asked,

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:13.330
imagine if you were
suddenly paralyzed,

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:14.770
would you want to keep living?

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.700
And when we're not in that
state we think, no, I wouldn't.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.220
Well, Dr. Frankel cites
an example of someone

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.110
who found herself
not being asked

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.360
that question in a hypothetical,
but that was reality.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.280
She became quadriplegic.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.910
She would spend her
days watching the news,

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:32.860
reading the news,
and whenever she

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.330
came across a story
of someone who

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.910
was going through a very
difficult time, of someone who

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:38.950
was suffering in
some way, she would

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.650
ask an assistant
to bring a stick

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.670
and place it in her mouth.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.360
She would then use
that stick, bend over

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:51.100
to press keys on a keyboard
so she could write letters

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:56.460
of encouragement to the people
she'd read about in the news.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:03.120
And Dr. Frankel said her life
is filled with an abundant sense

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.660
of meaning.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.820
We decrease despair
in the presence

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.840
of suffering to the extent
we increase meaning.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.350
That's what I mean
by perspective.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.440
I saw the power of perspective
up close and personally

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.330
a few years ago when
I had the privilege

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.330
of spending an afternoon with
this young man, Nick Vujicic.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.570
How many of you have heard
of this motivational speaker?

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:32.046
I did a quick Google search
as to whether you had a "Talks

00:37:32.046 --> 00:37:34.420
at Google" with Nick Vujicic,
and I don't think you have,

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.710
so I highly recommend it.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.192
This guy's hilarious.

00:37:37.192 --> 00:37:38.650
So, it helps that
he has an accent.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:39.483
He's from Australia.

00:37:39.483 --> 00:37:41.320
I just think accents are cool.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.820
But he's really funny.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.790
So anyways, I know someone who
knows someone who knows Nick.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.820
And he was coming
to the city I used

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.340
to live in Canada, in
Calgary, and so I thought,

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.210
I got to try to meet this guy
because I talk about his story

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.270
so often.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.120
So, sure enough, he
was willing to meet

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.620
with me and my colleagues and
we surprised my colleagues

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.120
with him.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.620
They didn't know
that he was coming,

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:04.880
and they all knew his story.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.600
So when he came to the
office they were shocked.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.670
Like they were like, no way!

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:10.490
This isn't you!

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:11.823
And then Nick looks at everyone.

00:38:11.823 --> 00:38:13.270
He goes, I'm not Nick Vujicic.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.642
I'm his stunt double.

00:38:14.642 --> 00:38:15.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.090
So anyways, Nick is a funny guy.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.680
He lives a full life.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.050
He loves traveling the world,
speaking to millions of people,

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.140
and inspiring them,
getting access to audiences

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.380
I could only dream
of getting access to.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.140
And it's because of
what he doesn't have.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.880
It's because of
his lack of limbs.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.180
He looks at this disability
as an opportunity.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.180
But he didn't always
have that attitude.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.310
He didn't always have
that perspective.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:47.180
When Nick was a child he was
bullied and taunted and made

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:51.320
fun of so much that one night
while lying in the family

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.380
bathtub he thought about rolling
over and drowning himself

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.080
in an act of suicide.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.600
Now, he obviously
didn't do that.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.670
But what's also obvious
is that his circumstances

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:03.170
didn't change.

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.690
He still lacks the limbs now
that he locked in that bathtub.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.660
So what's changed?

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.610
His perspective.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.920
Instead of thinking about
what his lack of limbs

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.110
prevents him from
doing, he started

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:20.015
to think about what his lack
of limbs enabled him to do.

00:39:20.015 --> 00:39:22.520
In the afternoon
I spent with him

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.540
I spent also with another
family he had invited along,

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.590
and that family included
this 2-year-old girl, Brooke.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.880
And, as you can see,
Brooke doesn't have arms.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.000
Nick's lack of limbs was
not diagnosed in utero

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.150
by ultrasound.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:41.410
It was only discovered
when he was born.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:42.820
Brooke's lack of limbs--

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.690
or her lack of arms--
on the other hand,

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.970
was discovered while her mom
was pregnant via ultrasound,

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.220
and when the mom went
for a routine ultrasound

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.670
and they saw the fetus
didn't have arms,

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:58.190
the doctors offered
to do an abortion.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.330
Brooke's parents said no.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.830
They didn't have a smartphone
at the time, so they went home

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.550
and where do you
think they went?

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.882
Google.

00:40:06.882 --> 00:40:08.340
I've told this
story so much, but I

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.750
have to say, I've never
told it at Google,

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:10.770
so I think that's really cool.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:11.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:15.780
So they went on to Google and
they typed, "no arms," Enter.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.460
And the first hit
was Nick Vujicic.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.980
And they spent the
rest of that pregnancy

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.580
looking at videos of someone
who was like their daughter.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.526
And then an opportunity came,
two years after she was born,

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.650
for them to drive eight
hours through the mountains

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.170
from British Columbia to
Alberta in Western Canada

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:38.150
to see in the flesh someone
who looked like their daughter.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.880
And when I saw Nick and
Brooke interact I thought,

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.090
he is uniquely positioned
to motivate and inspire

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.270
Brooke in a way
her parents can't,

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:49.730
in a way her sister
can't, in a way none of us

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:54.530
could and it's because
of what he doesn't have.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:58.070
His obstacle is now
his opportunity.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.140
That's the power of perspective.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.530
I think that can be,
then, obviously related

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.390
to the abortion discussion.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.670
How can we change
our perspective

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:11.930
in an unplanned
crisis situation?

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.850
In another occasion
where I was on a college

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:15.891
campus a student came to
the microphone and said,

00:41:15.891 --> 00:41:18.050
my step mom had an
abortion because she

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:21.460
was told her fetus was
going to die at birth.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.020
Are you telling
me she was wrong?

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.520
And I first expressed
sympathy to the student

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.220
saying that I was
sorry for the suffering

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.580
that his step-mom went through
and I don't pretend to know

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.530
what that must have been like.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.555
And I said to him, your
question is a fair one,

00:41:37.555 --> 00:41:38.680
and I'm going to answer it.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.138
But I said, if
you'll bear with me,

00:41:40.138 --> 00:41:43.510
I believe I can best address
your question by engaging you

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.270
in a dialogue, by asking
you some questions.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.040
Would that be OK?

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.690
He said sure.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:50.500
I said, OK.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.420
Well, the question I
have for you actually

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.100
involves setting
aside the abortion

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.200
topic for just a
moment and entering

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.330
into a thought experiment.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.190
I said, I want you to
imagine that someone

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:05.380
you love dearly on the opposite
end of the country calls you--

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.800
calls you today and says, I've
just been diagnosed with cancer

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.574
and I've been given
four weeks left to live.

00:42:13.574 --> 00:42:15.490
I looked at this student
and I said, would you

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:19.540
wait until week three,
day six, to hop on a plane

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.150
and go say goodbye to
the person you love?

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:26.710
Or, I said, would you take
the next flight out and savor

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.130
every moment of every day of the
next four weeks with the person

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:31.890
you love?

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.620
And he said, well,
the second option.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.520
I said, me too.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.076
And here's what I think
this says about us.

00:42:38.076 --> 00:42:39.450
What I think it
says about us is,

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.480
we recognize when we have
a minimal amount of time

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.000
left with someone
we love, we want

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.390
to maximize the minimal time.

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:52.200
We don't want to cut short the
already short time we have.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.650
That's perspective.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:56.140
So I said, let's take that
principle, that perspective,

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.431
and let's apply it to the
situation your step-mom found

00:42:58.431 --> 00:42:59.070
herself in.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.230
Before that poor
prenatal diagnosis,

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:06.135
she probably thought she
had 50 years with her child.

00:43:06.135 --> 00:43:07.760
And in one moment of
hearing that news,

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.176
your baby's going
to die at birth,

00:43:09.176 --> 00:43:13.200
she went from having 50
years to roughly 20 weeks.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.030
I said, based on your analysis
of the thought experiment,

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:19.290
why would we cut short
the already short time

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:20.930
we have left?

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.470
Instead, wouldn't
we want to savor

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:26.820
every moment of every day of
the next 20 weeks with the child

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.250
that we love?

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:31.910
Now, upon the birth happening
and the child dying,

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.860
would there be sorrow, grief?

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.570
Absolutely.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:40.360
But if you have the abortion
and you wanted to be pregnant,

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.450
would there be sorrow and grief?

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.920
Yes.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.070
So having the abortion instead
of carrying on 20 more weeks

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.260
is not going to spare sadness.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.220
But it will rob you
of the gift of time.

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.670
And that's, again, where we
want the power of perspective.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.460
The final point that I wanted
to address this morning

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.670
was that quality
of inspiring people

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:08.050
which is to do the right
thing, even when it's hard.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:11.390
If you think about it, that
fits with your code of conduct.

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:13.510
I know you have a slogan
here of "don't be evil,"

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:16.450
and when Alphabet came to
be it got a little broader,

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:18.610
to do the right thing.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.980
But we know that we
should do the right thing,

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.520
even when it's hard.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.890
And I think that's relevant
in the abortion discussion

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.050
if we think for a moment
about the circumstances

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.637
that a pregnant
woman could be in.

00:44:31.637 --> 00:44:33.220
And if we think about
the reasons that

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.928
would prompt someone
to have an abortion,

00:44:34.928 --> 00:44:37.210
we can acknowledge this is hard.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:41.170
Imagine being pregnant from
rape, being in poverty,

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:45.220
having health problems,
just not wanting the child,

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.710
or being really young,
having no support.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:51.310
In each of these
situations, wherever

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.830
someone sits on the abortion
debate, what side of the fence

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:56.440
they're on, there's
agreement, to be pregnant

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.600
and poor would be hard.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.570
To be pregnant and
young would be hard.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:06.760
To be pregnant from rape would
be excruciatingly difficult.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.300
There's no denying
the difficulty

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.560
in these circumstances.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:17.470
The question is, what ought we
do when circumstances are hard?

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.550
Well, let's imagine the
circumstances are these,

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.550
but not with a pregnant
person but someone who's

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.770
parenting this born child.

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:27.250
Would it be easy or hard to take
care of this child in poverty?

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:28.150
Hard.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:32.840
Would be easy or hard to care
for this child and be 14?

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.310
Hard.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.430
Would it be easy or hard
to parent this child,

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.050
knowing every day
you look in her face

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:42.180
you're reminded her
father was a rapist?

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.440
It would be hard.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.890
Would we ever allow someone
to end this child's life

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:52.000
because the circumstances
for the parent are hard?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.560
We wouldn't.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.800
We would say we need to do the
right thing, even when it's

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.060
hard.

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.370
And so I would suggest,
in the various encounters

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.490
I've had that we have
the same attitude when

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:05.650
it comes to this
life, since we know

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:09.370
this is a living human being
who, according to Article

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.440
VI of the UN, ought to be
considered a person who's

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.744
simply younger than
the rest of us.

00:46:14.744 --> 00:46:16.660
And since human rights
aren't grounded in age,

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.460
they're grounded in
being human, then

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.170
we ought to say here
as we say there,

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:25.260
we have to do the right
thing, even when it's hard.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.630
And that brings to mind
several people I've

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:31.740
had the privilege of meeting
who I believe, by their stories,

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.620
have inspired me to do
the right thing when

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.710
it's hard in my own life the
way they've done that in theirs.

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.690
A few months ago I
spoke in Guatemala

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:42.840
and I spoke alongside
another speaker, my friend

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.550
here, Lianna.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:46.840
Lianna and I met for the
first time in Guatemala.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:47.970
She speaks both Spin--

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:48.470
Spinglish.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.970
[CHUCKLING] She speaks
English and Spanish.

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.740
I, on the other hand,
only speak English

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.020
and so I had a
translator translate

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.460
for the audience my talk.

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.020
But because she
spoke in Spanish that

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.480
meant when she gave her talk
I couldn't understand it.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.640
So it wasn't until we
got to the restaurant

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.740
after giving our
first presentation

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.624
in the hotel we
were staying in that

00:47:06.624 --> 00:47:08.040
evening that we
shared our stories

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.640
and got to know each other.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.310
And as we were talking she
mentioned that she was 37.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:14.480
And I said, no way, I'm 36.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.230
And then a short while
later she mentioned

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:17.240
that she had a daughter.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.031
And I said, well, how
old is your daughter?

00:47:19.031 --> 00:47:21.870
And she said, 25.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.710
And then I did the math
and I thought, 25 years ago

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:30.690
I was 11, which means 25
years ago Lianna was 12.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.580
And Leanna told me her
story, that growing up

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:36.630
in Mexico City, when she was 12
one day two men kidnapped her,

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.630
held her for two days,
and brutally raped her.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.856
She got pregnant from that rape.

00:47:41.856 --> 00:47:44.030
And when she went to the
doctor and discovered this,

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:47.750
the doctors offered
her an abortion.

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.780
And Lianna asked the
doctors if abortion

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.410
would help her forget the rape,
if it would help ease her pain

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.040
and suffering.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.680
And the doctor said, well,
no, it won't do that.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.770
And she realized in that moment
that if ending her baby's life

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:05.942
wouldn't benefit anybody,
she wasn't going to do it.

00:48:05.942 --> 00:48:08.400
And Lianna said, if abortion
wasn't going to heal anything,

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.810
I didn't see the point.

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:13.330
She said, I just knew I had
somebody inside my body.

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:16.380
I never thought about who
her biological father was.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.326
She was my kid.

00:48:18.326 --> 00:48:19.200
She was inside of me.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.820
And just knowing she
needed me made me

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.280
want to get a job to help her.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.260
But in an interview
Lianna did, she

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.510
shared that, although
that was her attitude

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.850
about the pregnancy, the
rape itself caused her life

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.530
to become a living hell.

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.240
No matter how many
times she showered,

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.240
she could not get rid of the
feeling that she was dirty.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.640
And so she started to
entertain thoughts--

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.150
or she thought about
committing suicide.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.310
But when she thought
about committing suicide,

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:48.290
she remembered she
was pregnant and she

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:52.020
had to think not only about
herself but about the child,

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.310
and so she didn't kill herself.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.270
And she looked at me in
that restaurant in Guatemala

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.950
and she said to me, Stephanie,
I saved my daughter's life,

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:04.930
but she saved mine.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.150
In another story of
an inspiring person

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:11.050
I've met who I believe brings
this third principle to life,

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.720
I'm reminded of a young
woman by the name of Veronica

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.380
who was a college student who
got pregnant unexpectedly.

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.590
And her boyfriend wanted
her to have an abortion

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:23.930
and her friends wanted
her to have an abortion,

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:26.410
but she ended up telling her
parents and moving back home

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:27.760
and getting support.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.952
And she sent me this picture of
her and her daughter, Amelia.

00:49:30.952 --> 00:49:33.160
And I'd like to read for
you what she said to me when

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.310
she sent this picture.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:36.185
She said, the picture
I've enclosed of Amelia

00:49:36.185 --> 00:49:38.830
and I doesn't
fully show my face,

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.230
but it's an important
picture to me.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:44.230
Amelia became very ill
with respiratory problems

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:48.160
around seven months, which
meant a lot of nights dealing

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.580
with fever, congestion,
pain control,

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.610
and a sad little baby who kept
waking up due to having trouble

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:56.406
breathing in her sleep.

00:49:56.406 --> 00:49:58.030
She said, I took this
picture one night

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:01.270
when I decided to let her
sleep on my chest instead

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:04.180
of the crib, and she slept
throughout the night,

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.310
and so I did that every
night until she was better.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:07.750
And she said to
me, it represents

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.660
what we do as
mothers, that we stop

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:14.350
looking at ourselves as
individuals with needs

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:16.210
and instead we
begin to look at how

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:21.130
we can serve another and
therefore love another.

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:23.680
And with doing that,
she said, comes

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.990
learning to love ourselves.

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:32.830
And finally, I'm reminded
of my friend Debbie.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:37.180
Debbie's story is similar
to Lianna's and Veronica's,

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:41.470
in that she was
unexpectedly pregnant.

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:44.410
But unlike Lianna's
and Veronica's story,

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.540
Debbie had an abortion.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:50.620
And she deeply regrets having
made that choice, but realizes,

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.860
like all of us, she
cannot undo her past.

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:57.640
But she became convicted
that if she had regrets

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.270
and she knew the
impact of her choice

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:04.660
back then that she lives with
now, that she would have wanted

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.850
someone to tell their story.

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.600
And so she's decided
to tell her story

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.110
to try to help people
think differently when it

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:15.700
comes to the crisis they're in.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.560
And so she travels to
different audiences

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.240
and she talks about
her choice and she

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.040
talks about regretting it.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.959
And once she was in an audience
where a student had a friend

00:51:23.959 --> 00:51:26.500
en route to an abortion clinic,
and he simply sent his friend

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.430
a text.

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:30.160
There's a woman here who
regrets her abortion.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.990
And the friend texted back, why?

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:36.610
And so this young woman was
willing to sit down with Debbie

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:38.800
and listen to not
only Debbie's story,

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.040
but give Debbie an
opportunity to listen to her

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.980
and what her reasonings
were for abortion.

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.230
And she felt she had
no support, that she

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:50.440
couldn't get through that
pregnancy and parenting.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.440
So Debbie said, I'll support
you and your friend here

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.470
will support you.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:58.020
That girl didn't go to the
abortion clinic that day,

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:02.360
but she did go the next day
to hear her child's heartbeat,

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.780
and then she decided to carry
through with that pregnancy.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.140
And several months later,
this baby girl was born.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.890
And to wrap everything up before
we move it into questions,

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.050
I just want to leave
you with the thought

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:19.280
that, whether it's this teenage
mom who not only is delighted

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.900
that she has this baby--

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.706
but she encouraged
another friend

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:24.080
to carry through
with a pregnancy

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.130
that that friend is
grateful to have--

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:29.630
whether it's this teenage
mom or whether it's Debbie,

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:33.350
or whether it's
Lianna, or Veronica,

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:36.380
whether it's little
Brooke or her parents,

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:41.330
whether it's Captain
Sullenberger who prioritized

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:43.790
the passengers on his
airplane, whether it's

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:46.730
Nick Vujicic, that you remember
all these people and think,

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:50.570
they're inspiring because they
put others ahead of themselves,

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:53.180
because they had
perspective, and because they

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:57.170
did the right thing even
when it was really hard.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:00.150
And that's the challenge that
I leave all of you with today.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:01.278
Thank you very much.

00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:04.146
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:10.730
At this point I would
be happy to engage you

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:13.730
in a dialogue, a conversation,
and a question and answer

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:14.320
period.

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.510
So if you have questions
about the topic in general

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.810
or anything I've shared, I
would be happy to answer them.

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:23.030
And Mark has a
microphone over there,

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.910
and he will take it around.

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:27.620
So any questions?

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:29.240
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering, how do

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.430
you suggest creating
a dialogue like this

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:35.960
in an environment which is
almost entirely for abortion?

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.320
So how do you even
start this conversation

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.770
when you know there is such
a strong outward resistance

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:44.125
to a pro-life point of view?

00:53:44.125 --> 00:53:46.250
STEPHANIE GRAY: You know,
hopefully it came through

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:47.780
in the stories that
I shared, that I

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.969
think a lot of the times the
way we start conversations--

00:53:50.969 --> 00:53:52.760
whether we think it's
an environment that's

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.160
going to be friendly
or not so friendly--

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:58.250
is to start conversations
with open-ended questions.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.760
So I will ask people, what
do you think about abortion?

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.280
And if that might seem like
a really random, not so

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.320
much lunch-table
conversation, you

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.290
could maybe find an article
in the newspaper or something

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:12.020
that you read about online that
somehow relates and bring it

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.530
up, and say, did you see that
article about x, y, or z?

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:19.020
And it made me think, what do
you think about this topic?

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:20.540
What do you think
about abortion?

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.586
And really seek to
understand where

00:54:23.586 --> 00:54:24.710
that person is coming from.

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:27.350
And to give you an example,
once on an airplane

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:28.670
a guy sitting next to me--

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.260
we shared what our jobs were
and he asked what I did,

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.890
and I said, I go and give
talks about abortion.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:34.970
And he said, really?

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:35.874
That's fascinating.

00:54:35.874 --> 00:54:37.790
And I just looked at him
and said, what do you

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.230
think about abortion?

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:41.750
And he said, I think
it's necessary sometimes.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:43.250
And I just asked
another question.

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:46.080
I said, when do you
think it's necessary?

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.440
And he said, like cases of rape.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.900
And I said, you know,
I agree with you

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:53.690
that rape is a
horrible evil and we

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:56.880
need to not only support the
woman who's been victimized,

00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.857
but we need far more serious
consequences for the rapists.

00:55:00.857 --> 00:55:02.690
And then I said to him,
I have to ask myself

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:04.100
a question though.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.860
And the question I have
to ask myself is this,

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:12.900
is it fair to give the death
penalty to the innocent child?

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.480
And this passenger looked
at me and he said, well,

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.860
I never thought of it that way.

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:21.030
And so I didn't go in boarding
my plane with the intention

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:23.850
to speak about abortion.

00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:26.310
I just asked a few questions
when someone asked me

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:28.590
what my job was.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.009
Any other questions?

00:55:30.009 --> 00:55:30.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:33.634
So I have a friend who
says he's pro-life.

00:55:33.634 --> 00:55:35.550
Like, if he were with a
woman who was pregnant

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:37.320
he would really do
everything in his power

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.045
to persuade her to choose life.

00:55:39.045 --> 00:55:41.670
But he says he wouldn't want to
impose that decision on someone

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:42.326
else.

00:55:42.326 --> 00:55:43.020
What is your--

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.600
STEPHANIE GRAY: So that is a
common perspective people have,

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.420
is, I feel this way, and I
might even encourage you,

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.790
but I can't force my
views on you insofar

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:53.280
as I don't think the
law, for example,

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.290
should reflect how I would live.

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:58.350
And when someone says that, I
think analogies are helpful.

00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:01.950
I would ask a question and
draw an analogy out of it.

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:05.460
I would say, well, would you
say that you're against rape?

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.840
Yes.

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:10.290
And if someone was
going to commit rape,

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:12.120
would you try to stop them?

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:12.840
Yes.

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.480
And do you think, if you're
incapable of stopping them

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.520
and they actually
commit rape, that we

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.990
ought to have laws that ban
rape so there are consequences

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:23.190
for that person?

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:25.830
And if they say yes,
then I would say, OK.

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:29.400
So you clearly think,
under some circumstances,

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:34.590
we should have laws that say
certain actions are wrong.

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:38.190
So then why, when it
comes to abortion,

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:41.879
would you treat it
differently if abortion

00:56:41.879 --> 00:56:43.170
ends the life of a human being?

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.634
Now, if abortion doesn't end
the life of a human being,

00:56:45.634 --> 00:56:47.550
then I think we can call
into question, should

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:49.320
we have any laws against it?

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.640
But since we know we're dealing
with a human being that's

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.241
living, then if
the act of abortion

00:56:56.241 --> 00:56:58.740
ends that human being's life,
it's not enough for me to say,

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.780
I personally won't kill
someone, but if you

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.670
want to kill someone
that's your right.

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:06.030
If the facts are true,
if the evidence is there,

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:08.710
we have to go to its
logical conclusion and say,

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:11.820
if this action ends someone's
life it's wrong not just for me

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.260
but it's wrong for everyone.

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.360
And we ought to
have laws against it

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.910
as we do with rape and
other types of murder

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:19.320
and other things like that.

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.330
So we can't determine whether
we should, quote unquote,

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:23.890
"force our views
on other people"

00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:26.114
until we know what the view is.

00:57:26.114 --> 00:57:27.780
Like, for example, a
lot of times people

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:30.219
say, I support a
woman's right to choose.

00:57:30.219 --> 00:57:31.510
We have to finish our sentence.

00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:32.550
That's not
grammatically correct.

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:33.110
Choose what?

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:34.281
It's hanging there.

00:57:34.281 --> 00:57:36.780
I support a woman's right to
choose what color shoes to wear

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.470
with her outfit.

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:38.200
Sure.

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.290
What kind of ice cream
she thinks is the best.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:41.052
Sure.

00:57:41.052 --> 00:57:42.510
But I don't support
a woman's right

00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:45.300
to choose to kill an
innocent child, regardless

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.070
of the child's age.

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:50.280
So in a similar way, if I said
to you, I support a man's right

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.150
to take, you would have to
ask me to define what I mean.

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:55.250
Take what?

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:57.720
And it it's, support a
man's right to take his bag

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.036
and walk out of the
room, totally OK.

00:58:00.036 --> 00:58:01.410
But I don't support
a man's right

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:03.960
to take someone else's
bag out of the room.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.510
So we need to define what
we mean by choice, by take,

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:11.190
by all of this stuff,
and if in defining it

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:14.160
evidence leads us to the
fact that we're actually

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.540
ending someone's life or
violating a human right,

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:20.100
then we have to create
a structure legally

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:25.200
that bans that for the interests
of our fellow human beings.

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.026
Any other questions?

00:58:27.026 --> 00:58:29.570
AUDIENCE: I haven't really
quite formulated my question.

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:34.820
On top of-- using that
same analogy then,

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:39.740
what good would incarcerating
a mother be when we're talking

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.270
about the issue--

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:43.940
the issue being that women do
not have enough support right

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:49.920
now, so what good
would making it illegal

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.110
do for the woman in showing her
that there is support for her,

00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:56.042
that there is another way?

00:58:56.042 --> 00:58:57.500
STEPHANIE GRAY:
Very good question.

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:03.170
So certainly I would say,
it's not just one strategy

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:06.110
and abandoning all
other strategies.

00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:09.620
The slogan I like to use is,
make abortion unthinkable.

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.840
But in believing it
ought to be unthinkable

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.060
based on the evidence of
dealing with a human being

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.880
and believing in human
rights, believing

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.797
it ought to be unthinkable
doesn't exclude me from saying,

00:59:19.797 --> 00:59:21.380
I also believe it
ought to be illegal.

00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:24.830
I do believe it ought to
be illegal and unthinkable.

00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:27.560
What would be the
consequences for a woman who

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.280
violates the law?

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.238
Well, the first point
is, no woman is currently

00:59:30.238 --> 00:59:31.100
violating the law.

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.380
So we're not talking
about, for example,

00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:37.010
putting women in jail
who have had abortions.

00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:39.110
What we're talking
about is a hypothetical

00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:41.720
at some future point
when the law changes,

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.640
what ought the consequences be.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.980
And even when we say
something is illegal--

00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:47.750
you know, it's
illegal to steal--

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.840
what the consequences are
for any individual who steals

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.640
vary from case to case.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.880
You might find a situation
where a woman has an abortion

00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:56.930
under emotional duress.

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:59.042
She actually is not
freely choosing it.

00:59:59.042 --> 01:00:00.500
It's against the
law, but someone's

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.470
pressuring her or forcing her
to go there against her will,

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.720
so that would be one example.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.390
Or you have cases like
Andrea Yates where

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:12.120
you have a woman who drowned her
born children in the bath tub.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.420
I believe in her
case she was found

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.820
not criminally responsible.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.120
Her actions were still wrong
and they're still unlawful,

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:23.090
but a case was made, or could
be made in circumstances

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.852
like this, where someone was
not of the right frame of mind

01:00:25.852 --> 01:00:28.310
to be fully consenting to the
action that they were taking.

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:31.110
So all of that needs to
be taken into account.

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:33.170
But the reality is,
the law currently

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:34.730
isn't against abortion.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:37.640
And so what I think is
very important, as efforts

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.960
are made to have the law
changed to reflect human rights,

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.890
that all of us have the
inalienable right to life,

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:48.570
in the meantime we have
to offer support to women.

01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:49.640
Absolutely.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.650
And there are pregnancy centers.

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.660
There are homes
for pregnant women.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.660
There are nonprofits
across the country that

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.300
exist to do that very
thing and to not only

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.550
journey with a woman
through her pregnancy,

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:05.330
but to really walk with her
after her pregnancy as well.

01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:07.850
If she chooses to parent
rather than adoption,

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:09.680
she's going to need
a lot of support.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.600
And these centers
exist, and I would

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.590
say very much should have
our attention and support.

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:16.100
So I hope that was helpful.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.670
Any final questions?

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:20.000
AUDIENCE: Well, you've
given an inspiring talk.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.510
So you're kind of like
that good person quality

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:23.930
that you're kind of mentioning.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.120
So I was going to ask
a personal question.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.740
What inspires you
to be who you are

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.097
to give talks around the world?

01:01:30.097 --> 01:01:31.430
STEPHANIE GRAY: Well, thank you.

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:32.870
In terms of what inspires me.

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:36.850
You know, just speaking of
pregnancy centers there--

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:39.380
my mom volunteered
at a pregnancy center

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.850
when I was a young child.

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:45.650
Both my parents were really
active in the pro-life cause,

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.210
you could say,
generally speaking,

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:48.500
but in particular
my mom volunteered

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.416
at a pregnancy center.

01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:51.860
So when clients would
come for pregnancy tests

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.920
I would often go with her and
I would doodle on letter head

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.350
while she was in the office
counseling the girls.

01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.150
And when those
clients gave birth

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:01.010
my mom would go to the
hospital with flowers

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:02.510
and I would come along.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:05.270
And so from a very
young age I saw

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:08.700
that there were women in crisis
who felt they had no support.

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.700
And I saw that there were
people like my parents

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:14.630
and my mom who would
support them and love them

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:16.670
through that
difficult circumstance

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:20.640
and turn that obstacle they
were in into an opportunity.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.200
And that laid the
foundation to really convict

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.690
me to want to use
the skills that I

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:30.420
had to help those who were
more vulnerable and in need.

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.060
And I went to
university, actually,

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.920
with plans to pursue
a different career.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.370
But I heard an American
speaker who came to Canada,

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:38.780
and I was a college student.

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.660
His name is Scott Klusendorf,
and he gave a presentation

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.840
on this topic that blew my mind.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.750
And in that talk he said,
there are more people

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:50.870
working full-time to kill
babies than there are

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:53.240
working full-time to save them.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.570
And I'll admit, when I heard
those words I became very

01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:59.870
convicted that I wanted to
be one of the people being

01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:03.950
a voice for those who were
entirely incapable of raising

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:06.910
their voices against what
was happening to them.

01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:11.360
And a lot of things unfolded,
and here I am 15 years later.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.630
Thank you very much.

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:15.630
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
very much, Miss Gray.

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.460
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.710
If you guys have any
remaining un-asked questions

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:22.400
she'll be here.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.050
You can talk to her in person.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:27.254
And again, we have copies of
her book, "Love Unleashes Life."

01:03:27.254 --> 01:03:28.670
So thank you very
much for coming.

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:31.100
And for those tuning
in as well, too.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.210
Thank you.

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:35.260
[APPLAUSE]
