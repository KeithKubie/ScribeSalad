00:00:00.558 --> 00:00:03.332
- All right now we have
another combustion reaction.

00:00:03.332 --> 00:00:08.325
Instead of ethylene, we
now have ethane, C2H6,

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:11.985
has two carbons and six hydrogen

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:15.026
atoms in each molecule of ethane,

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:16.154
and it is reacting.

00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:19.508
It's ethane gas, it is
reacting with molecular oxygen

00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:22.747
in gaseous form and they combust to

00:00:22.747 --> 00:00:26.507
form carbon dioxide gas and liquid water,

00:00:26.507 --> 00:00:28.504
and like we've seen in previous examples,

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:31.210
this chemical equation is not balanced.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.405
How can we tell?

00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:35.436
Well here on the left hand
side we have two carbons.

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:37.130
Here on the right hand
side we have one carbon.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.953
Here on the left hand side
we have six hydrogens.

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:42.447
Here on the right hand side
we only have two hydrogens.

00:00:42.447 --> 00:00:46.126
Here on the left hand
side we have two oxygens.

00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:49.715
On the right hand side we
have two plus, three oxygens,

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:53.476
so none of the elements here are balanced.

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:56.691
But like we did in the
example of ethylene,

00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:58.925
whenever you see this
where you have several

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.107
somewhat complex molecules involved,

00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:05.194
it's good to save the element that

00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:08.665
is in a molecule by itself for last,

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:10.023
because you can just tweak this

00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:11.474
to change the number of oxygens

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:13.425
without it having any other side effects

00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:15.467
on the number of carbons or hydrogens.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:17.515
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to first balance,

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:18.512
like we've done before,

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:20.239
the carbons and the hydrogens,

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:22.503
which are going to have
implications on the oxygens

00:01:22.503 --> 00:01:23.803
because if I change the number here,

00:01:23.803 --> 00:01:25.080
it's going to change
the number of oxygens.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.717
If I change the number here it's going to

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:28.273
change the number of oxygens.

00:01:28.273 --> 00:01:30.780
But lucky for me I have
this dioxygen molecule

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.717
on the left hand side that
I can just tweak at the end

00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:36.433
to balance the entire chemical equation.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.499
So let's start with, you know last time

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:40.775
we started with carbon, let's
start with hydrogen this time.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:42.041
Just for kicks.

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:44.652
So over here I have six hydrogens

00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:46.534
on the left hand side, of
the entire left hand side

00:01:46.534 --> 00:01:48.356
I only have six hydrogen atoms.

00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:50.620
On the right hand side I
only have two right now,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.413
so if I want to have six I would
multiply these two by three

00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:57.655
so now I have three water molecules,

00:01:57.655 --> 00:01:59.757
each of them have two hydrogen atoms,

00:01:59.757 --> 00:02:03.274
so I'm going to have
six, six hydrogen atoms

00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:04.991
on the right hand side.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.013
Fair enough.

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:07.198
Now let's go to the carbon.

00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:09.523
Remember I'm saving oxygen for last.

00:02:09.523 --> 00:02:12.669
Carbon on the left hand
side I have two carbons.

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.503
How many carbons do I have
on the right hand side?

00:02:14.503 --> 00:02:16.303
Well right now I only have one,

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.031
but I can change that very easily.

00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:20.109
Instead of having one
molecule of carbon dioxide,

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.022
I can have two molecules
of carbon dioxide.

00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:24.972
And so now my carbons are balanced,

00:02:24.972 --> 00:02:26.806
two carbons, two carbons.

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:29.383
And now let's go to the oxygens.

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:34.350
So right now, right now on,
I'll do this in a mauve color,

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:38.148
right now on the left hand
side I have two oxygens,

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:40.622
but on the right hand side what do I have?

00:02:40.622 --> 00:02:42.629
Let's see, I have two times two,

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.660
so this right over here is four oxygens,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.447
and then I have three water molecules,

00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:49.606
each of them have one oxygen atom,

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:52.706
so three times one, so
this is going to be three

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:54.029
right over here.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.139
So on the entire right hand
side I have seven oxygen atoms

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.427
and on the left I only have two.

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:01.530
So what can I do here?

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.139
What can multiply by two to get to seven?

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.983
Two times what is equal to seven?

00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:11.408
Well two times three-and-a-half
is equal to seven.

00:03:11.408 --> 00:03:14.032
So two times three-and-a-half
is equal to seven.

00:03:14.032 --> 00:03:17.189
Remember I have two here,
I'm saying two times

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.454
something is equal to seven.

00:03:19.454 --> 00:03:22.425
I want to get to the four plus the three.

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:25.979
Well I multiply it by three point five,

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.763
and now I have seven, seven oxygen atoms

00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:32.480
on both sides of my chemical equation.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.803
But like we've seen in previous videos,

00:03:34.803 --> 00:03:37.264
it is not standard to just
leave a three-and-a-half here,

00:03:37.264 --> 00:03:38.913
it's kind of this weird notion of

00:03:38.913 --> 00:03:40.909
three-and-a-half molecules,

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.825
we like to have whole numbers here.

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:45.924
So how do we make sure
we have all whole number

00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:48.351
coefficients in front of our molecules?

00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:50.452
Well we could just
multiply everything by two,

00:03:50.452 --> 00:03:52.402
then this thing is
going to become a seven,

00:03:52.402 --> 00:03:53.727
this thing is going to become a two,

00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:55.027
this is going to become a four,

00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:57.232
this is going to become a six,

00:03:57.232 --> 00:03:58.102
so let's just do that.

00:03:58.102 --> 00:04:00.122
I'll write the whole reaction over again.

00:04:00.122 --> 00:04:03.210
So I have my ethane, and I won't write

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.485
actually what state it's
in just to save some time,

00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:09.202
plus some molecular oxygen.

00:04:09.202 --> 00:04:11.569
They combust, they yield,

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.788
so these are the reactants,

00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:15.424
the products are carbon dioxide gas

00:04:15.424 --> 00:04:19.695
and liquid water, and liquid water.

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:22.808
So let's see, you multiply,
if you say that there

00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:24.316
was a one out here before,

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:26.871
we're going to multiply
that by two to get two.

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:30.540
We had a three point five
here, multiply that by two,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.503
you get a seven here.

00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:36.763
We had a two right over
here, multiply that by two

00:04:36.763 --> 00:04:38.017
you get a four.

00:04:38.017 --> 00:04:40.002
Once again I'm just multiplying
all the coefficients

00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:41.802
by two just like you did
in algebraic equations

00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:43.763
in your algebra classes.

00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:47.479
And then finally three times two is six.

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:48.663
And we're all balanced.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.079
We were balanced here but we didn't

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:51.519
have whole number coefficients.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:53.516
Multiplying everything by two gave us

00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:56.521
the whole number coefficients
and we are much happier.
