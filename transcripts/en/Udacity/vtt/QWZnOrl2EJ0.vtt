00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.310
I want to end this
section on computability,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.400
by revisiting the scene we used
at the beginning of the course.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.400
Where the teacher was explaining
functions in terms of ordered pairs, and

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.860
the students were thinking of what
they had to do to X in order to get Y.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.150
The promise of our study of
computability was to better appreciate

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.720
the difference between
these understandings.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.120
And I hope you will agree
that we have achieved that.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.750
We've seen how there are many
functions that are not computable

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.090
in any ordinary sense of the word,
by counting argument.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.000
We made precise what we meant by
computation, going all the way

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.970
back to Turing's inspiration from
his own experience with pen and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.890
paper, to formalize the Turing machine.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.020
And we argued for the Church Turing
thesis, that this model can compute

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.710
anything that a computer today, or
any one envisioned for tomorrow can.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.680
Lastly, we described a whole
family of uncomputable functions

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.090
through Rice's theorem.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.410
What's next in the study
of computability?

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.120
Let's ask Lance.
