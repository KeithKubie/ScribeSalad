governments to provide resources to

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269

goals but one of the things that the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330
goals but one of the things that the
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.840
goals but one of the things that the
foundation is really excited about is to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
foundation is really excited about is to
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.570
foundation is really excited about is to
how to leverage the private sector and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
how to leverage the private sector and
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.920
how to leverage the private sector and
the reason that we're really excited

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
the reason that we're really excited
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.099
the reason that we're really excited
about that is that we know that markets

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109
about that is that we know that markets
 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.470
about that is that we know that markets
don't currently work well for the poor

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
don't currently work well for the poor
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.839
don't currently work well for the poor
but we really believe that markets can

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
but we really believe that markets can
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.269
but we really believe that markets can
be made to work well for the poor so if

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
be made to work well for the poor so if
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.740
be made to work well for the poor so if
you think about it you know why don't

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
you think about it you know why don't
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.810
you think about it you know why don't
markets work well for the poor well they

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
markets work well for the poor well they
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.119
markets work well for the poor well they
don't work well because first of all the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
don't work well because first of all the
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.360
don't work well because first of all the
poor don't have any money which means

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370
poor don't have any money which means
 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.619
poor don't have any money which means
they're low margin they're not a

are the basic information about these

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
are the basic information about these
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.510
are the basic information about these
markets and lastly a lot of the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
markets and lastly a lot of the
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.190

companies to it's hard for those two
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.710
companies to it's hard for those two
worlds to talk together and work

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
worlds to talk together and work
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.870
worlds to talk together and work
effectively together so it's really not

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
effectively together so it's really not
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.050
