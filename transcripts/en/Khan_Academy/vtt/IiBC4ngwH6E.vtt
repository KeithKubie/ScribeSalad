00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.480
What I want to do in this video
is start with the abstract--

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.330
actually, let me call it
formula for the chain rule,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.760
and then learn to apply it
in the concrete setting.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.596
So let's start off
with some function,

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:14.220
some expression that
could be expressed

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.200
as the composition
of two functions.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.100
So it can be expressed
as f of g of x.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.610
So it's a function that can
be expressed as a composition

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.130
or expression that
can be expressed

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.890
as a composition
of two functions.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.135
Let me get that same color.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.680
I want the colors
to be accurate.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.470
And my goal is to take the
derivative of this business,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.390
the derivative
with respect to x.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.380
And what the chain
rule tells us is

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.880
that this is going to be
equal to the derivative

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.930
of the outer function with
respect to the inner function.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.460
And we can write that as f
prime of not x, but f prime

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.730
of g of x, of the
inner function.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.950
f prime of g of x
times the derivative

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.635
of the inner function
with respect to x.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.230
Now this might seem all
very abstract and math-y.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.760
How do you actually apply it?

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.180
Well, let's try it
with a real example.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.246
Let's say we were trying
to take the derivative

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:28.560
of the square root of
3x squared minus x.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.070
So how could we
define an f and a g

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.710
so this really is
the composition

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.340
of f of x and g of x?

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.530
Well, we could define f of x.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.440
If we defined f of x as being
equal to the square root of x,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:51.430
and if we defined g of x as
being equal to 3x squared

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.410
minus x, then what
is f of g of x?

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.066
Well, f of g of x is
going to be equal to-- I'm

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.940
going to try to keep
all the colors accurate,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.090
hopefully it'll help
for the understanding.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.039
f of g of x is equal to--
where everywhere you see the x,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.820
you replace with the g of x--
the principal root of g of x,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.110
which is equal to the
principal root of-- we

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.750
defined g of x right over
here-- 3x squared minus x.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.020
So this thing right
over here is exactly

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.340
f of g of x if we define
f of x in this way

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.580
and g of x in this way.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.700
Fair enough.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.310
So let's apply the chain rule.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.020
What is f prime of g of
x going to be equal to,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.570
the derivative of f
with respect to g?

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.840
Well, what's f prime of x?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.320
f prime of x is equal to--
this is the same thing

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.090
as x to the 1/2 power, so we
can just apply the power rule.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.140
So it's going to be
1/2 times x to the--

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.190
and then we just take 1 away
from the exponent, 1/2 minus 1

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.820
is negative 1/2.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.190
And so what is f
prime of g of x?

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.050
Well, wherever in the
derivative we saw an x,

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.550
we can replace it with a g of x.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.320
So it's going to be
1/2 times-- instead

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.070
of an x to the negative 1/2, we
can write a g of x to the 1/2.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.090
And this is just going
to be equal to-- let

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.710
me write it right over here.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.830
It's going to be
equal to 1/2 times

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.080
all of this business to
the negative 1/2 power.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.140
So 3x squared minus x,
which is exactly what we

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.500
need to solve right over
here. f prime of g of x

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.340
is equal to this.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.300
So this part right
over here I will--

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.740
let me square it off in green.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.920
What we're trying to
solve right over here,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.250
f prime of g of x,
we've just figured out

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.450
is exactly this thing
right over here.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.930
So the derivative of f of the
outer function with respect

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.450
to the inner function.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.390
So let me write it.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.870
It is equal to 1/2 times g
of x to the negative 1/2,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.480
times 3x squared minus x.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.490
This is exactly this
based on how we've defined

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.020
f of x and how we've
defined g of x.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.520
Conceptually, if
you're just looking

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.311
at this, the derivative
of the outer thing,

00:04:31.311 --> 00:04:33.889
you're taking something
to the 1/2 power.

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.430
So the derivative
of that whole thing

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.940
with respect to your something
is going to be 1/2 times

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.120
that something to the
negative 1/2 power.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.040
That's essentially
what we're saying.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.400
But now we have to take the
derivative of our something

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.530
with respect to x.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.090
And that's more straightforward.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.160
g prime of x-- we just use
the power rule for each

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.390
of these terms-- is
equal to 6x to the first,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.910
or just 6x minus 1.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.530
So this part right over here
is just going to be 6x minus 1.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.460
Just to be clear,
this right over here

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.400
is this right over here
and we're multiplying.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.490
And we're done.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.330
We have just applied
the power rule.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.270
So just to review,
it's the derivative

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.730
of the outer function
with respect to the inner.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.520
So instead of having
1/2x to the negative 1/2,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.430
it's 1/2 g of x to
the negative 1/2,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.760
times the derivative of the
inner function with respect

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.100
to x, times the derivative
of g with respect

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.128
to x, which is right over there.
