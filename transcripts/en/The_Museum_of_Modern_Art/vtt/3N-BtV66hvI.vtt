00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.540
Good morning. I'm Glenn Lowry, director of
the Museum of Modern Art

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.050
and I'm delighted to welcome you to this
conversation about Bruce Connor:

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.750
It's All True. It really is. This
exhibition was made possible by Hyundai

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.330
Card and we are deeply grateful to
Hyundai Card for their ongoing support

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.410
for so many projects and exhibitions
here and we welcome their

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.710
representatives from Korea who have
joined us this morning.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.329
Funding for this project was also
provided by Jill and Peter Kraus

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.230
through their Endowed Fund for
Contemporary Exhibitions,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.059
The Walton Family Foundation, and the Museum of Modern Art's annual exhibition fund.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.840
I'm particularly happy that our
colleagues from SF MoMA are here with us

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.250
Rudolph Frieling, curator of media arts
and co-curator of this project

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.600
Gary Garrels who comes here as a beloved
former chief curator of drawings and a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.630
curator on this project as well, and
Rachel Federman, who was on the staff of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.369
SF MoMA working on this project when
it began,  and of course here at the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.720
Museum of Modern Art

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.250
Laura Hoptman and Stuart Comer. They
were the team that put this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.700
absolutely riveting exhibition together.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.979
I also want to say how thrilled we are
that Jean Conner is with us

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.390
I know she started her day yesterday at
a brutally early hour in the morning in

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.100
order to be here so gee

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.750
thank you so much for making the effort
and for being here and I hope you are as

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.600
pleased with this exhibition as we are.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.270
This project really is a collaboration
with SF MoMA and it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.920
it was really SF MoMA's driving impulse
that put this exhibition into play and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.719
I'm thrilled that Neal Benezra, director of
SF MoMA, is with us and Neil wonder if

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.200
you would say a few words and as he
comes to the podium let me just take

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.270
this opportunity to say congratulations
in a very public way to the absolutely

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.630
brilliant job you and your colleagues
did

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.630
in building the new SF MoMA.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.120
Thank you, Glenn very very much. You know, SF MoMA and the Museum of Modern Art have

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.470
collaborated on many occasions through
the course of our respective 10 years

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.370
and Bruce Conner: It's All True is only
the most recent of these and I did a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.180
little research online I found this
release stellar list of exhibitions that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.390
we worked on and in one configuration or
another together:

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.300
Gerhard Richter, Andreas Gursky, Oliafur Eliasson, Jeff Wall, Lee Friedlander

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.980
Martin Puryear

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.670
William Kentridge and Cindy Sherman, just
in the last 10 or 12 years or so

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.170
so that's pretty extraordinary.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.650
Glenn, I really do want to thank you as
well for your partnership and friendship.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.380
Glenn has been a wonderful

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.700
not just colleague but friend and
counselor to me as we've gone through

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.140
our expansion so I'm totally grateful to
you for that.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.470
Bruce Conner was thought for
many many years to be the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.280
central figure in the kind of
counterculture of the San Francisco

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.780
Bay area that was the extent of
his reputation to a very good with

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.160
considerable extent and now I think it's
safe to say that he's increasingly been

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.060
recognized as one of the most
influential artists of our time. To have

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.130
this retrospective, which is the first
since his death, presented here in New York

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.780
and premiering here in New York

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.370
I must say and at the Museum of Modern
Art only testifies to the expanding

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.370
reputation and awareness that is bound
to follow

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.980
this exhibition and when it comes of
course to San Francisco.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.600
Glenn mentioned Jean Conner, who is
herself a very fine artist in her own right

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.120
Thank you Jean for your cooperation and
that of Robert Conway and Michelle Silva

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.590
and the Conner Family Trust. You've been
indispensable partners in this project

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.810
could not have been accomplished without
you.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.420
Glenn mentioned the curators Rudolph,
Gary, Stuart Comer, Laura Hoptman

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.900
here in New York and also
Rachel Federman who was a former

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.040
assistant curator of painting and
sculpture at our Museum and was a

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.600
central figure in the development of the
project. Before I pass the word back to

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.710
Glenn I just want to also acknowledge the
support that we received from the Henry

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.580
Luce foundation, which is very, very
important in the organization

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.060
of the project and so we're very
grateful to Luce.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.060
So, Glenn, with pride, I'll pass the word back to you

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.280
Thank you, Neal for those very generous
words.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:21.550
So this is a large, sprawling, complicated
rich exhibition and since Bruce Conner

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.630
as Neal suggested is not necessarily a
household name

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.010
at least here on the East Coast: who is
Bruce Conner?

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.510
I only met him once. I shook his
hand in 2000. I wish i knew him

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:44.950
as a person, but as an artist, I think
he's the best known least known artist

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:51.940
in American post-war art and that he is
an artist who inhabited many different

00:05:51.940 --> 00:06:00.669
areas of the visual arts discourse
primarily film, cinema but also

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.490
primarily and especially at the
beginning of his career

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:10.390
the burgeoning genre of assemblage. And
during our research something

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.970
that was very interesting that I came
upon was that when Conner first showed

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.479
in New York, he showed as a very young
man, he was 23 years old when his first

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:25.180
exhibition here and up until around
1965, when he stopped

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.729
making his assemblages he was a key
member of a movement of assemblers who

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:31.360
included

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.110
Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns and in fact over and over

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.280
he was mentioned in that in that
particular cohort and when he chose to

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.060
remove himself and began to work on
something else he did this at it

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.990
deliberately and he chose to leave that
at that millier.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.710
It's All True comes actually from Bruce
himself and I think it's kind of like

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.000
this fabulous little window into his
thinking you want to talk a little bit

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.810
about the letter and how it sets up this
exhibition, Stuart.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.500
I think it's clear if you've seen the
exhibition the degree to which Bruce was

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.840
a shape shifter

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.840
and he never settled into one mode of
making for any period of time and when

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.380
this letter was written he effectively
compiled a long list of very

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.680
contradictory adjectives that had been
used to describe his work in the press

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.500
and then Riley said "it's all true" and he
really was elusive

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.120
I think the work itself can be very
fugitive he championed the fact that his

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.370
work would change over time and he was
true to his interest in cutting and

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.479
pasting and reassembling things
constantly changing nature of his own

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:44.400
identity as well as the work itself so
this fact that it was so difficult to

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.450
pin him down and now this is the first
major Postumus retrospective it really

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:53.490
is an important chance for us all to
start to pick through these secrets that

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.720
have circulated for a long time about
the work. But hopefully without fixing

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.530
him too much i think it would be a
disservice if we tried to over define

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:06.630
the work so i hope this exhibition
create signposts for understanding how

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:11.970
important this career was, hugely
important, but without fixing it too much.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:18.750
It's just to add a servant and also to
create connections which is a a

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:23.430
challenge with such a various body work.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:29.160
One of the works certainly in our
collection that I'm so pleased is in

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.890
this exhibition is "Child" an early assemble piece in it and the result of a

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.719
rather monumental conservation research
project.

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:44.730
Laura or Stuart, you want to talk about
what was involved in a sense bringing

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.800
that work back to life?

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.520
I'll just do a general contextual
comment about conservation in general

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.910
and maybe lower can dive into the
details about our brilliant colleagues

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.130
in our conservation department who did
restore "Child" after a long and

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:02.350
and troubled history. I think Bruce's
work in general is marked by a high degree

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:08.530
of fragility from the assemblages to
Celluloid itself which as we all know is in

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.310
a precarious state right now, film in
general as we know is shifting radically.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.600
So in taking on this exhibition, it was
critical to start looking at both the

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.820
objects the films and other materials in
which he worked and really assess how to

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.860
preserve them for posterity and to
really take some risks in a way to do

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.550
things maybe that had not been done
before and so I wanted to shout out

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.610
Roger Griffith and Megan in our
conservation team and Michelle Silver

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.770
the Conner Family Trust who have done
heroic work to make some of this work

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.180
look its the very very best for this
exhibition. And MoMA

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.990
has a long and illustrious history with
Bruce Conner beginning in the

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:51.040
mid-1950s when are one of our
curators Dorothy Miller went to visit

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.870
him in Wichita Kansas and returned to
write to start a file on him and write a

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:01.120
note that said talented artist to watch
something of that sort

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:07.090
and when "Child" was created in finished
in 1960 the museum of modern

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:12.670
art made an attempt to acquire this
strange and wonderful work. It's a made

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:19.900
of wax and it is of an homage to Carol
Chessmen, a thief and a rapist, but not a

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.890
murderer who was executed by the state
of California too much

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:30.670
to the dismay of many of the anti capital punishment people

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:38.020
Bruce is one of them. "Child"
wasn't acquired in 1960 but

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.660
eventually it came to us as a gift

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.770
a decade later and by that time it has
deteriorated greatly and over the years

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.880
it deteriorated to a point where it was
completely unshowable. Connor came to

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.240
visit "Child" several times and we were in
correspondence for more than a decade

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.630
about how to work on this and our
colleagues took this on last year as a

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.640
as a project that I guess was it was
also an inquiry because we weren't sure

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.750
they weren't sure whether this was going
to be possible since that have been had

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.970
been failure after failure over so many
years

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.649
and you can see it today in this
exhibition it is 99.9

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:18.759
percent of the original material there's
just, I'm looking at my colleagues here

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:23.230
there's just a interior armature and
then one small piece of stocking across

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:29.649
the mouth that is that is a new and
it really is a testament to our

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:35.649
conservators but also to the history of
the staying power of our commitment

00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:42.279
to boost Conner that started to 50 years
ago. Neal mentioned counter culture and

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:48.100
certainly that's a theme that runs
pretty much through Bruce's work. Stewart,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.970
you want to talk about the films in
particular and how they intersect with

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.750
both countercultural movement and
perhaps even with cinematic history

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.829
today?

00:11:56.829 --> 00:12:00.699
Sure, I mean I think even if you take two of
the earliest films in the show: a movie

00:12:00.699 --> 00:12:05.079
which opens the exhibition and "Looking
for Mushrooms" which marks a period in

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:11.139
which Bruce and Jean Conner move to Mexico and were actively exploring psychedelic

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:16.779
mushrooms with Timothy Leary and really
engaging in this an expanded idea of the

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:17.319
trip

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:21.970
you know all the trips of all kinds and
really exploring a countercultural view

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.199
of the world.

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:27.790
I think it's interesting too since this
is the first retrospective in New York

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.240
and the extent to which certain West
Coast movements i think were never

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.990
fully accommodated in some of the
narratives being written in this city

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.699
and it's becoming more and more clear
that on the counter culture itself

00:12:39.699 --> 00:12:43.449
produced you know fundamentally
important projects and I think cinema

00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:46.480
and experimental cinema in particular
was a major part of that.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.769
So by the time you move from all of
these scenes of death and destruction

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:52.200
that

00:12:52.200 --> 00:13:00.270
sort of cut up and we ordered in a movie
and Bruce's reflection on very

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:05.490
American symptoms of a very kind of dark
period during the Atomic Age and then the

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.380
escape from that in Mexico and and his
sort of delight in finding an intense

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.660
spirituality in every corner of the
streetscape in Mexico City how that then

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.670
relates to the final film and he
completed Easter morning in 2006 which

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:25.860
is the final work in the exhibition as
well which is really a counterpoint to

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.700
the darkness, sort of apocalyptic vision,
that marks so much of the early work and

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:35.340
in particular early films. And again,
I think he was constantly re-editing and

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.460
reworking his own films. There are many
films that were not completed:

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.950
he made over 20 films and I
think we've tried to select the seven

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.760
films in the exhibition that really
highlight key strategies or key moments

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.260
in the work but also films that really
relate to his other practices. Whether it

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.910
be in drawing, assemblage making,
printmaking...they were each distinct

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.840
bodies work in some ways but there's a
an intense fluidity that I think really

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:06.960
does indicate a strong vision and a
strong reaction to many cultural and

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.690
counter cultural developments of the
time.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:15.600
Yeah, I was always struck by the drawings
and I mean there they have if the film's

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.020
have a certain kind of fluidity and
shape-shifting dimension to them

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.280
the drawing to have this incredibly
intense almost obsessive dimension to

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.720
them. You wanna talk a little bit
about his drawings as a whole?

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.460
Conner worked in drawing from the
beginning of his career to the end of

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.540
his career in various ways that you
worked with ink he worked with the new

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.170
technology of magic marker which is
something that somebody's going to do a

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.100
show on sunday because this Yayoi Kusama and many other artists of the time were

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.460
working with this and it
changed their drawing.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.860
Conner worked with assemblage, sorry with collage we can be specific paper collage

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.270
from the beginning of his career to the
very end and he also pioneered this

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.290
technique of manipulating inkblots to

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:08.550
a fantastic effect starting in the 1970s
and again and continuing until the end of

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:14.940
his career and I think that what this is
a body these bodies of work are on their

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:20.250
own islands on their own but they also
relate to his filmic work as well as

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:25.560
assistance as assemblages because of the
concentration it takes not just to make

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.040
them but to look at them as well. I think
for Bruce Conner

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.930
there is always the acknowledgement of
the viewer in everything that he has

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.550
done and especially in the drawings you
can not only admire the steadiness of

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:46.230
hand and this is almost superhuman
concentration or attention to detail

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:53.130
but it also is on us to look at to be
able to look so carefully as closely as

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:58.800
possible in order to divine really the meaning and also the intensity

00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.730
of the work.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.730
It's a similar thing with the
assemblages you need to put your despite

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:07.050
the pieces of plastic on many of them i
encourage you to put your nose up very

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.850
close to them and look at all the
details and this is part also of a kind

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:18.660
of the incantatory, meta-physical, and
spiritual nature of a lot

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.579
the work and it has to do with the way
that the works of paper are made

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:25.980
not just what they are but how they're
made

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.990
on his part and also how we receive and
how we look at them. I want to come back to

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.459
the contradictoryness of It's
All True

00:16:35.459 --> 00:16:42.000
I think I can't think of another artist
who so embraced the idea of these

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.120
polarities. You read down that list it's
just about every possible condition and

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.889
its opposite and he leaves us in a kind
of a quandary.

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:57.779
Right? About what to believe where on the
spectrum of any one of his

00:16:57.779 --> 00:17:00.269
contradictions

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:08.280
he fits in it and it seems to me that that
embrace of contradictoryness is one of

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.480
the most important themes that runs both
through his practice through the

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.299
exhibition and what this work means for
us today. I think one thing you

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:21.240
I think no one could deny is that you
know this work has unbelievable energy

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.829
and I mean going back to the idea of the
counterculture different counter cultures had

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.890
different energies and so I think it's
very telling to see the punk material

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.450
next to the ink-blot drawings for
instance you know one is marked by an

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.140
extreme degree of aggression and
violence the other is very spiritual

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:42.000
very ethereal and you know he threw
himself into both of those situations

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.780
with a great vigor and so I think just
the way that you know he just

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:54.150
approached everything he did with such
passion, such perfectionism, an incredible

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:59.250
work ethic. I think each of
these things sort of stands on their own

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.580
term and they do contradict each
other and I think the other thing that I

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.770
mean Bruce for, I met him
twice and so the second time I met him

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.490
he was we were discussing film and video
and he was adamant that he would never

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:16.230
ever ever show his work on video and
that of course changed fundamentally and

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.290
you see that in

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:22.960
the wonderful installation "Three Screen
Ray" and his first film a movie which

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.830
again opens the show originally
conceived this as an installation in the

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.290
1950s which is hard to
imagine but it would have been rear

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.070
screen projected with other objects and
elements in the room

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.640
so finally in the mid early-2000s you know he finally achieves

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.580
this idea and even actually before he
experimented with three screen

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:44.170
projection but if you think about the minute detail in the drawings or the sort

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.470
of macro and micro spatial
configurations that go on in the

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.059
assemblages

00:18:49.059 --> 00:18:56.379
and then you're suddenly immersed in
this cinematic immersive space and you

00:18:56.379 --> 00:18:59.529
know i think even spatially he
contradicted himself and and you know he

00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:03.700
would go very deep into tiny many
details but then he would also he really

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.779
understood space.

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:08.740
I think and that's in speaking
"Dimensional Silver" it became very clear

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.799
that there was a kind of golden mean
that he had for sketching out the ideal

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:14.649
proportions for a video or film
installation.

00:19:14.649 --> 00:19:18.970
So I think he was very aware of how
people encountered his work and so even

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.539
if it was contradictory

00:19:21.539 --> 00:19:25.109
I just think there was an unbelievable
degree of focus and dedication in the

00:19:25.109 --> 00:19:30.269
work that maybe unites all the different
things that might

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:34.109
depart from one another but also the role
play

00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:37.919
I think there's one section of the
exhibition where you'll see his campaign

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:42.479
for supervisor for instance or many
strategies he used to get away from

00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:46.889
being you know "Bruce Conner" and/or would
really play with different pseudonyms

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.479
he did not he would did not want to be
easily absorbed into the art market or

00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:56.580
into any official histories he really
was a contrarian and came up with a lot

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.039
of different strategies to put that into
play.

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:04.590
Let me turn this over to all of you to
ask any questions that you might have

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:09.179
but if you do have any...

00:20:09.179 --> 00:20:16.259
Yes Lee, thank goodness! Kicking off of what you just said about not being readily absorbed and

00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:20.849
and the fact that he's a shape-shifter...
was he influential or did that kind of

00:20:20.849 --> 00:20:25.499
elusiveness almost preclude that... 
was he influential on other artists and

00:20:25.499 --> 00:20:26.309
movements?

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:30.450
I mean one artist I can think of who
contributed I mean several artists

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.950
contributed to the catalog

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.220
Dara Birnbaum in particular I mean just as
one example who

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.490
you know i mean when i mentioned
Bruce to her she just got so excited that he

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.330
was so influential on me and just
 you can see it in her work

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.110
i mean just this notion of appropriating
media imagery and what that meant to her.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:53.730
Certainly he had a major influence but
you're also seeing now i think is a

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.710
generation of younger artists

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:00.509
there's an exhibition now at the Whitney
called Mirror Cells which is I imagine

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:04.110
is largerly artists' work in their 20s and
30s and I wouldn't claim at all that

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.380
they necessarily knew Bruce's work but
there's no question that there's a

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.789
strong resonance between them and I
think a lot of people are looking at the

00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:15.360
way younger artists in particular are
not necessarily adopting digital

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.379
strategies but are returning to the
object or this idea of this handmade,

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:24.899
ready-made, assembalge object. There's also a very strong gothic sensibility that you

00:21:24.899 --> 00:21:28.080
see chiming with the black wax works if
you look at a young artists like Stuart

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.149
So I think there's a very strong
relationship between many generations of

00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:37.590
artists and Bruce's work. I also wanted
to add about his use of

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:42.750
assemblage which it came early and on
time and during the period of time where

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:49.559
it was raining in the discourses in
New York particularly he was

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:55.470
an innovator in that in an assemblage
and of course a slightly later the

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.440
advent of assemblage and Southern and
Northern California he was at the very

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:05.429
center of that moment, beginning from
his first encounters with his fellow

00:22:05.429 --> 00:22:12.120
Northern Californian assemblers in 1958
all the way until the mid 1960s when he

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.159
stopped making assemblage so he's a Titan
on both coasts in terms of the history

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:23.039
of art in that way and definitely in
terms of contemporary art this way

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:28.110
of working digitally and by and at the
same time for working filmically and by

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.529
hand at the same time is something
that's a regular part of the discussion

00:22:31.529 --> 00:22:37.019
and in contemporary art in 21st century
art right now. I think something that I

00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:40.019
really hope this exhibition will
generate here in New York in particular

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:45.159
is a rather fundamental assessment of how we think about California

00:22:45.159 --> 00:22:48.490
because this museum is that very few major retrospective of California artists and

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.600
I think the last one would've been Mike
Kelly at MoMA PS1 and for me there are really

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.720
important connections between Mike Kelly's work and Bruce's work

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.200
they were both polymaths the way they
engaged again with counter cultural

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.260
activities and and shape-shifting.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:07.149
I think there's a strong connection
between the two of them as well but I

00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:10.809
think we have to find other approaches
other narratives other frameworks to

00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:15.610
position Bruce's work in both within the
California context and

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.909
rethinking a more international context
for the work. I agree, because he can't

00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:22.090
so easily just be inserted into the
story that were already telling he has

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:26.889
his own stories almost his own planet
his own group of constellations or

00:23:26.889 --> 00:23:29.649
however you want to put it but am I
think that makes him

00:23:29.649 --> 00:23:34.750
exceptional in so many different ways
and whatever use one sees as new material

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.169
it has to be at first and foremost dealt
with on its own terms and then

00:23:38.169 --> 00:23:44.019
assimilated into what we already know as
it were. Thank you Lee,

00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:47.019
other questions?

00:23:50.380 --> 00:24:05.110
It seemed following up on your idea
of California and art that Bruce was not

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:09.730
so much part of the art market and
because your market was far away in

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.080
California although

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.850
there was certainly in the 60s
business not like the business model

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:20.500
that existed in New York where you are
turning out paintings and sculptures and

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.940
paintings and sculptures and you know
pop artists who made brightly colored

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:30.100
things and that was not Bruce and I
think that allowed him to explore so

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:38.380
many different things without being
beholden to that market and is this or

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.510
the contrariness of his personality

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:47.300
and his career certainly
influenced the types of works he made in

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:56.270
which has made it very difficult for
let's say the casual art viewer to

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:03.080
absorb all of the variety of media that
he worked in plus the interiority of the

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:12.140
work it is so so intense that you
don't get everything as you walk by

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.720
you can't view his show from the window
you have to actually look at it and so

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.460
it has made it

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:26.180
I think difficult for art history in
general to embrace until now. Can you

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:30.680
introduce yourself this is Michael Cohen
who has worked with Bruce Conner as his

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.580
representative in Los Angeles since 1989
so you certainly know from which you

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.360
speak.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.180
You know I think you know the the aspect
that you are touching on for me is the

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:47.720
obverse or the reverse to the
contradictory - which is the resistance

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.190
right this is like Bruce as an artist who
really understands the power of

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:57.350
resistance and that resistance is both a
very palpable physical resistance that

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.580
you feel as you're working your way
through the exhibition as well as it a

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.350
larger kind of metaphysical resistance
to the market to being understood and

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:13.550
accepted in a single way and I think
that those two qualities are very much

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.780
of today.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.790
You know there's always an interesting
question about reception when is the

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:24.410
right moment to really reconsider or
even consider an artist and I just think

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:30.140
Bruce's work today feels extremely fresh
and of the moment

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:36.140
precisely because he understood that
the power of resistance in the need for

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:41.600
resistance at a time when you know
culture can seem all consuming. It's

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.350
interesting

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.650
only Michael in particular first
presented three screen ray at Art Basel

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.800
and I think it was that presentation
that led a lot of people in the art

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.250
world to really wake up to the
importance of the work and that dovetail

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.010
with a moment where experimental film in
particular was beginning to enter the

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:58.280
marketplace for the first time so if you
look at that side of Bruce's work in

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:04.100
particular there's really a lot to learn
and think about and you know even with a

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.000
movie very early on he was obsessed with
this idea of collectors in particular

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.020
you know treating his films almost like
chinese scrolls that they would pull out

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.230
and watch over and over and over again
and again this very personal connection

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:19.610
that you mentioned but you know he was
thinking about modes of viewership that

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.510
I think we're not at all central to the
way the conventional logically art world

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:28.880
worked and so it's part of the challenge
now of to what extent do we accommodate

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.030
him in those logics until what extent do
we keep him

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.870
free of it. Other questions or comments?

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:44.300
If not what I'd like to do is again
thank our colleagues from San Francisco

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:50.150
for having co-curated this exhibition, to
Neal for having provided the leadership

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:55.100
that has guided San Francisco to such a
wonderful place today, to our friends

00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:01.550
from Hyundai Card for being with us, to
the Bruce Conner Trust, and to Jean in

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.930
particular for sharing this moment with
us and we'll be around if you want to

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.410
ask questions or go back upstairs and
look at the exhibition.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:14.370
Thank you, Laura and Stuart.
