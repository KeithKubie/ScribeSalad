00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.440
PROFESSOR: The students spend
about six hours in class

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.260
each week.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.460
And right at the
beginning of the semester,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.520
most of those six hours are
either lectures or activities

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.970
or workshops that
we have planned

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.360
to have inside the class.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.890
It's very, very
tightly programmed.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.770
This may involve, say,
brainstorming for the team

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.390
projects, or forming
up with teams,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.020
going through the
project constraints,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.600
or teaching them the techniques
that we want them to learn.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.650
Near the end of the
semester, we heavily

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.870
scale back the program content.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.530
We give students a
lot of class time

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.890
just to meet up with the teams.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.306
Because for many,
many teams, it's

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:46.570
difficult enough to gather
six people in the same room,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.230
in the same place,
at the same time.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.000
To get eight of them
in the same room,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.960
well, they're doing
it during class time.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.090
At least you know everybody's
going to be there.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.270
So we try to give as
much time as possible

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.570
later in the semester for
teams to actually work

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.710
on their project.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.470
But sometimes that is planned
out, like playtest sessions,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.740
for instance, where students
play each other's games.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.070
PROFESSOR: In the first
half of the semesters,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.130
all the lectures and workshops
are given by the staff.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.780
But by the second
half of the semester,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.250
we're getting them to see other
aspects of game development.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.440
So within MIT
students-- and actually,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.860
this year, a few Wellesley
students-- most of our students

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.550
are going to be coming to us
with a programming background.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.817
A few might have some design
classes under their belt.

00:01:34.817 --> 00:01:36.900
Maybe they've taken one
of our game design classes

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740
or another design
class offered at MIT.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.750
Some of the students are
going to have some art

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.560
aptitude, visual art aptitude.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.130
Some, a little bit more a sound
design or music composition

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.640
aptitude.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.599
But for the most
part, they don't know

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:51.890
what it's like to be an artist.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.098
They don't know what it's
like to be a sound designer

00:01:54.098 --> 00:01:55.392
on a game development project.

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:57.100
And they might actually
not know anything

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.680
about the business of games.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.990
So the last half of the semester
is bringing in guest lecturers

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.320
from the industry.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.970
We've got a great network here
in Boston, an independent game

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.000
developer network.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.270
Also, quite a few of the
AAA larger studios are here.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.740
So we mine our
network in each year.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.780
We get new speakers
to come talk to them

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.450
about how to work
with an artist,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.730
how to work with a sound
designer, what it actually

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.601
means to be an art
director in a game company,

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.600
or what actually does it
mean to even be a level

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.256
designer on a large project?

00:02:29.256 --> 00:02:30.880
But then also, we're
bringing people in

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.230
to talk about business models.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.000
Kickstarter is often
an interesting topic

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.500
for the students.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.400
We try to balance
it between here's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.870
what the industry
what looks like,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.370
and here's the
things that are going

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.260
to help you, right now, with
the game that you're working on

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.760
now.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.051
And if you wanted to take
the game a little bit further

00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:49.500
after the course, here's the
things that you could do.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.560
Things like fundraising,
submitting it to festivals,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.110
marketing it, and just getting
other people to play it.
