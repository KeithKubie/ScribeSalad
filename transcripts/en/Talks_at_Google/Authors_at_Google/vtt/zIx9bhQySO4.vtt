00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.670
Commentator: Today I'd like to introduce my
friend, Bill Barnes. Yesterday was the eighth

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.509
anniversary of his comic strip Unshelved about
libraries. He has many books out about this

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.290
comic strip.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.970
And five months ago Bill started a comic strip
about the software industry. It takes a special

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.130
kind of person to understand his snarky one-liners
and he's lucky to have found me because I'm

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.950
of his friends who does. I find him delightful.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.680
Please help me welcome Bill Barnes as he presents
"Cartooning In the 21st Century."

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.680
[applause]

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.270
Bill Barnes: Oh, thank you.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.290
Kathy's been doing Toastmasters, so she's
got, she's got the handshake. You always start

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.670
with a handshake and you end with a handshake.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.670
[laughter]

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.200
I was a little nervous today because I quit
my job in the software industry a little over

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.790
two years ago to do cartooning finally full-time,
and it's sort of like when you, when you leave

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.330
high school and you go to college and you
come back to high school, it's both sort of

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.880
exciting but a little nervous. Like how do
I fit in? Am I cool? Am I not cool? And I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.030
was worried about fitting in and then I realized
that I'm overweight, I have a beard, I own

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.060
a recumbent bicycle and I was up all night
putting up my Website. So I do actually feel

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.830
like I, I fit in here.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.830
[laughter]

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.580
So do we have, let's see, developers here?
Developers? Do we have any testers? One tester.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.500
Marketers? Even marketers. Do you guys have
program managers? No.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.820
What do you, so are, anyone, anyone ex-Microsoft
people? And so what, what is the sort of Google

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.500
equivalent to program managers here?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.213
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: They work at Microsoft.

00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:35.213
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: They work at Microsoft, yeah.

00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:36.213
[laughter]

00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:38.780
They're all the, they're all the ranks of
middle managers at Microsoft. I completely

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.780
understand.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.680
So today I thought we would talk about comics.
I'm gonna talk about what are comics?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.710
[pause - writing on board]

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.710
And where do they come from?

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.710
[pause - writing on board]

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.710
Where do they come from?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.900
I'm just more comfortable with a marker in
my hand.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.900
[pause - writing on board]

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.120
And then I'll do a little bit of history of
why I do comics and the comics I've done specifically

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.120
 -

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.120
[pause - writing on board]

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:16.940
Unshelved and now Not Invented Here; which
is so long that it's just doomed to be abbreviated.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.400
So what are comics?
Anybody?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.169
What is a comic?
Someone define comic for me.

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:22.169
[pause]

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.310
By the way if you're not here this room is
completely packed.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.310
[laughter]

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.779
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: It's a very, very short
graphic novel.

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:34.239
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: A very short graphic novel
which, so now you have a recursive definition

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.540
thing going on, right?

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.430
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: A sequential visual narrative.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.499
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: A sequential visual narrative,
nice.

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:44.499
[laughter]

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.180
Will Eisner called them sequential art, which
is very compact. And Scott McCloud in his

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.239
book "Understanding Comics", and this is always
a mouthful and I have to look it up "juxtaposed

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.230
pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence
intended to convey information and/or produce

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.760
an aesthetic response from the reader."

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.269
I think it is sometimes helpful to talk about
what comics aren't. They aren't books.

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.269
[pause - writing on board]

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.269
They aren't movies.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.269
[pause - writing on board]

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:16.730
Although I think people often confuse them
with animation. And they aren't pictures.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.790
They aren't just pictures anyway.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.069
[pause - writing on board]

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.499
So, so they're pictures arranged in sequence
and I think that's what everybody kind of

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.650
agrees on. You can have one panel comics,
things always exist on the periphery whatever

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.659
definition you get this leaky abstraction
problem with comics.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.030
But they, they're in sequence and what I love
about comics and one of the reasons I do them,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.939
is this thing about what happens between this
first panel and the second panel.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:47.730
In the first panel somebody answers the phone
they say, "What's that you hear? The bank

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.309
is being robbed?" And the next panel Superman
is sort of flying off into space.

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:57.799
And your brain knows what to do, your brain
knows how to connect those two things. But

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.579
it's your brain doing the connection and so
you make a very personal, you, you inject

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.209
your own personal experience of what exactly
happened in between those, those two panels.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.180
I think we, we also see this, it's sort of
a cut, right like in movies? In the old, in

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.519
the old movies, days of movies in the original
movies you had situations where somebody'd

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.600
be like, "What's that? You hear the bank is
being robbed?" And they'd put down the phone,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.860
they'd walk over and he'd take off his shirt
and they would cut away so you didn't have

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.110
to see him getting undressed, but then you'd
get back and now he'd have this thing on and

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.460
you'd see him opening the window, jumping
out, flying through space, and then finally

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.690
landing at the bank.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.720
Over time movie makers have learned to make
that more economical, and they've shortened

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.450
it and shortened it and shortened it, until
eventually now it is kind of that thing, "What's

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.260
that? You hear the bank's being robbed." And
the next thing you see him landing and your

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.720
brain fills it in.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.670
Comics do that same thing. They're actually
all about the cut and all about the stuff

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:51.850
that happens in between. One of the big advantages
of, of comics over movies is they're a lot

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.850
cheaper to make.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.260
And so one, one of the reasons you see a lot
of comics being made into movies is that in

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.500
a way they are a ready-made storyboard. Right?
Here, we've just laid it all out for you,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.530
at very low cost of what it's gonna look like.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.570
And so, in fact a lot of movie makers go back
into comics because it allows them to like,

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.950
Joss Whedon has been doing Buffy Season 8,
because it allows him to do a lot of stuff

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.190
that he actually could never have done, he
would never have had the budget to do, very

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.360
easily because he just draws pictures.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.860
So they're a little bit more than pictures;
they're different than books, and I love books;

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.030
I'm a huge book reader, but neurologically
you have a very different experience of comics

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.280
versus books.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.200
Obviously with, with books there's descriptions
of things and with comics they are just being

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.630
laid out for you. But even there there's kind
of a continuum. And so you could describe

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.040
a tall, dark haired gentleman walked in, in
a book and you think, you picture a tall dark

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.560
haired gentleman, whoever that person is in
your head.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.470
In a comic that can take lots of forms, it
can be, obviously you can make him tall, but

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.150
it could be as simple as that. We were having
a little talk at lunch about xkcd where really

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.440
you can't get even simpler than that.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.720
Right? There's your tark, tall, dark haired
gentleman and now you can project on that

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.420
whatever you want. Whatever that tall dark
haired gentleman is. And the more detail you

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.010
add, it starts changing it. Oh, okay, well
it's not that guy that I was thinking of.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.080
It's somebody else; he looks something like
that.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.530
And so for me comics are a nice medium in,
in the expressive thing. They're a very shorthand

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.060
way of doing stuff. I don't have to say the
tark, tall dark haired gentleman, I can just

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.330
draw him.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.350
And, there're actually have met people who
cannot read comics, neurologically the juxtaposition

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.770
of the words and the pictures are too much
for them. And their, their brains sort of

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.060
short circuit and they can't do it.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.590
For me it's almost a perfect thing. I actually
get a little tired of reading all those words

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.530
after awhile and so for me having a little
combination works.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.530
But it also works with my sense of humor.
There's some people who really wanna tell

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.700
a long story, and you can do that obviously
with comics. I really just wanna make a joke.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.070
If I could just go through my whole life cracking
short jokes, I would do that, and so the comic

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.740
strip is, is the perfect medium for that for
me.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.970
[pause]

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.220
Comics started - anyone familiar with "The
Yellow Kid?"

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.610
[pause]

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:14.420
The Yellow Kid was sort of the first popular
comic strip. He looked not dissimilar to this.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:21.530
I used to, I, I, well sometimes do pictures
but I know this is gonna go up on YouTube.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.530
And I didn't want to use any copyrighted images.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.950
Yellow Kid in the late 1800's, in the New
York, what was it? The New York World, Pulitzer's

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.160
New York, New York World, there was a comic
strip called Hogan Valley and one of the characters

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.930
was known as the Yellow Kid. It was just a
little kid, he was like six or eight, and

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.470
he wore this night shirt, a yellow night shirt
and he never spoke, but words appeared on

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.340
his night shirt to tell his story.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.639
He became hugely popular. There were literally
Broadway musicals, a whole line of merchandise,

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:52.460
actually a whiskey with the Yellow Kid on
it.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.460
[laughter]

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.830
And he became so popular that Hearst who ran
one of the competing newspapers in New York,

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:03.060
the, I have to look it up, The New York Journal
American, hired the guy to come over and do

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.430
The Yellow Kid in his newspaper to compete;
which he did.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.480
But it turned out the man who, who wrote Yellow
Kid owned the copyright to it so he just hired

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.520
someone to write Yellow Kid for the newspaper
he had been working at. So The Yellow Kid

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.250
actually ran in both newspapers for several
years.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.880
And it was a this, a big circulation war;
they were trying to get people to read this

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.055
incredibly popular character who today I think
we would look at and it's hard to find out

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:31.930
what's funny about it at all. But in the time
it was a big deal.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.520
And that, that, became, those became known
as the "Yellow Kid papers" and eventually

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:43.120
the yellow papers and that whole competition
between the two and the things they would

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.190
do to get circulation is now known as yellow
journalism because of The Yellow Kid.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.759
There were comic strips before The Yellow
Kid, but I think he kind of made it big and

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:52.260
showed what everybody could do and it was
followed by Little Nemo in Slumberland and

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:59.240
Little Orphan Annie and, and some comics that
we've even heard of today.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.870
And somebody had the smart idea that if you
took the newspapers that they're printed in;

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.879
print a lot of newspapers on 'em; fold 'em
over twice, and then slice down the edge,

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:08.839
you could actually make a book of these comics.
And that's the comic book. And that's where

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.490
that word comes from.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.209
They're called comics because of course they
were originally humorous, but rapidly what

00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:19.910
happened is people started telling different
types of stories. Instead of just collections

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.790
of comic strips in newspapers, they started
having more original material.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:26.310
Instead of comic stuff, you, you had an explosion
of genres. You had nurse comics, romance comics,

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:32.499
war comics, and eventually superhero comics,
when Superman came out.

00:09:32.499 --> 00:09:37.410
Then in the '50's, and this is, this is fine,
so actually America had a very burgeoning

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.630
comics industry; so did Europe; so did Japan.
It was very popular. Then in the '50's a guy

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:47.230
named Fredric Wertham came along and he revealed
that comics cause juvenile delinquency.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.230
[laughter]

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.950
Which we know now is caused by video games,
but they didn't know that then so -

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.360
[laughter]

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.220
And what happened was, there was this big
freeze; there was a big Senate sub-committee

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.509
on juvenile delinquency; he told everybody
this and oh my gosh, they imposed a thing

00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:08.009
called the Comics Code which was a self-imposed,
self-censorship of the comics industry and,

00:10:08.009 --> 00:10:12.199
and from that point on there was a huge freeze
and really the only thing left in comics after

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:16.990
this happened was the cleanest possible stuff,
which was superheroes, characters of high

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:22.000
moral standing people, and Richey Rich and
Archie and Veronica.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.990
And that's why for a long time comics were
just for kids. And if you think about it logically,

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.589
essentially what Fredric Wertham said is he
started off assuming, he said, "Comics are

00:10:29.589 --> 00:10:33.029
for kids. But look there's all these comics
that are written for adults and kids are reading

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:37.459
them and it's bad for them. So let's get rid
of these comics for adults and then comics

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:38.459
will just be for kids."

00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:42.639
So he, he did a nice little chronological
loop and it ended up back with what he wanted

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:48.230
which was for comics to be just for kids.
So sadly this, this very flexible medium really

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.930
was confined for a long time to just kid stuff.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.269
Over in Europe, over in Japan comics are for
everybody. Literally read by all ages, all

00:10:55.269 --> 00:11:00.430
sorts of genres. On the subway in, in Tokyo
you have businessmen reading businessmen comics

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:06.139
or war comics or whatever. They're just another
medium.

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:10.600
Finally after a while that started coming
back into American comics. In the '80's especially

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:17.380
the rise of the graphic novel kind of legitimized
it and now we have a, also influx of manga

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:23.519
from Japan, comics from Europe and it, it's
kind of starting to go back to what it could

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:25.040
have been.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.040
[pause]

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.480
And even the term graphic novel is kind of
a misnomer. It's not always a novel; it's

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.259
not always fiction, but nobody has come up
with a better word for it.

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:42.660
And what happened to comic strips? Which is
sort of started all this. Well they stayed

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.660
in newspapers. And as there are fewer and
fewer newspapers and the newspapers got smaller,

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.360
comics stopped being a thing they could use
to expand circulation.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.709
They became just a thing that the people would
read, I think people still like reading comics

00:11:55.709 --> 00:12:00.980
in the papers, but there's probably very few
people who would choose a paper over another

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:10.510
paper because of the comics it had.
And increasingly, of course, there's really

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.480
just one paper to choose from, so it doesn't
really matter.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.480
And comics, newspapers are primarily read
by older people, because young people would

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.480
be like, "Why would I do that when I can just
go to the Internet and read news?"

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.220
So you get this self-fulfilling prophesy:
newspapers are for old people, the comics

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.939
in them are for old people; and so they're,
they're old.

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:23.230
If you look at comics in newspapers these
days with very few exceptions they're, they're

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:28.399
very hackneyed, they're, it's Beetle Bailey
and Hi and Lois, and there's a few new things,

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:33.199
but for, primarily newspapers are trying to
retain their older audience, and they're desperate

00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:34.199
to hang on to them.

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:39.110
And so that's how comics have moved to the
Web. And so now anyone can do a comic, I mean

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:44.339
that's the magical Web thing that varied entry
is basically zero.

00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:49.740
Everybody has comics on the Internet. Really
tens of thousands of them, and there are some

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.019
really bad ones, because anybody can do it.
And so any nine-year-old can do it.

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:56.720
Kathy has a 12 year old who's, who's working
on doing, her's are, are very good, they're

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.759
much better than most of the stuff on the
Internet.

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:00.759
[laughter]

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:01.759
I -

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:02.759
[pause]

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:07.929
I thought we ought to talk about this now.
Yeah, so I was, I was, I often will like look

00:13:07.929 --> 00:13:11.442
at comics on the Internet and just be, just
be amazed. I mean it's sort of, it's sort

00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:15.300
of sweet and it's sort of sad what people
put up there and think is really funny and

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.079
it's just incredibly wordy and the punch line
is lost and it, just takes some time, right,

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:20.569
to learn how to do this.

00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:24.612
And the other day I was going through my own
personal archives and I found the first few

00:13:24.612 --> 00:13:27.999
comic strips that I started writing when,
when as an adult I started delving back into

00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:29.110
comics, writing comic strips again.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:34.269
And it was, it was every inch the really bad
beginner Internet column. That was just eight

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:38.959
years ago, right? So practice makes better.
I was just really struck by, "Oh well. I,

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:41.819
I had nothin' on them."

00:13:41.819 --> 00:13:42.819
[laughter]

00:13:42.819 --> 00:13:43.819
[pause]

00:13:43.819 --> 00:13:47.389
A lot of times when people find out I do a
comic strip on the Web, they ask me why, why

00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:52.439
it's not more webby. Like why isn't it, why
doesn't it have animation in it? I'm like,

00:13:52.439 --> 00:13:56.149
"'Cause then it would be an animation, right?
And I'm doing a comic strip."

00:13:56.149 --> 00:13:59.279
I think one of the promises or at least one
of the theoretical promises of the Web when

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:04.800
it comes to comic strips is you can kind of
get rid of all the shackles and constraints

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.360
of newspapers; they had, newspapers they wanted
all the comic strips to be a certain format

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.071
so they can line 'em up on the page. Well
that's not really a problem if you have a

00:14:09.071 --> 00:14:10.071
Website. It can be color now.

00:14:10.071 --> 00:14:12.060
These days some newspapers have color comic
strips, but for the most part they're still

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:18.860
black and white. They can be color, they can
come out as frequently as you want. You could

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.180
do them three times a day, you could do 'em
three times a week, three times a month; whatever

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.839
you want 'cause you don't have a daily cycle
of the newspaper.

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:30.149
And what's interesting is that most of comic
strips, most of the popular comic strips on

00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:34.399
the web look a lot like comics you would find
in the newspaper. Generally they're color,

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:38.420
that's probably the one big change and they
might be a different shape. They might be

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.069
more square than they are panels, but they're,
they're everyday or several times a week.

00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:46.239
It, they are strongly resembling, it would
be not out of place to put 'em in a, in a

00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:50.420
newspaper although the language might be a
lot stronger than you find in a newspaper.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.420
I know the Penny Arcade guys were here a week
or two ago, and so that, that doesn't really

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.529
belong in a newspaper, but visually there's
not that much different.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:15:02.709
And for me all I can say is I think that literally
like a century's worth of development of the

00:15:02.709 --> 00:15:07.829
comic art resulted in a vehicle that is, that
is ideal for communicating small bits of story

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:13.260
and/or humor in a very natural way. There's
just something about getting something every

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.329
day, having it be a certain size - I can't
draw too much, I mean I can't have this thing

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:20.199
be enormous and delivered everyday, that would
be too much work - so it's actually how much

00:15:20.199 --> 00:15:25.370
work I can produce in a day, and also how
much you can absorb in a day, and how, and

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.370
how much frequency - there's something very
natural about that rhythm.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.399
So even though newspapers may sort of being
going away and the rhythm of newspapers may

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:35.379
be going away, I think that will survive.

00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:37.139
[pause]

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:43.980
So that's why I make comics. They're, they're
my sense of humor, they're the way I tell

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:44.980
stories.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.661
I thought I would talk a little bit about
kind of my personal journey and, and it's

00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:53.139
interesting to see comics attract all sorts
of people.

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:58.660
I started off as a kid; I read a lot of comics,
I read sci-fi, fantasy, blah, blah, blah,

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.670
but I don't think I ever would have been a
person who made them.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:06.290
But when I was eight my family up and moved
overseas; we moved to Nigeria where we got

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:10.370
essentially in this little armed camp because
it was a dangerous place to live. So my house

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.540
had this huge fence around it with guards,
and me and my sisters were kind of stuck at

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.489
home at lot and we burned through all the
media we had; it was hard to get new media;

00:16:19.489 --> 00:16:23.309
this was in the '80s and, and really there
was one TV channel that had government sponsored

00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:27.799
thing. They also had the Brady Bunch and Star
Trek, which if I had to pick two shows to

00:16:27.799 --> 00:16:29.600
have, those would have been them.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.600
[laughter]

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.999
But even so my media was limited.

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:35.629
So we started making stuff. We started making
our own stuff. It was very kind of Little

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:39.639
House on the Prairie. We're all sittin' around,
I guess we'll like have to write our own stuff.

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:43.449
It wasn't Little House on the Prairie in lots
other ways, but in that way it was.

00:16:43.449 --> 00:16:44.449
[laughter]

00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:46.799
And so my sister and I started making our
own comics. In the beginning they were incredibly

00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:50.830
derivative, like I would read The Avengers
and I'd write a new comic and I called it

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.949
The Avengers.

00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:52.949
[laughter]

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:55.399
But it had slightly different characters and
it kind of went, well that's how you do it,

00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:59.399
you, you take something, modify it a little
bit and make it your own.

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:02.589
So after living there a couple of years I
came back to the States and I started publishing

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:09.829
my own comic books. So I was at this point
10 or 11 and I would write and draw them myself

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:15.220
and then I started advertising in the back
of comic collector magazines and sort of newsletters,

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.130
"Buy my comic book." And people did; I mean
amazingly. I could say almost nothing about

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.310
it. I'd be like, "Buy it." And they go, "Okay,"
and they'd send me five bucks and I'd send

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.570
them a, a comic, which I would photocopy in
my Dad's office.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:28.570
[laughter]

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.280
And then I said, "Wait. I can, I can, I can
move myself up the food chain." So then I

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.160
said, "You know what I need? I need, I need
writers and artists for this comic book."

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.492
And amazingly people would send me stuff and
they would, I would send all scripts and they'd

00:17:37.492 --> 00:17:40.390
send me back these huge beautiful pieces of
art that were nothing I could do, and I would

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.360
publish those on my Dad's Xerox machine in
his office, and sell those. And eventually

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:50.590
at a, at an actual photocopy place. And I
did that for a few years and that was super

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.590
fun.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:56.100
But creatively I kept moving back towards
the comic strip thing because the superhero

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.810
thing was kind of fun, but they weren't actually
again the stories that I wanted to tell that

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.980
really moved me. I wanted to do much simpler
stuff.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.880
It turned out what I really ended up doing
that, that when I look back today is the most

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:11.170
me, was a comic strip about my dog. My dog's
name was Barnabas, after the character in

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.080
the Dark Shadows, the vampire.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.540
And it was a comic strip called Barnabus The
Wonder Dog and it was really just about him

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.780
and my family and our adventures, sort of
slightly fictionalized. And I had the most

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.600
fun doing that stuff. And so I did that for
years through high school. Sometimes I would

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.190
print it out for other people to see and sometimes
I would just do it on my own.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:35.050
And when I went to college and then around
this time I started discovering computers

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:39.800
and so I had this, "What am I going to do?"
especially going off to college, what are

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.870
you gonna do?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.770
And I had to decide did I wanna do computers
or did I wanna do art. And I decided to do

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.750
computers, so I went to Carnegie Mellon and
I studied computer science. And I had a lot

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.750
of fun doing that.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.450
I, I did a comic strip in college for awhile
with a friend and it turned out to be important

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.571
because that comic strip that I did in college,
is now the comic strip I'm doing today. It

00:18:53.571 --> 00:18:57.160
has, it completely transformed and yet familiar.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.440
It was, we were both in fraternities; we were
in the two nerdiest fraternities on campus.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:07.760
Mine was something like 60 percent computer
science majors. And his was equally high in

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.760
engineers and stuff.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.910
And so we did, we did kind of our version
of what it's like to be really nerdy and yet

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:14.910
in a fraternity.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.410
And it ended up centering around these two
guys, and we decided as, they would be in

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:21.150
the, the worst fraternity on campus, it'd
only actually had them. It was just a two-guy

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.150
fraternity -

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.150
[laughter]

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.330
because everybody else had failed out and
so it was just them and no, but they couldn't

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.000
tell anybody 'cause, 'cause if they found
out that there was a fraternity on campus

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.730
that only had two people in it, they'd get
kicked off and so they did, did these elaborate

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.930
ruses and they had a rush and they got like
three more people which exploded the size

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.250
of their fraternity.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.600
But we kept coming back to the relationship
between these two guys. And one was this guy

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.920
named Bob. He was more sort of the manipulator
and this guy named Dave, and Dave would do

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.250
whatever Bob suggested. It turns out Dave
has a substantial trust fund which was what

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.010
was keeping the, the fraternity moving, and
Bob would take advantage of that.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.390
And I really liked the interaction of these
guys. It wasn't perfect, but we played with

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:00.360
that for a few years. And then that was the
last thing that I drew for three years. I,

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.430
I graduated college, I went off and worked
at Microsoft, I did the software thing for

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.790
a long time.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:11.080
And years went by and I got married and I
would always whine about this cartooning thing,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.490
"I wanna be a cartoonist." It's sort of one
of my dreams. Everyone kind of had that thing

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.430
that they wanted to be. I wanted to be a fireman,
actually I want to be an astronaut for a long

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.220
time, but for me it was always the cartooning
thing and I had really just abandoned it completely.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.020
I think I just said, "Well obviously I'm not
gonna be the best at it, so I'm not gonna

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.190
do it at all."

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:36.390
And I was whining to my wife about it and
she said, "Well why don't you just start doing

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:42.210
it? Start drawing comic strips I mean you
don't have to be in the newspaper, just start

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.990
drawing comic, comic strips." "I don't know",
I'd do it once in a while, but not really

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.990
incentive.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.990
So we, we developed an incentive program.
And the incentive program was when we got

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.790
married we'd worked out our budget and what
we were allowed to do and stuff, and we had

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.430
this thing where I could get a new car every
eight years. I'd been one of these Microsoft

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:57.240
guys who got like a car every six months for
awhile -

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.240
[laughter]

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.570
and I had to kind of get off that habit, it
was not working out for me. I was addicted.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.760
So I said, "Okay, I can stick with this car
for a long time."

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.040
The deal we worked out was if I, if I drew
a comic strip everyday for a year, I could

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.340
get a new car. At the end of the year I would
walk into a dealership and I could buy the

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.340
car.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.280
And this was, this was like the thing, this
was the wedge that I needed, I just kinda

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:17.670
needed that reason to get up and do it. And,
and it was easy. And then, I don't have to

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.012
show them to everybody, but of course I did.
And I had just a sketch book which I still

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.850
have which is the comic strip I drew everyday
for a year.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:27.530
It was mostly about my life, it was some other
stuff, it was fairly personal, but it was,

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.600
it was kind of a joke every day. It wasn't
always drawn well, it usually wasn't drawn

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.650
in ink it was just a pencil, but it was something
I did that proved to me that I could actually

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.930
write something every day.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.380
I always thought I was a guy with a sense
of humor and I always thought I'd do it; but

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.380
there's a big difference between being a funny
guy and actually writing a joke every day.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.170
And so I did that. And at the end of the year
I not only got a car, but I had an enormous

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.490
amount of confidence about it, because it,
because towards the end it was really easy

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.520
whip it off, I'm like, "What happened today?
Oh, nothing." Brrrrrr. And it just got, it

00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:01.110
got very easy. So my confidence was much,
much higher. And shortly after that I decided

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.770
to start a real comic strip.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.330
And so I did and this was based on my wife
and I's nine month RV trip. We, I, I'd quit

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:14.270
my job at Microsoft and we bought an RV and
we traveled around the country for nine months.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:19.590
We, we visited 38 states, even a couple of
provinces in Canada, 26,000 miles, and we

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.090
had a great time.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.570
And it was a, it's a very strange sort of
sub-culture of, of all these RV parks around

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.180
the country that people who travel - many
of them don't have homes at all - and it just

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.360
seemed whacky and crazy and funny. And I started
doing that.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.510
I worked on that strip for about six months
and it went nowhere. And I was really frustrated

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.580
because it'd been so easy to write this comic
strip about my life, and really what I did

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.660
is I, I was still writing about my life, I
was just writing about my wife and I's trip.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:51.280
And I hit a few road bumps. The first one
I did was I realized that I could not have

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.830
a character in the strip that had my wife's
name, that looked like my wife, because if

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.080
I had that character say something my wife
would not say, a complaint was filed -

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.080
[laughter]

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.860
in strong terms.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.860
[laughter]

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:12.460
And so I changed the character's face, changed
her name and immediately the complaints stopped.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.460
[laughter]

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.720
But the problem with that strip was it was
this husband and wife traveling around in

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.680
an RV. They were traveling around and they
would hit all these interesting problem situations,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:25.221
but there was no opportunity for a supporting
cast. It was just the two of them because

00:23:25.221 --> 00:23:26.221
they were always on the road. You would just
get to know someone and then you'd leave.

00:23:26.221 --> 00:23:29.120
By the way, that was what the life was like
and that was probably the hardest thing about

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.670
life on the road was we didn't really have
any friends for, for nine months that we had

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.250
steady contact with.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.860
And it was, it was a road block. I still,
I've never resolved that. For awhile I tried

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:45.610
adjusting the strip; I had the characters,
the male character's ex-wife following him

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.610
like with her husband -

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.610
[laughter]

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.170
she always to outdo him so it was like she
and her new husband had an even bigger, fancier

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.660
RV following him around and that was sort
of funny; and I have an ex-wife too, so I

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.830
got a little chance to vent a little bit in
that. But it structurally was just not gonna

00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.830
work.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:05.190
And it was around this time that one of my
wife's best friends came back from teaching

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.200
overseas and this is the guy that we call
Gene Ambaum, his, not his real name it's his

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.410
pen name. But that's how we refer to him.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:16.040
And Gene had gone to library school and had
gone overseas, found a wife, come back to

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.990
Seattle, was settling in and was starting
to work in a library.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:26.030
And he came over and he would tell these absolutely
dark and awful stories about working in libraries.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.370
Because libraries are these places where everybody
goes. I mean literally everybody goes to the

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.840
library at some point or another; often as
kids, but we often go back as adults especially

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.240
is you have kids - trust me right now libraries
are full of unemployed people trying to find

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.760
work or at least figure out how to file for
unemployment - everybody goes there. And so

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.160
some very fine upstanding citizens there and
some less so.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.800
And so he told me this story one day of the
old man who was looking to relocate and he

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.090
wanted to find the state with the lowest age
of consent.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.090
[laughter]

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.980
And that was like one of the sunnier stories.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.980
[laughter]

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.210
And I'm like, "This is comedy gold."

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.210
[laughter]

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:07.200
"This is the sort of thing upon which a comic
strip is built."

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200
[laughter]

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.630
And so we started talking about working together.
I'm like, "Dude, you gotta start writing this

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.670
stuff down and I will draw it for you."

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.640
And it was going along slowly and then we
went to a comic con together down in San Diego,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.290
just to kinda gawk. And on the flight back,
he's really scared of airplanes, and so to

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.560
distract him we started brainstorming the
strip that would become Unshelved.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.210
And it was all about this one kind of hip
young librarian dealing with stuff. And, and

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:34.380
that strip from day one has just wrote itself.
Because it is, it is the essence of a sitcom.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.440
It is a regular cast which is these librarians
and also the regulars that come to the library,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.780
the kids, the adults and stuff; plus anytime
I wanna talk about anything, I mean if I wanna

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.540
talk politics I can have someone walk in and
ask the question and look for help on stuff

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.540
like that.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.340
And really I, and from the second we started
working this I'm like, "I can't believe no

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.731
one else has ever done this." Like how has
no one else ever done this? And I just want,

00:25:53.731 --> 00:25:57.081
it's, it's that thing when you got like that,
that idea for the software product and you

00:25:57.081 --> 00:26:00.500
just know someone else is working on it right
now in their garage and you wanna get it as

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.440
fast as possible. And I did that thing.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.400
So we kinda rushed it out there and our plan
was, of course we wanted it to go in newspapers

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.960
'cause there still were newspapers, but we,
we knew we had some development to do. And

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.150
so we, we came up with the idea that we'd
put it on my Website. I'd had, I'd done this

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.820
a little bit with my other comic strip, very
limited capacity.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.060
Rob were you getting the, the first comic
strip? The -

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.100
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: Yeah.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.980
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: Yeah. An old friend of mine
and so he was one of like the dozen people

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.850
who read that first comic strip about the
RV. So we did it again with, with what was

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:36.710
then called Overdue. And we started putting
it out there eight years ago yesterday. And

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:41.480
three days later we got outed at a librarian
blog.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.740
Yeah, there's a blog for everything and there's
a big blog called librarian.net.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:51.370
And it was one of those nice problems to have
because this was really just a research project.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.700
At this point we didn't feel like we had our
characters right; absolutely the art wasn't

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.530
where I wanted it to be; but we wanted to
put it out there just as a point of accountability.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:03.060
Just get it out there and, and my friends,
my 40 friends and family will see it and that'll

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.060
be good.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:08.520
So we started putting it out and days later
we got outed on this blog. So we went from

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.860
40 readers to 1,000 readers overnight and
3,000 by the end of that week, and now it's

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.780
about 50,000.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:23.110
So that was great except that we didn't, we
didn't kind of have a chance to do the research

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:25.256
and development part of it. We just were there
and everyone was watching, everyone was watching

00:27:25.256 --> 00:27:26.256
as we figured it all out.

00:27:26.256 --> 00:27:27.660
And I will say that it's gone incredibly well
for that, that, the characters we started

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:35.160
off with which were very kind of stereotypical
characters pulled out of libraries we manage

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.480
to evolved them and they, they've added some
depth.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.730
The library audience turned out to be quite
magical and I think we planned a little bit

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.370
of this, but most of it was kind of lucky.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:50.630
Quite magical because it's a very heavily
networked group so when they all read that

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.210
blog; when they find out about it, they find
out about it, the one's who didn't read it

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.590
found out about it on a listserv the next
day and so forth. And that's worked out very

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.080
well for us.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.270
It turns our librarians also gather often.
I think they're people who are unappreciated

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:06.270
in their jobs and so when they have a chance
they zoop off to a conference to hang out

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.620
with other librarians and complain about the
people that they work with.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.720
And so we can go to a library conference and
just buy a booth, which is a fairly expensive

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.630
thing to do, but every single person who walks
by is a potential customer.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:19.730
And so at the beginning we would go to library
conferences and literally sign up a thousand

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.090
people over the course of four days to read
the strip just by getting them to write their

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:28.093
email name and then we'd add 'em to our email
list and start delivering it.

00:28:28.093 --> 00:28:32.610
And other cartoonists I know have comic strips
that are broader and I think much better than

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.800
ours in, in every way, it's just that they
can't go to a conference and do that.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:42.280
And one of my favorites is a comic strip called
Sheldon which is about an eight year old billionaire

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.810
and his pet duck who talks and it's, is really
the most beautiful, heartwarming, funny thing.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:50.490
It's very nerdy too, but he, there's just
not that boy billionaire conference he can

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.770
go to to find his audience.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:53.770
[laughter]

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.580
Also the Unshelved audience was very predisposed
to buying books. And so after we'd been doing

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.260
this just for a year, we decided to publish
our first book and we did it ourselves.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.990
We just found this printer up in Canada that
gave us a good price. You know we just spun

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:13.390
the big wheel and we said, "What the heck?"
And it was, it's very expensive comparatively

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.611
to not spending anything which is what we
had been doing. It's a big investment; we

00:29:16.611 --> 00:29:20.220
printed out 3,000 copies, but over the course
of just a couple of weeks, even before the

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.590
book went to the printer, before we actually
had to write the check to the printer, we'd

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:28.840
already pre-sold enough books from our audience
to pay for the entire print run.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.900
And, and that, that pattern has been, it's
happened ever since. It's all the, all the

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.470
stars were in alignment on that one.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.730
And I'll tell you, you go back and look at
the, the books you have are our latest book,

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.110
and I think I've actually become a pretty
good cartoonist, but you go back and look

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.780
at volume one and it is pretty primitive stuff.
It is not the worst stuff you'll find on the

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.520
Internet, but it is, it is pretty primitive
 - I think our writing was actually okay from

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.690
the beginning, we were both very concentrating
on the writing - but I was, I hadn't drawn

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:51.870
in years. In fact my writing had definitely,
my, my drawing had taken a dip and if you

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:59.540
go look at my old stuff you'd go like, "Wow,
he used to draw pretty well, what happened?"

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.540
[laughter]

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:03.170
But practice makes better and over the last
eight years I've probably kinda hit that 10,000

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:07.840
hour mark that Malcolm Gladwell talks about
in "Outliers", which is where your, your brain

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.131
circuit neurologically organizes around a
skill in such a way. And I, I think I'm actually

00:30:12.131 --> 00:30:16.190
an expert cartoonist, still not like anywhere
near the best artist around, but good enough

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:21.050
to actually tell the story, draw the characters
reasonably resembling what they look like

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.050
yesterday. So -

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.981
But I was lucky enough to, we were lucky enough
to have an audience that kind of went with

00:30:25.981 --> 00:30:30.570
us on the journey, watched me, watched me
learn to draw, watched me jump off the cliff

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:34.360
and, and build my parachute in real time [inaudible].

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.360
[pause]

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.800
After I'd been doing the comic strip for awhile
people said, "Well aren't you gonna do something

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:47.980
about the software industry? You worked there
for like 20 years." And I, I, I, I wasn't

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.530
even interested for awhile. Like I would,
I'd been doing, I mean I was doing it for

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:55.240
a while, I was doing both for awhile. And
the last thing I wanted to do was kind of

00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:00.020
take my work home and then do more of it.
I kind of needed the escape from it and I

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.240
think I also in retrospect needed some perspective
on it.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:08.120
It's very hard to look around at the stuff
you're in and have any perspective.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.550
And I had, I had left and then come back to
the software industry, but as I was preparing

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:17.470
to leave again, I actually felt I had enough
perspective and I started to spin up the next

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:23.770
comic strip, which has become "Not Invented
Here" which will be launched on September.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:28.750
And that was an interesting process. I started
taking notes about these characters and what

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:34.030
I ended up doing it reaching back into that
comic strip that I did in, in college, the

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:38.010
one about the two guys; 'cause I liked their
relationship and so the idea I came up which

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.520
was a very simple pitch was about these two
guys and the comic strip has actually changed

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.940
quite a bit from this, but these two guys
who have started four or five companies together

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.770
and each one had gone down in flames. Like
horribly and terribly burning every bridge

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.120
along the way.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.120
[laughter]

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.570
And so they were stuck working at this IT
company. And these guys, at least one of them

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:57.390
was very talented, it wasn't clear about the
other one.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.390
[laughter]

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.320
But they, they're a team, and they always
went everywhere together. And so they're working

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.710
at some, I don't know, some IT company, I,
at one point I, they were like in the IT department

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:09.270
of a shoe company. It was just gonna be the
most banal possible place to end up as a developer,

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.840
but they literally had no other choice 'cause
no one else would hire them or go anywhere

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.840
near them.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.230
And then while they're there they like they
have the idea and this is the one. Like they

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.670
actually had a good idea. And it's gonna go
someplace, but they couldn't do anything because

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.870
no, they couldn't attract any capital, no
one would go anywhere near them. So they decide

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.020
to start the company from within the other
company.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.020
[laughter]

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.510
And they were gonna, which I know never really
happens, right?

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.510
[laughter]

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:33.020
But they'd be working at their day jobs and
like in their day jobs they'd be working on

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.240
the other thing. I even had an intern who
was gonna come work for their startup, but

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:45.440
like on the grounds of the company they were
working for.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.440
[laughter]

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:56.690
And I thought this was very clever and a good
idea and I still think it's a good idea. In

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:06.960
retrospect, kind of an unimaginable, unmanageably
complex situation for a comic strip. I think

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:18.500
it would work for a sitcom where you can explain
a lot more, but it's too hard if you've only

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:25.060
got three or four panels to establish the
context of, are we talking about the company

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:30.340
they're working for or the company the company
within a company that they're working for?

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.340
[pause]

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:41.240
But anyway, this was the idea I had and for
awhile I was gonna both write and draw this

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.240
one.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:55.960
Now, Unshelved I, I worked with Gene who writes
it and I end up editing a lot of his stuff

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:15.000
and then I draw it. And as I started spinning
up this idea for the new comic strip I thought,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:28.430
"Well I can work with Gene again. He could
help me write this one; I'll source more of

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:29.840
the material."

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:40.399
And as I looked at it, I just didn't wanna
draw another comic strip. I, the drawing has

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:48.470
never been my favorite part. I like it fine,
but I didn't really wanna double my drawing

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:49.470
workload.

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:56.090
And Gene didn't really have anything to add
in terms of the genre. Like he didn't know

00:34:56.090 --> 00:35:07.720
anything about the domain; he's not from the
software world. And so what I decided to do

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:16.920
was to kind of switch roles and hire or at
least work with an artist.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:28.321
And so I started hunting around after I had
developed the original idea and I found a

00:35:28.321 --> 00:35:35.500
guy from Tacoma named Mark Monlux who I really
like his stuff; he's an illustrator but he'd

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:42.000
done some comic strips and I'd met him at
some cartoon events.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.860
And we worked together for a couple of months
and he did some stuff that I really liked

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:56.880
and then after a while we were both, we were
like, "This is not working out." Because he

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.960
was a professional illustrator and when you're
starting something like a comic strip it's

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.370
a lot like starting a startup. It actually
takes a lot of hours, you're not gonna get

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:08.301
paid for a while, and you're kind of building
up equity and that's about it.

00:36:08.301 --> 00:36:14.220
I couldn't, certainly couldn't afford to pay
for his time, and eventually, I eventually

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:20.070
he said, "Yeah, I just can't, I can't put
all this time into something that I don't

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.540
know is gonna pay for me and my family."

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.320
And literally we just had this conversation
and the next day I found out that one of my

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:38.950
favorite cartoonists a guy named Paul Southworth;
he did a great comic strip called Ugly Hill,

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:46.520
just beautiful; and so professional illustrators
just love this guy because the things he,

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.840
the things he did were amazing.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.470
He was drawing that one to a close and he
had been doing some drawing for another artist,

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:55.430
for Scott Kurtz who does PDP. And Scott has
a sort of side comic strip called Ding which

00:36:55.430 --> 00:37:03.230
is about a bunch of people in world of war
craft, so it's sort of, the comic strip of

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:07.500
them in world of warcraft having their adventures.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:14.230
And Scott had hired Paul to draw that strip
and that didn't work out for some reason and

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:21.630
so Paul had just said, "Oh, I'm not gonna
do that anymore." And I jumped on the phone

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:29.440
and called him up and said, "You should come
work on this comic strip with me."

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.850
And so he and I started working together about,
about a year ago something like that. And

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:43.500
starting we did all the process all over on
this thing. And in doing so the, he helped

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:51.410
simplify this overly convoluted story about
these two guys and their software company,

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:58.940
and it, it simplified to just two guys working
at some unnamed and sort of unknown software

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:13.670
company; became a little simpler and a little
less epic and a little more conducive to the

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.000
medium of comic strips.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:22.930
One of the things I thought I'd do if we can
get our AV working is I'll show you some development

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.490
of the characters or one of the characters
on -

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.490
[pause]

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.490
There we go.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:37.380
Okay, so to back up we, I started this comic
strip in, in college and we had these two

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:45.060
characters they were called Bob and Dave.
And Bob was, Bob was actually the more clever

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:55.180
of the two and the more manipulative of the
two and Dave was the one who did all the work.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:00.890
And I basically liked this balance between
the two. And as I developed the strip it ended

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:08.120
up looking a lot like the relationship between
what at Microsoft we call program managers

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.240
and developers.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:16.770
There's the people who say what to do and
then the people who actually do it. So, so

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:23.140
we kinda went with that and, and the development
is that over time the program manager character

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:28.800
who is now called Owen, became dumber and
dumber and dumber.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.800
[laughter]

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:36.710
To the point where it's like how does this
guy remember to breathe? And then the developer

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:44.450
character got very sort of, well he got, he
actually got smarter because he became a better

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:55.550
developer; but maybe simpler in the ways of,
of humans. I summed it all up software developers

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:58.220
sometimes have challenges in those respects.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.220
[laughter]

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.450
Looks at her husband.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:07.230
So I thought I'd show you the development
of Owen. So Owen actually starts off as, I

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:18.850
actually flipped the two, the two visuals
of the two characters; Bob went away in the

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:25.220
visual and Dave survived to become Owen, and
he's a character I always liked drawing.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:31.310
This is an Unshelved strip. So I'll read to
you: "I'm the smartest person in this library.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:41.710
Next to me you are all intellectual Lilliputians.
I need a book but it's got to be challenging."

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:46.390
And he says: "Then let me show you the book
on manners."

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:47.390
[laughter]

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:53.980
And so this is the character who used to be
Dave in the comic strip. And he just showed

00:40:53.980 --> 00:41:05.020
up here 'cause I always enjoyed drawing him.
I always enjoyed his little lip of hair he

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.020
had.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.020
[laughter]

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.020
Which is almost a hat, but not quite.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.020
[laughter]

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.350
And then so as I started working and sketching
on the, the new strip, I sketched in my sketchpad

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:19.490
and here's a page from my sketchpad. My [inaudible]
of the character who'd become Owen and he

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:28.910
basically, guy with, guy with, and also he
looked more and more like me is what happened

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.970
as I started drawing more -

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:31.970
[laughter]

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:38.420
His hair started receding, he got a goatee,
and his eyes be, became very expressive, in

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:51.090
Unshelved most of my characters just have
dots for eyes, but I really wanted to have

00:41:51.090 --> 00:42:01.360
a different look for this strip; a little
bit more realistic. This is when I still thought

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.690
I was gonna draw it.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:23.119
So then after I decided not to draw it and
I started working with Mark, he did his take

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:32.540
on it and we ended up with a different character
design; here's a couple of panels. And so

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:40.260
[inaudiable] "Rich client or thin client?
Sir, if I may I agree with Brook Astor who

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.109
said you can never be too rich or too thin."

00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:45.109
[laughter]

00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:50.280
And so that's, that's Owen there standing
up and it turns out he was not invited to

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:55.390
the meeting. That's the punch line of this,
this strip.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:56.390
[laughter]

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.310
So Mark has, I actually like the simplicity
of Mark's style and it could not be more different

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.930
than the next artist I worked with, Paul.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:09.300
So after Mark and I parted ways, I actually
didn't show Mark's designs to Paul, 'cause

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:17.510
I didn't want to pollute the waters. I just
showed him my design. And he sent me back

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:26.190
a bunch of sketches of Owen. And so character
design is kind of what Paul does; he's, he's

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:33.040
really good at it and I try to give him as
free reign as possible.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:41.510
So he took the very basic thing and did a
lot of variations on it. And impossibly fast.

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:53.080
Really, I mean I could be like, "Paul, I need
a new character." Pfft - ten seconds later

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.140
he's just got it in front of him.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.140
[laughter]

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.380
Both his talent and his work ethic are, surpass
mine.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:05.619
So I think I went with, I think of all of
these the ones I personally liked, I'm looking

00:44:05.619 --> 00:44:13.210
at them now – but it's funny because the
Hawaiian shirt and the moving over to Desmond

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:17.859
the other character - I guess the one I liked
was kind of the bottom left and the upper

00:44:17.859 --> 00:44:18.859
left.

00:44:18.859 --> 00:44:19.859
So I took that -

00:44:19.859 --> 00:44:20.859
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [unintelligible]

00:44:20.859 --> 00:44:21.859
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: What's that?

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:23.060
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [unintelligible]

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.040
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: It does say butt chin, yeah.
Yeah -

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.040
[laughter]

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.040
that's one of the [inaudible].

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.040
[laughter]

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.260
He kind of has a butt nose now actually.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:42.190
So I took one and I, so this is my, I took
his sketch and I Photoshopped it, and I made

00:44:42.190 --> 00:45:07.720
it look a little bit more like I wanted it.
So one of the things I liked is that he's

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:18.840
sort of semi-well dressed. Like he's the guy
who should be going to the meetings in a tie

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:26.609
and stuff; he doesn't really take it very
seriously. So he's just kind of got a dumpy,

00:45:26.609 --> 00:45:33.500
well dressed look; and a hat 'cause his hair
is thinning; totally unlike mine.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:43.740
And I sent that to Paul, and Paul liked that
and he ended up refining it into this guy.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:47.820
This is starting to look, this is starting
to resemble the final character. It's, so

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:52.262
his lines are all cleaned up; but the nose
and the chin are about to change, 'cause this

00:45:52.262 --> 00:45:53.262
is what is looks like now.

00:45:53.262 --> 00:45:54.262
[pause]

00:45:54.262 --> 00:45:59.430
And so that whole process took, well I mean
in a way that process began 20 years ago,

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:14.820
but that last part of the process took probably
a couple of weeks at least to get to, to get

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:20.500
to that point. And the first couple of, he
drew a couple of non-event [inaudible] strips

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:24.170
which he then redrew later, in fact we have
[inaudible].

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:30.130
Two different versions of the strip and it's
amazing how much the character design changed

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:35.400
between then, and then he ended up with characters
designs he was happy to start with so launched

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.410
in September.

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:43.220
And even so you go back and look at the, and
this is a guy who's been drawing his whole

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:49.290
life, you go look at the strip in September
21st, which is when we launched, and the strip

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:56.670
even just a few months later and it's amazing
how much the look of the strip has changed

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.250
and the characters have changed.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:01.350
It's just something that happens and I certainly
noticed it with my own work that as I draw

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:06.500
the characters everyday, I start doing shortcuts
and noticing the things that really work and

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:15.150
don't work about the characters and there's
nothing, you will never get it right ahead

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:23.220
of time. I actually think it's a lot like
writing code. It's one thing to kind of plan

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:31.130
that ahead of time, this is how it's gonna
be, and then when you get in the trenches

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:37.730
on it, you start rounding the corners and
figuring out what works and what doesn't work.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:42.820
So I'm really enjoying writing the new strip,
I love Unshelved and I don't wanna in any

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:48.970
way imply that there's something wrong with
it; I've been doing it for eight years and

00:47:48.970 --> 00:48:08.490
I still love the characters and in fact we're
gonna, we're gonna shake things a little bit

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:13.790
in the next year. We're gonna have more things
happen to the characters than have been happening.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:19.461
In part because we've been doing this strip
for eight years and we need to make it a little

00:48:19.461 --> 00:48:20.461
more interesting for ourselves.

00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:23.560
But what's fun for me about writing Not Invented
Here is a very different strip. Is it absolutely

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:31.790
is a way to channel my experience of working
in the software industry. It was just a place

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:38.180
I was never like, never quite found my, my
home in, but then I had lots of experiences

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:39.180
there.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:47.210
I was a developer for many years, I was a
manager, I was a program manager; my last

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:48.550
job I had, I did user, user interface design;
my last job was actually a [inaudible] trader

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.290
for an executive over at Microsoft because
I enjoyed public speaking and I'm, I'm good

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:56.690
at, at taking things and figuring out how
to talk about them. But it was, it was infuriating

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:00.980
to work with 19 different marketing groups
and stakeholders and try to figure out what

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.470
to say. So that was just sort of life at a
big company; or at least that big company.

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:08.560
But it's a lot of material. But the comic
strip's not really about the software industry

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.270
it's really about these two guys and their
friendship. And as I first started developing

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:17.270
it, at first it resembled the working relationship
of, of myself and Gene, the guy who I write

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:18.270
Unshelved with, because that's the working
relationship that I have the most direct knowledge

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:19.270
with.

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:20.270
But what's really interesting is that the
relationship between these two characters,

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.270
between Owen and Desmond, the program manager
and the developer, very closely resembles

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:22.270
the working relationship of a writer and an
artist. Like scarily close. As, as I rate

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:23.270
these things, the metaphor is, is, or the
analogy is very close.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:24.270
And so very quickly Paul and I sud, realized
that, that Desmond is Paul and Owen is me.

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:25.270
And I'm not quite as dumb as Owen, but -

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.270
but the, the, the relationship between the
two, and their, the things they perform. And

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:27.270
so Owen goes to Desmond and says, "Well here's
this thing we're gonna do and I've, I've figured

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:28.270
out here's the basic approach and here's what
I want it to look like." And Desmond's like,

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:29.270
"Well, that won't actually work, but let me
tell you what would work."

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:31.430
And that whole thing is exactly like what
happens when I go to Paul and I'm like, "Well

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.332
I have this idea about how to, how to do this
and I think it's gonna look something like

00:49:33.332 --> 00:49:34.332
that." Paul says, "Well that won't actually
work, but here's something that will work."

00:49:34.332 --> 00:49:35.910
And so, and so the characters, we're starting
to kind of write each character not exactly

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:36.910
separately, but Desmond has taken on more
and more personality characteristics of Paul,

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:37.910
and Owen is taking on more personality characteristics
of me. And, and the program manager/developer,

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:38.910
writer/artist relationship is what's coming
to the front.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:39.910
And so that's fun, because that, and I think
not only is that fun to write, but I think

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.970
it's fun to read something that feels real.
And the more, the more it is about the, the

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:46.980
very true interaction of, of myself and my
creative partner, the more it's not gonna

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.543
feel like some academic exercise and talking
about software.

00:49:50.543 --> 00:49:52.040
Very quickly, yeah, so, so, there's a sort
of an obvious business model for this comic

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.210
strip which is to appeal to the people who
work in software. But it's also a challenge

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:59.090
because I don't want it to just be a comic
strip for software industry, although I'd

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:01.230
be thrilled if it, if it became popular there.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:03.680
Because it's, it's actually written pretty
broadly. And even when they're talking about

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.361
software stuff you could almost have a word
bubble that says, "Gobbledygook here." And

00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:09.361
the people who from outside the software industry
can just be like, "Well I don't understand

00:50:09.361 --> 00:50:10.361
that word bubble, but I totally get the relationship."
And that's, that's how I try to write it most

00:50:10.361 --> 00:50:14.920
of the time. I try to drop in a little, a
few little rewards to the people that know

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.930
what they're talking about.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.440
The same thing on Unshelved; sometimes we'll
talk about library stuff, but I guess you

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.550
have to be a librarian to understand. But
very seldom; most of the time it's just a

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:29.099
background; and it just stays in the background
and that's my goal.

00:50:29.099 --> 00:50:32.820
So that is about all I, I brought to talk
about. I, we have a few minutes so if anyone

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:33.910
has any questions.

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:34.910
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:35.910
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: Desmond.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:36.910
[pause]

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:37.910
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:38.910
[laughter]

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:39.910
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: He's, he has an unusual head
design.

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:40.910
[laughter]

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:41.910
It's true. And it's, it is actually the most
consistent piece of feedback I get from people.

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:42.910
It took me awhile to get used to Desmond's
head.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:43.910
[pause]

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:44.910
It looks something like, it looks something
like this.

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:45.910
[pause]

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:46.910
And it's not exactly how people's heads are
shaped, but I see -

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.910
[laughter]

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:48.910
I see going back to my original sketches for,
for Desmond how this sort of came about because

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:49.910
my idea for Desmond is that his head would
be the same shape as his body. And so my,

00:50:49.910 --> 00:51:03.720
my, my original shape was like this; it was
more like a human head. And then his body

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:10.790
would also be kind of the same. It would be
like this and he's have this big belly. Alright,

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:11.790
it sort of looks like a developer to me.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:12.790
[laughter]

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:16.780
And, and I think Paul loved that and as he
usually does just kind of magnifies and makes

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.780
him come real.

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.670
It's one of these things where if you get
too extreme of characters and the eye cannot

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:29.150
recognize it as human, and I think Desmond
is actually just on the edge. But I, but I,

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.343
I got used to it pretty quickly and I just
assume other people will too, but I think

00:51:31.343 --> 00:51:32.343
that design will probably evolve over time
as well.

00:51:32.343 --> 00:51:33.343
I know it wasn't actually a question you asked,
but -

00:51:33.343 --> 00:51:34.343
[laughter]

00:51:34.343 --> 00:51:35.343
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:51:35.343 --> 00:51:36.343
[pause]

00:51:36.343 --> 00:51:37.343
Okay. Anything else?

00:51:37.343 --> 00:51:38.343
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:51:38.343 --> 00:51:39.343
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: What's that?

00:51:39.343 --> 00:51:40.343
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:51:40.343 --> 00:51:41.343
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: No, no other, there, there's
been a couple, but nothing, no serious effort.

00:51:41.343 --> 00:51:42.343
There's a, there's one done by a library page
called Turn The Page.

00:51:42.343 --> 00:51:43.343
[pause]

00:51:43.343 --> 00:51:44.343
Comedy writing is actually really hard; writing
a comic strip is hard. It's hard to if, if,

00:51:44.343 --> 00:51:45.343
if you try to be pithy on Twitter you know
what it's like to edit your thoughts down

00:51:45.343 --> 00:51:46.343
to the point where they fit in 140 character
slots and it's very much the same skill as

00:51:46.343 --> 00:51:47.343
writing a comic strip.

00:51:47.343 --> 00:51:48.343
I wrote a, I was reading, I won't name names,
I was reading a comic strip on the Web the

00:51:48.343 --> 00:51:49.343
other day that was a little political thing
and it, it literally was this conversation

00:51:49.343 --> 00:51:50.343
I think it was, "How dumb is Sarah Palin?"
And, and the President says, "How dumb is

00:51:50.343 --> 00:51:51.343
she?" He's like, "When she went out, she had,
to speak the other day, she had written on

00:51:51.343 --> 00:51:52.343
her hands, 'breathe in, breathe out, breathe
in, breathe out.'

00:51:52.343 --> 00:51:53.343
[laughter]

00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:54.343
Which is okay, it's not a bad joke. And the
other character says, "She's nutty."

00:51:54.343 --> 00:51:55.343
[pause]

00:51:55.343 --> 00:51:56.343
Oh, it made me so sad.

00:51:56.343 --> 00:51:57.343
[laughter]

00:51:57.343 --> 00:51:58.343
Why couldn't he just leave it there? But that's
sort of, that instinct and that sense of how

00:51:58.343 --> 00:51:59.343
to, of how to write in an economy of words
is, is just something you get by doing it

00:51:59.343 --> 00:52:00.343
a lot; also reading 'em. I mean I've been
reading comics my whole life so I have probably

00:52:00.343 --> 00:52:01.343
a good sense of the rhythm of it, but again
going back to the stuff I was, I was working

00:52:01.343 --> 00:52:02.343
on eight or nine years ago, it's pretty bad.
It's amazing the number of words I would use

00:52:02.343 --> 00:52:03.343
to get across a simple message.

00:52:03.343 --> 00:52:04.343
And so, and so practice makes better. And
so people who, who come out with something

00:52:04.343 --> 00:52:05.343
I think they put it out and they instantly
compare it to what else is out there, and

00:52:05.343 --> 00:52:06.343
it's not as good and they're like "Oh, I guess
I'm not good at it." And it's sad because

00:52:06.343 --> 00:52:07.343
they're, they will get good at it; they'll
absolutely get better at it. You just can't

00:52:07.343 --> 00:52:08.343
not get better at something if you practice
it.

00:52:08.343 --> 00:52:09.343
But you have to stick it out and, and absolutely
with Unshelved we were lucky enough to have

00:52:09.343 --> 00:52:10.343
an audience that was willing to stick it out
with us, and, and sort of pay us indirectly

00:52:10.343 --> 00:52:11.343
along the way.

00:52:11.343 --> 00:52:12.343
[pause]

00:52:12.343 --> 00:52:13.343
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: So you mentioned that
[inaudible]

00:52:13.343 --> 00:52:14.343
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: Yeah.

00:52:14.343 --> 00:52:15.343
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:52:15.343 --> 00:52:16.343
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: There's an intellectual property
problem or a potential one actually. It's

00:52:16.343 --> 00:52:17.343
the sort of thing where it doesn't really
matter if you have the right on an intellectual

00:52:17.343 --> 00:52:18.343
property, it's whether you can afford to have
your lawyers prove that you have the right.

00:52:18.343 --> 00:52:19.343
[laughter]

00:52:19.343 --> 00:52:20.343
There was a, a little short, a funny little
short on the Web years ago, some little, it

00:52:20.343 --> 00:52:21.343
actually appeared on I think Cartoon Network
which was called Overdue. And it was a take

00:52:21.343 --> 00:52:22.343
off from Cops; it's just a librarian driving
around retrieving overdue books. Overdue - boom.

00:52:22.343 --> 00:52:23.343
That's was it; it was just a title and you
can't even, you can't trademark a title. You

00:52:23.343 --> 00:52:24.343
can trademark a title of an ongoing thing,
but not of like a book or a, just a of a short.

00:52:24.343 --> 00:52:25.343
And so we thought, "Okay, that's not too bad."
And so I called up the company. I actually

00:52:25.343 --> 00:52:26.343
found the company that made it; it was just
a little, little production company, and I,

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:27.343
I explained the situation and they said, "Absolutely.
We would sign whatever you want. We're never

00:52:27.343 --> 00:52:28.343
gonna pursue this." And they said, "Great.
We wanna get out first book out and we wanna,

00:52:28.343 --> 00:52:29.343
we're just incorporating right now." And they
said, "Great. Actually is this gonna take

00:52:29.343 --> 00:52:30.343
a few weeks 'cause we just got bought by Scholastic."

00:52:30.343 --> 00:52:31.343
[laughter]

00:52:31.343 --> 00:52:32.343
"And so it's gonna take a while and we're
gonna - so like the next day we walked in

00:52:32.343 --> 00:52:33.343
and we said, "We gotta change our name."

00:52:33.343 --> 00:52:34.343
[laughter]

00:52:34.343 --> 00:52:35.343
And honestly I don't, I don't think they particularly
were gonna pursue it or anything but we just

00:52:35.343 --> 00:52:36.343
couldn't afford the risk.

00:52:36.343 --> 00:52:37.343
So we had a poll among our readers and we
had everybody send it in; we got like 500,

00:52:37.343 --> 00:52:38.343
600 different suggestions. Many of which were
pretty bad, but some of which were really

00:52:38.343 --> 00:52:39.343
good.

00:52:39.343 --> 00:52:40.343
My personal favorite that we didn't do was
Shelf Life which is - but one of the big advantages

00:52:40.343 --> 00:52:41.343
Unshelved had is it had an open domain name.

00:52:41.343 --> 00:52:42.343
So that, that will often trump other things
 -

00:52:42.343 --> 00:52:43.343
[laughter]

00:52:43.343 --> 00:52:44.343
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:52:44.343 --> 00:52:45.343
and for Not Invented Here we, we went through
a similar thing; originally it was gonna be

00:52:45.343 --> 00:52:46.343
called Company Town, because it took place
in Silicon Valley which is a town with companies.

00:52:46.343 --> 00:52:47.343
And then we, we found some stuff, that was
a little too close and again I couldn't get

00:52:47.343 --> 00:52:48.343
the URL for it, and so we brainstormed for
awhile and came up with Not Invented Here

00:52:48.343 --> 00:52:49.343
and NotInventedHere.com was owned by one of
those companies that scoops up domain names

00:52:49.343 --> 00:52:50.343
and forces you to pay for it.

00:52:50.343 --> 00:52:51.343
And then somebody suggested that we get notinventedhe.re
which is an island called Réunion for a French

00:52:51.343 --> 00:52:52.343
protectorate. And so we got that and, and
then, eventually did buy notinventedhere.com

00:52:52.343 --> 00:52:53.343
from one of those companies. I think they
got a little desperate as the economy got

00:52:53.343 --> 00:52:54.343
worse and I got it for a reasonable price.

00:52:54.343 --> 00:52:55.343
[laughter]

00:52:55.343 --> 00:52:56.343
Yeah, the, absolutely probably the most frustrating
thing of a new project is an [inaudible].

00:52:56.343 --> 00:52:57.343
Because the names are important and, and we
wanted something that sounded funny and invoked

00:52:57.343 --> 00:52:58.343
something of it and Not Invented Here is like
in the industry it's a great name, outside

00:52:58.343 --> 00:52:59.343
the industry a lot of people don't know what
that means and they just kind of do this - that's

00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:00.343
okay because they're probably not gonna read
it anyway but, as a name I think it's superior

00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:01.343
to Company Town for invoking something about
the strip.

00:53:01.343 --> 00:53:02.343
And it is kind of funny and, and also very
appropriate for me because I, I do everything

00:53:02.343 --> 00:53:03.343
myself. Like I totally wrote my own blog engine
and comic strip. I just wrote my, I just rewrote

00:53:03.343 --> 00:53:04.343
my Ecommerce engine. Partly because I -

00:53:04.343 --> 00:53:05.343
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:53:05.343 --> 00:53:06.343
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: What's that?

00:53:06.343 --> 00:53:07.343
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:53:07.343 --> 00:53:08.343
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: Well, I actually do it, I actually
do it intentionally because, because I'm writing

00:53:08.343 --> 00:53:09.343
about programmers and I feel I need to stay
connected to what's going on.

00:53:09.343 --> 00:53:10.343
And like I just did a cutting edge MVC application
and I actually sort of know what's going on

00:53:10.343 --> 00:53:11.343
with that now. Which I wouldn't. So, also
if this doesn't work out it'd be nice to go

00:53:11.343 --> 00:53:12.343
back to that industry.

00:53:12.343 --> 00:53:13.343
[laughter]

00:53:13.343 --> 00:53:14.343
So it's good to keep my skills going. Also
the other ones weren't good enough.

00:53:14.343 --> 00:53:15.343
[laughter]

00:53:15.343 --> 00:53:16.343
It's not an educated thing, absolutely all
through it I'm like, "They don't have the

00:53:16.343 --> 00:53:17.343
exact perfect [inaudible]. I'm gonna have
to write about that. This was, it was like

00:53:17.343 --> 00:53:18.343
the worst possible use of my time."

00:53:18.343 --> 00:53:19.343
[laughter]

00:53:19.343 --> 00:53:20.343
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:53:20.343 --> 00:53:21.343
&gt;&gt;Bill Barnes: So it's sort of an ironic thing
for me because [inaudible]

00:53:21.343 --> 00:53:22.343
Alright. Well thanks for comin' up guys.

00:53:22.343 --> 00:53:22.344
[applause]
