you could also probably go either into

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
you could also probably go either into
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.979

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
difficult to land on the polar ice caps
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.350
difficult to land on the polar ice caps
because the terrain is quite rocky also

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360

Rock retrieval we need to actually take

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
Rock retrieval we need to actually take
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.179

existed on Mars we have Mars rocks right

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
existed on Mars we have Mars rocks right
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.859
existed on Mars we have Mars rocks right
here on the planet Earth and when you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869
here on the planet Earth and when you
 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.170

slice them open you see little tiny

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180

squiggly things that look like
 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.819
squiggly things that look like
multi-celled organisms but we're not

multi-celled organisms but we're not
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.670

the questions we have to have Rock

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
the questions we have to have Rock
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.160
the questions we have to have Rock
retrieval and after that I think perhaps

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
retrieval and after that I think perhaps
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.620
retrieval and after that I think perhaps
we should put a blimp or a helicopter on

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
we should put a blimp or a helicopter on
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020
we should put a blimp or a helicopter on
Mars now the atmosphere of Mars is quite

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
Mars now the atmosphere of Mars is quite
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.260
Mars now the atmosphere of Mars is quite
thin only 1% the atmospheric pressure

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
thin only 1% the atmospheric pressure
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.590
thin only 1% the atmospheric pressure
here on the planet Earth so the wings of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
here on the planet Earth so the wings of
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780
here on the planet Earth so the wings of
a helicopter or the size of a blimp

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
a helicopter or the size of a blimp
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.749
a helicopter or the size of a blimp
would have to be different to compensate

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
would have to be different to compensate
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.670
would have to be different to compensate
for that and then of course we should

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
for that and then of course we should
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.130
for that and then of course we should
try for a manned mission to Mars but

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
try for a manned mission to Mars but
 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.109
try for a manned mission to Mars but
let's be real it's going to be expensive

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
let's be real it's going to be expensive
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.499
let's be real it's going to be expensive
and it will take time it costs $10,000

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
and it will take time it costs $10,000
 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.449
and it will take time it costs $10,000
to put a pound of anything into

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
to put a pound of anything into
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.300
to put a pound of anything into
near-earth orbit

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310
near-earth orbit
 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.070

imagine your body made out of solid gold

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080
imagine your body made out of solid gold
 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.820
imagine your body made out of solid gold
and that's the cost to put you into

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830
and that's the cost to put you into
 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.550
and that's the cost to put you into
orbit around the planet Earth to put you

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560
orbit around the planet Earth to put you
 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.260
orbit around the planet Earth to put you
on the moon cost about a hundred

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270
on the moon cost about a hundred
 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.839
on the moon cost about a hundred
thousand dollars a pound to put you on

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849
thousand dollars a pound to put you on
 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.559
thousand dollars a pound to put you on
Mars costs about a million dollars a

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569
Mars costs about a million dollars a
 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.770
Mars costs about a million dollars a
pound so think twice before you think

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780
pound so think twice before you think
 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.360
pound so think twice before you think
that we're going to go to Mars with

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370
that we're going to go to Mars with
 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.970
that we're going to go to Mars with
astronauts in the next few years it's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980
astronauts in the next few years it's
 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.100
astronauts in the next few years it's
going to take decades to prepare for a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110
going to take decades to prepare for a
 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.860
