LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.170
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.970
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.950
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.350
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.840
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.380
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.400
and why they do it.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.450
And today, we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.870
Hi.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.078
And welcome to this episode
of Coffee with a Googler.

00:00:26.078 --> 00:00:28.510
Today, we're reporting actually
from inside Google's Cloud

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.606
itself, or at least one of the
data centers that powers it.

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:32.980
And I'm meeting
with Greg Wilson.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.240
He's a manager on the Developer
Advocacy Team for the Google

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.470
Cloud Platform.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.520
But he's not one of your
typical pointy haired managers.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.020
You've worked on
lots of cool stuff.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.130
And you're going to tell
us all about it today.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.670
GREG WILSON: You bet.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.930
Yep, thanks for having me.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.305
LAURENCE MORONEY: So tell us
what is it that you do here?

00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:50.060
GREG WILSON: So I manage a team
of people, developer advocates,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.850
for Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.300
There's about 18 of us total.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.107
And our job is to go
out into the world

00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:01.440
and make sure people know all
the cool things that we're

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.692
doing with cloud platform.

00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:08.130
It's innovating very quickly--
announcements every other week.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.661
And we try to get
the word out there.

00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:12.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now
there's a lot of diversity

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.680
around cloud developers.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.680
There are so many different
types of developers.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.960
And it must be really hard
to have a core message

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.394
to reach all of them.

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:21.060
What are the opportunities
to reach out?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.210
GREG WILSON: Yeah, it is.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.240
It's very unique for
our team, specifically,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.590
in Google is that we're
dealing with a platform that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.070
has a different meaning to a
lot of different audiences.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.640
So for example, no JS
developers see cloud

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.450
in a specific way,
certain parts of cloud

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.820
that meet their needs for apps.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.930
Similar with Ruby, Java.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.570
But even things like
data scientists,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.824
people that are looking at six
billion rows of transit data

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:50.990
and they want to draw some
intelligence out of that.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.680
So we're trying to get them
interested in it as well.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.180
It's cool.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.800
We have some amazing services
around all of those things.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.824
So it's not just that we talk
to developers in one language.

00:02:01.824 --> 00:02:04.240
We have to be able to speak
in multiple types of languages

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.330
to multiple types of audiences.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
that's quite a challenge.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.070
But you've got a big team,
well equipped team for it.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.861
GREG WILSON: It is.

00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:10.710
And it's fun too.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.360
Because you get to see a
lot of interesting things

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.780
that people are
doing when you're

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.540
providing the computing
power, the CPUs,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.750
to drive all this stuff.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.480
You see some pretty
amazing things.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.980
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now, you mentioned

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.210
that you're constantly
releasing new things.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.270
And there's a constant drumbeat
of great new technologies

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.770
coming out.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.539
What kind of recent
ones have you done?

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.330
GREG WILSON: Gosh, so
many things going on.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.500
The recent ones that we've been
doing some activity around-- we

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.952
have 32 CPU VMs now.

00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:41.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice, nice.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.826
GREG WILSON: Matter
of fact, one of them

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:45.650
is 208 gigabytes of
memory with 32 CPUs.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Virtual.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.490
GREG WILSON: Yeah, that's the
gadget guy inside of me just

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.700
loves that, having
all this computing

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.770
power at my fingertips.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.597
And it's one thing to
think about a 32 CPU VM,

00:02:57.597 --> 00:02:59.930
that you start thinking about
that in terms of clusters.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.150
I want to have 1,000 of
those doing something.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.970
It's mind boggling
what you can do.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.112
And it's exciting for us.

00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:07.570
And we try to share
that excitement

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.970
with the people we talk to.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.990
And then around the
same time, we also

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.440
introduced a new feature
called local SSDs.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.290
So it's extremely high
I/O bandwidth drives

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.880
that are physically connected
to your virtual machine.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.838
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:27.220
GREG WILSON: We're talking
170,000 sustained IOPS, which

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.310
if you know anything about
disk drives and hardware,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.400
that's a stunning number.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.400
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.510
And I know you've been
putting all this together

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.470
to try and come up
with some scenarios

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.910
that you can show it off,
that numbers of CPUs an IOPS

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.495
might not mean much
to other folks.

00:03:43.495 --> 00:03:45.620
But the other stuff that
you've been building does.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.330
So can you share that?

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.650
GREG WILSON: Yeah.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.870
And that's one of the
challenges of our team,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.946
is that how do we let people
know beyond the specs?

00:03:52.946 --> 00:03:54.320
We can show them
a lot of numbers

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.444
of what the stuff is about.

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:58.220
But until they can see the kind
of things you can do with it,

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.760
it doesn't really make
sense to them sometimes.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.727
So yeah, we're always thinking
about how can we show this off?

00:04:03.727 --> 00:04:05.060
What type of demos can we build?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.110
What kind of story can we
build, more importantly?

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.200
For example, when the
32 CPU DMs launched,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.810
we found some software
called Prime C that

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.060
generates prime numbers,
using some neat very simple

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.850
algorithms.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.280
And we generated a trillion
prime numbers in 17 minutes

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.489
on a 32 CPU machine.

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:27.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: A
trillion in 17 minutes.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.530
GREG WILSON: A trillion, yeah.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.579
And it was funny.

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:30.370
I tweeted about in.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.930
And the tweet was, I generated
to trillion prime numbers.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.690
Because I can.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.150
Why not?

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: And you
said it took 17 minutes.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.410
GREG WILSON: 17
minutes for that.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.220
The software, thankfully,
supports multi-core.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.440
So it was able to take
advantage of those 32 CPUs.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.980
It's really very much a
CPU intensive operation

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.640
where there's other things that
also take advantage of memory.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.290
And you can mix and match a
lot of the things that we offer

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.700
and compute to do that.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, to rent
a 32 CPU machine for 17 minutes-

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.830
how much would that cost?

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.580
GREG WILSON: Well thankfully,
we have the per minute billing

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.330
on that.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.500
I think the hourly rate for the
208 gig one is anywhere from

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.180
a buck, 65, to 2.10
an hour, or something.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.030
It's really
inexpensive considering

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.920
what you're getting.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.420
And that's part of
the Google scale.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.880
I mean, we were able to pass on
that scale in incredible cost

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.850
savings.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.300
And so what that means
for geeks like me

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.710
is that I can get my hands
on some serious hardware

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.250
for the price of
a cup of coffee.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.380
I have a lot of
fun in 17 minutes.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah,
that trillion prime numbers

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.360
must've been pennies at the
rate you just mentioned.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.040
It's incredible.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.790
GREG WILSON: Yeah.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.535
So what is that, 1/4 of 2 bucks?

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:48.640
So yeah, 50 cents.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: How many
universities, and stuff,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.470
have to go and invest hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.620
in infrastructure when
you can do it this way?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.420
GREG WILSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.040
And that's the whole
idea behind cloud.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.165
And that's why there's so
much excitement in cloud,

00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:01.620
not just Google, but a lot of
the other big names in cloud

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.510
doing the same thing.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.952
It's a very exciting space,
which is what drew me into it.

00:06:04.952 --> 00:06:07.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: And you
took this sort of next step

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.882
on pay day.

00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:10.215
I've heard some of the stuff
you've been doing for that.

00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:10.965
GREG WILSON: Yeah.

00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:15.290
So sort of a funny story--
one of the guys on my team,

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.800
Ray Tsang-- he and I were
at South by Southwest

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.980
with some other
folks from Google.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.700
South by Southwest
was a few weeks ago

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.720
in Austin, Texas--
fantastic event.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.340
And we were literally hanging
out at a bar, 11:00 p.m.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.959
At night.

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: When
all the best ideas happen.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.920
GREG WILSON: When all
the best ideas happen--

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.150
having a couple of drinks.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.137
And someone mentioned that
the following day was Pi Day.

00:06:40.137 --> 00:06:41.720
And Ray and I were
like, man, I wonder

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.219
if we could do
something with Pi Day

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.830
like we did with
the prime numbers.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.960
And we said, well,
first of all, we

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.668
got to have some
software that can do it.

00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:48.640
We have ours.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.870
We can't go write software
to generate digits of pi.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.910
Plus, it's not trivial.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.444
It's pretty advanced
mathematics.

00:06:55.444 --> 00:06:56.735
So we both have our phones out.

00:06:56.735 --> 00:06:59.820
And we're Googling, is there
any software available?

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.170
And sure enough, we found
this thing called y-cruncher,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.620
by a gentleman
named Alexander Lee.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.070
It supports multi-core.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.430
It will allow you
to generate digits

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.950
of pi up to an astronomical
number of digits.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.460
So it supported the
operating system that we had.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.990
It ran on Linux.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.530
It was very CPU intensive
and memory intensive,

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.880
a good story for our VMs.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.580
So at 11:00 PM, we
were facing a choice.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.990
Do we do we run back to the
hotel and sit in the lobby

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.050
and make this work?

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.790
Or do we sit here and continue
drinking with their friends?

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.050
Because we're geeks first.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.260
And we basically were in
a cab in five minutes.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.950
So we excitedly get into a cab.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.960
We go back.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.030
We spent several hours
experimenting with it.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.810
So we were able to do a
billion just in minutes.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.210
I mean, it was incredibly fast.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.040
And we were looking
at how do our VMs

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.030
work with this the best?

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.420
And well, a billion is
not that impressive.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.150
And so well, why don't
we try 10 billion.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.950
So we did 10 billion.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.324
And that ran pretty
fast as well.

00:08:05.324 --> 00:08:07.792
But we still didn't feel like
we really stretched things.

00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:09.000
So they we tried 100 billion.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.416
Well, the problem
with 100 billion

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:13.520
is that it needs a lot more
memory than the 208 gig.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.940
So we needed to provide
disk for swapping.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.640
And as you know, disks are
much, much slower than memory.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: SSD
is not bad, right?

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.745
GREG WILSON: Exactly.

00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:25.490
And with local SSDs, which
are these physically connected

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.150
devices to your VM,
they're extremely fast.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.114
So that's where the 170,000
IOPS comes into play.

00:08:31.114 --> 00:08:33.030
So we thought hey, here's
a great opportunity.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.250
We're about 12:05
AM at this point.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.635
So now we're playing around.

00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:38.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
it's only an hour in.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.268
GREG WILSON: Oh yeah.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.642
We're still just
getting started.

00:08:39.642 --> 00:08:43.640
So we provision
out the local SSDs.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.280
We fire up a VM
with them connected.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.670
And we play around with the
parameters of the software.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:53.006
And we had 1.5 terabytes
of local SSD connected.

00:08:53.006 --> 00:08:54.880
Because not only do you
need it for the swap,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.270
but the output file itself.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.540
If you're going to generate
100 billion digits of pi,

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.116
that's 800 billion characters
in a file somewhere.

00:09:02.116 --> 00:09:04.890
So we actually dabbled with
doing a trillion digits.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.816
But it was going
to take more time.

00:09:06.816 --> 00:09:08.190
It was going to
go beyond Pi Day.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.940
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
needed to go to bed.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.690
GREG WILSON: And we were
getting sleepy at this point.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.520
So anyway, Ray's on one laptop.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.280
I'm on the other.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.320
We're experimenting with
different parameters.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.770
And we found the perfect mix.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.490
And thankfully, this is
right in Ray's wheel house.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.220
So we made a great team on this.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.760
And so about 3:00
AM, we kick off

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.690
what we think is
going to be the job.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.390
And we call it a night.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.020
And so the next
morning, we excitedly

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.570
logged back into the terminal.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.590
And it had finished.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.650
And it ran at about
5.3 hours and generated

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.639
100 billion digits.

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:42.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: 100
billion in five hours, wow.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.400
GREG WILSON: So then
we did a fun tweet.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.800
In celebration of
pi day, Ray and I

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.610
generated 100
billion digits of pi.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.340
And we put it out there.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.640
And this is getting back to
the developer advocacy job.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.830
We're trying to
generate some buzz

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.350
and show people
the cool things you

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.110
can do with this technology
and this platform.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.360
And the tweet did really well.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.530
I mean, it took off.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.310
It caught in some of the
excitement of Pi Day.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.760
[INAUDIBLE] was
tweeting about Pi Day.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.800
We were really hoping he
would catch our tweet.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.400
And a few people actually
pointed him to it.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.380
But he's probably got
other things on his mind.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: He's
probably watching our show now.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.450
GREG WILSON: Yeah,
I'm sure he will.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.790
So he missed his opportunity.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.670
The next Pi Day
will be his makeup.

00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:24.090
So that was a fun day.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.930
We got a good amount
of buzz out of that.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:26.970
We high fived.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.584
Because that was developer
advocacy success.

00:10:29.584 --> 00:10:31.250
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It's a big win, right?

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.150
GREG WILSON: So now we want
to take it to the next level

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.410
and try to break some
records on speed.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.470
On the site that has
y-cruncher, there

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.870
are documented records of how
long it takes to do these.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.565
We actually broke a couple of
records with what we're doing.

00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:49.190
But we don't want to
publish those yet.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.940
Because we want to go
for a bigger record.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.700
So we want to do a
trillion digits next.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.770
That's very feasible.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:11:00.810
But the world record
for pi is 13.3 trillion.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.090
The current record was
done on a workstation

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.575
with nearly 300 terabytes of
drives attached to it for swap.

00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:11.410
And it ran for 208 days.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.650
But that's a workstation
with a bunch of drives.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.660
I've got Google data
centers at my fingertips.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.980
I should be able to
beat that, right?

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.890
So it's more challenging
than you might think.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.880
So we're going to
be working on that.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.600
So hopefully, we'll be talking
a few months about how we now

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.745
hold the world record.

00:11:23.745 --> 00:11:24.460
LAURENCE MORONEY:
We'll be celebrating

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.090
you breaking the record.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.589
GREG WILSON: We'll
see what happens.

00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:28.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: And when
you did the 100 billion

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.840
for five hours, again, just
thinking in terms of cost--

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.490
because it's just the two of
you on your laptops terminalling

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.950
into a cloud server somehow.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.340
And compared to having the
dedicated hardware for it,

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.880
the cost must've
been a lot lower.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.604
GREG WILSON: Oh, yeah.

00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:45.020
It was cheaper
than the two drinks

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.890
we were drinking
when we left the bar.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.290
For the Pi Day specifically,
the local SSDs,

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.484
we only charged for the storage
for the drives themselves.

00:11:55.484 --> 00:11:57.150
You don't get charged
for the bandwidth.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.360
Because they're
physically connected.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.605
And then the virtual machine
is the pricing per minute.

00:12:04.605 --> 00:12:06.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
have it for five hours.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.870
GREG WILSON: Right,
so you're looking--

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.620
I mean-- no more than
$15, probably little

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.920
less than 15 bucks.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it wasn't
even particularly expensive

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.017
drinks?

00:12:13.017 --> 00:12:14.510
GREG WILSON: No, it wasn't.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.989
And that's the beauty of this.

00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:18.280
And we're having fun with this.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.950
There's not a lot
of practical use

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.870
to this other than some buzz.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.512
But you think about a lot of
the research that's going on

00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.470
and a lot of the computing
power that's needed.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.140
And especially when you start
thinking beyond a single VM,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.930
and you think, that times 1,000
or 10,000 VMs in a cluster,

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.972
you can really start doing
some game changing things.

00:12:38.972 --> 00:12:40.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.030
Sounds cool.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.440
GREG WILSON: Now for folks
who are watching the show who

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.939
might want to start
dabbling in this

00:12:44.939 --> 00:12:46.786
and maybe calculate
some other numbers,

00:12:46.786 --> 00:12:47.910
how would they get started?

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.210
What's a good place?

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.876
GREG WILSON: Best starting place
is just go to cloud.google.com.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.300
We actually have a trial
that you can sign up for.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.410
You get $300 for a couple
of months of playing

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.050
around, $300 for 60 days.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.550
You can have a lot
of fun with $300,

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.630
I mean, just based on
what we just talked about.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's 20
times your pi calculations.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.010
GREG WILSON: Yeah, you could
do a lot of digits of pi.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.385
Hopefully, you
would do something

00:13:11.385 --> 00:13:13.230
more exciting than that.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.220
So you can't missed
the free trial button.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.280
It's everywhere.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.500
And there is documentation.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.480
I mean, we've only touched
on virtual machines.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.313
We're starting to do a
lot of exciting stuff

00:13:22.313 --> 00:13:26.010
around containers with
a container engine,

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.380
BigQuery, the very large data
analysis that we mentioned

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.530
earlier, Kubernetes project.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.837
There are so many amazing
things going on in cloud

00:13:34.837 --> 00:13:37.170
that I think people would be
surprised what we're doing.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:37.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.660
And it's all summarized
on cloud.google.com.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.810
GREG WILSON: It is, yep,
everything you can find.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:42.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thanks, Greg.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.770
That was so cool--
lots of great stories.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:44.160
GREG WILSON: Thanks.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.710
I appreciate you having me.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.430
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Well thanks everybody
