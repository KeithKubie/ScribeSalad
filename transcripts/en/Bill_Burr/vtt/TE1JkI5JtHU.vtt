00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.030
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr it's time for the Thursday afternoon.
Yeah.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.830
<v 1>Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast is</v>

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.540
<v 2>ah,</v>

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.500
<v 3>oh,</v>

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.670
<v 1>just checking in on you.
Just checking in,</v>

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.080
seeing how your week's go in.
Huh?
Making sure the Celtics feds,

7
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:22.270
I fucking,

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.910
you just got you asses whipped by the Milwaukee Bucks.

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.160
<v 0>Boston slam is over.
Um,</v>

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.910
and there's a lot of people that are happy about that.

11
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.730
A lot of sports fans are happy about that.
And I'll ask you this,

12
00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:39.920
what does that say about you as a person?

13
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.710
That that's where you get your joy in the failures of others.

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.410
You know,
Boston could have used a sports pick me up.

15
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.810
We only won the world series in the Superbowl

16
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.650
<v 1>ball this past year.
Um,
I'm just fucking with the,
I do the same thing.</v>

17
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.040
Like,
I'm actually really upset that,
um,

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.360
well I guess it doesn't matter because the Lakers aren't in it,

19
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:10.361
but I want Kevin Durant to be totally healthy and if the Celtics aren't going to

20
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:14.420
win it just anybody but the Lakers and uh,

21
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.040
but I think that my hatred of the Lakers is justified considering for whatever

22
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:22.850
reason they get to count a non NBA title as an NBA title.

23
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.370
Um,
and I give it up to the Lakers.

24
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:30.050
They are the most successful team in my lifetime,
sorry,

25
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.850
MP and shit because my laptop's full here,
empty my trash.
Um,
they are,

26
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.920
they're the most successful team,
the fucking amazing.

27
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.890
And they were able to transition from the old school way right into the free

28
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.710
agency,
way better than the Celtics have.
So I'll give him up on that.

29
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:45.200
My only thing with them is that take that fucking banner down,

30
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.483
you know,

31
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.880
quit hitting off the ladies tees when all you championships in the NBA.

32
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:56.630
I think that that's fair.
Um,
but having said that,

33
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.730
I didn't see a second of the Milwaukee Bucks series,

34
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:06.660
but I definitely,
um,
I dunno though,

35
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.510
I definitely kind of saw,
I didn't see us winning it this year.

36
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.160
I was a little excited when we,
when we swept the pacers,
but,

37
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.840
um,
we just couldn't get into a groove this year.
It just couldn't,

38
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.810
I don't know what the fuck happened.
And I,
it's almost like,

39
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.213
<v 4>okay.</v>

40
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.730
<v 1>I Dunno.
It was like,
it was like when,
you know,
when in music,</v>

41
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:31.090
when they put together a,
a super band,
as they call it,

42
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.670
it's like we'll get the bass player from this huge band and we'll get the drama

43
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.820
from this band and Bob by and all that type of shit.

44
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:41.170
And you think that this thing's gonna sometimes it just doesn't work.

45
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:43.600
And I think if you're a good Celtic fan,

46
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.330
get off the fucking internet and stuff,

47
00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:51.100
fucking point and fingers that you clean up your own fucking life.
All right?

48
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.800
Until you put your hatred of the Lakers to bed like me.
No,
you've,
you,

49
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.860
you're not going to be doing this Celtics any by going on there and pointing the

50
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:02.720
fingers and,

51
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.040
and pointing your finger at people and saying a bunch of negative shit.

52
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.173
<v 5>MMM.</v>

53
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.630
<v 1>You know,
leave that to the,
to the analysts or whatever.</v>

54
00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:15.150
They're going to say enough.
But you don't need the fan,
the flames.

55
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:18.210
Because what I'm worried right now is what's going to happen is everybody's

56
00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:19.830
going to trash Kyrie Irving,

57
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.740
blame him and then he's going to go sign with somebody else and he's going to

58
00:03:25.741 --> 00:03:30.741
have this fire in his belly and it's got to come back to haunt us.

59
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:33.180
So just,
you know,
whatever.

60
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:37.110
Sometimes you ever see somebody Redo a car and they just put too much shit on
it.

61
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.373
<v 5>You know,</v>

62
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.960
<v 1>too many bells and whistles.
The rims don't,
you know,</v>

63
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.600
should've picked a different ram.
My,
you didn't need this.
He didn't.

64
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.150
It's kind of let,
that was just a little bit too much,
uh,

65
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.240
too much mustard on a hotdog and I don't,

66
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:55.500
I just don't think there was room enough for the amount of creativity on that

67
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:59.040
team.
That just wasn't enough touches for everybody.
And people started getting,

68
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.310
I don't know,
something happened.
I don't know what,

69
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.310
they just couldn't get into the flow.

70
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:06.090
But I do know that we have the best fucking young coach in the NBA and we also

71
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:08.170
have arguably one of the best gms and Danny Ainge.

72
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:11.280
So I believe what we were going to be able to fix this thing.
But,
uh,

73
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.200
thank you to the Celtics for a and not,
you know,
we came up short,

74
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:21.201
but it was still a great year and congratulations to your Milwaukee Bucks and a,

75
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.310
I'd be lying to you as an NBA fan to not say that it isn't a exciting to see

76
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:29.520
that team after all these years.
I mean that,

77
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.790
I can't remember the last time they had a nice one.

78
00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:36.470
I imagine something happened between Sidney Moncrief and,
uh,

79
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.460
Yanis
I tutored mostly to,
to Poole,
whatever's for La,

80
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.420
I can't say and take to tempo,
um,
sense him.
But,

81
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.090
um,
that is an exciting team to watch.
Uh,
whatever.
It's just,

82
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.770
it's good.
It's good with teams,
you know,

83
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.010
it's not good when just fucking New York,

84
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:01.400
Boston and la are fucking doing something.
And every,
every goddamn year.

85
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.560
It's just not good.
It's not good for the fucking leak.

86
00:05:03.561 --> 00:05:08.180
So I root for everybody else and I am almost to the point now,

87
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.120
<v 5>mmm.</v>

88
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.420
<v 1>Where I'm letting go of my anger of like,
like I just don't,
I don't,</v>

89
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.050
I'm too old now.
I,
I don't give a fuck.
All right.

90
00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:21.590
I'm not going to sit here and waste time and root against the fucking Lakers

91
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.980
even though it was just trashing them,
the Canadians and the Yankees,

92
00:05:24.981 --> 00:05:26.480
like I don't give a fuck anymore.

93
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.660
<v 5>MMM.</v>

94
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.820
<v 1>Because no matter how much I hate them,</v>

95
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:33.400
it's not going to change the result when they play the game.

96
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:37.810
So what the fuck am I doing?
All right.
God bless all of them.

97
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.210
I wrote for the Boston ones that if you beat us,
congratulations.
How about that?

98
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.550
Was that for enlightened?
And here's a big question,
Bill,

99
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:50.110
can you sustain it?
It's like I'm an emotional diet right now,

100
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.690
which I need to go on a real fucking died after the shit.

101
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.870
I had one fucking snickers bar in an airport cause they were boarding and I

102
00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:58.971
didn't have time.

103
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:02.360
And I remember that advertisement where they tried to act like it was actually a

104
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:06.230
decent replacement for a meal.
Remember when snickers had the balls to do that?

105
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.540
It's packed with peanuts.
Yes.

106
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:12.620
Surrounded by fucking the food version of heroin sugar.

107
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.570
And I got back on the sugar man.

108
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.170
<v 5>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.440
<v 1>I tied off,
I snorted the first one and then I shot there.</v>

110
00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:24.000
I ate more goddamn candy and dessert on the last four days of this fucking,

111
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.790
this trip.
And uh,

112
00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:30.000
I came home looking like I was fucking getting ready to play Santa Claus on

113
00:06:30.001 --> 00:06:34.680
fucking the next Christmas holiday.
So I,
uh,

114
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.950
I got back on it yesterday.
It's just,

115
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.520
it's just hard to eat well when you're on the road,

116
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.050
<v 5>but,
um,</v>

117
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.380
<v 1>people keep the vegetarian meals coming in,
man.
Um,
I'm gonna,</v>

118
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.940
I'm going to do like a hybrid.
My version,
I'm sort of like,

119
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:56.150
I like the way a rich kid goes to the army.
You know what I mean?

120
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.560
I'm going to be a vegetarian the way George W.
Bush served his country.

121
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.470
I'm going to be in the vegetarian reserves and you know,

122
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:10.640
not show up for a few days.
Um,
now why pick on him?

123
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.050
I Dunno because we're fucking bankrupt after that fucking

124
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.180
Dash Hirsch our intelligent edge.
Fucking damn good.
I would,
where is that guy?

125
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:24.530
Can he come out and say he's site now that we're 20 trillion in debt.
Ace.

126
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.370
Sorry about bankrupting your fucking entire futures.

127
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.890
I Dunno.
Partner kind of was talking to me about some shit like that.

128
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.710
I was kind of putting the last tube,

129
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:40.400
this one in the law and the one before us in perspective with what they fucking

130
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:43.010
inherited.
It's a fucking shit show.

131
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.220
It's like a water main break broken.

132
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:49.790
They get you walked in there with a fucking wrench in a pair of rubber boots and

133
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:51.950
you're supposed to try and fix it.
I don't,
I don't know what I don't know,

134
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:54.350
but that's too fucking dark.
Okay.

135
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.880
And I'm taking it on the upswing here because I'll tell you this,
I,
at this point

136
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.560
I tend to almost,
I think I've been to 29 different countries,

137
00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:09.030
28 really?
I went to the holy city to have the holy sea,

138
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:10.830
which is considered its own fucking country.

139
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.273
<v 5>MMM.</v>

140
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.190
<v 1>And uh,</v>

141
00:08:15.191 --> 00:08:20.160
the overwhelming thing that I have found is people are nice people.
Uh,

142
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.250
<v 5>yeah,</v>

143
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.830
<v 1>yeah.
They're just decent walk around that just fucking Nice.</v>

144
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.270
And all of this fucking shit that's going on is the concept of top cause they

145
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:31.090
want to control everything.
And I really got to tell you,
dude,

146
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:32.440
just don't fucking watch the news.

147
00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:36.790
I literally went to fucking Israel not watching the news.
Had no idea

148
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.630
that Hamas had shot like fucking six,

149
00:08:43.631 --> 00:08:45.190
700 fucking rockets.

150
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.830
I don't know if it's into Jerusalem and what I had no idea.

151
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.050
Just landed there.

152
00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:56.460
I mean people immediately gave me that information but know people fucking Nice.

153
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.220
The fucking Nice.
And when I got outside my hotel,

154
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:02.430
I saw some Palestinian people and they were peacefully protesting

155
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.660
and it's just,
people are fucking did.
They're just nice.
They're nice.

156
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.381
Although this fucking,

157
00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:11.200
these are evil doers and these fucking people and all these fucking people

158
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.600
bubble butts like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
What it is,

159
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.230
is this constant like you on the other side of the fucking fence.
Um,

160
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.840
smartest thing I ever did was I stopped watching the news.

161
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.280
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

162
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.500
<v 1>I really did.
If you want,
you know,
and I swear to God,</v>

163
00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:26.080
if I wasn't in this fucking business,
I'd get off social media.

164
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.440
If you've got off thing,
imagine if you did this.
If he got off social media,

165
00:09:29.441 --> 00:09:32.660
you stop watching the news.
All right?

166
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.800
And then you fucking,
I dunno,
start reading.

167
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.640
You know what's,
you know,
I watched a really cool documentary,
watch this one.

168
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.940
There's this documentary this kid made who is trying to do a documentary with

169
00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:47.100
Bill Murray.
Bill Murray never got to him.

170
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:49.480
And then he kinda realized other things or whatever,

171
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.150
but we was kind of investigating all of these stories about Bill Murray walking

172
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:56.970
down the street and then just jumping in a kickball game with random people

173
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.900
taking pictures and disappeared.
Just kind of watch that thing,
the way that guy,

174
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.480
or at least the way they're presenting,
the way the dude lives this life.

175
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.010
It's pretty,
uh,
I dunno,
maybe I was just stuck on an airplane.

176
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:09.930
But it kind of affected me when I was watching it.

177
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.440
I actually watched a bunch of great movies.
Yes.
Um,

178
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.000
on the 12 hour flight before the four hour delay,

179
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.040
a connecting flight never connect when you're traveling units or an

180
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:23.874
international,

181
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.470
as you basically considering it's playoff times,

182
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.060
it's get to the exit owes you basically just increased your chances of a delayed

183
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:37.140
flight by 100%.
As you doubled the amount of planes that you were taking.

184
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:39.000
A goddamn it had happened.
Um,

185
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.170
I do want to give a shout out to United Airlines for making it happen.

186
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.280
I thought,
you know,
these guys were up against it with the,

187
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:50.760
by the time the delay was over everybody,
the stewardesses,
flight attendants,

188
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.580
everybody was up against it and they still went anyways.

189
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.900
You're supposed to get in at like,
um,
10,
15,
la.

190
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:03.110
Tell Him we finally get in at like 3:00 AM and I basically spent 24 hours

191
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.820
on planes and in an airport.
And uh,

192
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.250
it's just one of those things where it's so far a 12 hour flight is so fucking

193
00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:16.250
long.
You don't even give a shit.
I just sit there as this thing.
All right.

194
00:11:16.251 --> 00:11:18.560
I stayed up for the entire thing too,
and I,

195
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:23.000
the first thing I watch was this Bill Murray documentary.
Then I watched,

196
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.170
um,
let me make sure I get the names of these movies,
right.

197
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.070
I watched that Jonah Hill movie.
Um,

198
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:32.320
<v 4>okay.</v>

199
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.820
<v 1>Is it mid nineties?
Said what?
It's called bid nineties.</v>

200
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.150
We'll that full movie pay for that thing that she fuck.
Mid Nineties.
Yeah.

201
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.210
Um,
Jody Hill movie,
fucking love that movie.

202
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.950
Great movie.
Incredible performances.
I love the writing and all of that.

203
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.490
And um,

204
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:55.930
<v 5>okay.</v>

205
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.650
<v 1>I was like,
man,
this must get great reviews or whatever.</v>

206
00:11:57.651 --> 00:12:01.190
And I looked it up and so much of the shit was about the language,

207
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.360
the harsh language that was used in all of that shit.
I just don't know.

208
00:12:05.361 --> 00:12:06.380
I don't understand.

209
00:12:06.381 --> 00:12:11.381
When they decided to treat every movie goer out there like they were fucking

210
00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:15.880
child,
you know what I mean?
I want,

211
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.940
remember watching roots when I was a kid.

212
00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:19.290
They didn't have this big fucking thing.

213
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.790
Now there's going to be a lot of a harsh things that you're going to see here.

214
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.660
You don't have roots came out now,
I think they would literally be like,
you know,

215
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.040
is,
is that,
is that the right thing to put out now?

216
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.310
Is this going to start slavery again?
It's just like,

217
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.960
this is the way people talked that the title of the movie is literally called

218
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.070
mid nineties.

219
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.220
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

220
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.570
<v 1>Is that 1890s?
I don't understand.
Just watch the movie.</v>

221
00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:51.470
It was fucking like,
I was really blown away by,
um,

222
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.310
<v 5>yeah,</v>

223
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.130
<v 1>the performance is too.
And I also love the ending,</v>

224
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.440
which is the hardest thing to land,
um,

225
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.410
is the third act without doing some sort of thing that people can see.

226
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.300
They can see the end coming or something like that.

227
00:13:06.301 --> 00:13:07.980
It was just a fucking phenomenal movie.

228
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.520
So congratulations to Jonah Hill and everybody else that was in it,

229
00:13:11.521 --> 00:13:14.840
the acting the actress in it would just,
they would just there.

230
00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:17.670
I was so fucking great man.
I'd really love that movie.
All right.

231
00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:19.320
And then next up,
what I saw,

232
00:13:19.321 --> 00:13:24.321
I watched a on the waterfront and finally fucking paid attention because I had

233
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.440
to credible movie.
I know that's like one of the best ones of all time,

234
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:30.510
but I actually sat and watched it.
Loved that one.

235
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.290
Then I watched Dag and to make sure I get this one right too.

236
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.420
The Laurel and hardy movie.

237
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.963
<v 5>MMM.</v>

238
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.090
<v 1>Another great one.</v>

239
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:43.420
<v 5>Okay.</v>

240
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.220
<v 1>I was just standing Ali.</v>

241
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.953
<v 5>MMM.</v>

242
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.540
<v 1>I watched that movie and just once again,</v>

243
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.400
absolutely fantastic fucking movie.
I made sure I picked good ones.

244
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.070
You know what I mean?
As if I'm going to sit here,
I'm going to make sure I,

245
00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:02.010
I watched,
uh,
you know,

246
00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:05.340
I remember Mark Marin was raving about that movie,
so I'm going to,
I was like,

247
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:09.150
I'm gonna Watch this,
but uh,
Steve Coogan and John C.
Reilly,

248
00:14:09.151 --> 00:14:11.460
Shirley Henderson and uh,

249
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:12.750
<v 5>yeah,</v>

250
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.840
<v 1>Nina Arianda.
They will like the main,</v>

251
00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:20.841
they play basically a Laurel and hardy and then their significant others and uh,

252
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.720
Nina Arianda,
her character was fucking hilarious.

253
00:14:24.721 --> 00:14:28.740
Definitely check that one out then.
Was that,
that's one,
two,

254
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.670
three set three or four fourth.
That's four with the Bill Murray thing.

255
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.160
And then I watched,
um,

256
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.550
<v 5>okay.</v>

257
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.970
<v 1>I start,
I was like,
all right man,
like these are really great movies,</v>

258
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:42.880
but you really have to pay attention.
Let me watch something a little sillier.

259
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:48.360
And they had saint elmos fire was on there and I got through maybe eight minutes

260
00:14:49.961 --> 00:14:52.110
of that movie.
It was,

261
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.610
<v 4>oh man,
it was a</v>

262
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.910
<v 1>dude.
When,
when,</v>

263
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:02.690
when fucking what now to fuck's his name when he takes Rob Lowe's head and he

264
00:15:03.371 --> 00:15:07.900
stuffs it in a fucking toilet in a bar and he,

265
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.710
the guy doesn't get mad.
He's like,
Oh yeah,
whatever the wet look is in.
I'm like,

266
00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:16.010
okay,
all right.
And then for the third time they did the,

267
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.740
they all told a joke and they all went,
but I'm bumping.

268
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.200
Then they had that little fucking thing that day when we get it,

269
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:25.270
they have comradery,
their college friends.
I was just like,
all right.
Um,

270
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.220
plus basically everybody who had this look on their face that they were just

271
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:29.630
really enjoying being famous.

272
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.770
I don't think it was a good time for any of those actors cause I like all the

273
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:34.610
actors in that movie.

274
00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:37.670
But that was just like they had that look on their face like,
yeah,

275
00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:40.400
this is never going end.
Um,
not all of them.

276
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.153
<v 4>Okay.</v>

277
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:47.540
<v 1>MMM.
Anyway,
so I shut that one off and I was like,
all right,
I'm not,</v>

278
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.120
I'm not,
you know,
this is actually gonna make the flight seem longer.

279
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:53.090
So then the last movie I watched,
what the hell that I watch?

280
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.040
I just went blank.
I watched another really good one.

281
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.350
This is how my brain's work,
cause I literally knew the movie and then I thought,

282
00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:06.680
wait,
what was the one previous to it?
And then if I go previous it just a racist.

283
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:10.530
The last thought,
oh,
I remember.

284
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.560
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

285
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.290
<v 1>I watched,
uh,
what happened to baby</v>

286
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.090
Jane Starting
Bette Davis and uh,

287
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.280
I don't want to say that Joan Collins,
the other Joan,
let me see.

288
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:30.281
Bette Davis and Joan Crawford and I always heard that,

289
00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:31.210
you know,

290
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.860
they did a whole movie about how they didn't fucking like each other and all of

291
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:36.650
this type of shit.
I watched that movie.
That's one of those movies that's,

292
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.020
it's like the performances and everything.
I really good.

293
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.320
Then it keeps going out off the road and then it comes back.

294
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.450
There is sort of a major hole in it where you know some shit that happened

295
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:51.110
before you get to see them.
It's like,

296
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:54.140
and the cops didn't intervene and then they were cool with the two of them just

297
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:58.640
hanging out.
Is,
is that,
does that what happened?
All this studio fixed it?
Um,

298
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.683
<v 4>yeah.</v>

299
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.570
<v 1>Um,
I actually really enjoyed it and there's an APP sure.</v>

300
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:08.580
In it who I really fucking loved and it turned out I'm going to get his name

301
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:10.870
here.
It turned out that,
uh,

302
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:14.710
he actually was the one that played King Tut on the Batman series.

303
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.390
It was a phenomenal actor.
I was like,
who the fuck is that guy?

304
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.870
What's his name?
Oh,

305
00:17:24.871 --> 00:17:25.950
for fuck sakes.

306
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:32.620
Is it Victor Buono?
Is that how you say his name?
Yes.

307
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.260
Larger than life.
Yeah.

308
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.960
In with an eloquent king size appetite from maniacal Mariemont.

309
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.960
Who the fuck wrote this shit?
Um,

310
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.100
Jesus Christ,
he didn't live long ago,
died at 43.

311
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.890
That must've been the old heart attack.
Take people trying to get the weight off,

312
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.460
try to keep the,
get the weight up and try and keep it off.

313
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:58.830
Don't need a bunch of fucking candy like I did.
So anyways,

314
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:02.100
I recommend all of those movies.
Um,

315
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.640
and I guess saint almost fired too if you're doing some research on the brat

316
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:08.430
pack now.
If I was going to watch a Brat pack movie,

317
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:09.810
I would watch the breakfast club.

318
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:12.690
I think that that was the high water mark of that.

319
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.600
But a saint almost fire if wasn't a good one.

320
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.600
<v 5>Um hmm.</v>

321
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.940
<v 1>Oh,
the other ones about last night.</v>

322
00:18:21.941 --> 00:18:26.941
What was the one that had Andrew McCarthy and rob Lowe and they both went to

323
00:18:26.951 --> 00:18:31.260
college
and uh,

324
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.720
I,
I know I can't,

325
00:18:34.721 --> 00:18:36.910
I can't talk about the movie without given the fucking thing away,

326
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.050
but it has one of the most anticlimactic endings to a movie I've ever seen.

327
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.840
I'm not ripping either after,
cause I think they did a good job,

328
00:18:43.841 --> 00:18:48.730
but it's just like,
did they just improv the end of that fucking thing?
Um,

329
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.570
I don't want to ruin that one.
All right.
What am I fucking Siskel and Ebert here?

330
00:18:52.571 --> 00:18:55.060
Shut the fuck up bill,
whatever.
That's what I,
that's what I watched.

331
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.380
Then I got home.

332
00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:57.550
<v 4>Okay.</v>

333
00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:02.380
<v 1>Finally got home,
uh,
at about three 34 in the morning.
And uh,</v>

334
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.250
I was able to,
uh,
yesterday sleep a little bit.

335
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.180
Right now it's four in the morning.
My time,
I,
uh,

336
00:19:10.181 --> 00:19:14.080
was able to stay up til about four in the afternoon yesterday going to watch the

337
00:19:14.081 --> 00:19:16.090
Celtics game.
I was like,
I'm gonna close my eyes for an hour.

338
00:19:16.091 --> 00:19:20.230
And I woke up at eight and I was like,
ah,
fuck.
Um,

339
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.470
because a pipe burst in my house,
shout out to my wife,

340
00:19:23.471 --> 00:19:24.850
handling that whole fucking thing.

341
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.740
I'm one of the main things you can greatest things you can ever teach your wife

342
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.940
is how to shut off the fucking water in your house before major water damage

343
00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:38.440
gets done.
And she handled that like a champ by a time she woke me up.

344
00:19:38.441 --> 00:19:42.070
The plumbers were already there and they fixed it.
So I don't know.
As I've set,

345
00:19:42.071 --> 00:19:44.830
this house has a lot of character.
It's got a lot of character,
everybody,

346
00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.150
a lot of fucking character.

347
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.733
<v 5>MMM.</v>

348
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.051
<v 1>Run and hide.</v>

349
00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:52.930
If anybody ever says that of a house that you're thinking about buying.

350
00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:53.621
All right.

351
00:19:53.621 --> 00:19:58.621
But the Boston Bruins and your North Carolina hurricanes are getting ready to

352
00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:03.940
show first game tonight,
5:00 PM west coast time,
8:00 PM east coast time.

353
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.120
Fucking 7:00 PM central time and 6:00 PM mountain tack that I handle everything.

354
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.000
What time is it in Hawaii?
I don't know.

355
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.540
Probably starts at like fucking one in the afternoon to have the afternoon.

356
00:20:17.541 --> 00:20:19.520
I don't know.
Honolulu time

357
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.003
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

358
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.570
<v 1>uh,
four o'clock,
Alaska time.
Uh,</v>

359
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:29.550
the Bruins start that series with the very difficult Caroline hurricanes have no

360
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:29.821
idea.

361
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:32.430
I don't know anything about this team other than that they've been an absolute

362
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:36.990
buzz saw sets to be getting of April.
So this should be another tough one.

363
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.023
Um,

364
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.520
I don't why they give it Marshawn shit for that little fucking snarky fucking

365
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.780
report or given them a rough time.
Somebody tried to it to how I,

366
00:20:47.781 --> 00:20:51.940
I missed the whole series.
Charlie Mcavoy,
I guess,
uh,
had a hit that was up high,

367
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.000
possibly dirty,
you know,

368
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.090
hit against somebody on the Columbus blue jackets.
He's like,

369
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:01.660
and they're still able to shake hands.
Why doesn't Brad Marshawn,

370
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:03.490
uh,

371
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.420
give more than one word answers to this fucking jerk off reporter because he's

372
00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:10.990
not on the ice.
That's why he's not a player.

373
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.023
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

374
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.230
<v 1>Stop paying.
This guy wrote this whole fucking article.</v>

375
00:21:15.231 --> 00:21:18.670
Like the reporters are just like,
people wouldn't even know what was going on.

376
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.130
We totally would know what was going on.
We're not there for your report.

377
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.980
Were there for the game?
We're watching the fucking game.

378
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:28.310
People would still watch literally if there was no fucking announces,

379
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:32.000
it wouldn't be as good,
would not be as good.
All right.

380
00:21:32.001 --> 00:21:35.660
But I would say right now that the level of coverage,

381
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.480
it's,
it's,
it's so above and beyond anything that's even needed.

382
00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.270
Where did that,
where did that fucking thing even happen?

383
00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:49.420
It happened during the warmups before a fucking playoff game in Marshawn took

384
00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:54.150
time out of warming up for a crucial fucking play off game

385
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.080
to talk to this fucking asshole.

386
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:03.060
And then he starts giving him shit like he's actually picked sides and he skated

387
00:22:03.061 --> 00:22:04.170
away like he should have.

388
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.630
<v 4>Okay.</v>

389
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.000
<v 1>I liked what he did and I liked that he gave one word answers,</v>

390
00:22:08.001 --> 00:22:11.360
but of course the press is always going to have the last answer and then they're

391
00:22:11.361 --> 00:22:14.910
going to bring up,
you know,
you look a few faces,
couple of so,
so forth.

392
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.030
So the next thing you know,
you can never get a break in the press,

393
00:22:17.031 --> 00:22:20.270
but that's just how it is.
That's just how it is.

394
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.110
But all I know is that Brad Mars and the Boston Bruins have moved onto the

395
00:22:24.111 --> 00:22:27.150
eastern conference finals and that fucking report,
it has not,

396
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.980
someone's going to hoist the trophy this year,
the Stanley Cup,

397
00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:34.060
and they're going to skate around.

398
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.630
When am I going to tell you one person who isn't that fucking guy and me?

399
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.400
So why don't you shut the fuck up with your little snarky?
He didn't,

400
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.720
if he just asked him about the play,
then he goes,
hey,

401
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:46.660
did you get your skates sharpened?
He sounded like a fucking blue jacket fin.

402
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.080
So fuck that guy.
Fuck his Instagram.
And all that shit.

403
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.560
Not saying to go on it and trash them cause that's,
that's even worse.

404
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:59.260
That's even worse than what I'm doing here on the podcast.
Um,

405
00:22:59.261 --> 00:23:01.510
so being jet lagged,

406
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.660
I was able to get caught up with some of the moto GP although I haven't a

407
00:23:04.661 --> 00:23:07.870
problem with their fucking uh,
their website.

408
00:23:07.871 --> 00:23:12.280
I guess they haven't uploaded the um,
the replay of the uh,

409
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:14.580
<v 4>yeah</v>

410
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.140
<v 1>the race from Spain yet.
But I was able to watch the one from Austin,</v>

411
00:23:19.141 --> 00:23:22.440
Texas where Mark Marquez was in turn 12,

412
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.840
which I guess is a difficult term because you come down from that straightaway

413
00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.770
and you've got to slow go from sixth gear all the way down to first gear.

414
00:23:28.771 --> 00:23:29.760
And I dunno what happened.

415
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.330
They kept saying trailbreaking I'm not a motorcycle guy.

416
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.110
I tried to be that guy for fucking two months out here in la.

417
00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:40.500
And all I kept thinking about was the time Richie Cunningham got the motorcycle

418
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.490
and Fonzie was telling him not to get it and then he ended up having a fucking

419
00:23:44.491 --> 00:23:46.460
accident cause know what he was a car guy.

420
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.480
What are the most dangerous things out there if you're riding a motorcycle

421
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.440
beyond people texting.
All right.
Is,

422
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.950
is while they're driving is to have a car guy on a motorcycle.
And I,

423
00:23:57.951 --> 00:24:02.150
I was able to recognize that in myself.
So anyways,
um,

424
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.790
there was nobody near him and he just fucking wiped up.

425
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.660
They just wiped out and then couldn't get the bike started and um,

426
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.280
and he got no championship points so it was huge obviously for them to get a win

427
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:16.250
here.
And He,
I think he's right.
I think he's back up by one cause to,

428
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.260
he also had a,
uh,
oh no,
I'm confusing racist.

429
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.980
Viteos I had a great start in the,
uh,
the Austin one and they did a little,

430
00:24:25.981 --> 00:24:28.310
a little bit of blue,
blue,
blue and the fucking first turn.

431
00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:32.150
And then that was it for him the whole fucking day.
I still don't understand why,

432
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.070
how I do like it.

433
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.200
I think what makes motorcycle racing interesting to me is the south certain

434
00:24:39.201 --> 00:24:43.250
bikes or just why are certain bikes better in the corners,

435
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.350
in other bikes are better on the straightaway.

436
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.700
Is it simply the way that they have them set up or is it literally,
hey,

437
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.240
we're just make it a better fucking engine for this thing?

438
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:56.660
Is it how I always hear like how I've missed the glory days of Formula One cars.

439
00:24:56.661 --> 00:25:00.760
Now the cars are two evenly matched and it's all about racing to the first turn.

440
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.710
Whoever's gets to the first turn and then the ones who win the fucking thing.

441
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.610
That seems to be what happens in Formula One.
Um,

442
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.190
but,
uh,
I was not able to watch the last f one race,

443
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:15.620
which I'm going to watch here now at like four in the morning when I finish this

444
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:19.550
podcast.
And I believe Lewis Hamilton is just a,

445
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:23.000
I think he won that one again.
I mean,
I don't know this,

446
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.930
it's literally just like which Mercedes drivers gonna win it this year or more

447
00:25:26.931 --> 00:25:31.430
accurately.
Does Valtteri Botox have a run in him to stop the inevitable?

448
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.420
Um,
so I'm going to go upstairs.

449
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.450
I'm going to fucking watch that when I get done recording.

450
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:43.451
This thing had to go downstairs into the La version of a basement and a record

451
00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:45.050
this thing,

452
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.350
cause I don't want to wake up my lovely daughter who I had not seen in fucking

453
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:51.540
eight days,
crushed me.
Right.
And I came home and uh,

454
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.940
she woke up early or whatever and I was psyched because I was up and I went in

455
00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:59.480
there to get her up and I was waiting to see your beautiful face light up that,

456
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:01.730
oh my God,
I'm seeing,
I'm seeing Daddy.
Right.

457
00:26:01.731 --> 00:26:06.731
And I came in and she big smile on her face and the first thing she said to me

458
00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:08.870
was,
I want Mama.

459
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.910
So I just left,
you know,
got her up,
change there at all,
that type of stuff.

460
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:21.530
And then,
um,
it's unreal.
I hate me in a way like that.

461
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.970
Uh,
but I did,
I did bring everybody to Iceland and we had an amazing week there.

462
00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:29.330
So I mean,
and you know what,
this is how I keep the lights on.
So I do have to,

463
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.500
you know,
go out and go to work.
Plumber has to go out and fix the fucking sinks.

464
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.900
And I have to go out and go tell my jokes.
I will tell you though,
uh,

465
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.731
just being away a week,

466
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:42.731
she got even taller and now she can like put her Pajama top on herself all by

467
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:44.461
herself.

468
00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:48.650
She can move her arm around and get through the sleeve and it's just like Jesus

469
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.820
Christ go away for a weekly.
They grow by leaps and bounds.

470
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.660
So,
um,
anyway,
I got her out of bed and,
uh,

471
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:58.390
<v 0>you know,</v>

472
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.980
<v 1>stiff as hell from being on the plane.
So I said,
she goes,
let's go see Mama.</v>

473
00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.850
And I said,
all right,
well hang on a second.
I've got to stretch for first.

474
00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.000
So what's hilarious is when I do my stretches,
she doesn't with me.

475
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.550
And then she imitates the noises that I make.

476
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.120
So like I did like the forward bend,
you know,
to start yoga,
you know,

477
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.100
you grab your elbows or whatever to afford Ben and I,
you know,
when I got passed,

478
00:27:17.101 --> 00:27:22.030
basically certain levels,
like,
ah,
and then she does hers and she goes,

479
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.960
Ah,
she just imitating,
she laughed.

480
00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:28.690
She thinks I'm being funny rather than just being old.
So,

481
00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.093
<v 0>mmm.</v>

482
00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.090
<v 1>She comes into the bedroom now and she takes the foam roller and she puts it</v>

483
00:27:34.091 --> 00:27:36.670
down and she sits down on it and have the her height.

484
00:27:36.671 --> 00:27:41.370
It's like a little chair and she sits down on and she's going,
ah,
uh,

485
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.930
thinking that like,
that's what you're supposed to do,
whether the,
uh,

486
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.380
whether it hurts or not.
Uh,
she's the best and I'm home for a little bit before,

487
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:51.820
uh,
I have an act of Gig,

488
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.670
<v 0>uh,
that's shoots this entire summer.
I don't know.
I think they already,</v>

489
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:59.310
they already put some stuff out about,
uh,
it's,
uh,

490
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:04.230
I usually tell jokes and shit about the shit that I'm in,
but I'm actually in a,

491
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.850
uh,

uh,
vehicle that,

492
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.140

493
00:28:10.141 --> 00:28:13.740
So I'm very excited to be in this thing and,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.413
Um,
yeah,

571
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.380
<v 0>sometimes you just,
you just,
you just feel it,
you know,</v>

572
00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.150
not saying that the others ones weren't.

573
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.360
And I think the last time I talked to you,
I just done Helsinki,

574
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:48.194
which was amazing.

575
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.400
Oslow was crazy fucking crazy show.

576
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:58.130
I had close to six or 7,000 people show up and then we went to,

577
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:59.443
um,

578
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.920
<v 1>we went to us podcast is going to go a little long.
Then we went to Amsterdam.</v>

579
00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:06.863
<v 5>MMM.</v>

580
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.580
<v 1>And that was like 3,500 people couldn't believe like that.</v>

581
00:33:09.581 --> 00:33:14.170
Many fucking people showed up other side of the world just to hear my fucking

582
00:33:14.171 --> 00:33:17.920
shit.
And Dick Jokes was amazing.
And um,

583
00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:23.550
we went out in a Oslow went out and I smoked a cigar and I fricking cigar

584
00:33:24.431 --> 00:33:27.940
smoking is off the rails.
I really got to reel that in.
You know,

585
00:33:27.941 --> 00:33:31.270
I feel like in a way that I kind of replaced the fact that I wasn't drinking,

586
00:33:31.271 --> 00:33:33.130
which was hard when I was going through Europe.

587
00:33:33.131 --> 00:33:36.340
So all of a sudden I'm fucking eating candy bars and smoking cigarettes,

588
00:33:36.341 --> 00:33:37.510
fucking craziness,

589
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:42.310
just because I'm addicted to some sort of buzz at the end of the day.
So once I,

590
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.500
I have to fucking get back to what I was doing,

591
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.400
which was putting on my pj's and fucking reading the book,

592
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.960
which I would have done,
cause I was,

593
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.870
I have like 25 more pages to go in that Beastie boy book,

594
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:56.110
but it was the cover special edition.

595
00:33:56.111 --> 00:33:59.350
So it was like sticking a fucking extra laptop in my bag and I didn't want to

596
00:33:59.351 --> 00:34:01.300
check a bag so I didn't bring it.
So

597
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.903
<v 5>okay,</v>

598
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.570
<v 1>I should have brought like this paper back book.</v>

599
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:08.350
Somebody got me on the Simpsons or something like that and done that instead.

600
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.100
But I didn't.
So now I have to live with my decisions.
Um,

601
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:15.130
so any who I um,

602
00:34:16.890 --> 00:34:17.300
<v 5>yeah,</v>

603
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.550
<v 1>let me see what was that?
Oh yes.</v>

604
00:34:18.551 --> 00:34:20.570
So also we ended up going out when we went on a slow

605
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:25.930
<v 0>Oslo,
is that,
are you saying?
And uh,
they took us out to this,
this bar.</v>

606
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:29.290
It was funny.
It was freezing cold out.
We walked home and they were going,
yeah,

607
00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:30.630
just to let you know,
you know,
cause they want you,

608
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.370
you want to take a cab or it's just like a six,
five,
six minute walk.
But like,

609
00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:36.300
oh it's walk and we get out and it was freezing out and the guy goes,
hey,

610
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.990
just let you know this is the bad part of town.

611
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.150
Like a lot of people don't like coming down to this part of town.
It's like,

612
00:34:40.151 --> 00:34:41.800
well you know,
you probably should have said that,
you know,

613
00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:44.880
five minutes ago when we were deciding how we were going to get home so they

614
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.720
have a walking and it was just like,
I don't know.

615
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:50.920
I mean there was definitely some drunk people there didn't seem to fucking crazy

616
00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:52.451
credit.

617
00:34:52.451 --> 00:34:55.450
I was only in that part of time for five minutes and who really mugged somebody

618
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.030
on a freezing cold night.
You know,
I always feel like people that Mug,

619
00:34:58.031 --> 00:35:01.390
people like,
Hey,
I'm going to fucking stay in tonight.
You know,

620
00:35:01.391 --> 00:35:05.460
put on my pj's and read a book on a Mug.
People better,
you know,

621
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.950
mugging for dummies,
whatever the fuck they would read.
Then I went to a,

622
00:35:08.951 --> 00:35:12.420
went to Amsterdam the next day,
um,

623
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.880
eight at this amazing fucking egg place that was right down the street.

624
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.210
They had a gourmet chicken sandwich,
one of those places.
I ordered it and like,

625
00:35:19.211 --> 00:35:23.800
I'm sorry we sold,
we were sold out of that sandwich.
You're like,
ah,

626
00:35:23.801 --> 00:35:27.730
this is one of these ads in places.
Right.
It was delicious.

627
00:35:27.731 --> 00:35:28.630
If you're going to Amsterdam,

628
00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.150
send me an email and I'll let you know what the fuck it is cause I don't have

629
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.660
the information with me right now.
Um,

630
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.500
<v 1>I can show,
can just find it on fucking if you just Google it.
God knows.</v>

631
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:43.530
That's how I found it.
And then I went to,
uh,

632
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.770
we went out to,
I forget the name of the place,

633
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:51.150
there was just some bar where you could just go in and you can just order weed

634
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.670
and smoke some weed.
And so if they had milkshakes too.
So I said I'd fuck it.

635
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:02.450
So may Barton equated in there and I am not a big weed guy and I'm still not.

636
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:07.710
And uh,
I dunno,
this was this body high shit.

637
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:11.790
So I smoked it and I was just like,
I'm not high.
I don't feel high right now.

638
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.270
And I think it was cause it was a body high cause the next day I woke up and I

639
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:19.800
definitely feel like,
you know,
something happened.
So I dunno.

640
00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:23.160
I Dunno if I,
I guess I was,
I don't know.

641
00:36:23.161 --> 00:36:25.920
All I know is I enjoyed the shit out of that fucking milkshake.

642
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.090
And it also took me,
like I asked for a vanilla milkshake

643
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.570
and then the woman showed up and she goes,

644
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.660
when she brought the orders like did you ask for Vanilla or strawberry?

645
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.900
I can't remember.
It's like,
yeah,
because everybody's smoking weed in here.

646
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.341
And I was,

647
00:36:41.341 --> 00:36:44.580
and I looked at it and it looked like a vanilla shake cause it was all white.

648
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.700
Said I stepped.
I go,
yeah,
no that's,
that's,
that's vanilla.

649
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.550
And it wasn't till I was like three quarters of the way through.

650
00:36:51.551 --> 00:36:54.310
Then it Kinda got to the clump of the ice of it,
that,
uh,

651
00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:58.300
the clump of the milkshake,
you know,
it's all stuck together.
That's it.

652
00:36:58.301 --> 00:37:00.810
I guess we're,
all the strawberries were,
I dunno,
I dunno.

653
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.550
But that was sort of interesting.
I,
I gotta be honest with you though,
Dude.

654
00:37:03.551 --> 00:37:08.250
I just,
I'm not into it.
I'm just not into weed.
I'm just like,
I don't know.
I just,

655
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.480
I don't like sitting around like,
hey man,
like I'm just like,

656
00:37:10.481 --> 00:37:13.090
fucking chill in here,
man.
I'm not fucking,
not,

657
00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:18.160
I would rather smoke a cigar and a then just sit there,

658
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.850
which is an obnoxious thing to do.
Um,

659
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:28.030
I will tell you though,
if,
if,
uh,
if you are a single person,

660
00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.930
you know,
and you got a little bit of fucking time off,
I mean,

661
00:37:31.931 --> 00:37:35.680
that part of the world's a great place to go.
Norway and Finland,
the women,

662
00:37:35.681 --> 00:37:38.920
but just fucking gorgeous particulars and they just have like regular jobs

663
00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.530
because there's so many of them.
You know,
you literally order room service.

664
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.381
You're looking at this woman,

665
00:37:44.381 --> 00:37:47.290
it's like you would be reading the national news and my country,

666
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:52.960
oh that say they're all like that,
but Jesus Christ man was,
you know,

667
00:37:52.961 --> 00:37:55.300
I don't know.
I feel like a troll when I'm walking around over there.

668
00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.880
So then lastly,
but leastly uh,
we did our show and Tel Aviv and man,

669
00:38:00.881 --> 00:38:02.020
I just had this feeling,
I was like,

670
00:38:02.021 --> 00:38:05.450
I just got a feeling that show's going to be one of those shows.
And uh,

671
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.340
and it was,
it was like,
um,

672
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:12.920
I feel like the last three shows Norway,

673
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:17.120
Amsterdam and then something happened when I was in,
uh,

674
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:18.760
<v 4>yeah,</v>

675
00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.280
<v 1>when I was in Helsinki where I was just like,
all right,</v>

676
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:22.330
<v 4>yeah,</v>

677
00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:23.890
<v 1>just whatever.
Just do what you always do.</v>

678
00:38:23.891 --> 00:38:25.780
Whatever the joke you think can just do that one next.

679
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:27.160
Cause I was really doing this rigorous,

680
00:38:27.161 --> 00:38:32.161
like I must dump my last hour of material and I must do all of these new bits

681
00:38:32.381 --> 00:38:35.020
that I have and the new bits of working,
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't be doing them.

682
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:39.100
People paid money to see me,
but there was no flow to them.

683
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.530
It was kind of like the Celtics this year.
I'm always fucking ideas,

684
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.690
but it was just like the,
the,
you know,

685
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:50.950
the transitions were a little awkward and I sat,
fuck this,

686
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:52.270
I'm just going to just do my shit.

687
00:38:52.271 --> 00:38:56.680
And it just kind of came to a peak when I went to a Tel Aviv and it just could

688
00:38:56.681 --> 00:38:59.950
not have been a better fucking crowd.
And I,
you know,

689
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:04.951
found out when I was over there that like 10% of their population doesn't even

690
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:09.130
fucking pay taxes.
And from what I can understand,

691
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:13.270
it was the Jewish people who dress up like,
like the,
uh,

692
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.920
sort of the pilgrim look without the buckle on the front and the curly Q hair on

693
00:39:17.921 --> 00:39:21.490
the side.
I don't know if it's every one of them,
but it was just like,
dude,

694
00:39:21.491 --> 00:39:25.570
what the fuck?
How the fuck?
Especially
in Israel,

695
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.770
he can't kick in for a little bit of something to defend your people at that.

696
00:39:32.031 --> 00:39:34.480
That's just,
you know,

697
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.720
I don't get that at all because God knows this.

698
00:39:37.721 --> 00:39:39.910
People in my country doing the same fucking thing,

699
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.700
making billions and billions and millions of fucking dollars,

700
00:39:42.701 --> 00:39:46.210
and they don't pay any fucking taxes.
And then nobody goes after them.

701
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:47.860
And then when the bill comes in,
Oh,

702
00:39:47.861 --> 00:39:50.130
it's a little higher there all week we got a tax.

703
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.990
The people that are already the honest people already pay in taxes.

704
00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:54.220
We got to tax them more.

705
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.690
And what kills me is people who make less money are like,
yeah,

706
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.860
that's the solution.
Nobody goes,
oh,
we got to go after these fucking freeloading.

707
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.750
So anyways,
I made fun of that.
Uh,
came right out,

708
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.840
opened with that.
So I was just like,
all right,
I got to see,
you know where,
where,

709
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:18.710
where these people are at.
I did a Hitler joke that also killed.
And as an aside,

710
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.470
these fucking people are cool and we just,

711
00:40:20.471 --> 00:40:24.580
I just had like the best fucking time and a,

712
00:40:24.581 --> 00:40:29.581
afterwards I met like I think just about every comedian in Israel,

713
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.910
we did a group photo and we were having a great time and this woman kept saying,

714
00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:36.130
all right,
all right,
get out.
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone.
I said,

715
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:41.470
they're not bothering me.
And then she goes,
yes,
they are.
It's like,
Oh,
I'm sorry,

716
00:40:41.471 --> 00:40:43.300
I didn't realize you're more in touch with,

717
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:46.900
I should've put my foot down and spend like lady lady.
They're not,

718
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.780
they're not relax,
relax.
Okay.
They're not bothered.
I'm not just being nice.

719
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.050
I like meeting comedians.
Um,

720
00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.420
so anyway,
uh,

721
00:40:58.421 --> 00:41:01.720
I met them and then when I walked outside there was all these people hanging out

722
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:07.030
and um,
you know,
I took all these pictures.
I met some guy from Turkey,

723
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:09.910
came down from Turkey just to see my act,
which is so flattering.

724
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.060
It was another woman there who was like,
I dunno,
like it looked like,
you know,

725
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:16.630
seven,
eight months pregnant,
you know,

726
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:21.610
took time to come out to the show is just one of those nights.
And,
uh,

727
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.560
Afterwards me Barnet and club Soda Kenny,
like we didn't,

728
00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:27.820
we didn't want the night to end,

729
00:41:27.821 --> 00:41:32.200
so we'd already smoked like two of the best cigars I've,
I've ever had.

730
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.490
There was this right next to my hotel,

731
00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:39.430
there was like this little like Bodega that sold everything from fucking m and

732
00:41:39.431 --> 00:41:40.510
m's and ice cream

733
00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:47.260
and beer and wine too.
Fucking then they had Cuban cigars.

734
00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:50.620
Yeah.
And I don't know what that little humidors system was,

735
00:41:50.621 --> 00:41:55.550
but they smell the drawn on was incredible.
So the first day we smoked a a,

736
00:41:55.551 --> 00:41:56.780
I can't remember we talked about this,

737
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.630
cause I know I recorded the afternoon of the show.

738
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.810
The first one we smoked was a,
uh,

739
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.270
it was a Cohiba robusto and then the next day it was,

740
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:11.330
I don't know if you say part part,
I guess a partake us.
We smoked the a,

741
00:42:11.331 --> 00:42:13.670
the series d,
which is their version,

742
00:42:13.671 --> 00:42:16.400
I think of a robusto and there was two of the best fucking cigars.

743
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:21.010
And we just were sitting there
right on,
uh,

744
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:26.110
Jaffa beach sitting on a park bench watching people go by and,

745
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.110
uh,
you know,
there was a church,
what are they,
what do they call it?

746
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.790
They don't call it,
is it a synagogue?

747
00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.340
<v 5>A temple?
Uh,</v>

748
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:37.220
<v 1>some do would just,
I don't know,</v>

749
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:42.070
on the hour or whatever would start singing in fucking say Hebrew.

750
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.713
<v 4>Okay.</v>

751
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.040
<v 1>You'd just be sitting there,
right?
Like,</v>

752
00:42:45.041 --> 00:42:48.390
you weren't getting enough for the fucking vibe of Israel.

753
00:42:48.391 --> 00:42:49.890
All of a sudden this guy would just,
yeah.

754
00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:52.950
<v 6>Oh,
hey,
a holiday.</v>

755
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.060
<v 1>I was just like,
I can't do it.
Um,
and me bar,</v>

756
00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.650
they would just look at each other and smile like they were in fucking Israel.

757
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:05.680
We just sat there looking at the beautiful Mediterranean Sea smoking this cigar

758
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:08.210
so that later on that night,
or like,

759
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:10.400
what do you want to do is I really want to smoke another cigar.
It's like,
dude,

760
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:11.260
I can't,
I can't,

761
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.870
I've already broke my rule of not smoking a cigar before is shown.

762
00:43:13.871 --> 00:43:17.470
I did that fucking throat is on fire here.
So,
uh,
I went,

763
00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:22.720
did that Bodega and I just got a little thing,
ice cream,
fucking hilarious.

764
00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:26.890
Three big meat heads walking down the beach,
eating ice cream,
you know,

765
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.840
at like fucking 10 30 at night.

766
00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:30.720
<v 5>Uh,</v>

767
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.070
<v 1>and just sat.
They just went over the whole tour in our heads,</v>

768
00:43:35.071 --> 00:43:39.490
just talking about,
um,
you know,

769
00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:42.190
just how much fun we had and what a fucking experience it was.

770
00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:45.910
We went all the way back to like,
dude,
remember when we were Reykjavik Iceland,

771
00:43:45.911 --> 00:43:49.330
meeting all those comedians and going up there and that,

772
00:43:49.331 --> 00:43:52.750
that one Icelandic comedian with the crazy laugh,
he had this love like,

773
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:57.790
how the fuck was,
I can't remember.
It's just like,
it's crazy.
Fucking laugh.

774
00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.960
And then he went on stage and he was funny as hell.
MMM.

775
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.460
And listening to them talking about the secret seller and their whole comedy

776
00:44:06.461 --> 00:44:07.190
thing and,

777
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.090
<v 5>and uh,</v>

778
00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:13.430
<v 1>and then we were off Copenhagen,
Stockholm,</v>

779
00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.880
Finland,
and then the rest of the ones I just talked about,
it could,

780
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:20.420
it just was just really one of those fucking tours.

781
00:44:20.421 --> 00:44:22.760
And I gotta be honest with you,
I'm starting to think like,

782
00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:25.490
I like to traveling internationally to do stand up.

783
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:27.140
Like I don't have to deal with,

784
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.230
like I do stand up now in the states and it's just like,

785
00:44:30.231 --> 00:44:32.850
what do you get off stage?
Like what the fuck did I say it?

786
00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:36.990
What's going to be taken seriously that I'd go too far on that one.

787
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:40.120
Is that going to be some sort of fucking issue?
And um,

788
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.061
I don't know.

789
00:44:42.061 --> 00:44:46.890
It's probably why I went so over the top of my latest special coming out and

790
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:51.180
also why I love the new Nick Depaulo special that's out.
You know,

791
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.430
and I don't agree with everything that the guy says,

792
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:56.070
but just the fact that someone can get out there and just fucking say what

793
00:44:56.071 --> 00:44:57.210
they're thinking anyways.

794
00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.850
And I know there's going to be a bunch of people in the labs are going to be

795
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.380
doing and get gig again.

796
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:04.710
It's like you tell me the difference between that fucking special that far to

797
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:07.920
the right in some of these other specials that far to the left.

798
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:14.030
You know that you get to the point where it's just people just on stage saying

799
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.710
liberal agenda.
There's,
there's no laughing people that just applause break.
Uh,

800
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.640
the younger comics funny as hell.
They told me they call it those comics.

801
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.360
They go on stage and they get clapped her,
nobody's fucking laughing.

802
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:29.070
So this is the answer to that.
And it's like,

803
00:45:29.071 --> 00:45:32.770
if you don't want somebody going that hard and the other side,
then you,
you,

804
00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:35.580
you know,
it's gotten fucking crazy.

805
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.810
Like people need to sort of meet in the middle and,

806
00:45:37.811 --> 00:45:42.180
and listen to each other and respect the fact that we're all fucking living here

807
00:45:42.181 --> 00:45:45.570
and that people have different views on things rather than just being like,

808
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.180
which I'll never,

809
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.160
never my life that I ever think that I would see the left get to the fucking

810
00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:53.160
point where it's just like save what we say,
think what we think.

811
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.730
And if you don't,
we're going to destroy your fucking career.

812
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.860
I was actually reading,
you know,
cause I,
you know,
just watching those old movies

813
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:03.710
<v 5>okay.</v>

814
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:08.270
<v 1>And uh,
watching Joan Crawford and Bette Davis,
you know,</v>

815
00:46:08.271 --> 00:46:10.240
then you start looking them up and then they'll,

816
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.820
they'll show like Lauren Bacall and all these great,
uh,

817
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.820
Ingrid Bergman and all these great actresses from back in the day.

818
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:21.080
And I think it was Lauren Bacall had thing seeing how she was liberal and saying

819
00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.590
being a liberal is the greatest thing that this isn't like the 1940s or 50s.

820
00:46:24.591 --> 00:46:26.420
Being a liberal is the greatest thing that you can be.

821
00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:31.580
It makes you open minded and,
um,
accepting of others.
And just,

822
00:46:31.581 --> 00:46:35.480
and I was,
I was just shaking my head going,
yeah,
that's what it used to be.

823
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.033
<v 5>MMM.</v>

824
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.200
<v 1>I don't know.
I don't think it was always that because I always do think that.</v>

825
00:46:41.201 --> 00:46:46.130
I don't think that,
um,
I don't know,
back when I was growing up,
I mean,

826
00:46:46.131 --> 00:46:49.160
politicians have always been filthy,
but like they had like that,

827
00:46:49.161 --> 00:46:53.390
that they kind of enjoyed the back and forth.
It wasn't as nasty as it is now,

828
00:46:53.391 --> 00:46:54.950
but,
but whatever,

829
00:46:54.951 --> 00:46:57.800
you just listened to a guy who doesn't even fucking watch the news and miss most

830
00:46:57.801 --> 00:46:58.640
of the sporting events.

831
00:46:58.641 --> 00:47:00.980
But tonight I got a little bit of rehearsal for that film.

832
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:05.180
I'm going to start the game a little bit late,
but,
uh,
go Bruins is always,

833
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.010
and I'm looking forward to another great series.

834
00:47:07.011 --> 00:47:11.030
Congratulations to the Columbus blue jackets.
On a phenomenal season.

835
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.570
Congratulations to the Milwaukee Bucks.
Moving on.

836
00:47:14.571 --> 00:47:18.350
I'm going to enjoy watching you guys.
Uh,
I think I'm going to,
uh,

837
00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:23.240
maybe I'll root for the bucks.
I Dunno.
I saw Duran,

838
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.010
thank God Warrenton blow out as Achilles.

839
00:47:25.011 --> 00:47:28.520
That's like the fucking worst for a basketball or any,
any athletes.

840
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:33.100
So it's just calf strain.
So,
uh,
she may be watched the rest of that series.

841
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:38.170
God knows I got nothing to do and I'm really tempted to fill up all my free time

842
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:40.480
with going out and flying a fucking helicopter.
But,
uh,

843
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.820
I've learned that that adds stress.

844
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:47.170
Drains me when I fill up all everything in my life and then I fucking stuck

845
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:51.550
getting upset and then people suffer,
so I got to stop fucking doing that shit.

846
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:54.940
So I think will only fly like twice instead of 40 types of,

847
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.490
whenever I am wired the way I'm wired.

848
00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.910
I'm doing the goddamn comedy jam on Monday.
The last show

849
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.990
<v 0>at the,
uh,

850
00:48:04.991 --> 00:48:09.580
What's the name of the fucking venue at the Roxy?
Monday.

851
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:11.860
Uh,
[inaudible]

852
00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:16.240
<v 1>May 13th at 9:00 PM,
and,
uh,
I got to get this song together.
I'm,</v>

853
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:21.100
I'm playing a song that's just a wait.
Yeah,

854
00:48:21.101 --> 00:48:23.930
May 13th.
Yeah,
I'm playing,
I'm playing a song as always,
I'm,

855
00:48:23.931 --> 00:48:28.440
I'm always reaching beyond unless I play like highway to hell.
I'm,
I even then,

856
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.790
you know,

857
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:33.090
that song is not as easy as you'd think as far as just playing something that's

858
00:48:33.091 --> 00:48:34.170
simple and making it sound good.

859
00:48:34.171 --> 00:48:38.850
So I am reaching beyond my ability.
So,
uh,

860
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.070
let's see.
I'm waiting for this thing to fucking load here.

861
00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:45.240
All I can see is the other two names.
They,
it says Jeff Ross in Mas.

862
00:48:45.241 --> 00:48:49.590
So that's obviously Jeb,
Ronnie Mazda,
Bronnie,
Jeff Ross,
myself,
Josh,

863
00:48:49.591 --> 00:48:52.440
Adam Meyers is wonderful band.
And uh,

864
00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:54.180
this'll be the last one at the Roxy Theater.

865
00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:57.450
I think they've actually maybe outgrown it and they're going to move onto a

866
00:48:57.451 --> 00:48:58.284
bigger venue.

867
00:48:59.180 --> 00:48:59.470
<v 4>Okay.</v>

868
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:03.010
<v 1>So,
uh,
I'm gonna be down there,
try out my new jokes,</v>

869
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.660
forcing them down your throats,

870
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:07.480
and then I'm going to get up and make a fool of myself.
Playing drums is always,

871
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:10.660
it's going to be be a,
it's gotta be a great time.

872
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:13.270
I hope to rose is going to be there.
I'm not sure if he is.

873
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:18.560
Why won't this fucking thing
tell me who's on the lineup.

874
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:21.590
Oh,
there it is.
Uh,

875
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.940
they got the name of the fucking promoters on there.
Come on.

876
00:49:27.941 --> 00:49:31.960
Who else is going to be on this fucking thing?
Look at me.
Look at me.

877
00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:32.794
It's so early in the morning.

878
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.530
Can actually do an hour here on the Thursday podcast.

879
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.830
All it has is the names of the promoters.
Oh Man,

880
00:49:42.831 --> 00:49:45.110
look at that cheeseburger.
Jesus the Internet.
They just know.

881
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:47.480
They fucking know they,
they,
that's why they want to have the cookies everywhere.

882
00:49:47.481 --> 00:49:51.260
So they,
we see what he's into and I make it and that fucking patriots jacket,

883
00:49:51.261 --> 00:49:52.340
I'm not going to buy it.

884
00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.640
I feel like if I finally by that thing,
when I click,
you know,

885
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.660
the paypal to pay for it,
the my computer is going to go.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

886
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.160
<v 0>We knew you couldn't resist.</v>

887
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.090
For those of you who haven't been listening to podcasts.
I,

888
00:50:09.091 --> 00:50:11.620
I went on Mitchell and ness.

889
00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:15.490
I love that website even though I look like a jerk off and all of their fucking,

890
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:21.190
you know,
all of their fucking stuff just because I'm an old guy here.

891
00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:22.420
But,
uh,
I looked up,
I was,

892
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:25.380
this is patriots jacket that I wanted when I was a little kid and I still,
I,

893
00:50:25.381 --> 00:50:30.200
I finally found it,
um,
and who made it,
but uh,
they discontinued it.

894
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.440
It was a cheap jacket anyways,
the sleeves look leather,

895
00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:37.190
but I believe there was some sort of vinyl and then it was supposed to be sort

896
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:39.500
of a wool,
you know,

897
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:42.500
it's like a varsity jacket and the jacket part that fit around like a

898
00:50:42.501 --> 00:50:46.040
bulletproof vest,
that part of the jacket is,
uh,
was supposed to be wool,

899
00:50:46.041 --> 00:50:50.540
but it was this pillowy cheap fucking,
the whole thing was a mess.
Um,

900
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:54.500
but I went on Mitchell and ness first to see if they had done a version of the

901
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:57.530
jacket and they didn't.
And I looked at some patriots jackets and I swear to God,

902
00:50:57.531 --> 00:51:00.980
this was like fucking two months ago,
60 days ago,
and they won't let up.

903
00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.231
They won't let up,

904
00:51:03.231 --> 00:51:08.231
which means somebody at least 60 days in that they just kept showing the ad to

905
00:51:08.961 --> 00:51:11.390
finally clicked and said,
yeah,
I'm going to buy that fucking thing.

906
00:51:11.391 --> 00:51:15.050
How hilarious is that?
Oh,
advertising.
All right.
That's it.

907
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:19.940
Thank you to everybody came out to my shows.
I'm back here in the US.
Um,

908
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:23.960
I'm going to watch the Bruins tonight and,
um,

909
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:28.250
I think Joe Rogan is out of the ice house.
If I get a fucking second wind,

910
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:32.210
we'll see.
We'll see.
I might be too fucking tired.
Um,

911
00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:35.210
I'm not officially on that fucking show,
but there's a chance I might,

912
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.840
I might drop by.
I shouldn't say that because I most likely won't.
All right.

913
00:51:38.841 --> 00:51:40.220
There's the oldest and most likely won't,

914
00:51:40.221 --> 00:51:45.221
but right now and fucking 4:37 AM I'm feeling like I can fucking do that to take

915
00:51:45.981 --> 00:51:48.920
a little cat nap.
All right.
That said,
go fuck yourselves.

916
00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:50.840
Have a great weekend and I'll talk to you on Monday.

917

That's Omar laughing in the background.
He's going to,

932
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:36.780
he's going to be doing the a actually working the boards.

933
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:40.100
People have always complained about how awful your levels,
my levels are.

934
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:40.951
You know what I like to do,

935
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:44.370
I like to take the base and turn it all the way down and then just crank up the

936
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:49.300
high end so it makes people's ears bleed.
Absolutely.
That sets what I go.
It's,

937
00:53:49.301 --> 00:53:51.450
so anyways,
we're going to be hyping that this week.

938
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:55.380
Jim Norton is actually going to call in.
David tell is going to call in.

939
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.670
Jim Breuer was actually too busy.
So whenever we got two out of three,
you know,

940
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:03.060
one of the biggest tours out there,
uh,
as I've said before,

941
00:54:03.061 --> 00:54:08.061
the sort of the Miami heat of comedy tours or possibly the Ocean's 11 if seven

942
00:54:08.461 --> 00:54:12.780
of them died tragically and then four decided to carry on and do a fucking

943
00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:15.990
comedy show.
So anyways,
I will waiting for Jim Norton to call in at this moment.

944
00:54:15.991 --> 00:54:19.200
So while Miss,
do what I always do,
I'm going to riff Omar.

945
00:54:19.201 --> 00:54:22.710
If I look at you and I looked panicked and I'm feeling fucking nuts,

946
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.770
we'll refer a little bit,
but until then,
just act like I'm not even here.

947
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:30.760
Let's just make this is fucking weird as humanly possible.
Comfortable.

948
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.870
Um,
somebody who is,
let's see what is going on.
Let's wait.

949
00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:35.280
What are we going to start with this week?

950
00:54:35.281 --> 00:54:39.180
Why don't we start talking about sports everybody.
Huh?

951
00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:43.920
The fucking Bruins finished off the goddamn filthy flyers,

952
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.530
which made me feel good.
And for all flyer fans out there,

953
00:54:46.531 --> 00:54:50.520
I'm not even gonna Talk Shit.
I'm not even gonna gloat because a,

954
00:54:50.521 --> 00:54:54.090
I was beyond nervous when we were up three games to none,
uh,

955
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.310
because of what happened to us last year.
And I was actually,

956
00:54:56.311 --> 00:54:58.890
I was actually praying,
not praying.

957
00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:02.730
I was kinda hoping on some level that you guys would win one of the first three

958
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:05.550
games.
So,
so even if we lost the series,

959
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:08.520
it wouldn't again be from fucking being up three games to none.

960
00:55:08.521 --> 00:55:10.710
So I have to admit,
I don't know if you noticed,

961
00:55:10.711 --> 00:55:12.870
but when you guys tied up game for one one,

962
00:55:12.871 --> 00:55:15.300
did you notice how quiet the fucking garden got?
So,
uh,

963
00:55:15.301 --> 00:55:18.780
we were all nervous about that shit,
but uh,
that's it man.

964
00:55:18.781 --> 00:55:22.890
Enjoy your golf and go fuck yourselves with your little fucking cream sickle

965
00:55:22.891 --> 00:55:26.580
uniforms.
It's over.
It's fucking over for you once again.

966
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.450
And hopefully we won't be right behind you cause I'm fucking nervous about

967
00:55:30.451 --> 00:55:32.940
playing Tampa Bay because they have a,

968
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:36.390
they got three cons on that team that can put the biscuit in the basket as they

969
00:55:36.391 --> 00:55:40.440
say.
And I'm really,
uh,
I don't know,
fucking know.
It's the bro Wins,

970
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:43.800
you know what I mean?
Every time you get excited and you're like,

971
00:55:43.801 --> 00:55:47.270
you know how that,
this might be the year,
this could be it.
Oh,

972
00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.850
speaking of filthy fliers,
what about that bullshit at the end of the game?

973
00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:51.641
Was it because we get,

974
00:55:51.641 --> 00:55:55.860
we scored two empty net goals that you decided to give Patrice Bergeron a mild

975
00:55:55.861 --> 00:55:59.340
concussion.
The basic,
the Jason Kidd of our fucking team.

976
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.080
Is that what you had to do?
I'm really happy that,
what's his face?
Uh,

977
00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:07.200
Josh Hart and I'll actually shaved off all that fucking hair that he had.

978
00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:10.830
I really hated that home.
Mac Davis looked that he was rocking and I couldn't,

979
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:14.880
I got to admit,
I didn't even notice him in the,
in the series.

980
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.550
I think he's like Thor.
Like he cut off his fucking hit.

981
00:56:17.551 --> 00:56:22.410
Who's the guy you pick if you cut off his fucking hair?
Uh,
Samson.
He said,

982
00:56:22.411 --> 00:56:27.270
Samson,
are you one of those comic book nerds who will get into all this?
Fuck,

983
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.120
no.
I,
you asked me anything about comic books.
I don't know.
Have any clue.
Yeah.

984
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.340
All these fucking movies,
Thor.
I mean,

985
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.450
how much are you scraping the bottom of the barrel when you're down to the guy

986
00:56:37.451 --> 00:56:42.070
who has a hammer?
He's got this fucking hammer,
Eddie,

987
00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:42.811
he and,

988
00:56:42.811 --> 00:56:47.260
and that's all his power and then fucking his dad throws it down to the earth.

989
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.550
Like I gotta admit,

990
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:52.870
I understand that me being into sports at the level of Matt and the fact that I

991
00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:56.440
don't even play is roughly the same thing I guess.

992
00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.960
But at least sports is real.
The fuck is wrong with you guys,
with you.

993
00:57:00.961 --> 00:57:05.961
God Damn Thor wallpaper and Flash Pajamas and they've now how many,

994
00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:11.110
how many fucking good movies do they even make with the superhero movies?

995
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:15.460
Honestly,
did you guys really like Spiderman?
Where you really into that?

996
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:20.140
Where they,
uh,
they gave him a girlfriend with those little teeth,
remember that,

997
00:57:20.141 --> 00:57:23.380
and he's fucking kissing her upside.
They turned it into a fucking love story.

998
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:27.640
So they could get you to bring your fucking broad down to the movie theater.

999
00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:30.970
Spiderman did not have a not good looking or a mediocre,

1000
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:34.570
whoever the fuck played his wife.
And those movies,

1001
00:57:34.571 --> 00:57:37.750
I would not be nervous approaching in a bar and that there's something wrong

1002
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:42.280
with that being a balding redhead.
Okay.
There's something wrong.
I should be,

1003
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:47.110
I should be beyond nervous.
But I wasn't.
I remember when I saw the fucking movie,

1004
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:50.200
I remember thinking,
where's the raven haired big hip,

1005
00:57:50.201 --> 00:57:53.530
big titty girlfriend that he had in the,
in the comic books.

1006
00:57:53.531 --> 00:57:56.290
And she was nowhere to be found.
Kirsten Dunst.

1007
00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.300
That's what it was with their little toddler teeth sitting there smiling at him.

1008
00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:05.710
She was awful.
She looked like six a picture you'd see in like one of those,
uh,

1009
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:08.920
one of those fairy tales.
The fables,
you know,

1010
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:11.290
be like the girlfriend ambient to mean to her.

1011
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:14.740
I was going to say the fucking girlfriend of the troll under the bridge.

1012
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:17.860
Um,
anyways,
uh,

1013
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:20.650
this is probably odd to the actually have them hearing you laughing in the

1014
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:25.150
background.
Usually it's just me sort of like babbling in the bedroom.

1015
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:27.370
You know what?
Yeah,
bring that down.
Just so,
because you know,

1016
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.040
people learn the fucking internet no matter what,
they're going to trash.

1017
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.600
The poor kids shook.

1018
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:34.660
What the fuck was that Guy Giggling in the background for him.

1019
00:58:34.661 --> 00:58:38.770
I'm gonna have to deal with all of that,
all of that horseshit.
So,
uh,
like I said,

1020
00:58:38.771 --> 00:58:40.450
when I look at you in a moment of panic,

1021
00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:43.510
like I don't know where the fuck this is going to be going.
Uh,

1022
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:48.750
for the love of God.
Bring up your mic and a and save me.
But I,

1023
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:50.650
like I said,
we're sitting here,
we're waiting for a,

1024
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:55.651
for the legendary Jim Norton Star of I was actually looking at is IMDP page and

1025
00:58:56.771 --> 00:58:58.630
a,
I didn't realize all this shit that this guy has done.

1026
00:58:58.631 --> 00:59:02.650
He just recently did a spot on bored to death,
a hit television show,

1027
00:59:02.651 --> 00:59:06.820
I believe on Hbo or showtime.
He's a bestselling author.
He's got two books.

1028
00:59:06.821 --> 00:59:08.350
Happy endings.
I hate your guts.

1029
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:13.420
He's got a brand new CD out called despicable available.
Look at me.

1030
00:59:13.421 --> 00:59:17.800
I'm hyping is shit before he even gets on the goddamn phone,
by the way.
Um,

1031
00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:18.520
when,

1032
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.710
when I gave him the phone number to call in there they are gonna it's going to

1033
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:24.650
light up here,
right?
I'll see you.
The phone numbers are going to light up.
Okay.

1034
00:59:24.651 --> 00:59:25.910
I'm just making sure.
All right.

1035
00:59:25.911 --> 00:59:30.890
This takes me back to the days I used to do a show back with the teen idols

1036
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:35.480
sensation from the,
and Anthony showed
Judd Joe de Rosa.
I used to do a show,

1037
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:39.230
we used to try to take callers and he's still always be a fucking nightmare.
So,

1038
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:43.280
um,
this is actually taken me back.
You know,

1039
00:59:43.281 --> 00:59:46.640
we used to actually do this show called uninformed that we're trying desperately

1040
00:59:46.641 --> 00:59:49.940
to bring back.
The problem is,
is that we live on opposite coasts.

1041
00:59:49.941 --> 00:59:51.440
I don't know if we can tie in Skype.

1042
00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:54.410
We got to figure out a fucking way to do that.
Um,

1043
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:57.470
but we used to take callers and because it was a brand new show,

1044
00:59:57.471 --> 01:00:02.240
we might as well been like on like,
like public access.
We just go like,
hey,

1045
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:06.710
we're talking about a apple trees.
Anybody want to call in on that?

1046
01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:10.390
And then we would just have fucking callers call in,
wait what?

1047
01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:13.880
Talking about apple trees and you pick it up.
Hey,
why don't you go fuck yourself,

1048
01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:15.860
you fag.
And then they'd hang up on us.

1049
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:20.750
So we stopped taking collars and I learned my lesson.
So this,
um,

1050
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.060
this week I'm just going to have fellow artists,
fellow artists call it,

1051
01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:27.550
but wait a minute,
you know,
I'm getting sidetracked here.

1052
01:00:27.551 --> 01:00:30.710
I almost forgot to talk about the fucking Lakers.
What the hell was that?

1053
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.760
What in God's name was that fucking debacle?

1054
01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:39.170
That's how you go out Los Angeles.
Lakers.
You call yourself.

1055
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:43.010
What the fuck was magic talking about where you were classy organization sense

1056
01:00:43.011 --> 01:00:48.010
when I think you showed your true colors,
but you're God damn right.

1057
01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:52.280
That's how you send out Phil Jackson.
The fucking rent are back of,
of,

1058
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:53.720
of this era.

1059
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:57.620
That's how you send them out by elbow in that little white guy from the

1060
01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.330
[inaudible].
You see that little spares coming down the fucking pain.

1061
01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:04.790
I didn't know he was like maybe an inch taller than I was.

1062
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:08.010
He just looked like some guy,
you know,
who just,
you know,

1063
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:09.800
let you know those guys will short guys are the worst.

1064
01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:10.850
Whenever you play pickup hoop,

1065
01:01:10.851 --> 01:01:14.510
you know they got their fucking balls right on your leg just playing ridiculous

1066
01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:16.280
defense.
That was that guy.

1067
01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:18.860
So there's part of it that I actually thought was mildly funny,

1068
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.910
that he elbowed him.
He went beyond the float and rib.
He cut that rib.

1069
01:01:22.911 --> 01:01:26.740
That's right in your fucking armpit.
But uh,
seriously man.
What a,

1070
01:01:26.741 --> 01:01:29.270
what a fucking horrific way to go out.
You know what's funny?

1071
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.360
This is how much I hate the Goddamn Lakers.
I didn't even watch,

1072
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.890
I didn't even watch a minute of basketball for months.

1073
01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:40.100
I think the last time I watched the game was when I went to a Memphis Grizzlies

1074
01:01:40.101 --> 01:01:44.570
Lakers game.
I don't watch hoop.
I think it's fucking boring as hell.

1075
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:49.010
Pro Hoop,
everybody gets six files.
There's 11 guys on each teams.

1076
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.260
That's 132 fucking files.
And then once they get in the penalty,

1077
01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:57.710
the fucking game is decided by unguarded shots from the foul line is fucking

1078
01:01:57.711 --> 01:01:59.660
horrific.
It's horrific.

1079
01:01:59.661 --> 01:02:02.720
But if I see the Lakers are about ready to fail,

1080
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:07.130
that's when I tune in and I got to tell you,
I was out on mother's Day.

1081
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:08.780
Do you guys have a good mother's Day by the way?

1082
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.500
Anybody out there did anybody out there order pro flowers?

1083
01:02:12.501 --> 01:02:16.790
I haven't heard a fucking word from them so I'm,
I'm taking that as a bad sign.

1084
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.950
I don't know that I sold any bouquets.
Oh Maher last week.

1085
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:25.010
I actually had for the first time I had a advertising here on this podcast and I

1086
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:26.490
was all excited.
Right.

1087
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.330
And I did sort of my own brand of podcasting [inaudible] advertising where you

1088
01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.330
sort of dropped,
you know,

1089
01:02:33.331 --> 01:02:37.500
hints about serial killers and incest and possibly you say cut in the middle of

1090
01:02:37.501 --> 01:02:40.590
the read,
write,
add a.
I don't think,
I don't know that I sold any.

1091
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:43.770
I didn't work too well.
Well you know I,
I try,

1092
01:02:43.771 --> 01:02:46.960
I tried to go the fucking every man route.
I try to be loud,

1093
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:50.340
just make this shit conversational.
I'll just say it the way I said,

1094
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:53.710
I thought I painted a nice picture.
I was talking about.
Look what?

1095
01:02:53.711 --> 01:02:57.120
What did you get your mother's mother for mother's Day?
Ah,
just the first of all.

1096
01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.180
Do you deal like your mother?
She's okay.
She's all right.
So yeah,

1097
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.680
as you kind of gets on my nerves,
you know,
hey,
you know,
it's definitely,

1098
01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.730
I kind of do it just cause I have to type,

1099
01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.060
we don't have a really good relationship.
Okay,
so you just got a card.
Yeah.

1100
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:11.060
When did you get it?
Mother's Day.
Sunday.
When did you get a Friday?

1101
01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:14.780
You've got a Friday,
right?
The pickings were pretty slim,
aren't they?
Oh,
totally.

1102
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.390
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
And that's what I was saying.
By the time you get in there,

1103
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:21.470
the only thing that's left is like the Fart joke card or the one that's like

1104
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:25.700
mildly incestuous.
Right,
right,
right,
right.
Totally over the top.
Love your mom.

1105
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:29.180
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,
that's what I said.
Yeah.
That's what I still have a ways.

1106
01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:30.530
Sony fucking flowers.

1107
01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:35.960
I haven't heard one goddamn peep from the people over at pro flowers.

1108
01:03:35.961 --> 01:03:40.490
You know what?
Fuck that.
Fuck them and fuck they're fucking flowers.
Right?

1109
01:03:40.491 --> 01:03:45.170
You call me with updates.
I'm to one secure,
I can't deal with the silence.

1110
01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:46.130
You know,
it's funny.

1111
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:49.370
I bet I sold a bunch of them and now I just told him to go fuck themselves.

1112
01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.860
It's a novel.
You know what I'm doing?
I'm just going to do this puck.

1113
01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.090
I want advertising on the same,

1114
01:03:53.091 --> 01:03:56.900
but I'm going to continue to do it the way I do it.
And when,
when people finally,

1115
01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:57.734
you know,

1116
01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:02.360
there'll be products that fit into a saint concert in the middle of it,
right?

1117
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:06.680
Absolutely.
All right.
So anyways,
the fucking Lakers,

1118
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.180
the Goddamn Lakers lose.
And uh,
I had just,

1119
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.010
it just thrilled me to no end,
but I gotta tell you something.

1120
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:15.890
They went out like a bunch of bitches.
All right.

1121
01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.730
A bunch of seven foot bitches that I would never say it to their fucking faces,

1122
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:24.080
but I'm saying it right now in the safety of this soundproof room.

1123
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:25.760
What the fuck?
Who,
who,

1124
01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:29.150
who the fuck told that guy to take his goddamn shirt off and he wasn't even in

1125
01:04:29.151 --> 01:04:29.984
shape.

1126
01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.100
Andrew buying and maybe you didn't blow out your ankle every time you cross your

1127
01:04:34.101 --> 01:04:37.520
fucking legs.
You could do a goddamn set up.
How dare you?

1128
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:41.600
How dare you do something like that with a man who's got 11 championships.

1129
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.510
I don't know.
You fucking kills me is,

1130
01:04:44.511 --> 01:04:47.570
I'm actually psyched at hopefully that Phil Jackson's going to retire because he

1131
01:04:47.571 --> 01:04:51.470
has the ability to,
to,
to,
to coach a team with a bunch of stars.

1132
01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:55.010
Much like a Joe Torry and I'm really hoping that motherfucker's going to quit.

1133
01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:55.600
You know,

1134
01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.670
I'm gonna go fucking stare at his naval and do all that Zen shit is he takes

1135
01:04:58.671 --> 01:05:01.580
ecstasy or whatever the fuck it is.
He does just get out.

1136
01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.980
Just get out of the league.
I don't give a fuck if you get back in the league,

1137
01:05:03.981 --> 01:05:07.580
go join the heat.
I don't give a fuck.
Just get away from the Lakers.
Right.

1138
01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:09.470
But this is what killed me.

1139
01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:13.040
I'm hearing rumors that the Lakers are going to get Dwight Howard,
you know,

1140
01:05:13.041 --> 01:05:15.650
cause he wants to come out here and be a fucking movie star.

1141
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:18.280
And I was just joking about on Kevin and being like,

1142
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:21.310
what are these basketball players going to realize that they don't have a shot

1143
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:24.850
at being a fucking movie star?
Cause they're too God damn tall.
You know,

1144
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.690
don't you see how ridiculous you look in street clothes?
If you ever seen a,

1145
01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:32.560
a professional basketball player off the court,
like standing in a bar,

1146
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:33.920
they fucking,

1147
01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.850
they got to duck every three seconds so they don't get hit by a ceiling fan.

1148
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.640
They're freaks.
They're absolute fucking freaks.

1149
01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:41.860
You think you're going to sit there and be like a love interest?

1150
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:46.570
Maybe if they remake Conan the barbarian and you want to sit on the back of a

1151
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:49.450
fucking Clyde,
stay on your feet is still dragging on the ground.

1152
01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:54.040
We could sticky in that.
It's just pissing me off to Dwight Howard's gonna.

1153
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.970
He's gonna come out here and Coby might get another fucking rink.
He,

1154
01:05:57.971 --> 01:05:59.410
that guy has no moves,
right?

1155
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.130
Do you realize the amount of people who could kick the living shit out of me

1156
01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:05.980
that I've already trashed?
When am I trash somebody who can't do anything?

1157
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:08.950
How about a Sama bin Laden everybody.
Huh?

1158
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:12.700
There's one mother fucker won't be knocking on any cave doors anymore.

1159
01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:18.490
You don't blow up in my mind is,
I am totally into conspiracy theory,

1160
01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:21.580
but the conspiracy theory that people have that he was,

1161
01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:24.280
that he was already dead or even better,

1162
01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:28.840
that he still fucking alive actually made me laugh.

1163
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:34.900
You know,
paranoid fellow paranoids psychos out there.
Um,

1164
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:39.340
if a Salman bin Laden was still alive,
right,

1165
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:43.330
and you're hanging out with them and America's sitting here gloating heaven,

1166
01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:48.130
one of their first truly proud days,
I feel since September 11th,

1167
01:06:48.131 --> 01:06:50.290
because that Shit's just been hanging over this country.

1168
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:55.930
Wouldn't you just make a video with the Sama holding the fucking Pakistani

1169
01:06:55.931 --> 01:06:59.860
gazette for that day?
Maybe you guys go over to the water park.

1170
01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.840
He allowed to do that and that part of the world.

1171
01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:06.760
Do they add the six flags infiltrated there yet?
The fucking infidels of we,

1172
01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:10.360
if we,
if given you a theme park,
you know,

1173
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:12.600
did we come up with some sort of Arab,
uh,

1174
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:14.590
fucking Mickey mouse that we could sell to you?

1175
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:17.650
Maybe stick a fucking Starbucks right next to it.
You know,

1176
01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.310
wouldn't you just do that and make the video and be like,
I'm still alive.

1177
01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:23.740
Go Fuck Yourself,
America.
And then a,

1178
01:07:23.741 --> 01:07:28.741
then Obama would look like an asshole and then he would be fucked for 2012 for

1179
01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:30.550
saying that,
uh,

1180
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.600
that a SAML was dead or if he died years before,

1181
01:07:34.601 --> 01:07:38.260
why wouldn't you just released that video?
I don't get it.
You know,

1182
01:07:38.261 --> 01:07:42.070
like even even I'm not that fucking paranoid and I think it's a great thing and

1183
01:07:42.071 --> 01:07:46.660
all you fucking losers out there who are trying to be all fucking deep going

1184
01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:51.370
like,
man,
what's everybody cheering about?
About the killing of a,
of a,

1185
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:56.290
of a fellow human being because he fucking killed 3000 people.
You asshole.

1186
01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:58.250
You know,
I,

1187
01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:01.130
I love these fucking idiots who are trying to be like all fucking deep as

1188
01:08:01.131 --> 01:08:02.950
they're sitting there going like,
oh,
well,
you know,

1189
01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:04.840
we got mad at them when they cheered,

1190
01:08:04.841 --> 01:08:09.841
when the fucking towers went down and now here we are cheering when a,

1191
01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:15.180
it gets killed.
A cycle.
Here's the difference.
All right.
Those,
uh,

1192
01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:20.120
sounded been lot actually is a fucking mass murderer who created nine 11.

1193
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:23.480
All right,
so that's who we killed.

1194
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:28.010
We didn't just fucking kill a whole bunch of fucking innocent people and started

1195
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.260
sharing.
Isn't that the difference?
Oh,
go fuck yourself.
Okay.

1196
01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:36.080
You got a rabid dog in your neighborhood.
You fucking put it down.
Okay.

1197
01:08:36.081 --> 01:08:36.440
Do you think,

1198
01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.760
and I don't like how this guy is being made out by some people sound bit Alon,

1199
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.970
like he's some sort of a fucking rebel.
He wasn't,
he was a goddamn psychopath.

1200
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:46.400
And if he was running the world,
would you want,
I don't,

1201
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:50.090
I don't think I'd want to be a chick.
Right.
I wouldn't want to be a,

1202
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.100
not only not part of his religion,

1203
01:08:52.101 --> 01:08:56.150
but practicing the religion the way he'd feels in a different way than he feels

1204
01:08:56.151 --> 01:09:00.200
you should.
The guy was a fucking maniac.
All right?
I thought it was a rebel.

1205
01:09:00.201 --> 01:09:02.870
He should be living in a cage,
not sitting in a fucking mansion.

1206
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:06.140
Guy's got a bigger house than I do.
Fuck him.
He was a rich kid.

1207
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:07.400
He was rebelling against his dad.

1208
01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.780
You've got to beans through the cabbage and they throw them in a lake and I love

1209
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.730
it,
you know?

1210
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:21.730
No,
it's funny.
I got,
I got it.
Oh Shit.
Saved by the bell.
Saved by the bell.

1211
01:09:21.731 --> 01:09:25.300
I think this might be Jim Norton.
You got to pick up.
He's picking up the phone.

1212
01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.340
He's picking up the phone.
If it's your wife.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

1213
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:33.370
Hey guys,
I'm going to be a,
you know what this is.
Sorry.

1214
01:09:33.371 --> 01:09:36.520
This is not very professional.
No,
no.
It's all right.
Yeah.
Why the fuck did it,

1215
01:09:36.521 --> 01:09:38.170
you know what?
You know how,
what a loser I am.

1216
01:09:38.171 --> 01:09:42.640
I didn't even realize at that moment wasn't professional.
Sorry about that.

1217
01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.270
Jesus Christ.
I was all excited.
You know what Jim was supposed to be on like,

1218
01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:49.450
like 15 minutes ago.
I know.
I got a feeling it ain't going to happen.

1219
01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:54.160
Busy man like him.
Do you have his number?
Busy man like him?
Uh,

1220
01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:57.940
yeah,
I do,
but I'm not going to bug him.
He knows he's supposed to call in,

1221
01:09:57.941 --> 01:10:00.160
but I mean,
I dunno if he's wrapping up.

1222
01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:01.870
I don't even know what fucking time it is over there.

1223
01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:03.851
You know it's going to be fucked.

1224
01:10:03.851 --> 01:10:07.030
You know what might be the comedy of this fucking episode is that I came down to

1225
01:10:07.031 --> 01:10:10.810
this studio and then nobody calls him.
No,
absolutely.

1226
01:10:10.811 --> 01:10:14.320
Nobody calls in Jesus Christ.
What do I do here?

1227
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:17.770
Do I hit pause on the recording and then call my publicist?

1228
01:10:17.771 --> 01:10:20.830
Is this what I have to do?
Any port in a storm?

1229
01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:24.670
What do you think?
Yeah,
if we could do that right.

1230
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:27.430
Fucking hit pause for half a second.
Sorry everybody.
This is the,
you know what?

1231
01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:29.320
This isn't even gonna be a pause in your guys' world.

1232
01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:33.940
This is just gonna fucking flow.
All right,
hit pause.
All right,
we're back.

1233
01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:38.560
Um,
is that,
that thing's not moving over there.
The old EKG monitor.
Are we back?

1234
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:42.550
Oh,
I see.
All right.
Well what back in?
I don't know what the fuck happened.

1235
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.910
All I know is David tell he's supposed to be our next guest.

1236
01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.560
Oh,
fuck me.

1237
01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:56.130
Do you guys realize the level of high hopes that I had for this fucking podcast?

1238
01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:57.870
I was actually in a real studio.

1239
01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:01.950
I actually got a frill professional here to work the Goddamn board,
the levels.

1240
01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.850
We're going to be great.
I was going to have people calling in last week.

1241
01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:09.660
I add advertising media was all good.
What could go wrong?

1242
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:12.500
You know what it's like.
Anybody see that mark,
uh,

1243
01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:16.530
that for 30 Marcus dupree story,
I couldn't even get through it.

1244
01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:20.700
Skye's like one of the greatest running backs that never made the pros.

1245
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:24.210
He actually finally got to the Rosie,
played a few games with the rams,

1246
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.880
have some shit,
but I wanted to feel bad for the guy,

1247
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:31.740
but he was such a dope and he was surrounded by a bunch of dopes that I couldn't

1248
01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:35.520
feel bad for him.
I just had to shut it off.
It was just a N***a got another one,

1249
01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:40.180
<v 9>Julie,
uh,
uh,
I wasn't in good shape.
A cooler burn book</v>

1250
01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.990
<v 0>and it's just like,
all right,
go fuck yourself.
You know,</v>

1251
01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:49.840
I'm weird man.
I'm a,
I am like a total fucking like liberal and I and I,

1252
01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:54.370
I,
I adjusted my liberal thought,
well,
you know,

1253
01:11:54.371 --> 01:11:56.800
I will definitely listen to somebody else's side of the argument,

1254
01:11:56.801 --> 01:12:01.570
but if you're not fucking work and to dig yourself out of a fucking hole,

1255
01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:04.120
then you know,
bury yourself.
I don't give a shit.

1256
01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:05.410
I'm not going to still sit there.

1257
01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.320
Who's that chick with the big head from all in the family.

1258
01:12:08.321 --> 01:12:11.470
She's always standing next to people who need a sandwich.
Right.

1259
01:12:11.471 --> 01:12:15.490
I don't give a fuck at that point.
You know,
that didn't even make sense.

1260
01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.920
You know what it's really trying to say.
It's like,
yeah,
it's like,

1261
01:12:17.921 --> 01:12:20.710
I had a buddy of mine just fucking,
his whole,

1262
01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:25.480
his whole life became about weed and he just was smoking it all the fucking
time.

1263
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:28.630
He was getting high at work,
getting fucking flunk and drug tests.

1264
01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:33.970
Then he starts calling me up,
hey man,
can you give me some money?
And it's like,

1265
01:12:33.971 --> 01:12:38.080
no,
go fuck yourself so you can do what?

1266
01:12:38.081 --> 01:12:42.250
Go buy a bag and pay your rent.
You can't,
you know,
I,

1267
01:12:42.251 --> 01:12:45.550
if you're in a hole in your reaching up out of it going,
help me out,

1268
01:12:45.551 --> 01:12:48.670
I'll reach down and pull you out.
But when you're face down,
digging a deeper,

1269
01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.250
asking me to throw money into it,
go fuck yourself.

1270
01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:56.620
Have I said go fuck yourself enough in the last couple of minutes.
Um,

1271
01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.091
all right.
You know,

1272
01:12:58.091 --> 01:13:00.610
I'm just going to plow ahead with this podcast and just do it how I normally do

1273
01:13:00.611 --> 01:13:02.950
it.
I'm just going to fucking riff for the rest of the hour and a,

1274
01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.793
you know what I'm going to do?

1275
01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:09.060
I'm going to let go of hoping that somebody calls in one of the stars of this

1276
01:13:09.591 --> 01:13:14.591
tour that is going to be at the Dar Constitution Hall in Washington DC.

1277
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:19.400
Uh,
stars,
Jim Norton,
Jim Breuer,
David.

1278
01:13:19.401 --> 01:13:23.230
Tell on myself and I am beyond fucking excited to play this gig.
Uh,

1279
01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.940
May 13th this,
this weekend,
Friday 13th.

1280
01:13:25.941 --> 01:13:27.140
That's what I'm supposed to be hyping here.

1281
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:32.180
If I could actually just somehow stop my brain from jumping from subject to

1282
01:13:32.181 --> 01:13:36.770
subject.
That's,
that's the mission of this fucking podcast is the hype that date.

1283
01:13:36.771 --> 01:13:40.940
But,
uh,
that actually that venue,
that's where Eddie Murphy taped delirious.

1284
01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:43.400
That's where Chris rock tape one of his specials.

1285
01:13:43.401 --> 01:13:44.810
I don't think it was bringing the pain,

1286
01:13:44.811 --> 01:13:47.510
but it's still Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence tape there.

1287
01:13:47.511 --> 01:13:50.300
So as a standup comedy fan,

1288
01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:53.210
slash geek slash,
comedian,

1289
01:13:53.211 --> 01:13:56.460
I am beyond excited to be there and I'm hoping that someone's going to call in

1290
01:13:56.461 --> 01:13:59.490
from the tour on this show.

1291
01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:03.480
I don't know if it's going to happen though.
You know,

1292
01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.750
it's like it's after the all star break.

1293
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:10.740
We just lost seven games in a row and that last playoff spot is really getting

1294
01:14:10.741 --> 01:14:14.470
distant.
I'm starting to let go.
I'm,
I'm fucking letting go of it.
Fuck it.

1295
01:14:14.471 --> 01:14:18.010
No one's calling in.
At least it'll sound good,
right?
People.

1296
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.030
It'll sound nice,
you know.
Anyways,

1297
01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:24.880
you know what I'm talking about earlier and this is what's really fascinating

1298
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.610
cause I'm trying to get myself back into shape.

1299
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:31.840
I've dropped like 10 pounds or I'm trying to hold it off fucking actually
salads.

1300
01:14:31.841 --> 01:14:35.380
Can you believe that shit?
What?
Are you a fucking queer?
Yes,

1301
01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:39.520
I'm eating salads and salad.
Eat and fag add.
Uh,

1302
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:43.570
you got to do it.
This is the thing,
this is what I've learned,

1303
01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:45.280
and I might have stated this before,

1304
01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:47.650
but this is the fucking thing about being a guy.

1305
01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:50.080
Women always bitch about how when they put weight on,

1306
01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:52.930
they put it on their ass and their thighs.
Okay.

1307
01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:56.230
Which is bad as that must be,
you know,

1308
01:14:56.231 --> 01:15:00.070
feeling like you're dragging a tugboat down the fucking street.
You know,

1309
01:15:00.071 --> 01:15:02.950
as your kids are sitting there with cereal in their hair,
that's gotta suck.

1310
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.950
But at least with the female form,
you know,

1311
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.180
gives you guys something to fucking hold on to,
something to slap,
you know,

1312
01:15:10.181 --> 01:15:14.050
when he's banging you from behind acting like you're somebody else pushing your

1313
01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:16.630
face into the pillow.
You know,

1314
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.720
with guys we put our fucking weight on,
it all goes to our goddamn head.

1315
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:24.940
I don't,
I don't know what it is.

1316
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:28.480
And it is crucial as a man in your thirties and forties,

1317
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:31.870
you got to do cardio man or else you're going to get that big fucking Ted

1318
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:34.450
Kennedy head.
And uh,
I was starting to get it.

1319
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:38.260
And there's a few people out there that have just said that are really,

1320
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:40.600
you don't like when they do those,
those,
uh,

1321
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.700
for those of you who live in the Midwest or po,
possibly Tampa,
um,
you know,

1322
01:15:45.701 --> 01:15:49.510
when they do those before and after photos of what it's like when you're on meth

1323
01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:50.380
and you know,

1324
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:53.890
in the one on the left he always looked like some angelic kid who's like student

1325
01:15:53.891 --> 01:15:54.700
class president.

1326
01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.130
And then the next one you look like you're in a fucking Zombie movie.

1327
01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.950
They had to do that about guys with that,

1328
01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:03.280
with like gaining fucking weight and the first billboard that they should use.

1329
01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.910
And I hate to out somebody,
I hate naming names in the podcast,

1330
01:16:06.911 --> 01:16:10.810
but fucking invade Malmsteen is that how you say his Goddamn name?

1331
01:16:10.811 --> 01:16:15.010
I am a child of the 80s.
And uh,
this guy was like,
uh,

1332
01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:16.810
you know,

1333
01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:20.050
the 80s was all about how fucking fast you could play the God damn guitar.

1334
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:24.190
And this guy actually blew past Steve Vai.
That's how fucking fast he played.

1335
01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:27.580
And you know,
I don't know what happened to the guy.

1336
01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:31.840
His fucking head is to,
there's a monitor.

1337
01:16:31.841 --> 01:16:33.550
I wish you guys could see the fucking I.
That's,

1338
01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:37.770
I remember the old TV you have when you've got a 27 inch screen TV before flat

1339
01:16:37.771 --> 01:16:40.640
screens came out.
You remember that Shit and you thought you were the shit.

1340
01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:43.180
You could actually host a Superbowl party cause you got that thing.

1341
01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.650
That's what his head looks like.

1342
01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:48.130
It looks like one of the old style fucking TVs just sitting on there and this is

1343
01:16:48.131 --> 01:16:51.220
the thing,
he still teases his hair up to the fucking moon.

1344
01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:56.210
He wears leather pants.
He's an absolute fun,

1345
01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:59.860
he's a mess.
So there's two things I think you got it.

1346
01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:03.530
You got to do as a guy is one,
you got to do the card,

1347
01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:04.660
you got to lay off the booze.

1348
01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:09.740
I think I'm actually going to come full circle and start advocating weed.

1349
01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.720
As long as you don't get the Munchies,
get the press,
get that prescription.

1350
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:17.450
If he can do it and you get that we smoked that weed,

1351
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:19.940
that doesn't give you the Munchies,
then you can get buzzed a little bit,

1352
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:22.080
but then you don't chow.
And then,
I don't know,

1353
01:17:22.081 --> 01:17:25.220
maybe you can not fucking end up like these guys.

1354
01:17:25.221 --> 01:17:28.780
You don't want to be that guy going back to your high school union just bursting

1355
01:17:28.781 --> 01:17:30.500
out of your button down shirt,
you know?

1356
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.870
<v 10>Okay.</v>

1357
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:35.470
<v 0>That big fucking I own a yacht head,
you know,</v>

1358
01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.350
just bumping into shit,
head getting hit by ceiling fans.

1359
01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:43.230
I just don't want to fucking be that guy.
But uh,

1360
01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:47.340
we're going to have pictures up on the,
uh,
the M podcast.com.

1361
01:17:47.370 --> 01:17:51.540
Is that thing blinking?
No.
Oh,
I thought I started blinking.
I was really praying.

1362
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.260
Jesus.
I didn't even prepare for this podcast,
so we know what I realized.

1363
01:17:55.261 --> 01:17:57.660
I actually have like people asking me for advice.
Let's,
uh,
let's,

1364
01:17:57.690 --> 01:17:59.910
let's read a couple of things.
Everybody gets centering.

1365
01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:04.830
This whole thing is just going down the APP Solo.
Shit.
We got somebody.
Oh fuck.

1366
01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:09.450
We got a caller.
Hello.
Hello.
David.
Tell you,
hey,

1367
01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:13.310
what's up man?
Hey Gee,
while I'm psyched you actually call Jim Norton.
Never,
uh,

1368
01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.940
never called it.
I felt like I was hosting like a telethon on,

1369
01:18:17.941 --> 01:18:22.200
on basic cable going keep,
keep those,
keep those calls coming in.

1370
01:18:22.201 --> 01:18:25.200
And there was like three operators behind me,
just clearly not on the phone.

1371
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.700
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1372
01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:27.533
<v 0>What's that?</v>

1373
01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:28.953
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1374
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:33.740
<v 0>Oh,
Jesus.
Bad cell signal.
Yeah.
Um,
is there any way you can,</v>

1375
01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.420
can you call us back?
Sure.
Can you,
oh wait,
wait.
I can hear you now.

1376
01:18:38.421 --> 01:18:41.550
I can hear you now Dave.
Okay.
All right.
Dave,
uh,

1377
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.260
you are calling in because we are playing the Dar Constitution Hall.

1378
01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:50.780
May 13th is Friday the 13th,
a,
the antisocial tour starring a Jim brewer,

1379
01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.890
Dave Attell,
Jim Norton and myself.
And uh,

1380
01:18:54.891 --> 01:18:58.820
I want to thank you for calling in the show.
You're the only member of the,
uh,

1381
01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.820
of the tour that actually took time out to call in.

1382
01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:06.560
<v 11>Yeah.
It's going in and out,
but I wanted to say,
I don't know if you hear me,</v>

1383
01:19:06.561 --> 01:19:11.330
but I'm calling because I love this show and,
uh,

1384
01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.530
I think it's going to be a great run at the,
uh,
at the,
uh,
in DC.

1385
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:19.820
<v 0>Yeah,
I got run.
I got,
yeah,
I can hear you.
I hope you can hear me,
dude.</v>

1386
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:23.390
I swear to God,
I met k rock studios.
I'm not doing this for my fucking bedroom.

1387
01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:26.090
This is the hot car.
Can't believe this.
This is the whole purpose,

1388
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:26.781
the whole purpose.

1389
01:19:26.781 --> 01:19:31.180
Dave of me getting out of my apartment and doing this shit this way so it

1390
01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.450
actually sound professional.

1391
01:19:32.451 --> 01:19:36.380
So when I had one of the fucking best comics out there,
call in,

1392
01:19:36.381 --> 01:19:39.080
I could actually hear him.
It's been a cluster.
Fuck Dave.

1393
01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:41.240
It's been an absolute cluster fuck.

1394
01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:47.160
<v 11>Um,
anyway,
I called him last night at two 20 in the morning</v>

1395
01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.380
<v 0>and they had no idea.</v>

1396
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:51.310
<v 11>Well,
I was wired.</v>

1397
01:19:52.290 --> 01:19:54.420
<v 0>That was my,
that was my fault.</v>

1398
01:19:54.421 --> 01:19:57.720
I should have said a two 20 in the afternoon.

1399
01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.840
<v 11>I'll just talk.
It doesn't matter</v>

1400
01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:05.310
<v 0>the
Oh God.
Are we losing them?
Yeah.</v>

1401
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:09.750
Don't call back.
Yeah.
You know what Dave?

1402
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:15.330
Yeah.
Fucking doubt.
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking cluster.
Fuck.
You know,

1403
01:20:15.331 --> 01:20:19.320
I could have done this shit.
I could have done this shit from my fucking house.

1404
01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.440
I could've already had this done.
I occurred.

1405
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:25.230
I could have already uploaded the shit and I could be going to the airport right

1406
01:20:25.231 --> 01:20:28.710
now.
Uh,
I don't know if I told you this,
Omar.
I'm actually,

1407
01:20:28.711 --> 01:20:33.630
I'm doing another episode of Glee.
This is my second episode.
You're on Gleevec.

1408
01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.750
Oh yeah,
they have,
it hasn't come out yet.
Okay.
But uh,

1409
01:20:36.751 --> 01:20:39.150
I'm doing another one and we actually got to go to New Mexico.

1410
01:20:39.151 --> 01:20:42.990
We're doing like this,
this send up a peewee Herman's,
a Mexican hat dance.

1411
01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.320
So I got to fly out to New Mexico to go do this shit.

1412
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.430
And they wanted me to fly out earlier.
Here we go.

1413
01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:55.740
Let's see who this is going to be,
Dave again.
Um,
is that him?

1414
01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.790
Oh,
Jesus.

1415
01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:03.060
<v 11>Yeah.
Can you do me a favor and I can pass this through the war.</v>

1416
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:03.841
<v 0>Can you believe this?</v>

1417
01:21:03.841 --> 01:21:07.410
Can you guys believe the level of unprofessionalism that's fucking going on

1418
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:11.010
right now?
We're not editing out any of this shit.
This is fucking horrific.

1419
01:21:11.011 --> 01:21:14.640
Who was that?
That was,
Derek knows Dave.
Dave.
So he's going to be calling back,

1420
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:18.150
calling back.
You know something?

1421
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.390
I always thought it was odd that I do these by myself and now I don't.

1422
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.430
Now I am totally fucking sold.
He's back on this.
Dave,

1423
01:21:26.431 --> 01:21:31.020
what's going on man?
This is great.
Let's see,
node,

1424
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:34.030
fuck all this.
Let's,
let's just get into what everybody knows.

1425
01:21:34.031 --> 01:21:37.390
We're going to be at a constitution hall this Friday the 13th,

1426
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.160
the anti social network towards Jim Norton,
Jim Breuer,
David Tell on myself,
uh,

1427
01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:44.770
for comics for the price of one in the middle of a recession.

1428
01:21:44.771 --> 01:21:47.980
I don't know why the fuck you wouldn't buy this ticket,
but,
um,

1429
01:21:48.190 --> 01:21:52.450
having said all that,
Dave,
I just,
uh,
just get it off of this fucking subject.

1430
01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:55.420
Um,
I,
I saw a bunch of shit this morning where,
uh,

1431
01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:58.780
people are coming back around saying that America shouldn't be cheering,

1432
01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.250
you know,

1433
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:02.920
as Samas death because it's a death of a fellow fucking human being on some

1434
01:22:02.921 --> 01:22:06.320
level.
And I'm about as liberal as they come.
And I go like,
wait,

1435
01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:11.260
what do you think about that?
Yeah.
Like people are going,
you know,

1436
01:22:11.261 --> 01:22:15.760
somebody died.
Doesn't it seem weird to be cheering about the death of somebody?

1437
01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.513
<v 11>Well,
I liked</v>

1438
01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:27.090
the fact that those kids off of Facebook and out on the streets,

1439
01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.700
<v 0>the back flip</v>

1440
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:33.230
<v 11>and I'm throwing a,
you know,
a beach ball around instead of a human head,</v>

1441
01:22:33.231 --> 01:22:35.120
which is how they would've done it in the Middle East.

1442
01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.133
<v 0>There you go.</v>

1443
01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:42.210
<v 11>It would have had a nice little,
um,
game of head soccer and um,
no,
I think we,</v>

1444
01:22:42.211 --> 01:22:46.580
we,
we earned it.
Um,
we,
uh,
which we call it,
uh,
you know,

1445
01:22:46.581 --> 01:22:47.480
living in New York City,

1446
01:22:47.481 --> 01:22:51.920
it's nice to see cheering that doesn't involve some kind of parade.
Um,
you know,

1447
01:22:51.921 --> 01:22:56.320
like whether it be of the Latino variety or the other Puerto Rican day parade,

1448
01:22:56.321 --> 01:23:00.340
which is always,
exactly,
yeah.
So for women,
for everyone.

1449
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:03.350
But the fun thing about it,
Bill,
it's that like,

1450
01:23:03.710 --> 01:23:07.810
as we're getting more information about him,
he's becoming less like,
um,

1451
01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:12.460
like evil.
It just more normal and sad.
Like the rest of us,

1452
01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:16.540
like he lived in two rooms with three women and a,

1453
01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:20.440
he spent most of his time on the computer.
You know,
it's just like looking at TV,

1454
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:21.670
dying his beard.

1455
01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:22.550
<v 0>I got to,</v>

1456
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:25.940
I was a little jealous that he had probably a bigger apartment than I think I

1457
01:23:25.941 --> 01:23:29.690
was living in a fucking mansion.
I gotta tell you Dave,
I gotta I got it.

1458
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:33.650
I do have to give the guy props as far as how long it took us to find us because

1459
01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:36.710
I've got to ask you this.
If,
if an entire nation was looking for you,

1460
01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:41.330
like how long do you think it would take him to get?
Yeah,
yeah,
10 minutes.

1461
01:23:41.331 --> 01:23:45.980
This guy,
uh,
for his,
his little infrastructure jumping from cave to cave,

1462
01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.170
I made,
I,
I,
you know,
10 years.
That's,

1463
01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.030
that's almost as amazing as how long magic has lived with HIV.

1464
01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:59.420
<v 11>There was a good comparison there,
but I think Pakistan did let us down,</v>

1465
01:23:59.421 --> 01:24:01.340
but they are our best friend and you know,

1466
01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.790
much like any friends who would give him a lot of money and they tell you what

1467
01:24:04.791 --> 01:24:07.610
you want to hear and I'm in while they're fucking you over.

1468
01:24:07.611 --> 01:24:11.810
So I really can't see why everyone's so surprised about it.
But,
um,

1469
01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:15.290
I think we should slam them a bit.
Here's my idea.
You Ready?
Yep.

1470
01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:18.890
They have to come in last at the parade of the Olympics.

1471
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:20.083
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1472
01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:24.900
<v 11>For all the other countries,
Peru,
Paraguay,
Pakistan,
no,</v>

1473
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:27.390
I'm sorry.
No,
you're gonna have to wait

1474
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.020
<v 0>the wraps around Zimbabwe.</v>

1475
01:24:29.850 --> 01:24:31.500
<v 11>Yeah.
It's no more alphabetical.</v>

1476
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:36.540
It's by order of country who is helping us on the warring terror and uh,

1477
01:24:36.541 --> 01:24:39.840
they can come in and Germany will be like,
we went through this,
you know,

1478
01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:40.710
they'll get over it.

1479
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:42.870
<v 0>Um,
eventually,
you know,</v>

1480
01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.940
<v 11>there'll be known for you're a World Trans Music and uh,
you know,
by curious,
um,</v>

1481
01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.040
uh,
porn.
But uh,
yeah,

1482
01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:51.150
<v 0>that's</v>

1483
01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:54.790
<v 11>so just how it is.
So,
uh,
yeah,
I'm a little,
I'm a little upset with Pakistan,</v>

1484
01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:57.470
but I think it was a great win.
And uh,

1485
01:24:57.970 --> 01:25:01.840
I like how they had to describe to people what the Navy seals or I guess any,

1486
01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.930
any um,
uh,
who are they describing that too?

1487
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:07.990
Cause every guy in their life wanting to be a navy seal at one point.

1488
01:25:07.991 --> 01:25:11.620
Like I'm going to be a navy seal.
Oh wait,

1489
01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.380
that involves a lot of swimming outside of a pool.

1490
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:17.170
<v 0>Yeah.
You've got to have abs right there.
I was out.</v>

1491
01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:20.890
I'm for some reason thought that when I was a kid I didn't realize that they did

1492
01:25:20.891 --> 01:25:24.820
shit on land.
I thought they were like the real live Aquaman.
Like if there was,

1493
01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.480
if there was a bad ship,
they come over the side with a knife in their mouth.

1494
01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:31.010
<v 11>Well it's land,
sea and air bill.</v>

1495
01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:34.610
So if he had like let's say put on like a jet pack,

1496
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:36.770
they would have followed him into the cloud.

1497
01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:41.090
<v 0>I like to have fucking,
people are trying to like,</v>

1498
01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:44.780
oh are we going to see the identity of the people that whack down on me?

1499
01:25:44.781 --> 01:25:46.520
Just like why?
Why would you think that you,
you know,

1500
01:25:46.521 --> 01:25:49.730
did we ever see the identity of those other two guys in the shrubs who shot

1501
01:25:49.731 --> 01:25:53.230
Kennedy?
They always give you the one guy.
They'll give you a lot though.
I

1502
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:56.500
<v 11>will eventually meet these guys because I play a lot of the funny bones and</v>

1503
01:25:56.501 --> 01:26:01.300
Improv towns near where they live and any do who was in the military will be

1504
01:26:01.301 --> 01:26:03.980
coming out to me.
Like,
you know,
I was the dude who shot him,
man.
Yeah.

1505
01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:06.740
<v 0>Was,
that was me trying to keep it on the down low.
Can I have,</v>

1506
01:26:06.741 --> 01:26:11.300
can I have a free DVD there,
Mr Hotel,
speaking of which,
ah,
do you have anything,

1507
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:16.310
um,
anything you want to hype as far as I know,
wait a minute.
You know what I uh,

1508
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:20.810
David Tell actually,
is it okay to announce a,
your upcoming TV show?

1509
01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.280
<v 11>No,
but I'm,
yeah,
I'm working on a project.</v>

1510
01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:26.550
And Bill,

1511
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:30.150
you were very cool and you've got to take a look a little bit about it involves

1512
01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:33.480
a safe,
it's a,
it's a little dirtier,
but,
um,

1513
01:26:33.481 --> 01:26:36.210
I think it's going to be fun and that's come out sometime this summer.

1514
01:26:36.211 --> 01:26:40.320
I did a show with bell where we look,
watch porn.
So,
um,
you know,

1515
01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:43.050
<v 0>we have,
believe it or not,
it's,
it's not only is it hilarious,</v>

1516
01:26:43.051 --> 01:26:43.950
but the way they did it,

1517
01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.200
because I was worried some of the stuff that we were watching,
I was,

1518
01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:50.250
I was wondering how you guys were gonna pull that off and get that on air and

1519
01:26:50.251 --> 01:26:53.070
I'm not going to give away what they did,
but I watched it and I,
uh,

1520
01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:57.150
on the last date we did up in Foxwoods and I thought it was,
it was hilarious,

1521
01:26:57.151 --> 01:27:01.500
was actually genius with what you guys were doing because some of that stuff was

1522
01:27:01.501 --> 01:27:06.120
pretty hardcore.
And,
uh,
it was actually hilarious to watch.
And,

1523
01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:10.080
uh,
I dunno.
I,
I think,
I dunno,
I don't want to jinx it,

1524
01:27:10.081 --> 01:27:13.050
but I think he got a good shot with that one.
Knock on wood.

1525
01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:16.480
<v 11>Well,
thank you for doing it too,
man.
You were,
you were very cool.
And,

1532
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:34.870
like this is like the real deal man.

Totally joking.
Um,

Like,

Whatever.</v>

1540
01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:06.000
<v 0>That's cause I went into my,
uh,
my radio guy voice.
That's,
that's nice.</v>

1541
01:28:06.210 --> 01:28:09.350
<v 11>He,
you have a good radio name.
How about like I said,
uh,
uh,
you know,</v>

1542
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.380
how about like double fee,
a Bang Bang or something like that?

1543
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:15.780
<v 0>Yeah.
It has to either be an abbreviation or there has to be some,
this might,</v>

1544
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:19.380
my sidekick has to have like an,
an animal name,
you know?
Yeah.

1545
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:23.520
You listen to double B and the Gazelle,
he alive on 97.1.

1546
01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.840
We got this next guy coming in and then I'll ask you the worst fucking questions

1547
01:28:27.841 --> 01:28:29.520
that you've heard a zillion times.
Dave,

1548
01:28:29.521 --> 01:28:32.070
do you get nervous before you go out on stage?

1549
01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:35.720
<v 11>Yeah.
You know what I love?
I like when people,
uh,</v>

1550
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:39.650
radio guys always ask me about like going on stage when like,

1551
01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.370
I've had radio guys open for me and they looked like terrified.

1552
01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:46.400
Like they've never seen the audience that they talked to me every morning.

1553
01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:50.600
<v 0>Yeah.
That's what they look like.
That's them.
You think you were that?
Yeah,</v>

1554
01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:51.840
they're always drinking.

1555
01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:56.040
They're always drinking before they go out on stage to just trying to calm the

1556
01:28:56.041 --> 01:28:57.240
nerves.
It's hilarious.

1557
01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.840
<v 11>Good.
I like,
you know,
I gotta get Outta here,
man.</v>

1558
01:28:59.841 --> 01:29:02.970
I got wet t shirts concert across town and then,
you know,

1559
01:29:02.971 --> 01:29:04.950
I'm up here in park dealership tomorrow.
So,
uh,

1560
01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.340
now they always have like a busier life to me.
I'm jealous.
That's what it is.

1561
01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:09.210
<v 0>Well,
well</v>

1562
01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:10.230
<v 11>I think it's going to be a good show.</v>

1563
01:29:10.231 --> 01:29:14.340
And so those were the people who did come to Fox.
And uh,
of course,
uh,

1564
01:29:14.341 --> 01:29:16.320
when we were in Atlantic city,

1565
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:20.520
this was our first show outside of the casino world.
Now I am against it,

1566
01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.250
but the rest of the guys,

1567
01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:25.370
I'm just or think that we have the juice to make to make it happen.

1568
01:29:25.371 --> 01:29:27.560
So I'm going with these guys,
but I saw this,

1569
01:29:27.561 --> 01:29:31.760
I was like a casino act exclusively like a Sonny and Cher.

1570
01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:34.490
You remember like a,
like a,
like the Osmonds,
you know,

1571
01:29:34.491 --> 01:29:36.970
like we've toured exclusively from casino to casino.

1572
01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.153
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

1573
01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:41.900
<v 11>You know,
and like conventions and stuff like that.
And then,
you know,
cause uh,</v>

1574
01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:44.300
you know,
you guys still have like a chance,

1575
01:29:44.301 --> 01:29:47.340
but I'm coughing old hack riding an old credit.
So I'll be here.

1576
01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:48.710
Like this is perfect for me.
You know,

1577
01:29:48.711 --> 01:29:50.870
like eventually I'll like work at the casino,
you know,

1578
01:29:51.130 --> 01:29:53.190
it will be a greeter at the door.
So,
you know,

1579
01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:57.150
you're saying it was all like the last round up before you hit the cruise ships.

1580
01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:01.220
<v 0>You know,
I always felt casinos when,
when you,
when you signed that that you know,</v>

1581
01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:04.850
I will stay here all year round out in Vegas.
That's,
yeah,

1582
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:08.000
that was basically a landlocked cruise.

1583
01:30:08.001 --> 01:30:11.540
Ship Gig was basically a year you had a fear of the ocean,

1584
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:15.890
but you've definitely tapped.
But you've definitely tapped out from the business.

1585
01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:17.970
But I have to admit though,
every once in awhile,

1586
01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:20.900
like when I'm sick of doing the road,
you start thinking,

1587
01:30:20.901 --> 01:30:23.330
you start lying to yourself basically.
That,
you know what?

1588
01:30:23.331 --> 01:30:25.130
I think I could do that.
You know,

1589
01:30:25.131 --> 01:30:28.940
I'll just get myself a nice house and I'll just do the,
uh,

1590
01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:32.870
I'll just do the flamingo every fucking weekend.
But,
uh,
I don't,

1591
01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:35.000
I don't think I could tackle what's that?

1592
01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.050
<v 11>I'm older than you.
So my dream is like,
yeah.
You know,
like once I hit 50,</v>

1593
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:40.430
I go to Vegas,

1594
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:43.610
I like buy a house with enough room in the back so it can be like a shooting

1595
01:30:43.611 --> 01:30:47.910
range,
ATV tours,
stripper wife,
you know,
we'll like,

1596
01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:51.750
we'll run that during the day.
At night I'll do my,
my shitty ass show and then,

1597
01:30:51.751 --> 01:30:52.770
you know,
um,

1598
01:30:52.771 --> 01:30:56.760
we'll just slowly die of a sun cancer and that's what it is.

1599
01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:59.630
<v 0>What do you know?
Uh,
I've talked to a lot of people,</v>

1600
01:30:59.631 --> 01:31:04.160
like the security people out there in Vegas as far as like some of the bigger

1601
01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:07.670
entertainers.
I'm always fascinated with that stuff and uh,

1602
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:12.850
I think that they are fully aware of how bad shit crazy you go having as a

1603
01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:18.200
performer having to work not only a casino but the same fucking casino,
you know,

1604
01:31:18.201 --> 01:31:20.520
five,
six nights out of the week.
And uh,

1605
01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:25.610
I'm fascinated with how little time all the performers,

1606
01:31:25.670 --> 01:31:26.810
like spend out there.

1607
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:29.210
Like someone's trying to tell me like all of them I heard like,

1608
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:32.090
like George Carlin when he would do like the two weeks they would have like a

1609
01:31:32.091 --> 01:31:33.380
limo waiting,
right?

1610
01:31:33.381 --> 01:31:36.350
Like they would pull up like five minutes or 10 minutes before the show.

1611
01:31:36.351 --> 01:31:39.300
He would get out,
he'd do his hours,
say thanks a lot.

1612
01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:42.770
Good night before the crowd even put like their jackets on to go back out to the

1613
01:31:42.771 --> 01:31:43.604
casino floor.

1614
01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:47.260
He's already in the car heading back to wherever the hell he is staying.
And the,

1615
01:31:47.290 --> 01:31:52.250
the best one I heard was Celine Dion evidently gets helicoptered from her

1616
01:31:52.251 --> 01:31:56.510
fucking house to the top to the top of the casino.
Does,

1617
01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:00.640
is show punches herself in the chest a couple of to get the notes out and then

1618
01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:03.340
she goes right back up and flies back to her fucking house.

1619
01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:08.100
<v 11>Yeah,
no,
she has the navy seals.
They totally,
they fly in and they extract or</v>

1620
01:32:10.410 --> 01:32:12.990
<v 0>well,
maybe they'll shoot her in the leg.</v>

1621
01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:18.140
<v 11>Yeah,
exactly.
Well,
that girl's available now.
So where are the housewives of,
uh,</v>

1622
01:32:18.230 --> 01:32:19.850
of a,
a Bob about city.

1623
01:32:20.730 --> 01:32:23.820
<v 0>I want to see that show.
You got a lot of hard,
you know what?</v>

1624
01:32:23.821 --> 01:32:26.880
I've actually heard that they have even worse plastic surgery than the American

1625
01:32:26.881 --> 01:32:28.350
ones.
That's why they way that little veil.

1626
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:29.610
<v 11>Oh,
really?</v>

1627
01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:33.630
<v 0>That's,
um,
that's,
that's the rumor on the Internet.
All right,
well,
before we,</v>

1628
01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:36.480
before I get outta here,

Oh,
I like,

1632
01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:48.090
usually when you hype something,
you're overhyping it.

1633
01:32:48.091 --> 01:32:51.840
You're saying it's better than it is,
but I got to tell you,
uh,
I,
I've done,

1634
01:32:52.230 --> 01:32:54.480
I've done four shows with these guys and every show,

1635
01:32:54.481 --> 01:32:57.750
I'm standing to the side of the stage watching everybody.
This is,

1636
01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:01.350
this is your out of your fucking mind if you don't come out to this thing.
Okay.

1637
01:33:01.351 --> 01:33:02.580
I'm not talking about myself.

1638
01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:05.940
These other three guys were on this tour are absolutely killing it every night.

1639
01:33:06.330 --> 01:33:10.980
And,

Ah Jeez.

1651
01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:45.960
what?
You know what?

1652
01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:48.570
I'm just going to get into the normal bullshit that I do for this week and we

1653
01:33:48.571 --> 01:33:50.570
got,
I'm going to read some stuff.
Oh,
mark,

1654
01:33:50.571 --> 01:33:53.060
do you remember back when you were in elementary school?
Yeah.

1655
01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.480
And they made you read out loud and there was always that kid who was so fucking

1656
01:33:56.481 --> 01:34:01.280
horrific.
You thought he was like borderline retarded.
Absolutely.
Yeah,
yeah,

1657
01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:04.430
yeah.
That's who I am.
So if you thought we were going to get out of here on time,

1658
01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:08.810
it ain't happening.
So fucking,
uh,
put your feet up on the console there.

1659
01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:12.140
Cause I'm about ready to start reading out loud.
All right,
here we go.

1660
01:34:12.141 --> 01:34:15.850
This is going to be the,
uh,
the advice for a,

1661
01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:19.340
for this week for some stupid reason.
You guys keep asking me for advice.

1662
01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.260
A high bill,
just to give you some background,

1663
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:25.820
I'm a 36 year old Asian woman that was born and raised in the bay area.

1664
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.620
Um,
I've been married for six years and I have a beautiful baby girl.

1665
01:34:30.650 --> 01:34:32.000
They always start off nice,

1666
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:36.320
everything's great and there's a nice summer breeze blowing up my skirt.
Um,

1667
01:34:36.321 --> 01:34:39.290
the only reason I am telling you this is because I wanted you to know that there

1668
01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.690
are wives,
mothers and Asians that listen to your podcasts.

1669
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:46.910
That thank you are funny.
Uh,
do I think you're an asshole?
Yes.

1670
01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:49.670
But you're a funny ass hole and that's all that matters.

1671
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.040
This just check is cool as hell.

1672
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:54.800
Don't ever let a few idiots that can't take a joke.
Joe,
get you down.
All right,

1673
01:34:54.801 --> 01:34:59.150
so a few podcasts ago,
uh,
you that not,
not every,

1674
01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:03.170
not very many women were writing in.
I decided that I should start Jesus Christ.

1675
01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:05.180
This is,
this is exactly how they tell a fucking story.

1676
01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.270
Three minutes before we were,
when did we get to the meat of this shit?

1677
01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:14.300
Cobbly weeks ago you sounded down and I was watching Oprah and I realized I

1678
01:35:14.301 --> 01:35:16.670
haven't called my friend from high school.
So anyways,

1679
01:35:16.671 --> 01:35:20.030
I decided to start pulling my weight and shoot you an email for advice.
I knew,

1680
01:35:20.031 --> 01:35:23.720
I know that you grew up in a family of all boys.
Um,

1681
01:35:23.721 --> 01:35:27.800
can you please tell me what is the best way to deal with the troubled male

1682
01:35:27.801 --> 01:35:28.634
teenager?

1683
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.620
One of my friends is a single mom and is worried about her 14 year old son.

1684
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:38.510
Oh Jesus.
This is going to be rough.
Um,
he used to be a pretty happy kid,

1685
01:35:38.511 --> 01:35:41.480
but lately he's become very quiet and keeps to himself.
Most of the time.

1686
01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:45.680
My friend doesn't know if anything is really wrong,
but when she asks for a,

1687
01:35:45.681 --> 01:35:48.380
for his response,
his response is always,
everything's fine.

1688
01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:53.820
Everything's fine.
All right.
Close the door.
Thank you.
Um,

1689
01:35:53.821 --> 01:35:56.870
he's not rude and he's not getting into any trouble that she knows if she just

1690
01:35:56.871 --> 01:36:00.260
concerned because he comes home from school and goes straight to his room.

1691
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.530
She wants to know if everything is okay but is unsure of how to approach the

1692
01:36:03.531 --> 01:36:08.450
situation.
As you know,
men don't always love opening up,
let alone a teenage boy.

1693
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:12.590
Do you have any suggestions?
Yes,
I do.
As a matter of fact,
um,

1694
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:17.890
first thing I would be worried about is,
uh,
I dunno,

1695
01:36:17.970 --> 01:36:21.230
it was easy lovesick it or is he a,

1696
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:24.890
is he being bullied at school?
Maybe that's what it is.

1697
01:36:24.891 --> 01:36:26.090
Did something fucking horrific,

1698
01:36:26.091 --> 01:36:28.550
something unbelievably humiliating the happen to him.

1699
01:36:28.551 --> 01:36:33.050
And now there's a fucking youtube video out there of it with 1.2 fucking million

1700
01:36:33.051 --> 01:36:33.351
hits.

1701
01:36:33.351 --> 01:36:37.130
That's one of the worst things about something awful happening to you now as a

1702
01:36:37.131 --> 01:36:39.950
kid is these fucking asshole other kids.
They all have cameras,

1703
01:36:39.951 --> 01:36:44.900
they film it and you fuck your fucking life is over.
So I don't know what it is.

1704
01:36:44.901 --> 01:36:47.000
I mean,
I hope it's not drugs or anything like that,

1705
01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:52.001
but if I was in that situation and the kid was an opening up,

1706
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:56.060
uh,
I try to spend more time with them,
um,

1707
01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.250
in order to compare this to,

1708
01:36:58.251 --> 01:37:01.220
I was never able to pick up a girl and like a meat market,
like in a bar.

1709
01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:05.630
I was never able to do that shit because they had the defenses up there fucking

1710
01:37:05.631 --> 01:37:07.250
ready for you to come at him that way.

1711
01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:10.790
And I think when they're sitting in their fucking room that just in that mode

1712
01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.010
you become in Sohn,
is everything okay?
You know,

1713
01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:18.010
plus they got to hide their weed or whatever's going on there.
But,
uh,
I think if,

1714
01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:22.580
if you just get them outside of that shit,
um,
I,
you know what,
I don't know.

1715
01:37:22.581 --> 01:37:25.130
I'm not a fucking parent,
but I think at some point I would just address say,

1716
01:37:25.131 --> 01:37:28.820
listen,
I'm not trying to Pry,
I'm not trying to be an asshole here,

1717
01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:32.840
but I've just noticed that you seem a little quieter than usual.

1718
01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.290
Um,
did you knock somebody up?
You know,
eventually come around to that question.

1719
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.750
You know what,
that question I think,
I think it's beyond me.

1720
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:47.300
I guess that that's what I would do.
I would try to,
uh,
I don't know.

1721
01:37:47.301 --> 01:37:49.760
I don't know what the kids into fees until if he's,
yeah,

1722
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:50.930
what are you from the bay area?

1723
01:37:51.170 --> 01:37:55.830
He likes the A's or the fucking giants buy tickets and then lie and say,
Oh,

1724
01:37:55.831 --> 01:37:57.150
I won these tickets at work.

1725
01:37:57.151 --> 01:37:59.220
So then he won't feel like a Douche gone with his mom.

1726
01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.130
Take to the game with the mom.
You shoot the shit,
you have a good time.

1727
01:38:02.131 --> 01:38:05.370
And eventually,
I don't know,
you get a couple of beers in him now he's 14.

1728
01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.850
I don't fucking know the,
I,

1729
01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:12.690
I think I would just address the fact that he seems quieter than usual.
Um,

1730
01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:15.570
I would see if he's hanging out with anybody new or different,
and if they,

1731
01:38:15.571 --> 01:38:18.180
if they look like John Bender from the fucking breakfast club,

1732
01:38:18.181 --> 01:38:23.010
I'd be worried that maybe he was dabbling in drugs.
Um,

1733
01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:27.990
I don't know.
But that's a weird age.
I know.
That's right.

1734
01:38:27.991 --> 01:38:30.030
When I started feeling like a fucking freak,

1735
01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:35.700
like my elementary school days were good and right around junior high,
that's a,

1736
01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:38.030
that that went good.
High School,
high school.
Where's,

1737
01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:43.030
where kind of went off the rails for me.
So he's right about 14,
I don't know,

1738
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:46.830
maybe he's a freshman and he feels like you know,
all these fucking,
you know,

1739
01:38:48.150 --> 01:38:49.860
seniors are free.
Get I'm out.
I Dunno.

1740
01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.790
It just feels like he's got to start all over again.

1741
01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:55.600
I have no fucking idea that's beyond me and I'm going to give you bad advice and

1742
01:38:55.601 --> 01:38:59.080
then I'm going to get sued.
So sorry.
But thank you for writing in.

1743
01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.900
I do appreciate it.
Um,
all right,
Jesus.
This,

1744
01:39:01.901 --> 01:39:05.620
this might be the worst fucking podcast I've ever done.
You know,
with my luck,

1745
01:39:05.710 --> 01:39:07.990
the people at k rock are actually listening to this and they were actually

1746
01:39:07.991 --> 01:39:12.700
considering giving me a fucking job and now it's over.
Right.
Well,
all right,

1747
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:17.270
Bill.
Hey,
one of my best friends has been going to church for years old,
g,

1748
01:39:17.271 --> 01:39:20.260
g h and previously it has never bothered me at all.

1749
01:39:20.890 --> 01:39:24.280
I grew up Catholic and like so many Catholics,
I no longer attend church.
Gee,

1750
01:39:24.281 --> 01:39:28.840
why was that?
Was it the kid fucking or the,
uh,

1751
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:32.710
money they took from the Nazis in World War Two?
Um,
anyways,

1752
01:39:32.711 --> 01:39:35.920
but it doesn't bother me in the least if someone wants to go.
That's how I feel.

1753
01:39:35.921 --> 01:39:37.660
Honestly,
a few months ago,

1754
01:39:37.661 --> 01:39:41.230
my friends started asking me if I would like to go to church with them.
Oh God,

1755
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:44.810
I politely declined.
That just gave me chills.

1756
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:49.330
That is fucking arms accidentally graze up against your hand when he said it.

1757
01:39:51.170 --> 01:39:52.340
Anyways,
since then,

1758
01:39:52.341 --> 01:39:56.600
my friend has told me he feels it's his mission to spread the word of God and

1759
01:39:56.601 --> 01:39:59.510
continues to ask me to go.
And as time passes,

1760
01:39:59.511 --> 01:40:03.860
he's getting more aggressive with his church sales pitch.

1761
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:08.960
What started off with him just slipping it into casual conversation has now

1762
01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:12.230
laugh.
How the fuck do you do that?
You want to go to subway?
Yeah.

1763
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:16.980
Get me the Italian on Italian bread and uh,
you know,
Jesus,
uh,

1764
01:40:16.981 --> 01:40:20.510
evidently he used to be around Italy,
wasn't he in Italy when he got crucified?

1765
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:22.880
Um,
so anyways,

1766
01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.630
he casually been slipping this into the conversation now as led to me receiving

1767
01:40:26.631 --> 01:40:31.280
text messages that say the following,
this,
this means more to me than,
you know,

1768
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:34.760
God has poured out love to me and he is reaching out to you.
Oh,

1769
01:40:34.761 --> 01:40:36.590
so ignore a few must,

1770
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:41.510
but there is a lot at stake here to this.
I applied.
Honestly,

1771
01:40:41.511 --> 01:40:44.900
if it's my choice,
I don't want to go,
please stop asking me about it.

1772
01:40:44.901 --> 01:40:49.790
I don't know how many more ways I can request that his was,
he responded with,

1773
01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:53.060
I'll hold off,
but know this God,

1774
01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:57.250
you and will not quit if I do.
Oh my God.

1775
01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.560
This sounds like the first draft of single white female.
Um,

1776
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:05.140
here comes my question.
Bill,
what does this,

1777
01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:09.470
why does this fucking Piss me off so much?
Because it's creepy.
Ah,

1778
01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:14.680
why do these,
why do these cults,
uh,
what do these cults do to these people?

1779
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:19.180
He is involved with the Church that people do joke around about and do call a

1780
01:41:19.181 --> 01:41:22.120
cult a,
what would you do if you or me at this point,

1781
01:41:22.121 --> 01:41:25.450
I don't even want to talk to this guy because these conversations are

1782
01:41:25.451 --> 01:41:27.820
infuriating me.
Um,
there's nothing you can do.

1783
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:30.760
You've got to look out for yourself.
You've got to cut this guy out of your life.

1784
01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:34.060
That's it.
It's fucking over.
He joined a Goddamn cult.

1785
01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:36.400
There's nothing you can do about it.
If you try to get them to,

1786
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:40.450
to see the light and not come out and come out of the cult,

1787
01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:43.180
you're immediately going to be a whatever,

1788
01:41:43.210 --> 01:41:47.920
whatever creepy word they use in his cult for the outsiders.
You know,

1789
01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:50.530
you're,
you're,
you're one of the others and you're,

1790
01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:54.130
and you're just going to drive them further into the fucking cult.
All right?

1791
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:58.210
Hopefully he's good with weaponry and uh,
you know,

1792
01:41:58.290 --> 01:42:01.750
for when the FBI surrounds the compound and ask them to come out nicely.

1793
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:08.170
Um,
let me guess.
Is the guy at the top,
does he have loans,
you know,

1794
01:42:08.171 --> 01:42:11.860
that they're following?
Who started this cult?
Does he have long hair?
And a beard.

1795
01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:15.040
You know,
if it's a white guy,
I think that that's how it usually goes.

1796
01:42:15.041 --> 01:42:16.810
Is He wearing high top gym sneakers?

1797
01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:19.510
Are they waiting for some sort of flying fucking saucer though?

1798
01:42:19.511 --> 01:42:21.850
Do you know what I would do if I was you?
I would,

1799
01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:25.150
and this might actually help them to come around.
Just cut him out of your life.

1800
01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:29.990
Just stop answering his text messages.
Don't hang out with them anymore.
And uh,

1801
01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.380
when he asked why,
I say,
dude,
cause you're out of your fucking mind.

1802
01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:34.960
That's why you're out of your fucking mind.

1803
01:42:34.961 --> 01:42:39.130
There's like 9,000 religions on this planet and they all say go somewhere

1804
01:42:39.131 --> 01:42:41.380
different.
Why do you think you don't even say,
why do you think you're right?

1805
01:42:41.381 --> 01:42:45.010
You're out of your fucking mind.
Alright.
You Die.
You go in the ground,

1806
01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.490
you become a fossil fuel with the stegosaurus.
That's it.
All right.

1807
01:42:48.491 --> 01:42:51.310
And someday if you have any gift and put any fucking luck,

1808
01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:54.250
you'll get extracted out of the ground and to be going right through a fucking

1809
01:42:54.251 --> 01:42:57.310
carburetor.
You know,
helping some asshole get to work.

1810
01:42:57.970 --> 01:43:00.900
Maybe go over to his girl house.
You know,
so we can,

1811
01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:03.040
you can get his first piece of pussy.
Other than that,

1812
01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.980
it's all fucking horse shit.
All you need is a 10 commandments.

1813
01:43:05.981 --> 01:43:08.660
If you follow those,
if there is some sort of after party,

1814
01:43:08.661 --> 01:43:11.530
some sort of VIP room at the end of your life,
you're going to fucking get in.

1815
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:16.540
All right.
Fuck these people.
Cut them out of your life.
All right,

1816
01:43:16.541 --> 01:43:18.910
I think I've got time for one more and then I've got to get the fuck outta here.

1817
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.931
Cause like I said,

1818
01:43:19.931 --> 01:43:22.900
I got a flat in New Mexico and I'm doing another episode of Glee and I know you

1819
01:43:22.901 --> 01:43:24.550
guys think I'm fucking around,
but I'm telling you,

1820
01:43:24.551 --> 01:43:29.290
this is episode number two and I got a damn.
But Bap,
bap,
bap,
bap,
bap.
All right,

1821
01:43:29.410 --> 01:43:29.981
number three,

1822
01:43:29.981 --> 01:43:32.920
bill first can't thank you enough for all the laughs and your weekly podcasts.

1823
01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:35.290
I just realized I don't have enough time to read this because it was something I

1824
01:43:35.291 --> 01:43:38.290
wanted to talk about.
I'm going to close it on this one.

1825
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.930
Here's a youtube video you guys have to watch this week.

1826
01:43:40.931 --> 01:43:44.470
All you gotta do is search Chuck Berry,
John Lennon,

1827
01:43:45.370 --> 01:43:46.203
Memphis,

1828
01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:50.670
or you can just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com and you see this video.
And,
um,

1829
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:56.030
I don't know how to describe this.
Basically what goes on here,
speaking of women,

1830
01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:01.370
um,
as much as people talk about the Beatles and how great their music is,

1831
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:04.100
was whatever you want to say,
I totally agree with them.

1832
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:07.850
I think that the greatest band of all time,
but I have to be honest with you,

1833
01:44:07.851 --> 01:44:12.560
John Lennon and Paul Mccartney redefined pussy whipped.

1834
01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:15.220
Okay.
They,
they,
you remember what,

1835
01:44:15.221 --> 01:44:18.920
like when Jordan came into the NBA and he just took it 20 years into the fucking

1836
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:21.620
future,
this is what these guys did with being pussy.

1837
01:44:21.621 --> 01:44:23.750
What people thought they knew what pussy with was.

1838
01:44:24.170 --> 01:44:25.820
You have to watch this fucking video.

1839
01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:29.000
It's John Lennon is singing with Chuck Berry.

1840
01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.450
Chuck Berry is probably one of the main reasons why John Lennon,

1841
01:44:32.630 --> 01:44:37.010
Lennon ever picked up a guitar.
So now he's on TV.
He gets to play with this idle,

1842
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:41.210
they're playing,
uh,
Chuck Berry's hit Memphis.
Okay.

1843
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:44.450
John Lennon's got Yoko in his fucking band.

1844
01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:49.070
They're in the middle of singing this song on television and they're killing it.

1845
01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:53.000
It's going great.
And I didn't Yoko's playing some stupid fucking drum.

1846
01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:56.960
And even though she has no fucking talent whatsoever,

1847
01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:00.140
he's putting her in the fucking band.
Just she'll,

1848
01:45:00.141 --> 01:45:03.650
she'll shut the fuck up and stop nagging him cause he's too much of a fucking

1849
01:45:03.651 --> 01:45:08.120
pussy to tell her that she has no talent.
All right.

1850
01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:13.070
The only reason why you're here Yoko's cause you're sucking my dick.
All right.

1851
01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:18.070
No,
you can't play the bongos.
But anyway,
she's up there playing the Bongos,
right?

1852
01:45:18.130 --> 01:45:19.810
So John Lennon,
Chuck Berry,

1853
01:45:20.230 --> 01:45:25.120
two of the greats of all time harmonizing singing this hit from the 1950s that's

1854
01:45:25.121 --> 01:45:28.360
what this moment's about.
And Yoko in the middle of it,
can't handle that.

1855
01:45:28.361 --> 01:45:31.980
She's not getting any shine.
She takes the fucking microphone out of the stands,

1856
01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:35.650
starts playing the Bongo,
and as they're singing,
you know,
go,
go Johnny,

1857
01:45:35.651 --> 01:45:38.730
go whatever.
She picks up the mic and I swear to God goes,
okay,

1858
01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:42.450
some fucking crazy shit.

1859
01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:48.120
And you see Chuck Berry's eyes fucking open as wide as they are.

1860
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:52.650
And it's that.
It's that fucking look,
dude,
you ever have like a buddy of yours?

1861
01:45:52.651 --> 01:45:55.110
And he's,
he's,
he's dating some fucking psycho,

1862
01:45:55.111 --> 01:45:58.620
but he's in love with her so you can't fucking say anything and you're just

1863
01:45:58.621 --> 01:46:03.030
sitting there waiting for the fucking lightning bolt to hit your friend in the

1864
01:46:03.031 --> 01:46:05.880
head where he finally realizes that he's dating a psycho cunt.

1865
01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:09.540
Chuck Berry had that look on his face.
Dude,
I'm not even joking.

1866
01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:12.390
Like I'm not even exaggerating.
She,
hey,
that's what the fuck she did.

1867
01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:17.280
And Chuck Berry's like,
what the fuck?
And it's kind of like John,

1868
01:46:17.281 --> 01:46:19.830
that's your woman get her in line.

1869
01:46:19.831 --> 01:46:23.730
And John Lennon does not even fucking,
he doesn't even blink.

1870
01:46:25.410 --> 01:46:29.010
He just,
he just keeps playing and then she does it again later on in that song.

1871
01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:32.760
And then you look at all the other musicians and they just keep playing the
song.

1872
01:46:32.761 --> 01:46:37.230
Like Yoko isn't even fucking there.
And I,
I dunno,
I,

1873
01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:37.921
I can't,

1874
01:46:37.921 --> 01:46:40.860
I thought I was going to be able to describe it to a level feed up to you to

1875
01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:44.130
understand it,
but you got to watch this video,

1876
01:46:44.670 --> 01:46:49.390
John Lennon and what's his face,
Courtney putting that monotone.

1877
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:54.030
Not only does he have are playing keyboards,
he's got to sing in background.

1878
01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:58.140
I mean the two of them,
I don't think they just did not have their women in line.

1879
01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:02.190
And uh,
I actually get infuriated when I watched this video.

1880
01:47:02.191 --> 01:47:06.820
The fact that John didn't just stop playing in that moment and what he should've

1881
01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.330
done was dressed or down right there.
Yes.

1882
01:47:09.331 --> 01:47:11.270
I find you want to have a fucking moment.
This is your mom.

1883
01:47:11.290 --> 01:47:14.940
If you ever fucking do that again,
I will slap you so fucking hard in the head.

1884
01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:17.280
Your eyes are going to look like mine.
Do you understand me?

1885
01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:20.880
You play that fucking Bongo and you shut your face.
You look like that bitch.

1886
01:47:20.881 --> 01:47:23.810
You crawled out of the fucking well and ring.
You understand me?
I didn't mean to.

1887
01:47:23.811 --> 01:47:27.630
Why I'm fucking you.
I got to be fucking anybody.
You can't play the punk bongos.

1888
01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.030
You can't sing.
Shut your fucking face.

1889
01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:33.330
And then he just walks back up to the mic and just counts the band back in.

1890
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:37.500
Right.
Is that what the fuck he should've done.
All right.

1891
01:47:37.501 --> 01:47:39.770
Whatever this thing has been a cluster fuck.
I want to thank you.

1892
01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:43.230
I want to thank David.
Tell for actually calling in.

1893
01:47:43.231 --> 01:47:47.130
I got one one out of the other three guys to call and Bruce said he couldn't

1894
01:47:47.131 --> 01:47:49.050
call in.
Jim Norton is just phenomenally busy.

1895
01:47:49.051 --> 01:47:53.460
Plus the guy also put together this tour so I can't get upset at him.

1896
01:47:54.150 --> 01:47:57.360
And uh,
I'm fucking here.
You got half the Goddamn tour,
right?

1897
01:47:58.630 --> 01:48:02.340
You got two out of four.
Just like the Beatles,
Paul Mccartney and the,

1898
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.720
who else has left?
Ringo Starr.
Wait a minute.
The other two are dead.
No,

1899
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.190
not on this tour.
They're both alive.

1900
01:48:08.191 --> 01:48:10.470
And then we're going to be at constitution hall.

1901
01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:12.960
Friday the 13th I'll might as well hot the other dates.

1902
01:48:12.970 --> 01:48:14.880
This tour is coming through a Chicago.

1903
01:48:14.881 --> 01:48:18.720
We're going to beat the Chicago theater on June 15th the paramount theater in

1904
01:48:18.721 --> 01:48:22.500
Seattle on July 1st and then we're going to be at a Vegas,

1905
01:48:22.930 --> 01:48:26.190
I forget the name of the casino on July 3rd all hype it next week and next week

1906
01:48:26.191 --> 01:48:30.480
I believe will be my 200 podcast.
So I'll be eating cake next week.
All right.

1907
01:48:30.481 --> 01:48:33.510
That's the podcast for this week.
I hope it made sense.

1908
01:48:33.511 --> 01:48:35.760
I know it was a little bit of a cluster fuck.
Uh,
but that said,

1909
01:48:35.761 --> 01:48:37.410
go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.

1910
01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:53.413
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

1911
