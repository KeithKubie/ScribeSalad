like they are dropping kind of hints in

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300
like they are dropping kind of hints in
 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.170
like they are dropping kind of hints in
there but it's kind of done in a way

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180
there but it's kind of done in a way
 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.459
there but it's kind of done in a way
that doesn't feel natural

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:12.469
that doesn't feel natural
 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:16.059
that doesn't feel natural
um if for example the character wants to

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069
um if for example the character wants to
 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:18.850
um if for example the character wants to
go and be somewhere else feels like in

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860
go and be somewhere else feels like in
 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.829
go and be somewhere else feels like in
the previous film this was the character

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:20.839
the previous film this was the character
 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.519
the previous film this was the character
that wanted to be long was an outcast

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.529
that wanted to be long was an outcast
 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:26.409
that wanted to be long was an outcast

and wanted to actually belong somewhere
 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.170
and wanted to actually belong somewhere
it finally gets you know to that place

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180
it finally gets you know to that place
 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.059
it finally gets you know to that place
that they want to be at the end where

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069
that they want to be at the end where
 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.629
that they want to be at the end where
the other character is okay doing the

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639
the other character is okay doing the
 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.820
the other character is okay doing the
same thing you know you know has done

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830
same thing you know you know has done
 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.110
same thing you know you know has done
the same thing over and over to it just

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120
the same thing over and over to it just
 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.320
the same thing over and over to it just
just wants to be you know it kind of is

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330
just wants to be you know it kind of is
 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.999
just wants to be you know it kind of is
seen as something greater than what eeeh

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009
seen as something greater than what eeeh
 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.499
seen as something greater than what eeeh
they've seen it you know get some

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509
they've seen it you know get some
 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.269
they've seen it you know get some
recognition so I feel like this should

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279
recognition so I feel like this should
 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.100
recognition so I feel like this should
have been switched the character wants

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110
have been switched the character wants
 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.679
have been switched the character wants
to go into another realm should probably

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:50.689
to go into another realm should probably
 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.779
to go into another realm should probably
be the other one in this it should

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789
be the other one in this it should
 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.050
be the other one in this it should
probably be switched around uh and I

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060
probably be switched around uh and I
 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.369
probably be switched around uh and I
think that's one of the big problems is

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:57.379
think that's one of the big problems is
 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:58.779
think that's one of the big problems is
that it doesn't feel like what the

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789
that it doesn't feel like what the
 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.749
that it doesn't feel like what the
characters are doing kind of goes along

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759
characters are doing kind of goes along
 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.320
characters are doing kind of goes along
this natural journey that like a

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330
this natural journey that like a
 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.149
this natural journey that like a
character should be going through they

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159
character should be going through they
 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.860
character should be going through they
kind of say while I'm feeling this right

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870
kind of say while I'm feeling this right
 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.290
kind of say while I'm feeling this right
now and then something comes along too

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300
now and then something comes along too
 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.100
now and then something comes along too
you know to help them with that where it

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110
you know to help them with that where it
 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.749
you know to help them with that where it
doesn't feel like they really went

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759
doesn't feel like they really went
 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.279
doesn't feel like they really went
through a long journey that went through

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289
through a long journey that went through
 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.499
through a long journey that went through

sort of all these different stepping
 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:22.600
sort of all these different stepping
stones and these sort of twists and

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610
stones and these sort of twists and
 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.369
stones and these sort of twists and
turns that really tie into their

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379
turns that really tie into their
 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.019
turns that really tie into their
character that would leave into this it

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029
character that would leave into this it
 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:27.639
character that would leave into this it
just sort of seems like they said they

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:27.649

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:05.899
thought about in the Chi list a few
 

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:07.510
thought about in the Chi list a few
examples I'm like that's a really good

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:07.520
