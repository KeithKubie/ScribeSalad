SPEAKER 1: Here's
exclusive footage

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.090
of a film now being made
about an abandoned boy

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.490
who became a doctor.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.478
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:27.322
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:47.576
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:57.938 --> 00:00:59.780
When the high school
counselor came

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.480
to give us advice
on courses to take,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.830
and here I was number one
student, he looked at me

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.320
and said, I'm putting you in
wood shop, where you belong.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.045
But I [INAUDIBLE] I really
want to go to college.

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:14.350
He said, fine, I will put
you in college prep courses,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.058
but I can guarantee
you that you'll fail.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.230
- He's so inspirational.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.660
I want to be just like him.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.550
And he's a
pediatrician and that's

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.423
the career I want to go into.

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:30.547
And knowing that he did it
and all the struggles he

00:01:30.547 --> 00:01:33.090
went through, it motivates me.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.520
And I'm like, I can do it.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.180
- I heard his story for the
first time in middle school

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.970
when he came to speak
at my middle school

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.374
and I was really inspired.

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:41.540
He'd been my doctor my whole
life and I had no idea.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.050
It was such an amazing story.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.680
And then he made
me also want to,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.830
after I complete the
career goal I want to get,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.530
which is orthopedic
surgery, I want

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.850
to come back to the
community just like he did.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.595
- An abandoned boy who grew
up working his whole childhood

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:01.060
in the fields to support himself
and contribute to the household

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.380
became a physician and
went back to the same area

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.600
he grew up in and has
been treating kids there

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.620
for 30 years.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.690
That's an important story,
a story that you're changed

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.970
and your opinion is changed,
and your even self image

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.440
is changed when you walk away.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.900
Now you've seen a movie.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.999
Now you've been to the movies.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.464

[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:47.677 --> 00:02:49.649
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:53.985 --> 00:02:55.110
DIANE WAGNER: Hi, everyone.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.890
Thanks for having us.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.820
I thought I'd begin today by
reading a quote about you,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.880
Dr. Resa, that was written
by author and speaker Jim

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.266
Cathcart.

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:10.280
"Ramon's story is the
story of human potential,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.140
the unique personal
potential that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.110
exists within us, independently
from any external source.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.670
We are not limited by our age,
our health, our relationships,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.750
or our finances nearly as much
as by our own unwillingness

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.510
to dream and persist.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.020
Ramon, you are a unique
and gifted individual

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.270
with an important
place in history.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.420
Your legacy will be felt
for many generations,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.170
maybe even forever."

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.090
So Jim Cathcart obviously
gets your story,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.910
and so do we, the filmmakers.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.240
And I think the gist of
what really gets to us

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.860
is that it really does show
the almost unlimited potential

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.590
of every human being and
of the average person.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.750
So I think we can
all relate to that

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.740
and I think it's incredibly
important and inspiring,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.320
and that's why we're making
the movie about your story.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.140
RAMON RESA: Thank you.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.140
DIANE WAGNER: All right.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.770
Well, let's start by
talking about your family.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.000
Because your story is incredible
and it begins with your family.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.400
So you didn't know who
your father was and you

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.370
were given away by your mother.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.100
Tell us a little bit
about your sense of family

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.110
or how you consider
family to be in your life.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.870
RAMON RESA: Well, my mother had
five kids before she was 21.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.240
And she gave us all
away, even though we all

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.590
had the same father.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.710
And to this day, I still
don't know who my father is.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.660
She died a couple of years ago.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.220
Before she died, we asked
her, who is our father?

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.620
And she refused to tell
us, even though we--

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.820
I said she had five kids.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.250
I didn't realize I had a
couple of siblings because she

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.750
didn't tell us that either, and
I didn't find out about them

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.660
until I was in my 20's.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.730
As far as other
siblings, have no idea,

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.470
because I don't know
who my father is.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.239
But she gave us away
to a family of 15.

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:09.530
She told us they were our
grandparents, which found out

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.220
that one of them was a
grandparent, but the other one,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.060
not sure where he came from.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.642
So they had 15 in that family.

00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:18.600
And they basically just
took us in because they

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.050
needed more field workers
to pick the crops.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.020
So the more hands you had at
that time, the better you did.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.760
So that's how I ended up
in Goshen, California.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.950
DIANE WAGNER: So Goshen
is a very tiny town.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.710
Can you kind of paint
a picture of what

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.704
that was like for you in the
'50s when you grew up there?

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:40.370
RAMON RESA: Well, when I grew up
in Goshen in the '50s and '60s,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.120
it was poverty,
all farm workers.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.320
You were considered rich if
you actually had an indoor job.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.470
And we all strived
to get an indoor job.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.490
That was our goal.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.050
If we could get
a factory job, we

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.990
considered that we made it in
life, because we were always

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.030
told that all we were good
for was to be farm workers.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.360
And a step up was getting
out of that hot sun.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.200
Getting out of
that cold weather.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.840
When you're picking
cotton and it's foggy

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.230
and when you're picking
oranges and it's foggy and cold

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.440
and the fruit still
has ice on them,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.440
or you're picking grapes under
the grapevines and it's 105.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.360
You're hot and sweaty
and black widows

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.930
and wasps all over the place.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.280
You're going to get out
into the environment

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.677
where it's controlled.

00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:29.510
DIANE WAGNER: Right.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.640
So later on in
your life when you

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.680
wanted to get a summer
job and things like that,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.200
you wanted an indoor job, right?

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.400
And you couldn't get one.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.108
RAMON RESA: Yeah.

00:06:38.108 --> 00:06:43.010
I decided to apply as a
stock boy at JC Penny's.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.400
And I went up and I asked.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.190
And they said, well, you
don't have any job experience.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.850
Here I worked 12 hours
a day every summer,

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.267
every holiday since the
age of three years of age,

00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:55.850
and I was told I had
no job experience

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.956
to even be a stock boy.

00:06:58.956 --> 00:07:04.047
Of course, at those days, if
you were Mexican or a minority,

00:07:04.047 --> 00:07:05.380
they didn't give you those jobs.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.110
They saved those jobs for
people who had some influence

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.780
or who knew somebody
at the store.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.650
And of course, being a farm
worker, you don't know anybody.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.540
DIANE WAGNER: Wow.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.620
OK.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.170
Well, let's talk a little
bit more about your family.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.270
So you said you didn't
know your father.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.720
You never knew him, you didn't
know anything about him.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.280
What do you think
that did to you

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.460
as a child in terms of your
developing and growing up?

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.210
RAMON RESA: When you
don't have a father--

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.900
when I became a father, I
wanted to be around for my kids

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.590
and play with them and
show them the world.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.340
And growing up, I
had nothing of that.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.330
All I was told is get out
there and work in the fields.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.007
Get up that ladder
and pick the oranges

00:07:57.007 --> 00:07:58.090
or get under those grapes.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.370
And who cares if there are
wasps and black widows?

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.406
That was my role model,
work, work, work.

00:08:03.406 --> 00:08:04.550
There was no fun.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.010
I don't remember
playing at all as a kid.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.010
It was just work.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.340
So I had no concept
of how to be a father,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.490
so when I had my own kids, I
was afraid of screwing them

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.340
up the way I was screwed up.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.770
DIANE WAGNER: So you are
afraid, but you always

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.950
knew at the same time that you
wanted to have kids, right?

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.290
RAMON RESA: I wanted to have
kids because I wanted to--

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.000
if I ever had
kids, I wanted them

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.180
to have a different
world than I had

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.100
and to give them the
opportunity that I didn't have.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.700
To be a kid,
really, to be a kid.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.809
DIANE WAGNER: And you
certainly have done that.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:46.180
I mean, your kids are the
American success story as well.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.270
Your son has followed
your footsteps.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:55.000
RAMON RESA: Well, when I
graduated from junior high,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.514
I was the number one student.

00:08:56.514 --> 00:08:58.180
They called me into
the office and said,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.816
because of your speech
impediment, and other reasons,

00:09:02.816 --> 00:09:04.690
we're not going let you
be the valedictorian.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.570
We're going to let
somebody else do that.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.560
And I thought, that's
great, because I

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.950
don't want to get in front
of an audience anyway.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.366
I hate to be in
front of a public.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.840
So when my son graduated
from junior high,

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.400
he was the number one student.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.650
He became the valedictorian.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:25.720
He graduated top of his
class in high school.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.120
He graduated and went
to Stanford University.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.750
He was accepted to UCC San
Francisco Medical School.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.680
And he just finished
his residency training

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.910
in pediatrics at
Brown University.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.830
And this is despite
the fact that he always

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.410
told me he was never
going to be a doctor

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.790
and follow in my footsteps.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.910
He will be actually
starting a fellowship

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.850
in New York at Sloan
Kettering next year

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.200
in pediatric
hematology oncology.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.350
So I hate him because
life for him was so easy

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.470
going through school.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.250
And I suffered so much
and I struggled so much.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.140
DIANE WAGNER: And
you paid for him too.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.640
RAMON RESA: One of
the things I love

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.400
to tell people is
I went to college

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.350
and I had grants
and scholarships

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.350
and working my butt off.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.933
I mean, I worked
every summer holidays

00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:14.920
to pay what my
parents were supposed

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:22.580
to pay their side of
the college expenses.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.947
So when my daughter ended
up going to college,

00:10:24.947 --> 00:10:26.530
she went to UC Santa
Cruz like my wife

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.760
and I did, and I was proud to
pay for her college expenses.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.130
And I made the mistake of
telling my son that if he got

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.590
accepted to Harvard
or MIT or Stanford

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.380
that I would pay his way.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:43.090
He received a full ride at UCLA
and Berkeley, but idiot me,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.120
I did make that
comment, and I promised,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.460
so I was proud to pay for him
to attend Stanford University.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:50.704 --> 00:10:52.120
DIANE WAGNER: All
right, so that'd

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.890
be one of your weaknesses.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:54.950
RAMON RESA: What's that?

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.720
DIANE WAGNER: That
you speak out of hand

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.930
and get yourself in trouble.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:00.763
RAMON RESA: Exactly.

00:11:00.763 --> 00:11:05.074
I do that all the time and
then I have to pay the price.

00:11:05.074 --> 00:11:06.490
DIANE WAGNER: So
one of the things

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.906
that we're going
to do in the film

00:11:07.906 --> 00:11:11.110
is when some of your
problems intersect

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.290
with societal problems,
we're going to touch on that

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.460
and talk about that.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.690
So one of those
issues is hunger.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.480
And you grew up
hungry as a child.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.790
And right now, there are
about 13 million kids

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.050
in this country who are hungry.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.210
So I want to know what that's
like, because I've never

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.880
been hungry, like
really never hungry.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.580
And I just want to hear what
that was like growing up

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.476
and how that impacted you.

00:11:38.476 --> 00:11:39.850
RAMON RESA: The
first time I ever

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:45.970
felt that I had enough to eat
was my first day in college.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:46.954
The cafeteria.

00:11:46.954 --> 00:11:48.370
When you go up
there and they say,

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.215
oh, you can have all
the food you can eat.

00:11:50.215 --> 00:11:52.030
I thought, wow, and
so I loaded up my tray

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.744
and I got three glasses
of chocolate milk

00:11:53.744 --> 00:11:55.660
because at home we
couldn't ever afford to buy

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.909
chocolate and stuff like that.

00:11:56.909 --> 00:11:59.140
So I was in heaven.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.000
But when you grow
up poor, I mean,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.580
and 15 kids in the
family, food runs out.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.930
I remember being down to
our last sack of beans

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.220
and working in the
winter and when

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.426
there was a freeze a number of
times where we couldn't work,

00:12:15.426 --> 00:12:16.300
so there was no food.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.080
And luckily, people
dropped food off

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.920
at our doorstep, beans and rice
and flour for the tortillas.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.130
And that's what we survived on.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:34.920
And now my biggest joy is
to do that for other people.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.360
To buy some beans
and rice and flour

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.480
and give it to food
pantries, because they feed

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.710
the people that were like me.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.310
And I just remember
being hungry all the time

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.660
and going out and trying
to study and work at school

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.400
and do well educationally.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.010
I just-- because I was hungry.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.140
And here I am picking
grapes and picking oranges

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.392
and picking all these crops.

00:12:58.392 --> 00:13:00.100
DIANE WAGNER: Yeah,
I can't imagine that.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.390
You're picking the food that
we eat and yet you can't eat it

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.130
and you're hungry.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.810
RAMON RESA: My grandfather was
really good at raising animals.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.640
We had rabbits and
chickens and goats.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.690
So we were able to sustain
ourselves in mean times

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.575
because he always had something.

00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:23.680
And he was able to get
the food for those animals

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.080
by the leftovers in the
fields that we picked.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.930
DIANE WAGNER: So you lived
basically on rice and beans

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:32.960
and tortillas.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.724
Is that your main?

00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:34.390
RAMON RESA: Yep.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.250
That's why I still
love the rice and beans

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.480
and tortillas and potatoes.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.239
If somebody wanted to take
me to a fancy restaurant,

00:13:41.239 --> 00:13:42.780
the first thing I
look at is, do they

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.210
have beans or do they have
rice, do they have tortillas?

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.020
So I obviously I
love Mexican food

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.450
because that's my comfort food.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.930
That's what I survived on.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.990
DIANE WAGNER: OK.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.490
Great.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.872
So as a kid, did you ever
imagine you'd be successful?

00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:00.580
RAMON RESA: As a kid,
I was a farm worker

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.470
and I was going to
be a farm worker.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.480
I was told that was my life.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.200
So no, I had no clue.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.640
I mean, in my family, if you
graduate from eighth grade,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.740
you're considered intelligent.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.554
And so, I mean,
to go beyond that

00:14:13.554 --> 00:14:15.220
and to even think
about going to college

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.594
and even when I entertained
the idea of going to college,

00:14:17.594 --> 00:14:20.775
people were saying, what do you
want to waste your time for?

00:14:20.775 --> 00:14:23.200
Those are only for smart
people or they're only

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.370
for white people.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.200
You go out and get a
job in the factory.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.036
So that's what they thought was
considered making it in life.

00:14:33.036 --> 00:14:35.410
DIANE WAGNER: So you thought
you could get a factory job?

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.520
RAMON RESA: Oh yeah.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.831
Great pay, indoor job.

00:14:39.831 --> 00:14:42.080
DIANE WAGNER: So did you
ever dream about other things

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:42.580
though?

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.570
Like I don't know, things
you might see on TV or you

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.274
might read about, comic books?

00:14:48.274 --> 00:14:50.190
RAMON RESA: No, I mean,
because everything you

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.080
saw on TV back in those
days, the sitcoms, I mean,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.560
they were all Anglo families
around the table with food

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.532
on the table and talking
about their events of the day

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:01.740
in school and all that stuff.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.730
I mean, no, that was not us.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.500
I mean, we could not identify
with that whatsoever.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.230
I mean, that was
so foreign to me

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.575
that I looked at that, it
was just a different world.

00:15:11.575 --> 00:15:13.084
We didn't exist in the world.

00:15:13.084 --> 00:15:14.500
In fact, if you
look at the movies

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.754
from those times
and those shows,

00:15:17.754 --> 00:15:19.670
the only time we saw a
minority in those shows

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.220
was as a janitor or a cook
or a servant, menial jobs.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.850
You didn't them as a
teacher or a parent.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.210
I mean, we had no role
models whatsoever.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.340
DIANE WAGNER: Yeah, I get that.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.910
OK, so let's talk about
when you started school.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.910
And when you started school,
you didn't speak English.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.930
And you were told that you could
not speak Spanish in school.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.550
And now I know
that there's a lot

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.090
of English as a second
language classes

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.730
and bilingual education.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.440
But in those years,
there was none of that.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.230
So I can't imagine how
hard that would have

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.480
been to start school like that.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.940
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:05.110
RAMON RESA: Well, since I
had a lot of older siblings,

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.310
I was learning English a little
bit before I went to school.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.700
And it turned out that
my Kindergarten teacher

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.720
was Latina, which I didn't
know that, Mrs. [INAUDIBLE],,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.007
because she didn't
speak Spanish.

00:16:19.007 --> 00:16:21.090
And then it was just
recently that I realized that

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.740
in my whole career in
elementary and high school

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.960
and college and medical school
and residency, I never ever

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.870
had another Latina teacher.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.634
That was the only one
in my whole career.

00:16:32.634 --> 00:16:33.800
DIANE WAGNER: That's unreal.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.530
RAMON RESA: But in
that school, they

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.110
did not allow you to speak
Spanish because they thought

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.330
that you were talking back.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.396
And so if you were
caught speaking Spanish

00:16:45.396 --> 00:16:47.020
in the playground,
they would whack you

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.030
over the head with a ruler and
make you stand in the corner,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.790
because that was not allowed.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.200
DIANE WAGNER: Wow.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.159
Did that happen to you?

00:16:54.159 --> 00:16:55.950
RAMON RESA: Oh, that
happened all the time,

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.710
because you're trying
to talk to somebody

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.610
and that's the only
language you know.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.970
And so we made it
to where we did not

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.220
want to speak Spanish anymore.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.310
And in fact, for
a while there, I

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.510
lost my Spanish because
I just suffocated it

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.530
so much that I thought it
was bad to speak Spanish

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.180
or to be considered Mexican.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.700
So my name became
Raymond, not Ramon.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.450
DIANE WAGNER: Wow.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.460
So when did you start
using Ramon again?

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.450
RAMON RESA: My senior
year in high school.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.780
I started to become more
aware of what we were

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.080
and to be proud of our
heritage and our background

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.650
and not ashamed.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.520
But I was still ashamed of my
background as a farm worker,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.790
so I never talked about
that part of my life.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.710
DIANE WAGNER: Right.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.780
Let's go back into school.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.140
So early on, you had
some heroes in your life.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.760
And we're going to cover
some heroes in your life

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.150
and some villains in the film.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.690
And one other heroes
was Mrs. Lambers.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.050
So when you hear that name,
what do you think about?

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.689
RAMON RESA: I think about this
small, little Anglo woman.

00:18:03.689 --> 00:18:04.980
I have no idea how old she was.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.396
She was probably in her 20's,
but who knows in those days?

00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:11.230
But when I went to school, I
wore the same clothes to school

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.700
that I did to work.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.390
And we didn't have hot
running water, so we stunk.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:17.260
We wouldn't bathe.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.720
And we'd come straight
from the fields

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.970
to school, because I would
work in the mornings before

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:25.270
and I would work after school.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:29.020
But one day, this Mrs. Lambers,
she got down to my level

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.397
and she said, you
should go to college.

00:18:31.397 --> 00:18:33.730
And why she would say that
to a little Mexican boy whose

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.940
family were just farm
workers, have no idea.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.420
But that idea of
college made me realize

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.480
that there might be something
out there, whatever that was.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.235
So she put that little
spark in my mind.

00:18:46.235 --> 00:18:47.860
DIANE WAGNER: So how
old were you then?

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.961
RAMON RESA: I was
in second grade.

00:18:49.961 --> 00:18:52.210
DIANE WAGNER: And so you had
no idea what college was.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.880
RAMON RESA: I had no clue.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.979
The teacher said go to
college and I thought, well.

00:18:56.979 --> 00:18:58.770
DIANE WAGNER: Well,
thank goodness she did.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.682
RAMON RESA: Yes.

00:18:59.682 --> 00:19:01.390
DIANE WAGNER: So now
that you're an adult

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.210
and you're where you're
at and you think of her,

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.880
what do you think of her now?

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.650
RAMON RESA: It's
interesting because I

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.280
don't remember much
about my growing up

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.350
and the people around me.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.891
I mean, in fact a
lot of times I have

00:19:14.891 --> 00:19:17.250
to ask my older relatives
about my teachers,

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.180
because I don't remember them.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.950
I don't remember their names.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.110
I have to ask other
people for that.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.254
I have to ask about experiences
we had, because I have a blank.

00:19:26.254 --> 00:19:26.920
A lot of blanks.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.420
And in fact, when
I wrote my memoir,

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.900
I had to go back and ask
people, who was our teacher?

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.360
And then it would start
slowly coming back to me.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.060
But I just think of her as
just that one moment in time.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.150
I mean, it wasn't like
she did that whole year.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.990
It was just a moment in time.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.460
And that's why I was thinking
it's so important when

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.168
I talk to people.

00:19:46.168 --> 00:19:50.170
I said, you reach a kid at the
right time at the right place,

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.690
and you just keep trying.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.570
Because you never know when
the moment will be there.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.290
DIANE WAGNER: Absolutely.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.510
OK, so when you were
in elementary school

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.200
and throughout school,
you stuttered badly.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.960
And I assume that
you were teased

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.990
and it was really
horrible for you.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.500
Can you talk about that and
what happened with that?

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.070
RAMON RESA: Well, I especially
remember in fourth grade,

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.630
because we had a fourth
grade teacher, Mrs. Tobin.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.730
I thought she was a witch.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.490
She was a person
with the wily hair

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.180
and a hair out of a mole
and the beady little eyes

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.362
and she carried a ruler.

00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:31.570
She was the one that whacked
me over the head with it

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:32.850
when you spoke Spanish.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:38.680
But when I was in class, in her
class and she would call on me

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.190
and I would stutter, the
other kids would laugh at me,

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.450
and so she'd whack them
over the head with a ruler.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.060
And I thought, that's great.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.830
That made me feel good.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.327
But it was really hard to try
to get through school when

00:20:50.327 --> 00:20:52.660
you don't speak Spanish very
well and you're stuttering.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.769
And so of course, I
had no self esteem

00:20:55.769 --> 00:20:57.310
because of what was
going on at home.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.226
Because at home there
was a lot of abuse going

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:01.900
and a lot of molestations,
a lot of alcoholism.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.940
I mean, we witnessed
people being molested,

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.910
we witnessed spouses getting
beat up all the time.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.620
Everybody was
drunk all the time.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.190
That was our environment.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.310
And so I just thought
that that's life.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.670
And so I thought that's the
way I'm going to end up.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.100
And so because of what
was going on at home,

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.860
that made me
withdraw and stutter

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.830
and not want to be very open.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.990
And throughout all my life,
I was very closed off.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.100
My friends didn't have a clue
what was going on in my world,

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.924
inside my head.

00:21:30.924 --> 00:21:32.590
DIANE WAGNER: So
you've been very closed

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.754
off your whole life?

00:21:33.754 --> 00:21:34.420
RAMON RESA: Yes.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.170
DIANE WAGNER: Because of that.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:35.670
Yeah.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.130
Understandable.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:46.030
OK, let's talk a
little bit about some

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:52.280
of the racism and discrimination
you suffered in high school.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.600
So one of the villains in
your life, I would say,

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.090
is your high school counselor.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:01.564
Can you tell us a little bit
about that and what happened?

00:22:01.564 --> 00:22:02.980
RAMON RESA: Well,
the first time I

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.182
met him is when I went in
for college prep courses.

00:22:07.182 --> 00:22:09.640
And the first thing I told him
was I want to go to college.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.900
And the first thing he told me
is, you're not smart enough.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.566
Even though I was the
number one student

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:14.860
at the elementary school.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.150
And he said, well, I'm going
to put you in wood shop

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:16.880
like I did your brothers.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.160
That's where you belong.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.252
That's where you people belong.

00:22:20.252 --> 00:22:23.080
The implication was
just we were not meant

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.200
for anything but field work.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.640
So this man was six
foot five, 250 pounds.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.081
And my grandfather said, you
don't talk back to a white man.

00:22:33.081 --> 00:22:35.080
He controls your life,
he controls your destiny,

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.386
he controls our jobs.

00:22:36.386 --> 00:22:37.760
But I stood up to
him and I said,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.630
I really want to go to college.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.940
And I think that was a
defining moment in my life.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.020
If I hadn't done that, I
wouldn't be here today.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.380
But it's interesting,
because when

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.580
you talk about the
discrimination,

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.320
I mean, we go out and
work in the fields

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:57.760
and they refused to pay us
after working because they said,

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.850
what recourse do you have?

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.260
You can't call the
cops because we'll just

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.740
have you shipped away
back to Mexico, even

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.230
though we were born here.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.000
So [INAUDIBLE] so
they'd tell us they'd

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.590
pay us $10 a tray
to pick grapes.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:11.590
That's how you got paid.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.715
And then at the end of the
day, they pay you eight.

00:23:16.726 --> 00:23:19.870
As a Mexican in those
days, you had no justice,

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.710
nobody to go complain to.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:30.840
The last time I really
experienced discrimination

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.490
that I've been very vivid is
when I opened up my office

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.110
in Porterville and
somebody wrote on my wall,

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.634
"Mexican go home."

00:23:38.634 --> 00:23:40.300
DIANE WAGNER: They
wrote that before you

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.350
opened your office, right?

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.040
RAMON RESA: Yes.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.209
They had already put
some [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:44.209 --> 00:23:46.000
DIANE WAGNER: So you
had gone to med school

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.860
and you had done your
residency and you

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.170
were excited to
start your practice

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.920
and right before
you'd opened the door,

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.102
they wrote that, right?

00:23:55.102 --> 00:23:55.810
RAMON RESA: Yeah.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.810
So throughout life, I mean
in high school and college

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:04.540
and stuff, you could tell
even in elementary school,

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.990
even though everybody there was
poor, but if you were Anglo,

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.880
they looked at you differently.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.880
I mean, they gave you
the opportunities.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.950
I mean, they would tell
the white kids, OK, now you

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.420
lead them because
they're not leaders.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.270
And it was just
amazing that you always

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.479
thought that you had to
step behind a white person

00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:26.020
even when it was a kid who was
paid for working in the fields

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:26.950
too.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.180
DIANE WAGNER: So you
grow up feeling inferior.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.700
RAMON RESA: I was inferior.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.190
I cannot remember.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.160
Even the medical
school, I always

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.030
thought that everybody
was smarter than I was.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.880
DIANE WAGNER: OK.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.220
So in high school, you became
very depressed, suicidal even.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.950
So why do you think you got
so depressed in high school?

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.220
I mean, obviously we
know a lot of adversity

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.280
we've been talking about.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.500
But what specifically
in high school

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.704
do you think contributed to the
severity of your depression?

00:24:57.704 --> 00:24:59.120
RAMON RESA: I think
in high school

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.980
was the first time I really saw
my situation at home for what

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.840
it was.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.470
It was so dysfunctional
and so toxic.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.150
And all the stuff
that had been going on

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.791
and all the things
that I witnessed.

00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:10.540
And then when I stepped
into the classroom

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.760
and I saw those kids that
were so different from me.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.300
And then here I am trying
to fit in and I realized,

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:16.912
this isn't me.

00:25:16.912 --> 00:25:17.995
This isn't where I belong.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.850
And I mean, obviously
I'd been depressed

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.710
my whole elementary
career and life.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:32.020
And I was just thinking I have
a pipe dream to go to college

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.900
and nobody in my family
had even come to college

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.850
or even entertained the idea.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.350
So I thought, that's
my only way out

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.933
and there's no way
I'm going to go in.

00:25:39.933 --> 00:25:42.320
So I just started thinking
about killing myself.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.350
That was just, [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.934
DIANE WAGNER: So how
close did you get to that?

00:25:46.934 --> 00:25:48.850
RAMON RESA: Every day I
just thought about it.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.820
Every day I thought, how am I
going to drive off this bridge

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:57.340
or how am I going to
find a way to do it?

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.850
And I would leave my
friends for weeks at a time

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.120
and not talk to them.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.290
Just function,
just go day to day.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.784
But that's the thing.

00:26:09.784 --> 00:26:11.200
Every time I came
back, they would

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.550
accept me back for who
I was and say nothing

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.460
and ask me no questions.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.220
And I think that's
saved my life.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.980
And I still have
those three friends,

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.730
they're still friends
of mine to this day.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:22.896
DIANE WAGNER: Three friends?

00:26:22.896 --> 00:26:23.944
RAMON RESA: Yeah.

00:26:23.944 --> 00:26:25.610
DIANE WAGNER: That is amazing.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.120
I think it really speaks
to the power of people

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.176
being able to find
a family or you

00:26:31.176 --> 00:26:32.800
were able to find
some support that you

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.883
didn't have anywhere else.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.490
So you were the
first in your family,

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.210
I say in quotes,
to go to college.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.300
And you knew you wanted
to go to college.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.070
But you weren't quite
sure how and you

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.790
had no idea what really to do.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:54.250
So in high school, you had
another hero that came along,

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.460
kind of showed you
an opportunity.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.765
Can you tell us a little
about [INAUDIBLE]??

00:26:59.765 --> 00:27:02.140
RAMON RESA: Yeah, I mean, in
high school for some reason,

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.390
the counselors did not
tell us about college.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.690
The most they would
mention is junior college,

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.790
because you could do
carpentry in junior college

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:13.040
and you could do plumbing
and stuff like that.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.280
But one day this young man
showed up named [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.370
And he said, I can tell you
how you can go to college,

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.390
because I'm going
to UC Santa Cruz.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.300
And one of these
days, I'll show you.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.900
I'll take you there.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.230
And so one weekend that I
wasn't working in the fields,

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:32.650
he got a group of us together
from Redwood High School

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.130
and we went.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.400
And for the first time in
my life, I saw the beach

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.800
and I saw the ocean
and I saw hope.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.680
And I saw this beautiful
campus and I thought, wow,

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.980
how do I go here?

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.635
And he said, well, you have
to fill out an application

00:27:44.635 --> 00:27:46.343
and we need to get
your financial records

00:27:46.343 --> 00:27:48.440
from your parents.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.446
So I went back home and
I told my grandparents.

00:27:50.446 --> 00:27:51.820
I said, wow, I
can go to college.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.804
I found out a way.

00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:54.220
My grandmother
took one look at me

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.910
and she said, you bastard,
you're not going anywhere.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.826
You gotta stay here and
get a job at a factory

00:27:57.826 --> 00:28:01.270
and pay us back for all the time
and money we invested in you.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.430
I mean, here I supported
myself since the age

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.350
of three years of age
and she's telling me

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.640
that I can't go away to college.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.850
So I moved out of my
home my senior year

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:12.430
to be able to get away from her.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.888
DIANE WAGNER: So
how did that work?

00:28:13.888 --> 00:28:15.580
How did you move
out of your home?

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.810
Where would you go?

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:21.760
RAMON RESA: Well, another
person, my biology teacher,

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.280
Mr. Nagel, found
out my situation.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.880
So he found me an
apartment near the campus.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.170
And when I tell
people, I tell them

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.580
I have had two jobs in my life.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.387
I was a farm worker
and a doctor.

00:28:32.387 --> 00:28:33.970
But he also did
something else for me.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.450
He found me a job as a
janitor in my senior year.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.799
So I have to change
what I tell people,

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:42.340
because I was a
janitor a year, and I

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.000
was proud to do that because
that helped me support myself

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.530
for that whole year.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.550
And I just waited for the
dream of getting the letter

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.980
from UC Santa Cruz to see
whether I had been accepted

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.294
or not.

00:28:55.294 --> 00:28:56.710
And so if it wasn't
for Mr. Nagel,

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:00.170
I'm not sure what
would happen to me.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:03.100
Homeless or I would have found,
I don't know, something else.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.620
Who knows?

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.340
But that was another
defining moment in my life.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.555
Somebody stepped
up and helped me.

00:29:08.555 --> 00:29:09.610
DIANE WAGNER: Absolutely.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:13.450
I mean, you definitely have an
amazing amount of persistence,

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.480
but you definitely
also have had angels

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.910
that have come in at
key periods of your life

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.500
that have helped to
make the difference too.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.080
RAMON RESA: Yes.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.330
DIANE WAGNER: OK, well then
that gets us into college.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:29.220
So you went to UC Santa
Cruz in the early '70s.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.490
And at that time, the
UC system had a big push

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.040
in terms of recruiting Latinos.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.430
Because the UC
system student body

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:44.110
was vastly underrepresented
in terms of Latino students.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.900
So you were among
that first wave.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:51.060
And can you tell us a little
bit about what that was like?

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.190
RAMON RESA: Well, when I
first went to the campus

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.185
and I saw it, I
thought it was a park.

00:29:57.185 --> 00:29:59.260
I was like, this is a
Disneyland for adults.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.020
Because my life was all
farm work and fields.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.850
And you just step into
it and to go to the dorm

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.130
and when people complained
about the dorm being

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.170
too small and not
enough room, I thought,

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.141
I mean, this is for just
two people, not five.

00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:16.390
And the room was bigger than
the room we all slept in.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.540
And we slept on the
floor and all that stuff,

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.510
so I thought, wow,
this is fantastic.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.880
And then we had to use sheets.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.500
And I thought, sheets,
what are those?

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.166
I mean, I had no idea
how to use sheets.

00:30:25.166 --> 00:30:28.830
And then we went to the
cafeteria and forks and knives.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:29.830
Where are the tortillas?

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.410
I mean, I just wasn't
used to eating that way.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.550
It was so foreign to me.

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:37.070
I mean, honestly, it was
just a different world.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.610
I just could not believe
that I had actually

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.015
gotten out of my environment
and was in a college situation.

00:30:43.015 --> 00:30:44.890
DIANE WAGNER: Did you
feel you were in heaven

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:45.775
or were you in shock?

00:30:45.775 --> 00:30:46.900
RAMON RESA: I was in shock.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.290
I was in culture shock.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:52.480
I mean, I just had no clue
what I was doing there.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.800
I mean, when they told
me about financial aid

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.154
and I had my grants and my
loans and how to get the money.

00:30:59.154 --> 00:31:00.820
What do you mean how
do I get the money?

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.153
Well, you have to put in a bank.

00:31:02.153 --> 00:31:03.050
What's a bank?

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:04.508
You have to get a
checking account?

00:31:04.508 --> 00:31:06.356
What's a checking account?

00:31:06.356 --> 00:31:09.770
So I had no clue how to
do any of those things.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:11.350
And so I had to learn all that.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.571
And so it was just interesting.

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.070
I kept thinking
that every time they

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.570
charged me a fee for
something because I

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.611
would overdraw my checks.

00:31:17.611 --> 00:31:18.230
I had no idea.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.600
I thought they were
stealing money from me.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.052
So I had to learn all of that.

00:31:23.052 --> 00:31:24.760
DIANE WAGNER: So it
was a whole new world

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.040
in terms of people too, right?

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.790
So all of a sudden there
were a lot of girls around.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.080
RAMON RESA: Yes.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.830
DIANE WAGNER: And so had you
dated much until that point?

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.910
RAMON RESA: I didn't
date in high school,

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.670
because of my self esteem and
the shame I felt for myself

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.240
and what was going
on inside of me.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.490
I was afraid to talk to girls.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.750
I just didn't interact
with them at all.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.180
But it was funny because in
my first class in college,

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.120
in anthropology, I looked behind
me and I see this gorgeous girl

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.625
and thought, wow.

00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:59.357
A couple days later, I actually
saw her in the courtyard

00:31:59.357 --> 00:32:00.940
and I had the courage
to go up to her.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.380
And I said, are you Mexican?

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.080
And she said no.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.406
And I said, that's OK.

00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:06.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.410
But I knew that I had
fallen in love with her.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.150
And I was going to marry her.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.520
One problem.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.990
She had a boyfriend.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.380
Six foot tall, 200 pounds.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.890
His dad was a doctor in
Marin County in California,

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:21.170
one of the richest
areas in the country.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:24.980
And so I had to figure
out a way to win her back

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.740
and to win her to my side.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.330
And here I am a
scrawny Mexican farm

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.570
worker with long
hair and a bandanna

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:33.520
and now I'm more
or less a militant

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.020
because I'm realizing
the injustices

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.230
that we're suffering.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.860
So I'm competing
with this person.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.450
And about three months
after I met her,

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.352
she came up to my
dorm room and I asked

00:32:43.352 --> 00:32:44.560
her, what are you doing here?

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.470
She says, I want to just let
you know I broke up with Kirk.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.667
And I said, why did you do that?

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:51.750
She said, because I realized
I'm in love with you.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.249
And that's the first
time in my life

00:32:53.249 --> 00:32:54.980
I had ever heard those words.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.260
And we've been
married for 41 years.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.820
So I did marry her.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.570
DIANE WAGNER: Wow.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.500
So that was the first time in
your life you had heard that.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.850
And you were what, 18, 19?

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:05.550
RAMON RESA: 19.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.910
DIANE WAGNER: Yeah.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:10.310
RAMON RESA: But even in those
days when I started dating her,

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:15.040
there was a lot of,
like, why are you dating?

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.830
Why she dated this Mexican.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:20.300
She was getting a lot of static
from not so much her family,

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.070
but her family kept
saying, are you

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.230
sure you know what you're doing?

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:27.520
Because he doesn't know
much about our culture,

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.620
he doesn't know how
to go out to eat.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.350
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.190
They kept asking
her and asking her.

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:37.320
And they're from Marin
County, a very liberal setting

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.410
in California, but
they still kept

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.570
asking her if she
knew what she was

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:44.450
doing in an interesting way.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.530
DIANE WAGNER: Yeah.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.480
It is interesting,
your backgrounds

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.190
are so polar opposite.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.270
You are from central California
and this very poor town

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.450
and she was from Marin County
and you found each other

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.330
and you chose a very
healthy relationship, which

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.205
is incredible, I think,
with your background.

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:02.621
RAMON RESA: Well,
it's interesting

00:34:02.621 --> 00:34:05.290
because, again I mentioned
Marin County is very liberal,

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.360
but one of their friends,
her parents' friends,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.270
applied to medical school
at the same time I was,

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.850
and he didn't get in and I did.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:17.030
And they were very upset
because they told her,

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.495
your daughter's boyfriend
took our son's spot

00:34:19.495 --> 00:34:20.370
because he's Mexican.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:27.980
DIANE WAGNER: Well, so
speaking of medical school,

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.310
so when did you decide
to become a doctor?

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.922
What happened?

00:34:32.922 --> 00:34:34.380
RAMON RESA: When
I started college,

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.570
I had no idea what
I was going to do.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.340
I just thought, I'm
in college, and then I

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.810
thought, well, now what?

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.560
But my mother, I mentioned she
had five kids when she gave us

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.060
away.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.909
But she ended up getting
married and had seven more.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:48.790
And her husband
or my stepfather,

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.560
whatever you want to call him,
had an accident in the farm

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.560
my freshman year at college.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.566
And he went to the
emergency room.

00:34:55.566 --> 00:34:57.440
They told him there's
nothing wrong with him,

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.650
go back to work.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:01.610
He died of a brain hemorrhage.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:03.750
My Aunt Helen had breast cancer.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.015
She went to see her doctor.

00:35:05.015 --> 00:35:07.348
She said, they treated me
like dirt because I'm Mexican.

00:35:07.348 --> 00:35:08.360
I'd rather die.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.410
She died.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.555
My brother, Domingo,
he was a sickly kid.

00:35:12.555 --> 00:35:14.930
I was in and out of Valley
Children's Hospital in Fresno.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.346
He would be in
there for six weeks

00:35:16.346 --> 00:35:19.050
at a time with a GI problem.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:25.010
And so I thought, wow, maybe
that's what I should do.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.932
I should think about
going to medical school.

00:35:26.932 --> 00:35:28.640
So I went up to my
advisor, my counselor,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.740
and I said, I decided
I want to go pre-med.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.311
He said, you're
not smart enough.

00:35:32.311 --> 00:35:33.560
He didn't even know who I was.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.240
He didn't have my
transcripts in front of him.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.989
But he just looked at
the color of my skin

00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:38.780
and just told me I
wasn't smart enough.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.350
So I dropped him as
my adviser, obviously.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.989
DIANE WAGNER: So
then what did you do?

00:35:43.989 --> 00:35:46.280
RAMON RESA: Well, I asked
some people who were pre-med.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.895
And in high school,
I didn't take

00:35:47.895 --> 00:35:49.020
any of the pre-med classes.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.414
I didn't take calculus,
physics, or anything like that.

00:35:51.414 --> 00:35:52.830
And so the first
thing that did is

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.080
I went and signed up for
chemistry and the first thing

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.520
I did is I flunked it.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.549
I thought, wow, there
goes that dream.

00:35:58.549 --> 00:36:00.590
But I realized, no, I
really want to be a doctor.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.760
So I went back and
I took it over.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.600
And with the help
of tutors, I was

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.340
able to pass all my
classes, my physics

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.500
and my calculus and
organic chemistry.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.420
And the really interesting
thing about that

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:15.110
is when my son was
at Stanford, he

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:19.990
tutored kids that
were struggling.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.540
He basically paid
it back for me.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.281
DIANE WAGNER: So your son
tutored others like you

00:36:25.281 --> 00:36:26.280
who had needed tutoring?

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.460
RAMON RESA: Yeah.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:31.240
So he helped others get
through when peopled helped me.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.580
DIANE WAGNER: In so
many ways, your story

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.100
goes full circle
in terms of being

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.660
able to see impact like that.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.420
OK, so let's talk a little
bit about med school.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.740
So you went to med school in
the late '70s at UC Irvine.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.180
And you got accepted there,
UC, because you said something

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.420
to them when you applied
that you believed really

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.350
helped you get in.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.350
What was that?

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:00.840
RAMON RESA: Well, in those
days, medical schools, only 1%

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.630
were minority.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.320
And they came up with this
idea of affirmative action

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.864
to give some of
us an opportunity.

00:37:06.864 --> 00:37:08.530
And again, I didn't
have the best MCATs,

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.120
I didn't have the best grades.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.960
But I was able to
get an interview.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.860
And when I went to UC Irvine,
they asked me a question.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.777
And they said, why do
you want to be a doctor?

00:37:16.777 --> 00:37:19.318
I said, I want to be a doctor
so I can go back to my hometown

00:37:19.318 --> 00:37:21.310
and be a role model for
the kids that remind me

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.080
of the kid I used to be.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.187
And I think that's what
got me into medical school.

00:37:26.187 --> 00:37:28.270
DIANE WAGNER: So what
happened when you got there?

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.977
Did you feel welcomed
or comfortable?

00:37:31.977 --> 00:37:32.560
What was that?

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.476
Because you said that
there weren't many other

00:37:34.476 --> 00:37:35.920
Latino med students.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.854
RAMON RESA: What happened is
that one of the Anglo students

00:37:38.854 --> 00:37:40.270
came up to us,
there were a number

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.045
of minorities that
were admitted,

00:37:42.045 --> 00:37:46.030
and she said, I overheard
the professors talking

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.760
and they were saying that
you people don't belong here

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.801
and they're going to do
everything in their power

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:52.165
to make you guys quit or fail.

00:37:52.165 --> 00:37:56.320
So that was what welcome we had.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.990
And we knew that we had
a target on our backs

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.360
and if we did not
succeed, we would not

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.330
be able to open up the door
for the people to follow us.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:07.980
So it was hard.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.290
DIANE WAGNER: Yeah, you call
those your zombie years.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:14.070
So a lot of stress.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.210
RAMON RESA: Very much.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.280
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.330
I was just going day
to day and I was hoping

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.180
that I just would not fail.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.690
It was interesting, because when
I was thinking about quitting,

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.520
I got a letter from my
an aunt of mine, Lucinda.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.095
And in the letter, she said,
Ramon, we knew you were smart

00:38:32.095 --> 00:38:36.690
and you would get a job indoors
and wear a suit and tie.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.340
But for you to be a doctor,
for anybody in our family

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.350
to be a doctor,
that's impossible.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.840
So I knew I could
not fail my family,

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.079
because I needed to be a
role model for them too.

00:38:47.079 --> 00:38:49.120
DIANE WAGNER: So things
like this kept you going?

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.920
Because I think
oftentimes people

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.340
say, well, what's the
key to your perseverance

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.570
or what really made
you keep going?

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.180
And I think it changed
throughout your life, right?

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.560
Things like that would keep
you going at that time.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.930
OK.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.620
Well, people talk about
having a rock bottom.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.290
I know your life is just
completely up and down

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.190
a lot of challenges.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:20.150
So was there a rock
bottom for you?

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.380
RAMON RESA: Yes, several.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:27.970
But after I graduated from
medical school, I went home.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.490
They were having a party.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:32.590
But the party wasn't for me, it
was for my aunts and sisters.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.667
And my family, they never got
married, they just had babies.

00:39:35.667 --> 00:39:37.000
And there were three new babies.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.470
And so when I was there,
I overheard my grandmother

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.886
and my mother in the background
saying, my son the doctor,

00:39:41.886 --> 00:39:43.210
no, he's my son.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.240
And I was so angry at them
that I went up to them as said,

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.980
neither one of you's my mother.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.820
And I went up to Fresno to start
my UC San Francisco [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.720
my internship program.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.740
And while I was there, I was
getting really severe headaches

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.940
from the tension.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.565
Kids were dying and I was used
at all these kids dying on us.

00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:02.440
But about a month after
I started my program,

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.940
I get a call from home.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.460
My sister Annette was married
to an abusive alcoholic man,

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.490
just like every single
woman in my family.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.010
And she decided she had enough.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:12.370
She left him.

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.190
Unfortunately, she left him to
go to my brother Danny's house.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.600
And this man followed her there.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.140
Danny tried to stop
him at the door.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.806
He put out a gun,
shot Danny, killed him

00:40:19.806 --> 00:40:22.127
in front of his two kids.

00:40:22.127 --> 00:40:23.710
Tracked Annette down
into the bedroom,

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.709
shot her and killed her
in front of her two kids

00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:28.770
and took off to Mexico
never to be seen again.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:30.850
They gave me two days
off from my internship

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.280
to go home for the funerals.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.690
And when I was home, I
realized that in my selfishness

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.690
to make something of myself,
I had abandoned my own family.

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:42.710
I wasn't there for them.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.500
So I went back to my
internship program and I quit.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.660
I just said, I can't
take this anymore.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.671
So I quit.

00:40:49.671 --> 00:40:50.920
DIANE WAGNER: I can't imagine.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:56.860
I mean, the family violence
like that and the family guilt

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.290
that you had on top of it.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.290
So how did you
rebound from that?

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.480
You went back and
then how in the world

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.590
would you get back on track
after all that torment?

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.290
RAMON RESA: My
wife was pregnant.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:15.750
And my daughter was born.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:19.480
And when I held her in my
arms and she looked up at me,

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.280
I realized this was
no longer about me.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.470
This was what I
could do for her.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.250
So I went back and I
begged for my job back.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.520
And they gave me my job back.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.310
And every time I wanted
to quit or failed,

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.520
I just had to hold my
little girl in my arms.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.660
I said, this is for you.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.940
And I still call her
my little lifesaver,

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.300
because if it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't have finished.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.301
DIANE WAGNER: So she
was your lifesaver.

00:41:46.301 --> 00:41:46.800
Yeah.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:54.440
I'm curious about the amount
and the different kinds

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.710
of adversity you've had,
the hunger and the abuse

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.920
and the discrimination and
just the wide range of things

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.170
you had been through.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.030
What do you think
you would say has

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:08.960
been the hardest
throughout your life?

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.410
RAMON RESA: I think my
low self esteem has always

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:14.540
been a burden from the get go.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.030
And even through
medical school, I

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.025
thought I was the
stupidest, dumbest student.

00:42:20.025 --> 00:42:24.890
And in residency, I
always thought I was again

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.960
the back of the pack.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.150
And even when I graduated
and I started my practice,

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.900
I still thought every
other doctor in town

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.440
was smarter than I was.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.945
And I joined Rotary.

00:42:34.945 --> 00:42:36.820
I don't know if anybody
knows what Rotary is,

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.290
but I joined Rotary and
I became the president

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.600
after only being in the
club for three years.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.350
And I thought, what
am I doing here?

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:49.490
I don't know enough
to even run a club,

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:54.834
much less be in front
of them like this.

00:42:54.834 --> 00:42:56.500
But the hardest part
was always thinking

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.180
that I never was good enough,
I never was smart enough.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:07.160
And I think once I told my
story in front of my Rotary Club

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.670
and they accepted me, because I
never told people about my life

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:13.750
before, that changed me.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:15.740
I realized I had value.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.290
Being a farm worker wasn't
the end of the world.

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:22.100
It was something that I used
to springboard myself ahead.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.910
And if I could just share all
the stuff that went in my life

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:27.424
with other people
and I could make

00:43:27.424 --> 00:43:29.090
them realize that if
they suffered abuse

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:32.120
or if they had no
mother or father or this

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.734
was going on, that
they can make it too.

00:43:36.734 --> 00:43:38.150
DIANE WAGNER: That
is so powerful,

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.560
because I feel like
we all have pain.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.550
We have different kinds
of pain and struggle.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:48.380
But we tend to hold
it in and maybe move

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:53.120
on or ignore it or not talk
about it because we're ashamed.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.800
And you're speaking to the power
of sharing it, and whether it's

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.620
in your Rotary Club or
with a friend or family

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.920
member or therapist
or whoever it may be.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.259
And it kind of takes the
power away of the pain.

00:44:07.259 --> 00:44:08.300
RAMON RESA: Yes, exactly.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.091
DIANE WAGNER: Yeah.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:14.600
So your ticket
out was education.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.350
RAMON RESA: Right.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.510
DIANE WAGNER: Obviously.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.690
So do you view education
as a human right?

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:22.315
What's your philosophy
about education?

00:44:22.315 --> 00:44:23.273
RAMON RESA: Definitely.

00:44:23.273 --> 00:44:26.120
I mean, I think it's ridiculous
when I have kids in my practice

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.080
who say they can't go to college
because they can't afford it.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.150
And I'm talking
about Mexican, Anglo.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.430
I mean, it's sad that they
have to make a choice.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:37.490
And in this world, if
you want to go to college

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:43.700
and you're qualified, you
should be able to go to college.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.680
I just think it's criminal that
when people get out of college,

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.740
they owe so much money.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.240
That's wrong.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.860
DIANE WAGNER: How much did you
pay for your kids' educations?

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.920
RAMON RESA: My daughter
was $25,000 a year.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.880
So it was $100,000.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.700
And luckily she didn't
go a fifth year.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.760
My son was $200,000 at Stanford.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.590
But I did not pay
for medical school.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:11.870
I figured he could pay his
own medical school expenses.

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:13.610
DIANE WAGNER: So
that's a sizable bill

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.770
that you could do
because you are a doctor

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.060
and you achieved
the American dream,

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.380
but that's a crazy amount
of money to think about.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.910
RAMON RESA: Yes.

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:28.690
I honestly don't see how
somebody come into a job, oh,

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:32.050
and $100,000 or $150,000 as
a teacher or whatever else

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.820
and I mean, it took
me 20 years even

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.970
though most of my college
and medical school

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.160
were based on loans and grants.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.600
I finished paying
off my college loans

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.346
the year before my
daughter started college.

00:45:45.346 --> 00:45:49.550
So I've been paying
college a lot of years.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:56.450
But again, I was
blessed to be able to do

00:45:56.450 --> 00:46:00.089
that because of the
education I received.

00:46:00.089 --> 00:46:02.130
DIANE WAGNER: And I think
most parents want that.

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:03.463
They want to be able to do that.

00:46:03.463 --> 00:46:07.190
So it's just this
issue of is education

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:10.590
affordable and accessible?

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:14.000
OK, so now I'd like to ask
you some fun questions.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.920
And then we're
going to open it up

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.320
for questions from the audience.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.720
And what we're
thinking of there,

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.120
just so you can kind
of noodle on it,

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.910
is we want you to think about
Dr. Resa's life and his story

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.450
and maybe the elements of
it that really touched you

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.300
and why the story
resonates with you.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:41.000
OK, so first of all,
you are a good golfer.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.542
So you are what, a handicap
seven or something?

00:46:43.542 --> 00:46:44.250
RAMON RESA: Nine.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.300
I'm not that good.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.269
DIANE WAGNER: OK.

00:46:46.269 --> 00:46:48.310
Well, that's pretty good,
as far as I understand.

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:49.810
RAMON RESA: I think
my practice gets

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:53.080
in my way of my
practicing for golf.

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.017
DIANE WAGNER: OK.

00:46:54.017 --> 00:46:56.350
You took a red eye here because
you wanted to play golf.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:57.250
RAMON RESA: One more
time with my son.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.860
My son was home and we
played seven rounds of golf

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:00.970
in eight days.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:02.620
DIANE WAGNER: Right.

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:03.120
OK.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.474
But I hear you get frustrated
on the golf course.

00:47:05.474 --> 00:47:06.390
RAMON RESA: Sometimes.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.639
DIANE WAGNER: Sometimes, yeah.

00:47:07.639 --> 00:47:10.687
So what would be an embarrassing
golf blow up that you have?

00:47:10.687 --> 00:47:12.520
RAMON RESA: I don't
think it's embarrassing.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.470
Just the fact that I throw
my clubs and hit the trees

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:15.080
and they break.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.080
That's not embarrassing.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.990
That's just something I do when
I get angry and frustrated.

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.741
DIANE WAGNER: OK, not
embarrassing to you, OK.

00:47:21.741 --> 00:47:22.240
Alright.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.600
So you're a
pediatrician and parents

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.000
ask you all the
time, well, what do

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.470
I do if little Joey doesn't
want to eat his vegetables?

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:32.530
And what do you say?

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.050
RAMON RESA: I tell
him I hate vegetables.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.450
Plain and simple.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:40.570
I say, but somehow both
my kids love vegetables.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.960
So I just tell
them don't push it.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.040
But do what my wife does.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.500
Mince it really, really fine.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.150
And that way I
can't pick it out.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.270
Because if I can pick
out the vegetables,

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.520
I don't care how small they
are, I will pick them out.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.310
So she minces it.

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:55.080
So I tell them to mince it.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.330
DIANE WAGNER: To this day.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:58.455
RAMON RESA: Yes, to this day.

00:47:58.455 --> 00:47:59.580
To this day.

00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:04.000
DIANE WAGNER: When you
hear the word cadaver,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.740
what do you think?

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.460
RAMON RESA: Oh, I just think
of being in the anatomy lab

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.510
dissecting the cadaver.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:13.348
I'm having a sandwich and hoping
that I don't mix the two up.

00:48:13.348 --> 00:48:14.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:19.289
DIANE WAGNER: What's your
definition of happiness?

00:48:19.289 --> 00:48:20.080
RAMON RESA: Babies.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:20.880
Kids.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.120
Holding a baby.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.540
That's my all time favorite.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.145
Just after I examine a four or
five month old baby, after I

00:48:26.145 --> 00:48:27.270
get done, I just hold them.

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:29.270
And it's just so neat to
just hold them and have

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:32.060
them look at you
and smile and gurgle

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.000
and they make little noises.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.700
That's it.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.690
DIANE WAGNER: You
live for babies.

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:39.356
RAMON RESA: I live
for babies and that's

00:48:39.356 --> 00:48:40.870
my biggest gripe about my kids.

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:41.780
Jerks.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.580
They will not give
me grandchildren yet.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.780
35 and 30, you'd
think by this time.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:52.600
My older brother, he's only
older than me by two years.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.390
He already has
great grandchildren.

00:48:56.390 --> 00:49:00.430
DIANE WAGNER: Well, we'll
think good thoughts for you.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:04.030
And then what's the most
disappointing part of your life

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.260
right now?

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.945
What's really kind of just
bugging you lately these days?

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.490
RAMON RESA: Trump.

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:13.450
Politics.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.692
What's going on in this
world and this country.

00:49:15.692 --> 00:49:16.400
Really that's it.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.430
I just think that he's going
to have a lot of effect

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:24.700
on a lot of people, like migrant
education programs that benefit

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.917
kids, that they may
cut out because he's

00:49:26.917 --> 00:49:29.000
going to think, oh, 50
million here or 100 million

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.280
here, no big deal.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.220
They don't understand
that in my community,

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.850
it's going to
impact those schools

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:36.539
and those children so much.

00:49:36.539 --> 00:49:38.830
DIANE WAGNER: And what about
your peer group and things

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:42.730
that you've been seen
lately or hearing?

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.360
RAMON RESA: Yeah, I have a lot
of friends who are in Rotary

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.420
and are Anglo and are
conservative and Republican.

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.770
And we get along really
well and I unfortunately

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:54.160
have been hearing a lot of
more racist remarks from them

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.870
than I used to.

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:58.930
So they've been given permission
to open up about their racism

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.680
that I thought
didn't exist anymore.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.680
DIANE WAGNER: And they
probably don't realize it

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.640
in front of you, right?

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.750
I mean, they're
friends with you.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.470
RAMON RESA: Well, they say,
oh yeah, but you're different.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.303
You're an exception.

00:50:07.303 --> 00:50:07.990
You're a doctor.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:13.270
You're not-- like that
makes a difference?

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:15.700
DIANE WAGNER: No,
that must be really

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.272
jarring to see that in people
that you know coming out now.

00:50:19.272 --> 00:50:19.980
RAMON RESA: Yeah.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.360
It's sad because I thought
this world was changing.

00:50:24.772 --> 00:50:25.480
DIANE WAGNER: OK.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.910
And then before we get
to the Q&amp;A, one more.

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:31.120
So if you could talk to
your 18 year old self,

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.740
what would you say?

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.990
RAMON RESA: Honestly, I have
no idea what I would say,

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:38.710
because I can't even fathom what
I was as an 18 year old other

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.280
than I was lost.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.990
And I just had hope
about going to college.

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:48.600
I have no idea, honestly, what
I could have said to myself.

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.100
DIANE WAGNER: Well, maybe you
could say something like, hang

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.560
on, because you'll be good.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.220
RAMON RESA: Who knows?

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.950
I don't speculate.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:51:00.450
I mean, somebody
asked me one time,

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:02.860
what would you tell your
father if you ever met him?

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:03.485
I have no idea.

00:51:03.485 --> 00:51:05.193
I mean, I don't even
speculate about what

00:51:05.193 --> 00:51:07.810
happened to my father, where
he is, or what he's done.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:10.780
I don't think about it.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.220
DIANE WAGNER: OK.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.620
Great.

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.420
Well, can we open up for Q&amp;A?

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.890
OK.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:19.600
Who's first?

00:51:22.228 --> 00:51:24.680
AUDIENCE: That was a very
powerful presentation.

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.500
Thank you so much
for being so honest

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.020
and sharing your emotion.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:31.540
You talked a lot about not
knowing your father, but what

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.740
about your mother?

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.020
What kind of relationship
did you have with her,

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:38.380
especially after she married and
had seven additional children?

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.330
Was she a factor in your life?

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.652
RAMON RESA: My
mother was my aunt.

00:51:42.652 --> 00:51:44.110
I always thought
of her as my aunt.

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:46.780
Never thought of
her as my mother.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.690
I thought of my half
brothers and sisters

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:54.730
as just more siblings.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:58.810
I thought my grandparents'
kids, my aunts and uncles,

00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:00.985
more as my brothers and sisters.

00:52:00.985 --> 00:52:05.220
But even that was kind
of older than I was.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.820
So it was like I was in limbo.

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.516
I wasn't sure where I belonged.

00:52:09.516 --> 00:52:11.140
My mother lived in
the same town I did,

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:14.980
but she didn't really exist
to me other than [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:16.960
DIANE WAGNER: But you
would run into her?

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.430
RAMON RESA: At
family get togethers

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:22.620
and maybe on the street,
but I, again, just

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:23.700
didn't relate to her.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:30.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much for
your time and for your talk.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.290
So obviously your
legacy is going

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:35.320
to go far beyond the
beginning of growing up

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.170
without your paternal
mother and father,

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:41.800
but personally, I have family
members who've been abandoned.

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.040
So I even see
firsthand how difficult

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.170
it would be for anyone.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.275
And so through
your talk, you just

00:52:49.275 --> 00:52:53.170
radiate that you moved beyond
the bitterness and the hurt.

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:58.097
So I guess what helped
you heal beyond the hurt?

00:52:58.097 --> 00:52:59.680
RAMON RESA: I think
that when somebody

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.380
asked me to write a book
about my life experiences,

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:08.130
I was able to get that out and
open it up and actually see

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:11.012
all the stuff that happened.

00:53:11.012 --> 00:53:12.720
And I always said that
before my mother--

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.670
I mean, I hated my grandparents
for what they did to us.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.930
But before they died, I
realized that they themselves

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:20.050
had no education.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:21.360
They had no hope.

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.770
They were just
struggling to survive.

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:26.064
And so I was able to
forgive them for that.

00:53:26.064 --> 00:53:27.480
And the same thing
with my mother.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.380
I mean, she had five
kids before she was 21.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:32.540
I mean, she was molested,
plain and simple.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.290
She didn't know what
she was doing either.

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.100
So I shouldn't have
blamed her either.

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.300
And so I was able
to forgive her.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.820
And before she died, I took
her to a restaurant, the best

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.750
restaurant that she had
ever been to in her life,

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:47.250
just kind of take her out.

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.110
And two weeks later, she died.

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:54.210
So I had some peace
because I didn't walk away

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:55.308
with bitterness.

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:03.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
the very powerful story.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:09.420
I think a lot people would call
your experience the definition

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.130
of the American dream.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:14.520
I want to ask you if
what your definition

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:19.527
of the American
dream is and if you

00:54:19.527 --> 00:54:22.110
think that the American dream
is still alive and has a future?

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.720
RAMON RESA: Yes,
it is still alive.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.290
I think that the current
administration is stepping

00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:34.360
on it on a lot of cases.

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.960
But I think that you still are
able to make it in this world

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.560
if you try and if
you have support

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.870
and if somebody's behind you.

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.592
I mean, I don't
know what I would

00:54:44.592 --> 00:54:46.050
have been like if
I had some family

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.650
support behind me or parents.

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:49.350
I have no idea what
I would have done.

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:51.420
But I think that's
an important thing

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:55.365
and I tell all my
parents in my office

00:54:55.365 --> 00:54:57.780
and that I encounter,
just be there

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.610
and be supportive
no matter what it

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.540
is that your kids want to do.

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.320
I had one young man that
was sent to me by the judge

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.810
because he was
getting into trouble.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:10.080
And he didn't want
to go to school

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.920
because he didn't like it.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.320
He was carjacking cars
and getting in trouble.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.156
But anyway, so he came in
and I asked him one time,

00:55:17.156 --> 00:55:18.840
I said, why are you doing this?

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.655
He says, because I
don't like my life.

00:55:20.655 --> 00:55:22.780
I said, well what do you
want to do with your life?

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.290
He says, I want to be a cook.

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:25.623
I want to go to culinary school.

00:55:25.623 --> 00:55:27.810
And I said, why
don't you do that?

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:29.160
I can?

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:29.830
I said, yes.

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:31.470
Well, my parents don't
want me to be a cook.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:32.970
So who cares what
your parents want?

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:34.190
What do you want?

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:37.230
So he had an adult, a person
of authority, tell him, do

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:38.910
what you want.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:40.920
All of a sudden,
his eyes lit up.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.230
And that's really what it is.

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:44.820
You just do what's fun.

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.724
And I think as long
as you do what's fun,

00:55:47.724 --> 00:55:49.140
you are living the
American dream.

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.690
I happen to be a
doctor, a pediatrician,

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:53.550
and I love being around babies.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:56.169
So I am right where I should be.

00:55:56.169 --> 00:55:57.960
And in fact, I should
be working right now.

00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.668
And I can't wait to
get back to work so I

00:55:59.668 --> 00:56:01.050
can play with babies again.

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:03.180
And I would tell parents that.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.395
You're paying me to do this?

00:56:04.395 --> 00:56:06.020
This is great.

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.910
A great job.

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.800
AUDIENCE: I have a
question for Diane.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.030
I'm curious to know as one
of the documentary makers

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:17.110
of "Ramon Rising" how you
came across Dr. Resa's story

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:20.520
and sort of how you went
about putting that together

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.316
and what the status is now?

00:56:22.316 --> 00:56:23.190
DIANE WAGNER: Thanks.

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.400
Yeah.

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.200
Well, it's an incredible
opportunity and blessing

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.000
to be able to be
making this film,

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.400
because it's such
an important story.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.120
And how we came about
it is my husband

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:40.380
Jesse was a media consultant
after spending many years

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.700
in TV news.

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.970
And during that time,
he was advising people

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:48.420
about how to gain
national news exposure

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:53.010
and so forth on a panel of the
National Speakers Foundation.

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:54.930
And Ramon was there.

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:58.140
He was writing his book,
his memoir, at the time.

00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:02.130
And Ramon asked Jesse about
the title "Farm Worker

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.030
To Pediatrician."

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.450
And Jesse knew at that instant,
that was over 10 years ago,

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:10.650
Jesse knew that that
was just the story.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:14.460
And long and short, we decided
to make our first documentary

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.770
project together
with Ramon's story,

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:23.470
because it goes without
saying it's the perfect story.

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:27.810
So we're in production right
now and we've shot probably

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:30.550
25% of it, maybe 30%.

00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:33.330
And we have a few
more weeks of shooting

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.000
and a few months of editing.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.970
So we're hoping to get it out
as soon as possible, because it

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:40.800
goes without saying,
I think, but the movie

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.585
needs to be out there
for many reasons.

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:49.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
sharing your story Dr. Resa.

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:51.990
Diane pointed out
in the Q&amp;A with you

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:55.420
that you had some well placed
angels throughout your life.

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:57.150
So what sparks you?

00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:58.860
What do you do to
pay it forward?

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:05.760
RAMON RESA: I talk to a lot of
schools, a lot third graders,

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.660
fourth graders, high school,
college, kids in trouble,

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:16.050
kids who are losing their way.

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:19.150
In my office, I
talk to the kids.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.520
If they don't perform,
I tell them off.

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.874
I say, you're smart.

00:58:23.874 --> 00:58:25.290
Don't you dare
tell me that you're

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:28.230
only capable of doing a C.
So I become their role model,

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:29.270
their authority.

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:31.717
If their parents are happy
with them getting a C,

00:58:31.717 --> 00:58:33.300
I said, I wouldn't
be happy with that.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.150
So I push them.

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:38.645
And I push other people
when I meet other people

00:58:38.645 --> 00:58:39.770
and I talk to other people.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:41.940
I tell them, this is
all you have to do

00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:43.890
to make this kid a success.

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:44.710
Just be there.

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:47.730
Just be there for
that one moment.

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:49.140
I don't like to talk.

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:53.040
I don't like to go all over the
country, all over the state.

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.750
But that's what I do.

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:58.800
And I do it because
this young woman

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:02.490
not too long ago, I told
my story and she said,

00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:04.710
I had given up hope.

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:06.855
And I heard your
story, now I have hope.

00:59:06.855 --> 00:59:11.070
So I realized that even though
I don't want to do this anymore,

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:13.640
there are other people
that will benefit from it.

00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.020
So I keep going.

00:59:18.139 --> 00:59:19.680
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned you didn't

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.740
want your kids to suffer
the same way that you

00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.910
did growing up.

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.840
So what did you do to
prepare your own kids

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.039
against discrimination?

00:59:29.039 --> 00:59:30.080
RAMON RESA: Against what?

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.660
AUDIENCE: Discrimination.

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:35.520
RAMON RESA: Basically
just being a doctor

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.880
and living in a home
with a swimming pool

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.710
and not out in
the ghettos or out

00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:43.010
in the toxic
environment like I did

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:48.020
or the neighborhood
was a lot of it.

00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.210
Not letting them
be exposed to it.

00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:52.340
I mean, my kids were not
exposed to my family.

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:57.380
They were not exposed to the
abuse and the alcoholism.

00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.730
They were not exposed
to the negativity

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:00.850
that's going on there.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:03.569
It was all about positive,
positive, positive role models.

01:00:03.569 --> 01:00:06.110
And I was showing them, I mean,
every time we went somewhere,

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:07.070
I showed them colleges.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.670
We go to Santa Cruz,
go to UC San Francisco,

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.110
USC, Cornell, Harvard, Yale.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.410
Every time we went on a
trip, we'd stop by the school

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:17.610
and look at them.

01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:20.780
And that was just my hope was,
oh, you're going to college.

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.930
The question is where, not
are you going to college.

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:28.030
And that's how I
just brought them up.

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:29.810
They had the opportunity
and the ability

01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:31.760
to do anything they wanted to.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.590
I never pushed.

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:38.540
I just expected it of them
and they met my expectations.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:43.020
DIANE WAGNER: You shielded
them, though, from a lot.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:50.810
RAMON RESA: I mean, my son heard
my talk at Stanford one time.

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:52.650
And I asked my wife
about what he thinks.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.640
She said, he was so mad at you.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.275
Why?

01:00:56.275 --> 01:01:00.020
Because you had never told
him any of this stuff before.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:05.450
So I did not bring my
background into their world.

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:07.640
So they grew up in
the middle class

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.420
world that had all the
opportunity open to them.

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.870
