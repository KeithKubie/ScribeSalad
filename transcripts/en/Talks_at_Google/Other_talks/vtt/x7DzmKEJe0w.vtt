00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:03.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, Al Pittampalli.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.850
AL PITTAMPALLI: So the
date is March 14, 2011.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.660
President Obama
and his war cabinet

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.680
are meeting at the
White House to discuss

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.390
how to attack the Pakistani
compound allegedly

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.690
housing Osama bin Laden.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.360
Now at first the
discussion is all

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.657
about coming in from the air.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.490
They're talking about
firing a small missile

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.440
from an unmanned
drone or dropping

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.210
a large bomb from a B-2.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.240
But there were a
few problems, right?

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.020
The first problem is, if
you fire a small missile

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.310
you might miss.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.230
If you drop a
large bomb, there'd

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.210
be a high risk of
civilian casualties.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.970
And in either case hard
to really determine

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.810
whether you got the guy.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.090
That's when the administration
for the very first time

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.860
began to discuss the possibility
of a Special Operations ground

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.540
raid.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.980
But in many ways, this was
the riskiest strategy of all.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.270
What if the raid team was
detected while helicoptering

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.489
into the Pakistani airspace?

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.460
What if the Pakistani
military, which

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.010
was stationed dangerously
close to the compound,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.460
engaged the raid
team in a firefight?

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.290
What if US troops were
injured or killed?

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.800
These were frightening
questions that required answers.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.910
So in order to answer
those questions,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.770
the president and his
team consulted the man

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.410
who'd ultimately be tapped
to lead the mission, a man

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.720
by the name of Admiral
William McRaven.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.260
Admiral William McRaven is
the commander of Joint Special

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.440
Operations Command.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.420
He's one of the most successful
military leaders in the history

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.350
of United States military.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.690
And he certainly looks the part.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.590
The guy's 6 foot 1, he's
got impeccable posture,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.490
this domineering presence,
four-star general.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.840
But there was one thing
about the guy that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.600
was unusual to the
administration, something that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.150
was atypical of military brass.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.860
McRaven was humble.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.650
He was modest.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.300
He was open to
suggestion and unusually

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.110
willing to change his mind.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.830
So from the very
beginning McRaven

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.792
admitted he didn't
have all the answers.

00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:10.250
In fact, when he first presented
his plan to the president,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.460
he said, Mr. President,
we haven't thoroughly

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.730
tested this out yet.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.370
And we don't know
if we could do it,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.340
but when I do I'll
tell you straight up.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.140
McRaven ultimately
did test the plan.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.610
It became successful.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.640
But still, he reminded everyone
of its fallibility, how things

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.410
could go wrong at any moment.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.420
Now over the course
of many meetings,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.750
the president and his
team grilled McRaven,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.900
questioning his plan,
second-guessing his thinking.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.330
But McRaven didn't seem to mind.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.731
He approached the
scrutiny without ego.

00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:42.980
In fact, in response to a
good question, he would say,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.730
you know what?

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.850
I haven't thought about
that, but I need to.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.580
And he wasn't just
paying lip service.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.250
He was making
substantial changes

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.000
to his plans based on
the feedback of others.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.210
So for example,
McRaven originally

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.120
proposed having backup
Chinook helicopters stationed

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.100
on the Afghan-Pakistani border.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.680
That way they would
prevent any infringement

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.620
on Pakistani sovereignty.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.510
But the president disagreed.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.810
He wanted those helicopters
as close to the compound as

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.770
possible in case the SEAL team
needed to get the hell out

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.340
of there.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.350
McRaven was persuaded.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.700
The helicopters would be
flown deep into Pakistan

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.900
near the Abbottabad
compound ready to move.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.940
On April 29, 2011,
President Obama,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.210
after a careful deliberation
process with his team,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.106
officially ordered the
SEAL Team 6 raid overseen

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:33.230
by Admiral William McRaven.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.970
Why?

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.860
Why did he do it?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.130
Later he would explain it was
his confidence in McRaven that

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.920
led him to go ahead
with the raid.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.090
He said, the guy just never
seemed surprised by anything.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.390
Remember that quote because
it turned out to be true.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.740
During the raid, one of the
SEALs' Black Hawk helicopters

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.160
went down.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.610
The administration
began to panic.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.047
They were watching via secure
link from the White House.

00:03:56.047 --> 00:03:57.880
Some people didn't know
what to expect next.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.690
One person actually
thought he might throw up.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.550
But not McRaven.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.700
McRaven was calm.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.500
He was expressionless.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.030
Later, afterwards he
described it, he said,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.660
we had a contingency plan.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.900
We executed that
contingency plan.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.730
And we continued on
with the mission.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.709
And continue on
they did, completing

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.620
one of the most successful
military operations in United

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.260
States history.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.400
Ladies and gentlemen, my
name is Al Pittampalli.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.560
I'm the author of a book
called "Persuadable."

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.920
And today, what I
want to talk to you

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.620
about is what I
believe to be the most

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.990
critical skill of
modern leadership,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.320
something I call persuadability.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.720
Now persuadability,
or being persuadable,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.330
is the genuine willingness
to change your mind

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.120
in the face of evidence.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.147
It means rejecting
absolute certainty.

00:04:46.147 --> 00:04:48.730
It means treating your beliefs
as temporary and acknowledging,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.350
no matter how confident you are
about any particular belief,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.970
you could be wrong.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.460
Now this might be a
little bit strange

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.800
to think about in the context
of a leadership skill, right?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.470
If anything, we admire
heroes and leaders

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.866
that do the opposite,
that resist persuasion.

00:05:06.866 --> 00:05:08.240
I mean, just look
at the language

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.430
of successful leadership.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.580
Strong leaders stay the course.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.110
They defy the odds.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.810
They prove their critics wrong.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.410
They stand firm in
their convictions.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.960
And then what do
we call leaders who

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.750
actually do change their mind?

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.210
We're quick to label them
flip-floppers and pushovers.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.550
We think of them as weak.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.530
In fact, our culture
indoctrinates

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.640
us to believe this
to be true, right?

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.850
I call this the traditional
leadership archetype.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.750
It's embodied by the three
C's, conviction, confidence,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.700
and consistency.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.230
That's what we believe
strong leaders to be.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.730
That's what I believe
strong leaders to be.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.950
But for the last
four years, I've

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.490
been studying the most
successful leaders in history

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.190
and modern leaders, at least.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.010
And what I found
is, one by one, they

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.740
are bucking the traditional
leadership archetype

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.550
in favor of a new
way of thinking,

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.240
a new way of leading, what
I call persuadability.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.086
And the question is why?

00:06:03.086 --> 00:06:06.400
Why is it that these
leaders are sacrificing

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.960
the cost of being perceived as
a weak leader to be persuadable?

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.107
And the reality is
because they notice,

00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:14.940
they know something
that other people don't.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.090
Being persuadable is
the ultimate advantage.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.220
So to understand why
and understand how,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.050
let's revisit McRaven's raid
on the Abbottabad compound.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.940
So there's one thing
you have to understand

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.710
about the Pakistani raid is
it was a Special Operations

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.680
mission.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.050
And Special
Operations is special.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.970
It's unconventional
and full of surprises.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.940
Information is coming in
up until the last minute

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.580
before the mission commences.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.890
And when that occurs, in
that kind of environment,

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.140
being decisive-- this
traditional leadership

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.010
archetype of the three
C's-- doesn't work so well.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.640
Maybe it works when the
environment is simple, right?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.880
When the world is static.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.680
But McRaven understood something
that most people don't really

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.640
embrace often, which is
that, in a world that

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.320
is more complex, more
turbulent, more fast

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.460
changing than ever, the answer
is to be able to be prepared

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.280
to change your mind.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.360
That's the only way to succeed.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.410
In fact, that's the way to
be unsurprisable, right?

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.460
To be the guy that's never
surprised by anything,

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.480
you have to admit you
don't have all the answers.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.450
And you have to be willing
to change your mind.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.330
But being willing
to change your mind

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.050
isn't just a lesson for a few
elite units in the military.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.250
It's happening everywhere.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.170
The world is changing.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.710
Globalization,
hyperconnectedness,

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.520
the rise of the
internet are all making

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.910
the world complex, turbulent,
and entirely uncertain.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.690
So whether it be
business, politics,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.720
medicine, philanthropy, being
persuadable, the willingness

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.050
to change your mind, is
an advantage everywhere

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.330
because right now everything
is special operations.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.884
So agility, the ability to
adapt to changing circumstances,

00:07:57.884 --> 00:07:59.425
is an advantage of
being persuadable.

00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:01.810
But it's not the only
advantage of being persuadable.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.310
There are actually
two more, and I'd

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.540
like to take you
through those right now.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.750
And then what I'd
like to do is actually

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.910
talk to you about how
to be persuadable.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.540
So let's talk about the second
advantage of being persuadable.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:19.590
In 2007, a man by
the name of Ray Dalio

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.940
traveled to the White House
with an ominous warning.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.685
The economy was headed
towards catastrophe.

00:08:26.685 --> 00:08:28.810
This wasn't going to be
some just regular downturn.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.680
This was going to be a
deep global recession.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.740
Now the senior economic staffers
of the Bush administration

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.850
ignored Dalio that day.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.409
That would turn out
to be a huge mistake

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:43.309
because a year later the
economy went into free fall.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:44.690
The government was blindsided.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.400
Ray's competitors were
losing their shirts.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.780
But Ray was making a fortune.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.320
See, Ray was prepared.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.630
He had programmed into
his trading system

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.430
some early warning
indicators that

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.390
would tell him when
he needed to pull out

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.240
of certain affected investments.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.160
One day one of his
indicators told

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.100
him to pull out of several
banks, including Bear Stearns.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.030
A week later, Bear
Stearns collapsed.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:17.185
This, ladies and
gentlemen, is Ray Dalio.

00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:19.999
Ray Dalio is one of the most
successful hedge fund investors

00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:20.540
in the world.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.910
Inarguably he runs
the biggest hedge fund

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.240
in the world, Bridgewater.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.520
Some people call him the
da Vinci of investing.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.200
And John Cassidy
from "The New Yorker"

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.360
says he's got an uncanny ability
to anticipate economic trends.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.870
His competitors are all
tearing their shirts out,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.300
or tearing their
hair out, rather,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.980
trying to figure out, how does
he know what's going to happen?

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.050
What does he know that we don't?

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:51.000
And that is the wrong question
because he doesn't know.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.500
Right?

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.780
He's not Biff Tannen from
"Back to the Future II."

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.330
He doesn't have an almanac that
tells him what trades to make.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:57.950
No.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.650
The secret to Ray Dalio's
success, his accuracy,

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.720
isn't at all what he knows.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.022
It's how he thinks.

00:10:04.022 --> 00:10:05.480
So in order to
explain what I mean,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.870
I've got to talk to you about
this guy, Philip Tetlock.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.770
Philip Tetlock is a professor at
the University of Pennsylvania.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.030
He's an academic juggernaut.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.610
He's responsible
for what I think

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.440
is one of the most important
studies over the last 30 years.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.960
So Philip Tetlock
about 30 years ago

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.970
was really frustrated because he
wanted to answer this question.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.352
Do experts really know
what they're talking about?

00:10:28.352 --> 00:10:30.060
I mean, how many times
do you see experts

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.150
on TV that are pontificating
about what's going

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.610
to happen in the future, right?

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.790
Do they really know what
they're talking about?

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.190
We never get to know because,
by the time judgment day comes,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.800
there's no reckoning
because we've

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.334
all lost track of
the predictions,

00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:45.000
and therefore there's
no accountability.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.410
Well, Tetlock wanted
to change that.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.460
Tetlock decided to
study meticulously,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.440
to track meticulously
lots of experts.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.850
We're talking about 284
experts in total, upwards

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.870
of 82,000 predictions,
to find out,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.990
do these experts really know
what they're talking about?

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:06.140
After two decades, what he
found made huge headlines

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.060
and was pretty depressing.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.240
Experts performed
abysmally on the whole.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.850
In general, they didn't
perform much better

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.520
than your average
Joe on the street.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.010
But there was a silver lining.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.200
There was a subset of
experts in Tetlock's study

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.240
that actually performed
significantly better

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.780
than everyone else.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.440
And what he found
was that it had

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.940
much less to do
with what they know

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.980
and more to do with
how they think.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.600
So he classified these
successful forecasters

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.110
and unsuccessful forecasters
into two kinds of groups.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.000
He called them
foxes and hedgehogs.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.620
So hedgehogs know
one big thing, OK?

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.110
So these guys had these
grand, simple understandings

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.300
of the world.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.420
And they were so confident
in these theories

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.360
that, when information
would come up

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.740
or an event would
occur that contradicted

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.367
their theory, instead of
throwing out the information--

00:12:00.367 --> 00:12:01.950
or instead of throwing
out the theory,

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.520
they would throw
out the information.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.110
Foxes, on the other hand, had a
different way of doing things,

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.610
right?

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.490
They had theories too, but
they were much more skeptical

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.980
of these theories.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.080
And therefore, when
information would come up

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.720
or an event would occur that
contradicted their theories,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.290
they would just
change their theory.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.500
And they would do it over
and over and over again.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.090
In short, in a word,
foxes were persuadable.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.760
And now we know the
secret of Ray Dalio.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.060
He's a fox.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.090
And he spends most of
his day trying to avoid

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.620
being a hedgehog, right?

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.730
In fact, 30 years
ago, he decided

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.511
to start tracking all of his
trades, all of his predictions,

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:43.010
right?

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.810
So he took out a notebook
and he would write down

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.060
the trades he was making,
and then he would follow up.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.476
He would track
them and watch them

00:12:49.476 --> 00:12:52.480
to make sure that those trades
came true or were successful.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.864
If they weren't, he would
assume there was something

00:12:54.864 --> 00:12:57.030
about his understanding of
the world that was wrong,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.090
so he would just change it.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.390
Dalio's been doing
this for 30 years,

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.580
and he takes no shame in this
constant process of revision.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.140
Now from the outside this makes
him look really inconsistent,

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.640
right?

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.650
He's constantly
contradicting himself.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.870
In fact, some might
call him a flip-flopper.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.610
But who cares?

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.020
He doesn't because the reward
is deadly accuracy, one

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.169
that makes him one of the
most accurate investors

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:23.710
in the world.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.680
Let's go to growth now,
the third advantage

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.080
of being persuadable.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.520
In 1974, a guy by the name of
Alan Ricks, who's a researcher,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.220
was following up on
a long-term study

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.580
of kids who were highly
disturbed as young boys.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.790
He wanted to find out-- all
these kids had undergone

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.050
psychiatric treatment,
psychotherapy, as kids,

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.425
and he was following
up with them

00:13:49.425 --> 00:13:51.380
to see how they were
performing as adults.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.880
What he found was
that most of the kids

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.417
weren't doing very well
as adults, unfortunately.

00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.250
But there were a few
kids that were actually

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.110
doing extremely well.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.220
And what was
remarkable to him was,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.916
when he dug a little
deeper, is that those kids,

00:14:06.916 --> 00:14:08.540
the ones that were
doing well, were all

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.430
treated by the same provider.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.190
Ricks came to the conclusion
that, in the field

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.200
of psychotherapy, there
are a few therapists that

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.790
are performing
exceptionally well,

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.010
that are getting results
head and shoulders

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.540
above their peers.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.780
He called these high-performing
therapists supershrinks.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.510
Now at the time, the
field was way more

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.010
interested in finding
out what makes

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.020
for good therapy
versus good therapist.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.410
And so Ricks's conclusion
didn't get much attention.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.590
That was until a team of
researchers in the 2000s

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.100
found his study, and they
were fascinated by it.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.090
They wanted to find out what
made supershrinks so super.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.190
This is the lead
on the team, a guy

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.916
by the name of Scott Miller.

00:14:53.916 --> 00:14:55.990
What these guys had,
the International Center

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.980
for Clinical Excellence,
at their disposal

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.350
was lots of data.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.140
So they had a lot of
data on patient outcomes

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.890
and therapists.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.434
And what they would
do is they would

00:15:06.434 --> 00:15:07.850
come up with a
list of attributes,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.730
like, everything you
could think of that

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.160
might separate the
good therapists

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.243
from the great therapists.

00:15:12.243 --> 00:15:16.450
We're talking about age,
experience, level of education,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.320
gender, the mode of therapy,
all of these things.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.620
And one by one they would
cross check these attributes

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.180
with the data.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.630
But one after one they
kept striking out.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.720
They couldn't
determine what actually

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.680
made the supershrinks so super,
and so actually after some time

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.990
they decided to give up.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.270
Until two years later,
Scott Miller was on a plane.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.680
He was on a flight, and he
saw this "Fortune" magazine

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.230
article.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.760
And he picked it up, and
he started reading it.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.970
And it was by a guy,
the article was by a guy

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:48.230
named K. Anders Ericsson.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.240
Now many of you might be
familiar with that name

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.070
because he's the father of
a concept called deliberate

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.310
practice.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.860
So Anders Ericsson's
claim to fame

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.870
is that he studied
experts in a wide variety

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.470
of cognitively complex skills.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.110
We're talking about from
violin, to chess players,

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.720
to lots of different
kinds of skills.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.480
And what he found was that
the quantity of practice

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.600
didn't determine whether or not
these people became masters.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.107
It was important, right?

00:16:16.107 --> 00:16:17.190
It just wasn't sufficient.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.200
He actually famously
came up with this idea

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.640
of the 10,000-hours rule.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.390
So it was important.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:27.380
But what was much more important
was the quality of practice,

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.360
right?

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.062
Experts and masters don't
just perform the same thing

00:16:31.062 --> 00:16:32.270
over and over and over again.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.670
It's not just rote repetition.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.525
No, they're constantly concerned
with negative feedback.

00:16:37.525 --> 00:16:38.900
See, what they
want to do is they

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.580
want to understand what are the
weaknesses in their performance

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.850
so they can continually
adjust and improve.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.250
And they do so obsessively.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.150
This was the revelation
that Scott Miller needed.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.080
Armed with this fresh new
perspective, he and his team

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.650
dove back into
the data, and they

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.667
found something really
interesting in their data

00:16:55.667 --> 00:16:57.500
that they hadn't seen
the first time around.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.090
In fact, they couldn't
believe that they missed it.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.350
It turns out when they looked
at the lowest performing

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.020
therapists, the lowest
performing therapists,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.160
they found something
very confounding.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.589
When you looked at their
own self-evaluations,

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:11.460
it turns out the lowest
performing therapists actually

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.720
thought they were the best
performing therapists.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.849
They were delusional.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:17.680
They were suffering
from what psychologists

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.640
call illusory superiority.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.540
Don't laugh too hard
because we all suffer

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.056
from illusory superiority.

00:17:23.056 --> 00:17:24.680
Every single person
here thinks they're

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.040
more attractive, more
intelligent, more honest

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.690
than they probably actually are.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:33.364
And the research has lots of
examples of how this works,

00:17:33.364 --> 00:17:33.863
right?

00:17:33.863 --> 00:17:36.720
Now here's the problem
with illusory superiority.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.670
If K. Anders Ericsson is right,
it does protect our ego, right?

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.600
It prevents us from having a
nervous breakdown every now

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.260
and then.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.130
But the cost is, it
prevents us from engaging

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.387
in deliberate practice.

00:17:49.387 --> 00:17:51.470
Because in order to engage
in deliberate practice,

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.011
we need to understand
our weaknesses,

00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:55.190
and illusory
superiority makes us not

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.220
understand our weaknesses.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.990
But there is one
fascinating conclusion

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.260
from the research, which
is that, even though we're

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.270
really bad at understanding
our own weaknesses,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.130
it turns out we're actually
really good at pointing out

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.270
somebody else's weaknesses.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.610
And so the solution is actually
really simple for masters,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.190
for people who really want to
improve at an accelerated rate.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.000
You should allow other people
to point out your weaknesses

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.350
for you.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.070
And this, it turns out, was
the secret of supershrinks.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.840
Supershrinks were
obsessive about asking

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.870
for negative feedback.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.490
I mean, there's lots of ways to
get negative feedback, right?

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.031
You can try to do
it yourself and you

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:38.640
can intuit it, which a lot of
supershrinks, it turns out,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.410
did do.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.530
But the main way that
they got their feedback

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.170
was by asking their clients.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.110
Now this is kind
of unprecedented

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.125
in the therapeutic
relationship, right?

00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:49.750
The therapist is
usually the one that's

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.177
giving the feedback
to the client.

00:18:52.177 --> 00:18:53.510
And here they are asking, right?

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.700
They would ask questions
like, how am I doing?

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.220
How empathetic was I
at today's session?

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.970
Did we talk about what you
wanted to talk about today?

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.190
And they didn't just stop
at those questions, right?

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.440
Like, they kept following
up because people don't like

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.640
to give you negative feedback.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.098
So they would continue to ask
over and over and over again.

00:19:11.098 --> 00:19:12.970
And they were
persistent because they

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.680
wanted to make sure they
got that negative feedback.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.540
And that, it turns
out, is how they

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.280
grew at an accelerated rate.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.720
And they didn't just
ask for the feedback.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.660
They acted upon it.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.097
They were persuadable.

00:19:26.097 --> 00:19:27.180
They actually embraced it.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.540
They didn't see it as a
favor to the other person.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.670
They saw it as a gift.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.570
Because as Cornell
psychologist David Dunning

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.960
writes, who is one of
the foremost researchers

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.610
on illusory superiority,
the road to self-insight

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.560
runs through other people.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.810
So now that we've talked
about the advantages of being

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.476
persuadable, I want
to talk a little bit

00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:46.984
about how to be persuadable.

00:19:46.984 --> 00:19:48.400
Because it's not
that easy, right?

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.564
Every single person here who
buys into this argument--

00:19:51.564 --> 00:19:53.980
maybe you don't-- but if you
do, that being persuadable is

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.090
an advantage, that's not enough.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.590
Because it turns
out there's lots

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.610
of obstacles that prevent
you from being persuadable

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.745
even if you want to be.

00:20:01.745 --> 00:20:03.620
And we're going to talk
about them right now.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.620
In fact, it's almost like
a quest you have to go on.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.550
It's almost like a
journey you have to fight.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.090
This is our heroine,
our persuadable leader

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.270
who wants to be persuadable.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.570
What we're going
to find is she is

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.499
going to experience
lots of obstacles

00:20:15.499 --> 00:20:17.290
along the way that are
going to prevent her

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:18.310
from being persuadable.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.020
The first is this thing
called the feeling of knowing.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.950
So here's what I want
you to do right now.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.330
I want you to think
about something,

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.920
everybody here,
think about something

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.970
you're extremely certain about.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.840
Something that you're
100% confident about,

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.190
100% sure about.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.980
Maybe it's a political belief.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.140
Maybe it's your belief that
either looser or stricter gun

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.040
regulation would lead to a
better society or less crime.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.726
Maybe it's a project
or a business idea

00:20:45.726 --> 00:20:47.100
you have in the
back of your mind

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.710
that you're just sure is
going to change the world.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.930
Or maybe it's an argument you're
in with your spouse right now

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.890
about how to best
discipline your kids,

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.051
and you just know you're
right and they're wrong.

00:20:57.051 --> 00:20:57.550
OK?

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.000
Really think about
this for a moment.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.870
Now that feeling that you're
experiencing right now

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.260
is what the neurophilosopher
Dr. Robert Burton calls

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.580
a feeling of knowing, OK?

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.472
It's a sensation that gives
us this feeling of certainty.

00:21:12.472 --> 00:21:13.430
Now here's the problem.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.220
We want to believe
that that feeling is

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.240
the result of some kind
of rational analysis,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.720
some good reasons we
have to feel that way.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.820
And it's not, OK?

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.970
The feeling of
knowing arises out

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.840
of involuntary mechanisms in
the brain independent of reason,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.680
independent of
rational analysis.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.980
But it sure doesn't
feel like that, right?

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.121
It feels totally reliable.

00:21:35.121 --> 00:21:36.120
It feels like the truth.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.310
But the truth is
that it's unreliable.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.780
It doesn't always tell
us what's accurate.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.610
And so here's the problem.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.370
The feeling of knowing is
completely involuntary, right?

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.360
We don't choose it.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.240
You didn't choose to have that
feeling any more than we choose

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.110
to fall in love or get angry.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.450
These emotions
actually happen to us.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.034
So we can't just get rid of
the feeling of knowing, right?

00:21:57.034 --> 00:21:59.200
It stands in the way of us
being persuadable, right?

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.750
Because the first
thing we need to do

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.270
to be persuadable is to accept
the possibility that we're

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.655
wrong, right?

00:22:06.655 --> 00:22:07.780
But there is a bright side.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.540
There is something that
we can and must do.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.123
Because we can't get
rid of a feeling,

00:22:11.123 --> 00:22:13.840
but we can learn to distrust it.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.210
And in order to
do that, we should

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.655
recall a moment of opacity.

00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:20.530
So here's what a moment
of opacity is, right?

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.764
Everyone knows what a
moment of clarity is.

00:22:22.764 --> 00:22:23.930
We've all heard that before.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.990
It's like an experience
you had in your life

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.800
where just something was
so right that you just

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.550
felt like you understood
the world, right?

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.049
It was like for the
first time ever,

00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:37.530
you could see the universe
just completely unobstructed.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.580
A moment of opacity
is the opposite.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.110
It's a time in
your life where you

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.990
were so sure you were going
to get something right

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.770
and you got it wrong.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.800
Everybody who predicted that
Donald Trump wouldn't make it

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.400
to a primary, much less
win three in a row,

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.500
should have had a
moment of opacity.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.570
This painful realization
that, wow, we

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.430
don't understand the world
as much as we think we do.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.380
The problem is,
whenever we experience

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.757
this moment of opacity, five
seconds later we forget, right?

00:23:08.757 --> 00:23:10.590
We learn to distrust
that feeling of knowing

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.620
in that moment because
we realized it was wrong,

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.410
and then five seconds later or
five minutes later we forget.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.890
Persuadable leaders make
sure they never forget.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.270
Your moment of opacity,
as painful as it is,

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.920
is your greatest
asset because it

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.720
will remind you to distrust
your feeling of knowing.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.340
Our second villain on the
path to being persuadable

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.260
is the confirmation bias.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.960
So we all know what the
confirmation bias is.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.139
It's the force
that has us believe

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:39.430
what we want to believe, right?

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.180
It gives us information
and it causes

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.040
us to seek out information that
confirms what we already know.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.149
We've all been led by
the confirmation bias.

00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:47.690
Just think about
the last time you've

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.200
seen an article on Facebook.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.340
And you see an
article headline that

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.825
just seems infuriating to
you, just from the headline.

00:23:56.825 --> 00:23:58.950
So you click on it and you
race through the article

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:04.090
as fast as you can, basically
dismissing every single point,

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.700
you know, calling the
thing biased propaganda

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.200
and then deleting it or getting
it out of your Facebook feed

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.460
or, if you're like me,
unfriending the person who

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.549
posted it, right?

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:13.340
This is what we do.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.340
This is the protocol.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.950
Now compare that to what we do
when we see an article that we

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.550
initially like, right?

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.180
So it's an article
with a headline, oh,

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.138
that seems interesting.

00:24:22.138 --> 00:24:23.060
I kind of like this.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.680
You go through it, it takes
you two seconds, you read it,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.055
you love it, and then you
share it with all your friends.

00:24:28.055 --> 00:24:29.220
And then you celebrate.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.860
This asymmetry leads
us away from the truth.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.770
It leads us to things that we
already know, which is great,

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:37.960
at least for our ego.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.680
But it's terrible when
we're seeking the truth.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.250
So how do we combat
this confirmation bias,

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.650
which is often insidious?

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.240
We often don't even know
when it's taken hold of us.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.660
The answer is to
argue with others.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.677
So there's this amazing
thing that happens.

00:24:52.677 --> 00:24:54.260
Arguing is actually
a beautiful thing.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:59.020
It actually produces, often, the
most reliable results, right?

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.200
It's the quickest
path to the truth.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.260
Think about the one
area in our society

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.920
where we desperately
want the truth.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.470
In our justice system, right?

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.940
I mean, we desperately don't
want an innocent person

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.880
to go to jail for the
rest of their lives

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.932
for a crime they didn't commit.

00:25:14.932 --> 00:25:15.640
So what do we do?

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.240
We don't commission a team to go
on a fact-finding investigation

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.310
and render a verdict alone.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.810
No.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.851
We know that the confirmation
bias would probably

00:25:23.851 --> 00:25:24.680
lead them astray.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.410
So smartly, what we do is we
have an adversarial system.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.650
We have a defense, and
we have a prosecution.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.820
We have them argue
against each other

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.170
because there's this
amazing thing that happens.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:38.080
The confirmation bias
alone is a weakness, right?

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.600
It leads us away from the truth.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.300
But when you have two
confirmation biases that

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.030
are directed at each other,
that are opposing each other,

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.320
it actually balances
each other out.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.101
And so when you
argue with people

00:25:50.101 --> 00:25:52.600
that disagree with you-- not
with people who agree with you,

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.370
that can actually
result in polarization

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.320
and get you further
from the truth.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.580
But when you argue with
people that you disagree with,

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.744
it actually gets you
closer to the truth,

00:26:01.744 --> 00:26:03.660
and that's the best form
of being persuadable.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.870
But there is a problem
because that's not

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.984
how most people argue, is it?

00:26:09.984 --> 00:26:12.400
If you've ever seen an argument,
it's more like a quarrel,

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:12.680
right?

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.138
It's like two people
who are trying

00:26:14.138 --> 00:26:15.940
to tear each other apart.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.810
Just look at the
political debates

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.770
if you want evidence of that.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.230
So the question is, why is that?

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:25.931
So the metaphor I use for how
we argue is skeet shooting.

00:26:25.931 --> 00:26:27.430
So you're arguing
with somebody else

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.470
and somebody makes a good point.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.430
It's almost like a clay
target that's flung in the air

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.890
that you take your shotgun
with and you shoot it down.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.514
And then when they make
another point, you turn the gun

00:26:35.514 --> 00:26:36.430
and you shoot it down.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.880
And you obsessively try to
shoot down all the points.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.850
And if you can do
that, then you win.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.215
That is a terrible way
to argue, it turns out.

00:26:43.215 --> 00:26:45.090
It's a great way if you
want to argue to win.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.215
It's a terrible way if you
want to argue to improve

00:26:47.215 --> 00:26:48.440
the accuracy of your beliefs.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.240
So why is it?

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.490
Why do we do that?

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.280
Well, the answer,
one of the reasons

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.700
is because of a force
called dichotomous thinking.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.511
So human beings
don't like ambiguity.

00:26:57.511 --> 00:26:59.510
We like to believe the
world is black and white,

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.852
wrong or right, 100%
certain or 0% certain.

00:27:02.852 --> 00:27:05.310
We want to believe that LeBron
James is the best basketball

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.643
player in the world or he's not.

00:27:06.643 --> 00:27:09.010
We want to believe that
intervening in Syria will

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.370
produce good outcomes and less
conflict in the Middle East

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.370
or it won't.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.560
And so what the logic goes
when you see the world that way

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.230
is that, if somebody can
score a point on you,

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.890
if somebody can prove that
one little thing that part

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.150
of your reasoning is wrong,
well, then that means

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.620
you must be totally wrong.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.100
And so therefore, we have to
perfectly defend our positions.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.430
But that's not how
the world works.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:36.880
The world is not
black and white.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.910
It's entirely uncertain.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.110
It's shades of gray.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.460
So what we have to do is we
have to make uncertain judgments

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.790
based on probabilities.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.500
And so in order to battle
dichotomous thinking,

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.909
we need to think about
our beliefs incrementally.

00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:51.450
We need to update
them incrementally.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:52.366
So here's what you do.

00:27:52.366 --> 00:27:53.985
Next time when you
argue with somebody

00:27:53.985 --> 00:27:56.240
and you really want
to be persuadable,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.800
imagine, instead of
putting your hand

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.400
on your shotgun the entire
time, keep your hand on a dial.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.150
So imagine there's a
dial in front of you.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.290
It's a radio dial.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.540
And if you turn the dial all
the way to the left, that

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.380
means you're 100% certain in
any particular belief, decision,

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.600
opinion you have right now.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.860
All the way to the right
means you're 100% certain.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.700
All the way to the left
means you're 0% certain.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.762
Now, when somebody makes
a good point, instead

00:28:18.762 --> 00:28:20.470
of being concerned
with shooting it down,

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:24.790
all you have to be focused
on is just turning the dial.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:28.070
If they make a point that
is good but contradicts

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.090
your opinion, just turn the
dial a little bit to the left.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:34.170
If some evidence surfaces
that supports your position,

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.950
turn the dial a little
bit to the right.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.650
If by the end of the argument
your dial is to the left

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.930
or to the right of where
it was when you began,

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.860
congratulations, you've
learned something.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.270
You've improved the
accuracy of your beliefs.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:51.310
But we can't just turn
that dial forever, right,

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.480
because at some point we
have to make a decision.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480
We have to take a stand.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.360
We have to decide whether
to change our mind or not.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.070
And that is when the most
insidious and most powerful

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.430
force prevents us from
changing our mind,

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.310
and that is attachment.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.710
In our quest to be
persuadable, the problem

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:15.004
is we fall in love with
our beliefs, right?

00:29:15.004 --> 00:29:16.670
We have what are
called favored beliefs,

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.070
which are beliefs
that we care about,

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.120
that we don't want to see go.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.495
It's usually
because they're tied

00:29:20.495 --> 00:29:24.340
into our identity, our
relationships, or our material

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.200
self-interest.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.590
Upton Sinclair
has a great quote.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:30.190
He said, "It's difficult to
make a man understand something

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.670
when his salary depends on
him not understanding it."

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.810
Which is exactly
the point, right?

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.420
We have a lot tied
into these beliefs

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.920
and we don't want
to see them go.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.815
The people that may
experience this,

00:29:44.815 --> 00:29:47.110
it's most salient for
people who experience this,

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:48.190
is writers, right?

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.710
So writers are a
pretty neurotic bunch.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.430
We often fall in love
with our work, right?

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.030
So every sentence,
every paragraph

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.400
can feel like it's our own baby.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.710
And so when an editor
points out to us

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.670
that maybe this
paragraph isn't the best,

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.970
maybe this chapter isn't the
best and maybe it should go,

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.490
we get infuriated, right,
because it feels like we're

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.870
abandoning our own offspring.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.530
And so there is this
indispensable advice that's

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.000
given to writers
because we know,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.800
any writer who's worth
their salt knows,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.720
that editing is a critical
part of the process, right?

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.220
We need to get rid
of the bad ideas

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.040
so that we can get
the good ideas.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.080
And so this indispensable
piece of advice

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.350
that you've probably heard
before is, kill your darlings.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:33.000
Instead of letting your editor
passively and slowly drag

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.260
your darlings away from you
as tears are running down

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.780
your cheeks, you
should grab the knife

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.000
and take matters
into your own hands.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.730
Now this sounds-- I mean, it's
a crass expression, right?

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:47.750
But for good reason because
it acknowledges the fact

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:52.670
that letting go of our favored
beliefs can feel painful,

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.740
can feel wrong, can feel
twisted, can feel even unholy.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.580
But we have to do it
because the sooner we

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.000
can get rid of the bad
ideas, the sooner we

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.650
can have good ideas.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.850
But that's not the only reason
we should kill our darlings

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.020
because so far what
I've talked about

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.420
is a persuadable advantage
for the individual, right?

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.980
The benefits of agility,
accuracy, and growth.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.399
But there's a much more
important advantage

00:31:19.399 --> 00:31:20.940
that we should all
be concerned with,

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.481
and that is the
collective advantage,

00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:24.820
the advantage for society.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.980
You need to kill your
darlings because that often

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.850
is the fastest path
to changing the world.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.430
So we in this society have
this marketplace of ideas.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:34.840
It's a beautiful thing.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.330
The marketplace of ideas
through this exchange of ideas

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.070
actually makes it more likely
that the best ideas prevail.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.240
The best policies, the best
opinions, the best beliefs

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.360
are the ones that
rise to the top.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.160
And yet our
marketplace of ideas is

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.630
broken because in order to have
a marketplace, a functioning

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.160
marketplace, you need
buyers and sellers.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.480
But in our marketplace, it's
like everybody's a seller,

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:57.980
right?

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.110
Everybody wants to
sell their idea,

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.370
but nobody is willing to buy.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.230
And that's a problem.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.600
When we think about all
the great social movements

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.710
and social change
in history, we think

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:10.010
about the persuaders, right?

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.640
We think about the great
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.550
Mahatma Gandhi,
Susan B. Anthony,

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.820
people who changed
hearts and minds,

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.610
these committed
activists, that was

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.740
what sparked and led to change.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.020
And of course, those
people were fundamental,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.750
they were instrumental,
they're heroes.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.490
But that's not telling
the entire story

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.060
because, in order for change
to occur, in order for people

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.800
to sell change,
you need people who

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.350
are willing to buy it, right?

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.980
There were opponents,
there were people

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.150
on the other side
that needed to accept

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.790
and be persuaded in order
for that change to occur.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.330
So that's my invitation
for you all today

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.830
is to become buyers, is to
really look into the world

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:51.110
and see, what are the ideas
that I can embrace that conflict

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.330
with my current ideas?

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.730
Where can I show up to
the table and actually

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.870
have a genuine willingness
to change my mind?

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.950
And to actually
accept the possibility

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:01.650
that maybe I'm wrong?

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.190
That's going to require a little
bit of a different mindset,

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.690
right?

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.174
I say that the mindset
that we usually have,

00:33:07.174 --> 00:33:08.840
the mantra that's
going through our head

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.110
over and over again as we
interact with the world is,

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.350
let my idea prevail.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:14.850
That's the mantra
of persuasiveness.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.070
But I want to offer you
a different mantra today,

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.990
one that I think
is more valuable

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.810
and it takes a little
bit more courage,

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:25.839
but I think it's way more
advantageous for society

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:26.630
and the individual.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.960
And that is, let the
best idea prevail.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.480
Thank you.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.650
So at this time, if
you have any questions,

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:43.600
there are microphones
in the aisles.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.641
So please, you know, I'd love
to field any comments you have.

00:33:54.588 --> 00:33:58.600
AUDIENCE: And so my
question is, how do you

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.940
ensure that you don't
overdo it so you come out

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.400
as being, like, not
have enough credit

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:11.760
or not confident enough about
your beliefs and positions,

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.332
whatever?

00:34:12.332 --> 00:34:14.290
AL PITTAMPALLI: That's
a really great question.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.980
So let's just first dispense
with an obvious straw

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.560
man, which is, being persuadable
does not mean gullible, right?

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.560
It doesn't mean
always persuaded.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.380
So just because you come to the
table and you have this genuine

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.210
willingness to change your mind,
if people don't provide you

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.560
with good reasons or good
argument or a reason to change

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.600
your mind, then you shouldn't.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.250
That being said, there's
also truth to this idea

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.469
that we can't be too
persuadable, right?

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:43.980
I mean, think about it this way.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.590
You know, if you're a
leader and you're driving

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:50.010
and you're about
to head off a cliff

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:52.066
and there are other
people riding with you,

00:34:52.066 --> 00:34:53.940
you don't have time to
be persuadable, right?

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.960
Everybody's going to have
their own opinion on what

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.780
you should do.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.480
But as a leader
when time is short,

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.200
you need to just
steer the wheel.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.260
So the opposite of
persuadable is decisive.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.370
And so what leaders
need to do, I think,

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:10.990
is vacillate between being
persuadable and being decisive.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.150
Now the problem is,
most people, when

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.606
they think about
leadership, always think

00:35:16.606 --> 00:35:17.730
that we should be decisive.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.104
And if we need to
be persuadable,

00:35:19.104 --> 00:35:21.602
fine, but it's kind of not the
hallmark of a great leader.

00:35:21.602 --> 00:35:23.560
So we'll kind of be
persuadable, but then we'll

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.440
hurry back over to
being decisive again.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.300
At best that's how
leaders operate.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.130
The argument of this
book is not that we

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.850
don't need to be decisive
often, because we do.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:36.490
It's that, instead of
being a decisive leader who

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.650
has to be persuadable
every once in a while,

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.110
you should be a
persuadable leader who

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.600
sometimes needs to be decisive.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.520
So we should live in
persuadability because,

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.834
especially when it comes
to the big things in life.

00:35:48.834 --> 00:35:50.250
When it comes to
the small things,

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.820
be decisive because a good
enough decision is good enough.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.272
You don't need accuracy,
agility, and growth.

00:35:55.272 --> 00:35:56.980
But when it comes to
the big things, when

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.560
it comes to the
big decisions, when

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.020
it comes to important
ideas, we need

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.860
to be persuadable because
that's how we ensure

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.020
that we have the best outcomes.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.452
Thank you.

00:36:09.452 --> 00:36:10.910
AUDIENCE: Yes, so
one of the points

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.780
you mentioned for
being persuadable

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.680
is arguing with others.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.380
Now I find that my peer groups,
people who I interact with,

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.350
they share a lot of
the same beliefs.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.120
Now I'm wondering, when I go out
there and try to find someone

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.190
to argue with, am I
going out to the street

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:32.650
and finding a person with
opposite beliefs as me?

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.940
Or how do I find
the ideal person

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.214
to argue with where it's
a positive exchange?

00:36:38.214 --> 00:36:39.880
AL PITTAMPALLI: That's
a great question.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.740
So there's a journalist
named Bill Bishop who wrote

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.220
a book called "The Big Sort."

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.600
And his argument is that
our country, especially

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:54.220
our country, has kind of turned
into this environment where

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:59.020
we are surrounded by people
who share our beliefs, right?

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.420
It's called
homophily, I believe.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.134
Wherein that, think about
where you live, right?

00:37:03.134 --> 00:37:04.550
I mean, think about
New York City.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:08.160
But even your local
neighborhoods in New York City.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.680
Think about the
people around you.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.150
The diversity of opinion
and political belief

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.100
is so narrow, right?

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.970
And so what we need to do,
what we need to make sure

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:20.990
we do is we need to get
outside of our bubble

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.440
as much as we can.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.080
And there's lots of ways to
do this, but one of the ways

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.030
to do this is through media.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.650
Think about the media that
you watch all the time.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.060
There's liberal media and
there's conservative media.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.451
And if you're liberal, you
probably watch liberal news.

00:37:34.451 --> 00:37:35.950
If you're conservative,
you probably

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.200
watch conservative news.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.776
And I mean, the
internet is so fractured

00:37:39.776 --> 00:37:41.150
and fragmented
that we could just

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:46.300
find whatever is the station
or the book or the article

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.540
or the television show that fits
into our existing worldview.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.150
And we need to fight that.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:56.409
So what I challenge you to do
is, instead of finding books

00:37:56.409 --> 00:37:58.200
that you already know
you're going to like,

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.325
that you're already going
to agree with, find books

00:38:00.325 --> 00:38:02.440
that you think you're
going to disagree with,

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.950
that are completely different
from your worldview.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:10.360
It always infuriates
me when people give me

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.994
a book as a recommendation.

00:38:11.994 --> 00:38:13.410
They say, oh, I
got you this book.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.701
I know you're going to like it.

00:38:14.701 --> 00:38:17.210
No, give me a book that I'm
not going to like, right?

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.640
Because I always read
books that I like.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.650
I want you to find the most
intelligent, strongest argument

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:27.550
that contradicts something
that I already believe.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.689
Yes.

00:38:28.689 --> 00:38:30.355
AUDIENCE: So I really
enjoyed your talk.

00:38:30.355 --> 00:38:32.063
And sort of leading
on the last question.

00:38:32.063 --> 00:38:34.804
I also agree with
your discussion

00:38:34.804 --> 00:38:36.220
of the dangers of
the echo chamber

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.011
that we live in
politically and culturally.

00:38:38.011 --> 00:38:41.210
So I'm wondering if you do see
any signs across the country

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:42.960
for venues in which
people are having

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.820
these kind of positive
debates and actual marketplace

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.320
of ideas.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.054
The current political debates
do not do that at all.

00:38:49.054 --> 00:38:50.720
And that's from within
the same parties.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.099
So I wonder where
are the places where

00:38:53.099 --> 00:38:54.640
people with strong
different opinions

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.460
can reliably come together?

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.650
Do you see any positive signs?

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.620
AL PITTAMPALLI: The
short answer is no.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:05.670
I think there's a real lack
of leadership in that area.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:08.830
I think the political
climate is so polarized

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.430
that, even if you try
to be that person,

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:14.230
if you try to be the person
that says, hey, wait a minute.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.500
Let's make sure we're not
just gravitating to our ideas

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.450
or the conservative
idea, the liberal idea,

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.050
let's try to gravitate
towards the best idea, that is

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:24.560
such a controversial position.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.300
So it's very tough
right now, which

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.341
is one of the reasons I
wrote this book because I

00:39:28.341 --> 00:39:33.500
wanted to try to help shift
the culture in some small way.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.290
That being said,
there's lots of havens

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.730
outside of the political
process, right?

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.826
So if you google right now.

00:39:40.826 --> 00:39:42.700
For example, there's a
rationalist community.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.200
There's people who
pride themselves,

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.670
they call them rationalists
because they pride themselves

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.720
on being rational and updating
their beliefs in the face

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.330
of evidence that are kind
of apolitical in the sense

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:55.920
that they don't care from what
party the idea comes from.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.190
They just want the best idea.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.360
And so you can always find those
kinds of like-minded people.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:05.010
And I think that the best
thing that anybody can do

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.680
is to try to take
on your own tribe.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.019
Because if outsiders decide to
be persuadable, that's great.

00:40:11.019 --> 00:40:12.560
But if you want to
change the system,

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.050
you need insiders to do it.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.730
So I actually dedicate
an entire chapter

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.150
to this concept of
taking on your own tribe.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:23.980
You know, if you're an outsider
and you try to give a speech

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.090
or try to persuade
people on a-- like,

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:30.010
imagine-- think about the last
time a Republican has stood up

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.710
at the DNC convention
and said, hey, you guys

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.870
need to change the way you're
doing this, and that worked.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:37.120
That never works.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.800
But what happens when a Democrat
stands up on the DNC stage

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.800
and says, hey, we
need to rethink this?

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.690
That often doesn't work either,
but it has a better chance.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:48.850
So my invitation
to people who want

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:50.940
to kind of change
the system is to find

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.560
ways to take on your own tribe.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.180
We're kind of indoctrinated to
take on other people's tribe.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.210
We're always saying, you guys
are wrong, our tribe is right.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.390
But find ways.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.760
One of the quickest
ways to change the world

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.130
and have an impact
is to find areas

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:08.054
where your own tribe is wrong.

00:41:08.054 --> 00:41:09.758
AUDIENCE: Yeah, excellent talk.

00:41:09.758 --> 00:41:12.800
So speaking on that subject,
I'm imagining the scenario when

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.040
you're working with your team.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.570
And you're willing
to be persuadable,

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.000
but obviously other team
members are not necessarily.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.646
Maybe there are some
bigger egos in the room.

00:41:24.646 --> 00:41:27.540
So what are some
actionable words or phrases

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:31.470
that we could use in the
moment to convince somebody

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:35.530
in our team to be persuadable
other than saying something

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:36.999
like, well, what
if you're wrong?

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:37.790
AL PITTAMPALLI: OK.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.081
That's a really great question.

00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:41.820
So how do we persuade others
to be persuadable, right?

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.750
The answer to your
question is, it's

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.210
virtually impossible
in the moment

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:51.140
to convince somebody
to be persuadable.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.602
Because when you say-- you're
in the middle of an argument

00:41:54.602 --> 00:41:56.810
with somebody and they're
being stubborn and you say,

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.970
I want you to be persuadable,
what you're telling

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.910
them is that you're wrong.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:04.340
And that's not being very
persuadable yourself, actually,

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.790
because that means you've kind
of foregone the possibility

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:09.120
that you might be wrong.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.050
And so the only way
to actually convince

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:14.420
people to be persuadable is
before the kind of argument

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.280
happens, right?

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.510
Like, instead of kind of
advancing any kind of agenda,

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:23.310
you actually try to set up an
environment in which you all

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.520
agree to this certain
set of rules, right?

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.910
We're going to let
the best idea prevail.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:30.126
So before the meeting
occurs, or before you

00:42:30.126 --> 00:42:32.000
get into some kind of
conflict with somebody,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.630
or before you start
to butt heads,

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:36.660
you have to try to
spread this idea

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.185
that the best way to get
this accuracy, agility,

00:42:40.185 --> 00:42:42.310
and growth and the best
way to run an organization,

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:46.590
the best way to make decisions
is to make sure we are-- it's

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.100
an idea meritocracy, right?

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.740
We're not picking a
decision or an opinion

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:57.840
because the most powerful
person in the room says it.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.680
We're doing it because
it's the best idea.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.290
That's a very hard
thing to do, again,

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.430
and that's one of the
reasons why I wrote a book.

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:08.790
So I would say, best answer,
give them a copy of my book.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:11.240
Second best answer, do
your best to explain it,

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.010
but not in the middle
of a heated conflict.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:15.530
Yes.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:16.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.238
I was wondering if
you could expand

00:43:18.238 --> 00:43:22.120
on what you think or looked
at to be the factors that

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.350
have contributed to
maybe what we see

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.600
as an increase in
those number of leaders

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.130
who are being more vulnerable?

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.070
And I'm particularly
wondering whether you

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.450
looked at how gender
or the leaders'

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:35.050
attitudes toward diversity
or, to your earlier

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.680
point, the amount of
diversity surrounding them

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:42.140
either helped or hindered their
ability to be persuadable.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:49.850
AL PITTAMPALLI: Yeah, so I think
that the rapid pace of change

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:54.860
is really what has allowed
these leaders to actually

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.490
be more persuadable
more recently, right?

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:59.750
We're seeing a rise, I
think, of persuadability.

00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:03.590
People have always
been persuadable.

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.200
I mean, I talk about
Abraham Lincoln in my book

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.574
and how I thought he was an
extremely persuadable leader.

00:44:07.574 --> 00:44:09.170
So this is not a new phenomenon.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.980
But the reality is,
in a world that's

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.880
so complex and so
hypercompetitive,

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.044
we need to be willing to adapt
and to change very quickly.

00:44:18.044 --> 00:44:20.460
And if you think about it,
it's just a logical conclusion,

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:20.960
right?

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.900
The way that you adapt
and change quickly,

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.710
you need to make
a-- all new change

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:27.490
is preceded by a new decision.

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:31.000
All new decisions are preceded
by a new belief, right?

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.990
A change of mind.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:33.690
So the quicker you
can change your mind,

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:37.880
the quicker you can adapt
to changing circumstances.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.350
As for gender, I don't
comment a lot on gender,

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:44.060
at least right now, because the
research is a little bit mixed.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.549
And you know, it's tempting.

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:47.090
And there is some
research to support

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.000
that, for example,
women have a tendency

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.430
to be more open-minded
and more persuadable

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.570
than men, although I haven't
really confirmed them

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.560
so I don't talk
about that that much.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.625
But I think one part
of the research that

00:44:59.625 --> 00:45:02.620
seems pretty unequivocal
is that diversity,

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.050
whether it be ethnic
diversity, gender diversity,

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:06.420
really does help.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.794
Because, like we
talked about, one

00:45:09.794 --> 00:45:11.460
of the ingredients
for being persuadable

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.190
is to get different
perspectives,

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.930
different opinions, to argue and
to exchange ideas with people

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.140
that disagree with you.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.950
And people-- diversity-- that's
what diversity is, right?

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.140
It's people who come from
different walks of life,

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:26.210
different backgrounds, different
cultures who are trading ideas,

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:28.470
who have their own kind of
prism through which they

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:29.360
see the world.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.600
And so to me it seems
completely logical

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.580
that diversity would
lead to better arguments,

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.790
to better exchanges, and
therefore better outcomes.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.160
AUDIENCE: We all
have our beliefs,

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:49.040
and we basically do things
based on our beliefs.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.200
What do you think about the
idea of actually doing something

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.260
against our beliefs
as an experiment?

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.090
AL PITTAMPALLI: That's
a brilliant idea.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.660
And I kind of advocate
that all the time.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:08.970
It's amazing how
the number of times,

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.880
the small number
of times, we ever

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.660
do stuff that is contrary to
our beliefs or our intuition.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.360
I mean, what's amazing
is, the cultural meme is

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.546
trust your gut.

00:46:20.546 --> 00:46:21.420
That's the big thing.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.970
Everybody's trying to encourage
you to trust your gut.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:23.971
We always trust our gut.

00:46:23.971 --> 00:46:26.095
There's nothing remarkable
about trusting your gut.

00:46:26.095 --> 00:46:27.560
We trust our gut all the time.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.660
You trusted your gut
a million times today,

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.904
every single interaction.

00:46:31.904 --> 00:46:33.320
It's actually way
more interesting

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.250
and way more difficult to
actually distrust your gut,

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:39.130
to actually make
decisions and to do things

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:43.250
that are contrary to your
beliefs and your preexisting

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:44.070
attitudes.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.290
So one of the things you
have to be comfortable

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:49.560
with, and that's what
this first step to being

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.170
persuadable that I
talked about today,

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.130
is to recall your moment
of opacity, right?

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:55.970
The whole point
of that is to get

00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:00.340
you to remember that this
feeling that you experience

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.674
that is produced by your
beliefs is not the truth.

00:47:03.674 --> 00:47:06.090
You know, it feels like that's
the right direction, right?

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:08.512
It feels like it's the
right thing to do, right?

00:47:08.512 --> 00:47:10.970
Like, the writing example, I
think, is salient here, right?

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.092
Like when somebody
criticizes your work,

00:47:14.092 --> 00:47:15.800
whether it be writing
or entrepreneurship

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.770
or anything, your
gut, your belief

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:19.380
tells you that they're wrong.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:23.590
And it's the mark, the
hallmark of responsible adults

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:27.210
and intelligent people
to say, wait a minute.

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.470
I'm not objective on this.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.250
Maybe it's possible
that I'm wrong.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.670
And it's just that
space, it's that distance

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:38.081
for a second, that recalling
your moment of opacity that

00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:40.330
separates yourself from the
thought, from your belief,

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:41.788
from your intuition
that allows you

00:47:41.788 --> 00:47:43.830
to make a rational decision.

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:47.060
It's what Daniel Kahneman
refers to as System 2, thinking,

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.970
that we all need to
become much better at.

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:54.014
AUDIENCE: You had this
idea to write the book,

00:47:54.014 --> 00:47:57.070
and you had the insight and
then you wrote the book.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:59.280
How were you persuaded
when you were writing it?

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.970
How did your mind change?

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:03.030
And how did you change
your original theory?

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:06.240
AL PITTAMPALLI: That's
a really great question.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:10.300
I had to toss several
chapters of my book.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.180
In fact, you know, this
book is what, 65,000 words?

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:18.440
I probably wrote, like,
600,000 words in total.

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.670
Because I really tried to
eat my own cooking here,

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.030
which is really tough
because I'll tell you what.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:26.730
Persuadable is like
this easy thing

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:28.100
when you're intellectually
talking about it.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.391
But when you have to do it
yourself, you're like, well,

00:48:30.391 --> 00:48:31.390
this is not easy.

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:34.330
Because what would happen was,
I would read somebody's research

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.080
and I would say, wow,
this is fascinating.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.940
This fits right in
with my argument.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.692
And then I would call
them up for validation.

00:48:40.692 --> 00:48:42.150
And you could see
yourself starting

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:44.527
to lead them in the
direction you want them to.

00:48:44.527 --> 00:48:46.110
And they're resisting,
and then you're

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.500
asking these loaded
questions to get them to say

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.910
what you want them to say.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:55.090
And you know, it takes a lot
of kind of effort and courage

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.760
to say, was I leading
them too much?

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.360
You know, am I wrong about this?

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.010
And you know,
luckily, I think, I

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:05.090
had some good editors
that helped me with this,

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.925
but I wasn't
perfectly successful.

00:49:07.925 --> 00:49:09.860
And that's the lesson
of being persuadable.

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.860
It's not-- human beings
are very flawed this way.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.070
Our confirmation bias
is extremely strong.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.040
So I did my best.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.470
And I think I did
probably better than most,

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:21.380
but I wouldn't say that
I'm perfect by any measure.

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.790
But I think the
lesson here is for all

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:28.020
of us, which is, what is
your contribution to being

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:28.980
persuadable?

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.090
Where in your life,
where in your work,

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:33.510
where in your business
can you take the time

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:38.108
to address the
confirmation bias,

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:41.180
really confront the possibility
that you may be wrong,

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.500
and then follow the evidence
wherever it may lead?

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.440
I think it's the
best thing for you.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.500
And I also think it's the
best thing for society.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.310
So I hope you'll
take this message

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:52.262
and really embrace
it and act upon it.

00:49:52.262 --> 00:49:53.720
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.840
It was a real pleasure
to speak with you.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.990
