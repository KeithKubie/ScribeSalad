00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.870
&gt;&gt;presenter: I have the honor of introducing
Julie Clow; author of the Work Revolution:

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.900
Freedom and Excellence for All.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.520
I know many people in the audience have the
opportunity to know Julie and we all think

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.060
very highly of her but I’d like to share
my personal experiences with Julie in working

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.060
with NGDU.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.710
It wasn’t that long that we had the opportunity
to work together but I took every opportunity

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.420
to take advantage of her brilliance in leading
teams and managing and developing people and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660
in developing high impact strategy.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.480
I also had the opportunity to gain her as
my biking buddy for one glorious summer where

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.590
we would scale the mountains up Old La Honda
and Page Mill in preparation for a century

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.590
ride.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.820
And it was during those six hour rides that
Julie first mentioned her ideas of writing

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.350
a book.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.820
And periodically she would share things with
me about thoughts she had and wanted to get

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.559
some feedback on how do we focus on what’s
right, what’s most high impact, not everything.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.790
She shared her ideas around the challenges
and opportunities that come with technology.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.750
And never being off but having the opportunity
to be on whenever it’s convenient.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.100
So I feel like I got a little bit of an insider
view and an opportunity to see her ideas as

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.260
they were developing.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.080
Now, we all know Julie in her wonderness and
it was no surprise to me and others that she

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.370
was able to get a book deal just about eight
months after first sharing her ideas and then

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.450
had a full manuscript about six months after
that.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.890
Meanwhile moving to New York, starting a new
job and training for an Olympic triathlon.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.510
So she is multi talented in a variety of ways.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.400
For those of you that don’t know Julie’s
background at Google she joined sales EDU

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.990
for a period of time, transitioned to people
ops where she developed the foundations and

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.590
leadership in teamwork program also known
as Flight which is still thriving and great

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.590
reviews.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.140
People continue to talk about it.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.369
But we were fortunate enough to steal her
away and have her join us in NGE where we

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.650
had her for a period of time.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.060
She’s now VP of learning and development
of a small investment management company in

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.060
New York.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.129
She is a proud Auburn fan where she got her
PhD in organizational behavior in psychology.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.650
And she’s here to talk a bit more about
her work so please join me in welcoming Julie.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.150
[applause]

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:33.469
&gt;&gt;Julie Clow: So it was a little bit of a
challenge to think about what I might do for

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.280
an Authors at Google talk when my book is
basically about my experience at Google.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.329
So usually I get to go and talk to people
and wow of them with stories of how life at

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.219
Google was great and free and autonomous but
coming here and telling you guys this is a

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.239
little bit flat.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.029
So I had to stretch myself a little bit in
thinking about what I could share with you

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:54.769
around the work revolution.

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.389
So I thought I could do two things.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:02.779
One is recount to you the lessons I feel that
I learned having spent five years at Google

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:07.239
and then two some of the surprising things
that I learned along the way doing the book

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.239
research.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.449
So what kind of things pushed my imagination
even further in terms of what we can do in

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:13.969
our organizations?

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.269
So the question I want to pose is, “What
if?”

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.450
So I’m gonna share with you some of those
what if questions and talk through some really

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.329
interesting examples of what I’ve come across
in the course of writing the book.

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:32.499
So the book is The Work Revolution: Freedom
and Excellence for All and the question is

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:34.689
why a work revolution?

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:41.849
So, as anybody who’s worked in the corporate
environment knows, this is more the norm than

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.739
what we have experienced in Google.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.339
And, in fact, I worked at several organizations
before joining Google in which this was the

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:50.339
case.

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:54.930
It was a nine to five sort of work life and
you had to be there on time and if I was late

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.269
because of traffic I was stressing, why?

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.840
I don’t know, to get there for no apparent
reason.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.089
But this is really the reality of the majority
of people out there and I just felt compelled

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:11.269
to write a book to articulate why this is
kind of dumb and why we should be looking

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.959
at this in a brand new way and questioning
the assumptions behind it.

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.310
And as I was writing the book, what I realized
was that our management practices, in fact,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.190
once had a function.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.290
There was a reason behind the things that
we were doing.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.190
And that was because the assembly lines back
in the early 1900’s was the way of organizing

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.230
people to make sure that everybody showed
up on time so that everybody was there to

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.070
actually do repeatable work on an assembly
line.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.750
So it was all about repeatability, it was
about precision, about defining roles so that

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.190
people could do them over and over and over
again.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.290
So all of those things we indicative management
practices and that’s where this came from.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.290
This was a world of manual labor.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.130
It was a world of manual work.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.550
It was a world in which people were far less
educated than they are today.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.120
So back in the early 1900’s only six percent
of the general population had a high school

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.700
diploma.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.000
Six percent.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.760
Now we’re up to around 70 percent that have
high school diplomas.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.620
And we actually have 30 percent of our population
has college degrees and ten percent has post

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.090
graduate degrees.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.510
So we now have more people with masters and
PhD’s and other post graduate degrees than

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.290
we did people with high school diplomas in
the early 1900’s.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.390
That’s a huge difference yet we’re still
treating people like they need to show up

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.500
and be babysat, more or less.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.460
But where we are now is also vastly different
with respect to the work we’re doing.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.420
So rather than thinking about work as repeatable
tasks that we need to learn and do at high

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.270
precision, the opposite is, in fact, true.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.280
We’re in a space where we actually need
to be creative in the way that we think about

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.400
our work.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.270
Where the solution should never be the same
solution twice, we’re problem solvers now.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.860
We have to think innovatively about how we
do our work.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.890
So that’s the vast difference between it.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.760
And when I thought about those differences
and then factored in our new reality which

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.570
is basically that work happens 24 hours a
day.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.500
The information, as we know, does not stop.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.360
We have e-mails, I mean; I remember my life
at Google with teams literally sprinkled across

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.460
the planet where emails would pour in every
hour of every day.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.860
And that was great.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.520
In some ways that was really cool to see that
sort of work environment but at the same time

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.300
it posed a conundrum because you’re basically
never off.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.240
You’re always on.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.950
So it’s hard for us to really manage that
especially if we’re trying to shove ourselves

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.740
into a nine to five work day.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.389
This is essentially what people’s lives
tend to look like in your typical corporations.

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.370
So of course there never seem to be enough
hours in the day.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:10.890
But if we look at this in a different way,
if we question the assumption behind this,

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.900
there are 24 different hours across which
we can sleep, work, play and recover but the

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.250
vast majority of the companies and families
adhere to the 9 to 5 work day, 11 to 6 sleep

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.230
cycle, two- day weekend and how we fit in
any kind of play and recovery is anyone’s

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.230
guess.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.200
So I saw this as an opportunity to say, “Why
don’t we rethink this?”

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.780
What if we came up with new rules?

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.930
What if we embraced our reality instead of
fighting that reality to figure out how to

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.150
be in box zero all the time and come up with
all kinds of productivity fixes?

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.020
What if we just rethought the whole thing?

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.020
What would that look like?

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.960
Well, during my time at Google I really felt
like I got a glimpse of what that was.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.900
When I started here, all the sudden I was
free to be the night person that I naturally

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.900
am.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.780
All the sudden I was free to do work in the
way that suited me the best.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.889
And what mattered was the impact.

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:06.330
What mattered was what I could bring to the
organization and the results that I could

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.330
produce.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.330
That’s it.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.460
It didn’t matter when I showed up in the
morning.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.430
It didn’t matter what clothes that I wore.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.800
And that kind of freedom was absolutely and
profoundly life changing for me as I’m sure

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.360
it was for many of you guys, especially if
you’d had jobs prior to Google.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:28.639
So what I’d like to do is share the lessons
that I distilled out of this that essentially

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:29.800
are part of the book.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.729
And I came up with five guiding principles.

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:39.789
I realized that trying to put new rules to
replace old rules was kind of, you know, not

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.789
the point at all.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.490
We don’t need more rules we need fewer rules.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.259
And so instead, what I came up with were guiding
principles.

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:52.600
And the guiding principles suggest ways of
thinking about the work environment that embrace

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.920
the always on sort of reality but then really
frees us up to do things in a way that both

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.480
benefits us personally, but also the organizations
that we work for.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.559
It’s not a zero sum game.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:09.319
So, what are those five lessons?

00:09:09.319 --> 00:09:12.190
First of all, impact not activities.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.310
This is kind of an overarching one that I
think I wove into every single one of the

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.350
chapters.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:22.500
But the basic notion is that we have to think
about what impact we’re bringing rather

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.160
than fixate on the activities that people
are spending their time doing.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.050
So if you free people to focus on the impact
then the activities don’t matter.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:37.050
And one of the things I learned to ask, a
lot, was, “What problems are we trying to

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.510
solve?”

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.120
So one of the things that I love about Google
and I still it’s one of the most brilliant

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.160
mission statements on the planet is the mission
of organizing the world’s information and

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.839
making it universally accessible and useful.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:54.610
Every single Google employee can sight that
on demand and that means it’s a powerful

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.389
and sticking mission statement.

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:59.149
But furthermore, it’s a problem based mission
statement.

00:09:59.149 --> 00:10:02.389
It’s a problem that we’re trying to solve
for.

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:09.050
So this actually translates, not only to the
organization, but also to individuals.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:14.990
So I got an email from somebody that read
my book and she wrote kind of a book back

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:20.199
to me which was cute and really nice, but
in it she talked about reading this book and

00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:25.230
thinking completely differently about her
role in the organization that she’s at.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.100
So she was hired to start a library.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.180
She had a librarian’s degree and that was
her job.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.029
But starting a library is an activity.

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:41.399
And when she read the book she realized she
had a huge opportunity to rethink her job

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:43.550
in more problem based terms.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:50.769
So instead, she now thinks about her job as
information flow, information creation, dissemination,

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:55.980
consumption and now she sees all kinds of
opportunities to completely expand beyond

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.860
what she hired to do but to solve the problem
in really unique ways.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.519
So that was a huge lesson for me and it’s
something that I continue to apply to everything

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:05.519
that I do.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:09.519
What problems are we trying to solve.

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:14.300
The second lesson is, “Energy not schedules.”

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.290
When I started at Google, what I’ve always
known about myself is that I’m not a morning

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.040
person, at all.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.529
And when I was actually able to set my own
schedule, what I realized is that I gravitated

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:28.769
towards coming in around ten o’clock a.m.

00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:31.619
And, in fact, in my current job, that’s
what I do.

00:11:31.619 --> 00:11:32.930
I don’t show up before ten.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:33.930
I know myself.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:39.559
It’ll be junk hours, I’ll get nothing
done but by paying attention to my own personal

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:46.220
energy and instead of fixating on schedules
which are most of the time based on, kind

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.939
of, arbitrary sorts of deadlines, I could
follow my personal energy.

00:11:50.939 --> 00:11:56.660
I could follow the energy of projects in terms
of how they might naturally play within the

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.199
organization rather than trying to force those
things.

00:11:59.199 --> 00:12:04.790
So paying attention to energy was a huge thing
for me and it freed me up to be more productive

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:10.910
during the hours I was here and to feel like
I could live a sane life, in terms of my schedule.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:16.119
I recently stumbled across a new book which
I haven’t read yet but I got the concept

00:12:16.119 --> 00:12:17.119
out of it.

00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:18.540
It’s called Social Jet Lag.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.779
And I never even knew there was a term for
this.

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:27.749
But social jet lag is this notion that we
all have our own, sort of, chronotype.

00:12:27.749 --> 00:12:34.230
And a chronotype defines when you naturally
gravitate toward going to bed and how long

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.730
you sleep.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.779
No surprise, everyone’s different in this
regard.

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:45.131
So, for example, with my particular chronotype
I am, let’s see, the average hours that

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:51.990
I sleep is about 8, divide that by 2, that’s
4, my free form bed time is about 1 o’clock

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.949
which means my midsleep is 1 o’clock plus
4, that’s 5.

00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:57.850
Alright, so my chronotype is 5.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.519
Well, what does that mean?

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:06.179
This is the distribution of chronotypes throughout
the population which I thought was quite interesting.

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:07.179
I’m kind of normal.

00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:08.980
I’m right in the middle.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:15.350
So four and a half seems to be where most
people fall, well the top of the curve, so

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.389
to speak, and 5, not far off of that.

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:23.040
So I thought, wow, I’m really not as different
as I thought that I was.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.529
But what is interesting is if we look at the
typical 9 to 5 schedule, if the top of that

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:37.600
bell curve is 4.5, I kind of backwards calculated
this, and the median work time is 9 a.m.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.020
And that’s being generous, a lot of companies
say 8, ya know?

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.550
Let’s assume you have to get up at 7:30
to get ready and commute in by that time,

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:51.910
then basically the 9 to 5 work schedule is
suited best for people that need 6 hours of

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.360
sleep on average and like to go to bed at
1:30 in the morning.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.199
Do any of you fit that profile?

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:00.199
Anyone?

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:01.199
Anyone?

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:04.829
No one, zero, for the record.

00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:06.920
So this seems kind of silly.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:12.720
If we think about the ideal reality for someone
whose median is 4.5 needing 8 hours of sleep,

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.459
then in fact, the best time for people to
show up for work is around 10.

00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:21.749
But I think the point here is we all have
our own unique chronotype.

00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:25.999
We have the numbers of hours that are required
for us are vastly different.

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.420
So why can’t we just show up when we need
to?

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.670
What a realization.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:35.660
So that, to me, was a pretty profound vocabulary
to put around this in a way that freed me

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:41.779
up to think about my needs and my energy and
regulating that is best for me.

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:45.819
So the third is “strengths not job slots.”

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:52.509
&gt;&gt;Julie Clow: So one of the things that I
loved about being at Google is that we focused

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:57.739
so much on hiring people that we feel belong
in the Google culture.

00:14:57.739 --> 00:14:58.739
And that’s huge.

00:14:58.739 --> 00:15:02.149
And, in fact, the organization that I’m
at now is the same way.

00:15:02.149 --> 00:15:07.079
We hire people because we feel like they belong
in the community.

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:12.519
And when you do that, then you can bring people
into the organization, you can embrace them

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:17.759
and set them free to do work in the best way
to solve problems for the company.

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:21.019
Because if people buy into the mission, if
they’re excited by the work you’re doing,

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:23.040
there’s no need to babysit them.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:28.540
So this is a profound difference between the
way that typical companies do that which is

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.940
to think about job slots and experience and
the right resume and if they have the right

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.119
things, check, check, check, bring them into
the organization.

00:15:36.119 --> 00:15:38.350
But who cares if they’re a culture fit.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.699
And then that breeds all kinds of problems.

00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:45.430
And that’s why many companies don’t trust
their people from the start.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.949
The right thing’s not everything.

00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:51.459
So this speaks directly of that fact that
we are in a state of overwhelm.

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:58.119
That there is too much information, too many
ideas, too much to do, so we have to get better

00:15:58.119 --> 00:16:02.269
at figuring out what the right things are
and not everything.

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:07.120
And one of the things that I loved about Google
was in almost every conversation around goals

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.279
and priorities, somebody would ask the question,
“What project should we stop doing?”

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:18.029
And I thought that was a really profound question
that surfaced quite often, that was a really

00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:20.809
important question to ask.

00:16:20.809 --> 00:16:23.699
And then finally, “grassroots not top down.”

00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:28.509
This is where I really saw, first hand, the
power of collective intelligence.

00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:32.939
When you set people free to make decisions,
especially as a group, then you get some pretty

00:16:32.939 --> 00:16:34.410
amazing stuff.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:40.319
And I loved the fact that, you know, our TGIF’s
were built around the Google moderator tool

00:16:40.319 --> 00:16:44.579
where people could ask any question but then
we’d vote up the ones that were most important

00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:45.579
to us.

00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:49.430
And I loved bureaucracy busters every year
where people would find opportunities to flush

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.350
out bad processes.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.199
All of that was about collective intelligence.

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:57.309
And it was about leveraging that within the
organization.

00:16:57.309 --> 00:17:01.800
And when I saw the power of that, it made
me thing that it made me think that how underutilized

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.930
that tool is in many other organizations because
they don’t understand the mechanics of collective

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.790
intelligence.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:17.430
So these were the lessons that I suggested
in my book for individuals, managers or organizations

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.430
to implement.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.630
And I suggest various ways of doing that.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.579
But in thinking about this presentation, then
I pushed myself a little bit further to think

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:29.910
what if we questioned all of our management
institutions?

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:34.900
So, even at Google, there are things that
we still hold on to.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.240
I say we.
[laughs]

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.660
&gt;&gt;Julie Clow: That you all hold onto that
the organization still holds onto and I thought

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.640
what if we question some of these assumptions?

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.510
And tried to figure out what was behind these
institutions and how we might think differently

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.630
about other approaches.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.700
So, what if?

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.240
What if we ditched job descriptions, job requirements
and job roles?

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.020
What would that look like?

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:08.360
The reason that I bring this up is because
the point of job descriptions and requirements

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.090
or roles is to make the hiring process more
efficient.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.820
Because if you can make good guesses about
what skills somebody needs to do a particular

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.550
job, that makes the whole resume sifting process
a lot easier.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.560
You know what you’re looking for in an interview.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.020
Of course there’s still the cultural component
but when you bring someone in, what’s the

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:33.900
point of keeping them in one strict bubble
around the work that you’d like them to

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.060
do?

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.410
So what inspired me was a story I read a couple
of weeks ago.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:47.890
I was in Seattle and I picked up the local
paper and they had this profile on this man,

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:53.010
Eric Wahl was his name, who went to work for
the University of Washington.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.540
He’s a creative writer.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.130
He has a Masters degree in creative writing.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:01.550
And he went to work for the surplus store.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.550
How does that work?

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.050
I mean, what could he possibly bring to that
job?

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:10.330
But what was interesting is he’s completely
transformed the organization, or the little

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.330
department.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.990
They sell extra chairs, desks, lamps, whatever,
whatever happens to be in the university that

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.210
they don’t need any more they sell through
the surplus store.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.510
So what did this guy do?

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.980
He applied his creative writing skills; he
took the initiative to apply his creative

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:29.150
writing skills, because he thought that the
website that advertised their products was

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.230
utterly boring.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.250
So here’s a sample of one of his write ups.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.760
[pause]

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:43.860
&gt;&gt;Julie Clow: It’s brilliant, a timestamp
machine.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.140
Who needs a timestamp machine?

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:54.400
And yet the guy makes up these funky, hilarious
descriptions that makes people want to browse

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.400
the website.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:01.630
And, in fact, this department at the University
of Washington, logged $900,000 dollars worth

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.580
of sales.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:08.160
Practically tripled their twitter following
and people line up out the door to get into

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.460
the surplus store to buy their stuff.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.260
Absolutely amazing, now again, if you thought
about a traditional sort of person to take

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.660
on that role, you would look for somebody
with sales experience, with marketing experience

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.370
and all these other things, but a creative
writer?

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:27.990
Not so much, and yet a creative writer applied
to a surplus store equals something pretty

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.380
phenomenal.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.940
So it just inspired me to think outside the
box.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.610
So what lessons could we take from that?

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.060
One, I think it’s important, I’m constantly
learning this.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.650
I started learning this at Google but I think
it’s a lifelong journey, its being true

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.570
to our authentic selves.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:47.570
Who are we?

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.570
What are our skills?

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.410
What strengths and talents can we bring to
the organization and how can we think about

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.950
using them in really creative ways?

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:00.650
That was something that I learned at Google
but it’s something that I continually push

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.650
myself in.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:05.890
If I’m not happy in the role I’m in, it’s
my own fault for not figuring out a way to

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.890
make it better.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:11.020
It’s my own fault for not figuring out how
I can better apply my talents to the work

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.160
that I’m doing.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.760
But the second lesson here is to build diverse
and unexpected teams.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.260
So take a chance on people who have quirky
degrees or a different point of view.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.960
I think that the more diverse that we have
the better the opportunity to innovate and

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:32.170
to think differently about the problems that
we’re trying to solve.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:38.130
So two, what if we ditched working hours,
milestones, meetings and vacation time?

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:44.391
Some of these things are still true at Google
but I think there’s a huge difference, some

00:21:44.391 --> 00:21:47.830
organizations have taken this much further,
let’s just put it that way.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:53.440
So, for example, vacation time, saying take
vacation when you need vacation we’re not

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.020
gonna track it.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.330
Many companies have done this.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:03.760
Best Buy is one in particular who instituted
what they ended up calling the “results

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:09.750
only work environment” And the results only
work environment is simple.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:14.010
Each person is free to do whatever they want
whenever they want as long as the work gets

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.300
done.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.000
So what does this force?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.470
It forces people to be super crystal clear
about problems they’re trying to solve and

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:27.800
then holding people accountable for actually
doing those things and the rest doesn’t

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.800
matter.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.280
So this is really impact, not activities taken
to an extreme when you literally do not care

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.560
if people show up to work, it’s just that
they get the job done.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.660
So the results only work environment is actually
been spread to many other organizations.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:49.230
There’s a pair of women that used to work
at Best Buy who are now consulting on this

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.830
with a group called Culture RX and they’re
a pretty phenomenal group and they’re coaching

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:58.430
these companies to move toward activity based
work environment to results only work environments

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:03.950
with pretty phenomenal success.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:09.860
So lessons here that we can all learn and
take away is to be clear about the difference

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.450
between true urgency and false urgency.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:19.080
And this is a hard lesson because we all think
that the things we’re working on are true

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.430
urgency.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:26.600
But true urgency really is about the needs
of our customers and important deadlines that

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.430
drive the business itself.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:33.510
True urgency isn’t about fake deadlines
we set to motivate ourselves.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.750
I think that’s well and good and, in fact,
setting those goals is important but at the

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.860
end of every quarter when everybody’s scrambling
around to meet their own deadlines, those

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.870
are really false urgency deadlines.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:49.890
And when we impose those false urgency deadlines
on each other, then what we’re doing is

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:54.160
creating a lot of confusion about what really
matters.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.410
The second piece to this is to learn to be
a quitter.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:01.000
And this is a hard lesson because, especially
with over achievers.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.950
We’re programmed to work hard and achieve
and if we quit something that’s a sign of

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:07.950
failure.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:14.240
But, in fact, if we really are focused on
impact and results then we have to get a lot

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.470
better at quitting things that aren’t working
that don’t have as much impact, that aren’t

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:24.780
working for the organization in general and
that, in fact, is a skill that everybody can

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.490
hone and get a lot better at.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:31.390
But it also requires learning to say no which
is kind of the corollary to that and is very

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:35.690
difficult to do.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.180
So what if we ditched managers?

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.450
What would that look like?

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:48.060
So if you think about it, managers, the role
of managers is to hold people accountable,

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:54.360
to evaluate people’s performance, to give
people feedback on how they’re doing and

00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:00.640
to figure out how they should be compensated,
more or less right?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.310
So if we step back and say, “Okay, what
if we did this a different way?”

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:10.150
What if we got rid of the manager layer of
things to do this and instituted different

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.060
ways of accomplishing the very same thing.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.980
Again, what problem are we trying to solve?

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.430
Well, what problem we’re trying to solve
is the accountability piece, the feedback

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.980
piece and getting things done in the organization.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.210
There have been a couple of organizations
that have done this.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.350
The most famous, though, is Morning Star.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:33.600
So this is essentially a company that processes
tomatoes in various ways.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.120
So we’re kind of back to the whole manual
labor thing.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:42.340
And yet, these guys decided very early on
that they did not want management layers in

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.030
the organization.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:51.230
So what they did instead is establish something
called CLOUs; Colleague Letters of Understanding.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:56.210
And these colleague letters of understanding
start with this is my personal mission statement.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:01.080
So every individual has to define who they
are, what value they bring to the organization

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.380
and what their role is, roughly speaking.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:11.870
And then they commit to being accountable
for a whole series of things within the organization.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:17.110
But they do this by determining who they need
to work with the most.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:21.790
And so every year, everybody sits down and
does this and negotiates with their teammates

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:25.500
to say this is what I wanna be accountable
for, how about you?

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.900
And so it’s a whole negotiation process
to figure out who has the right strengths,

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.760
who has the energy, who has the interest in
these kinds of things, what you are excited

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:39.840
to be accountable for and those clues are
how people are evaluated.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.080
Not by managers, but by each other.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.070
So, again, it’s all peer based.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.960
So the peer feedback is a very critical component
to this.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:54.370
In fact, I was looking at one of their sample
CLOUs and safety is a really great example.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.700
So who holds people accountable for safety?

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.140
Well, if you think about it, the best people
to hold people accountable for safety are

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.410
your peers because your peers are the ones
that are seeing you in the process of either

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.850
wearing your safety helmet or not.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:13.180
So by peers being held accountable to hold
each other accountable then the feedback becomes

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.030
much more frequent and open and honest with
each other.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:22.140
So if somebody’s not doing well it is the
responsibility of the peers to give them feedback

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.470
and say, “You’re not holding up your end
of the bargain.”

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:28.460
And really being honest and forthright about
those things.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.520
So when you have the management layer it kind
of divorces us from the whole process of giving

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.710
each other feedback in real time in ways that
people kind of need it.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:46.100
So the lessons here are that one we can do
a much better job of articulating our value

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.210
through the lens of other people.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:53.700
So if you think about what is my role in the
organization, how can I contribute to my teammates?

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.570
What will be of value to them and the organization?

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.030
That’s one it’s kind of a way of saying
what’s your personal brand but I think in

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.350
a much more functional definition.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.410
It sits a lot better with me.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.650
And then the second thing is giving each other
honest and timely feedback.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:15.230
Not leaving it to the managers to necessarily
to this but doing it yourself because you’re

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.250
the one working with your colleagues.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:21.500
So it’s a really cool way of thinking about
it and challenging your assumptions behind

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:28.270
what managers are all about and what role
they play.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:33.780
What if we ditched teams and headcount allocation?

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.850
Chaos right?

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:40.750
You kind of need teams to form and get things
done and focus on priorities and those kinds

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:45.650
of things, but there is an organization that
decided to try it a different way.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:49.190
It’s a game company called Valve.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:53.840
And in their employee handbook, which was
very recently leaked, I think it was intentionally

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.090
put out there, but it’s a really interesting
organization and I highly recommend that people

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.850
read the handbook.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.200
How do they decide on work?

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.520
Could they bring somebody into the organization,
again, based on cultural fit and belonging

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:14.470
and they say to them, “Go find a project
that you can add the most value to now.”

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.640
And somebody might come in and say, “Well
I have a really strong background in x, I

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.860
think I should contribute by x.”

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:25.430
And I told the story of one employee who did
that and they said, “Well we already have

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:29.570
people working on x for this team so you’re
not gonna add value there.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.200
It’s already happening.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.430
Go find someplace else that you can add value
who doesn’t already have people that are

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.430
contributing that.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:41.240
“And so they actually encourage people to
go around and talk to people as much as possible.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.860
What projects are going on?

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.920
What might I be a part of?

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.920
Where can I add value?

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.550
What’s important to the company?

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:50.370
Not just short term but long term as well.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.800
And then they make the decisions.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:59.170
So they literally put all of the desks on
wheels so that teams can self organize and

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.020
move their desks around and move closer to
one another or group people in a different

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.020
way.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.020
And so there are teams.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:10.060
And, in fact, there are actually team leads
but they’re very informal kinds of definitions

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.900
and they change often.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:17.440
So the whole point is that people can self
organize and reorganize in ways so that people

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.510
can work on projects that they’re excited
about that add value to the company.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:28.270
The founder, Gabe, said, “Are there things
that I wish people would be working on that

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.650
aren’t?

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.030
Yes.”

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.530
Period, yes but he’s okay with that.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.810
He still believes that this model in which
you’re embracing a little bit of the chaos

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.800
is much better than him telling people what
they should be working on.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.940
So this is collective intelligence and grass
roots to the extreme.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:52.240
It’s pretty fun to think about actually.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.700
So what are the lessons that we can take away
from this?

00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.210
One, focus on the value you can uniquely bring
right now.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.330
And that can change over time.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:06.970
So you might add value in one way now but
then in six months it might be in a very different

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:12.230
way that you can add value but constantly
asking that question and reevaluating that.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.559
And then two, trust in the chaos.

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:19.030
Know that when we set people free to do the
work, to find the value, there’s gonna be

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.030
a little bit of chaos.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:23.440
There’s gonna be a little bit of disorganization.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.480
Because Valve has all their desks on wheels
it’s kind of tough to know where anyone

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.950
is gonna be at any given time.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:34.600
So they actually have a system set up so they
can tell, virtually, where everybody is located

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.980
so that they have real time information about
where to find people.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:43.920
So you have to mitigate some of craziness
and chaos that goes around that but, in general,

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:50.470
embracing and trusting in that chaos that
ultimately the value will rise to the top.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:55.620
Finally, what if we ditched Power Point and
pitches?

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.350
So what is this all about?

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:04.670
This is the difference between companies that
are idea judging companies versus companies

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:08.330
that are idea testing companies.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:16.270
And I didn’t really grasp the distinction
between the two until I met the co-founder

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.540
of a company called Noom.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:25.550
It’s actually a former Googler who started
this company to build these Android apps.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:30.170
This one’s called Noom, there’s another
one called cardio trainer that I absolutely

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.280
love.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.840
And I actually went to have lunch with them.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.320
So they’re this great little start up.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.240
They have about 20 people, they have their
own private chef, I mean, it was just truly

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.470
a fun little experience.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:47.400
But what struck me, in the way that they run
their company, is they spend zero time debating

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.520
ideas.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.890
They have invested in an infrastructure that
makes it possible to test virtually everything.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:58.760
And they use Prudhoe typing type of methods,
which we’re familiar with here at Google.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.990
But they use really creative ways of testing
everything.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:05.610
And this goes down even to their management
practices.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:09.990
So they’re playing around with how often
they switch people around in projects, they’re

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.990
testing that.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.540
So 90 days they’ll try this and they’ll
see how did that work?

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.590
And then they change it up a bit and they
test something else.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:22.940
So their whole culture is if you have an idea,
great, go test it.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.140
And when everyone is free to test their ideas
then it doesn’t become political.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:33.410
It’s not about power point and pitches and
how you state the numbers in a way that sounds

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:37.150
convincing that your idea might, in fact,
be the best one.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:44.080
And, again, it’s challenging I think, you
know, Google is a testing culture but to the

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.070
nth degree is this company and even thinking
about what I do.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.890
I’m in organizational development.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.770
I don’t write applications.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:57.960
So when you think about testing ideas for
applications versus testing ideas for organizations,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.420
it’s slightly different and yet, there all
ways of testing these things.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:08.560
And to force myself to think in that way has
been a really interesting revelation.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.319
So what are the lessons here?

00:34:10.319 --> 00:34:16.620
Test everything first and then use something
else like Google Docs of Prezi to actually

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.620
present your data.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.429
I’m kind of partial to Prezi right now.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.200
But test everything.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.990
Test everything in creative ways.

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:32.550
And rather than trying to judge each other’s
ideas just use the data to tell you the answers.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:40.669
So I heard Jim Collins speak about a week
ago and he talked about a personal hedgehog.

00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:45.920
So in his book Good to Great he talks about
the hedgehog concept for companies in terms

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.200
of where they can be world class at, that
drives the economic engine that everybody’s

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.870
passionate about.

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:57.240
And he translated this to a person hedgehog
which I thought was a really phenomenal way

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.150
of summing up everything that I’ve talked
about today.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:04.020
But what is at the intersection of, one, what
you’re passionate about.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:10.220
And that’s not enough because I’m passionate
about surfing but I will never become a professional

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.850
surfer, to my chagrin.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:17.100
Two, what you are genetically coded to do.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:22.340
I thought I was good at math until I took
math classes in college and saw the people

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.920
who were really good at math.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.010
I am not genetically coded to do math.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.680
There are people who are.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.290
I know that that’s not my strength.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:36.190
But there are things that I am genetically
coded to do that I’m also passionate about.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:41.590
And if you put those two things together with
the third which is what can you create that

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:45.380
is of value to society and to other people?

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.900
That is your personal hedgehog.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.701
That’s the sweet spot of things that you
can do that’s gonna give you joy, bring

00:35:51.701 --> 00:35:59.400
value to the organization and essentially,
hopefully, lead to your professional success.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.100
But one more thing; don’t forget to have
fun.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:07.310
And I think that is truly the most important
lesson that I took away from working at Google

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:12.720
and that I will always be passionate about
in life is; how do you make work feel like

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.720
play?

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.990
One of my favorite authors is Martha Beck
and I love this quote from her.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:22.710
“I’ve mentioned the idea of using the
word play to replace the word work.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:28.080
If you have no way of feeling playful doing
your work, get different work.”

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:34.700
I have this quote in the book and I didn’t
know if it would resonate with other people

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.050
but I got a LinkedIn invitation the other
day from somebody, you know, your standard

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:44.510
LinkedIn invitation and I would like to connect
with you, I read my book and I quit my job.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.510
[laughter]

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:51.040
&gt;&gt;Julie Clow: So her message was basically
that she couldn’t find a way to be playful

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.080
at work.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.700
And she couldn’t buy into the mission of
the organization and realized that it wasn’t

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.990
a good, you know, she didn’t belong in that
organization.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:04.340
And so, ultimately, she made the decision
to quit to find work that is more meaningful

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.560
to her.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.450
And thankfully, Google provides an amazing
place that where people can feel playful doing

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:16.330
their work and my hope and my vision for the
world is that everybody can eventually get

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:17.330
to that place.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:24.730
Where organizations are not set up to be dreary
and bland and built to essentially create

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:25.730
conformity.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:32.570
But rather, to pull out of people their deepest
levels of talent and enthusiasm and joy toward

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:34.740
the things that we’re doing.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.369
So thank you guys, very much.

00:37:37.369 --> 00:37:38.810
[applause]

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:44.360
&gt;&gt;Julie Clow: Here’s my information.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.360
Follow me on Twitter.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.530
I know most of you any way but thank you guys
for coming.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:51.120
It means a lot and it has been wonderful to
be back at Google.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.090
Thank you.

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:54.880
Questions?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:01.640
&gt;&gt;male #1: So you mentioned the importance
of pure feedback and evaluating work and,

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.460
as you know, that’s something we do here.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.840
But the challenge is always the negative feedback.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.230
It’s very hard to give negative feedback
to your peers.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:15.070
Does the fact that we also have managers do
evaluations here sort of force us to pass

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.650
off the dirty work on them?

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.890
Or did you find like in a place like Morning
Star, people are willing to give the negative

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.560
feedback because there isn’t that safety
valve?

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.030
&gt;&gt;Julie Clow: Well, I think you hit on it
exactly which is it is tough to give negative

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.030
feedback.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:32.980
So one, if we’re not in the habit of doing
it then we tend to feel compelled to give

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.850
negative feedback versus positive feedback.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:39.720
And so, if all we’re doing is giving each
other negative feedback, that’s not a good

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720
scenario.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.860
But if we get in the habit of giving frequent
feedback I think it becomes a lot easier to

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.200
be authentic and flowing in terms of the kind
of feedback that we give.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.070
But I think, definitely, having managers in
place does provide a bit of a crutch where

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.560
we aren’t flexing that muscle.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.180
And we feel like we can give feedback in other
round about ways and leave it to the managers

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.380
to give the hard feedback to people.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.340
But if you think about it when you have somebody
who’s a poor performer on your team, it

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:10.350
makes everybody’s lives miserable, including
that person that isn’t doing well.

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:14.840
And when you set up a peer feedback sort of
system then it makes it so much easier for

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.250
people to flush that out and keep each other
accountable and give that real time feedback.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:22.980
So where I haven’t experienced it first
hand, only through what I’ve read, I can

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:29.250
only imagine that it just creates an environment
where that feedback is expected and welcomed

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:35.170
and, you know, a healthy sort of thing rather
than being toxic or tough to do.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:40.619
&gt;&gt;male #2: So I really liked your foundational
principles.

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:44.031
They, we see all of them here I think.

00:39:44.031 --> 00:39:48.736
When I think of a person of traditional companies
some person in a leadership position, some

00:39:48.736 --> 00:39:54.070
total of them are probably terrified of them
all together to keep them from running in

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.070
the other direction.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:40:00.690
You have one or two that you think are most
impactful to them potentially that you usually

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:01.690
start with?

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:06.410
&gt;&gt;Julie Clow: Yeah, that’s a really excellent
point and, in fact, I most often bring this

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:11.920
up when I’m talking to audiences that these
concepts feel foreign, is that fear is a really

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.910
huge driver and I completely understand it.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:19.150
Because if you’re in an organization where
things are working, you’re making money

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.630
and for the most part the organization is
working well but there might be indicators,

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:26.109
maybe retention isn’t as good as you’d
like it to be or whatever, why go through

00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:28.090
the process of changing all this?

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.760
You know, why fix what isn’t broken?

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.890
At least that people think.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:39.420
But the point is that those organizations
may be good and good is the enemy of great,

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.590
as Jim Collins says.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.390
I’m a big fan of his.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:48.010
So if organizations wanna be great then they
have to address the fear behind doing it.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:54.040
And I think that, that advice that I give
people is, go back to the grass roots idea

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.220
of testing everything.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.950
So don’t think that you have to change an
entire organization in one fell swoop.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:04.869
But rather, think about little things that
you could do to test things out.

00:41:04.869 --> 00:41:07.410
If we did this differently what would happen?

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:11.700
You know, let’s try no dress codes for a
week, for a month or whatever and see what

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.700
happens.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.710
You know, testing little things and being
okay with the fact that there might be failure

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.340
along the way but that you’ll learn as you
move on.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:27.230
And I think that, think really small and test
everything gives people the comfort of knowing

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:30.300
that you don’t have to try to flip everything
all at one time.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.971
And can kind of follow with the success of
it.

00:41:31.971 --> 00:41:35.840
So that’s really the number one piece of
advice I give.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.180
[pause]

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:42.400
&gt;&gt;Julie Clow: Okay, thank you guys very much.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:42.599
[applause]
