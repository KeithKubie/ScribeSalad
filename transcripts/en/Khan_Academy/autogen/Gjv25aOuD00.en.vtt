00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.210
 
let's do another example where we have

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220
let's do another example where we have
 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.150
let's do another example where we have
some data we want to fit a line to that

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160
some data we want to fit a line to that
 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.179
some data we want to fit a line to that
data and maybe use that to estimate some

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189
data and maybe use that to estimate some
 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.879
data and maybe use that to estimate some
of the some of the data that we didn't

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889
of the some of the data that we didn't
 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.290
of the some of the data that we didn't
collect so to speak

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
collect so to speak
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.910
collect so to speak
so the first thing they asked us well

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920
so the first thing they asked us well
 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.499
so the first thing they asked us well
let's look at the chart first of all

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
let's look at the chart first of all
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.660
let's look at the chart first of all
this is birth year they started in 1930

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670
this is birth year they started in 1930
 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.700
this is birth year they started in 1930
they go all the way up to the year 2000

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710
they go all the way up to the year 2000
 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.830
they go all the way up to the year 2000
and in increments of 10 years and they

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
and in increments of 10 years and they
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.200
and in increments of 10 years and they
tell us the life expectancy in years so

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
tell us the life expectancy in years so
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390
tell us the life expectancy in years so
a good thing for us I think this is the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
a good thing for us I think this is the
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.460
a good thing for us I think this is the
United States and the life expectancy

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
United States and the life expectancy
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.070
United States and the life expectancy
has been steadily increasing and the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
has been steadily increasing and the
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.420
has been steadily increasing and the
first thing they asked us to do is to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
first thing they asked us to do is to
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.639
first thing they asked us to do is to
make a scatter plot of the data and I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
make a scatter plot of the data and I
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.650
make a scatter plot of the data and I
did this on excel ahead of time and this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
did this on excel ahead of time and this
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.639
did this on excel ahead of time and this
is what I got as you can see in 1930 was

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649
is what I got as you can see in 1930 was
 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.830
is what I got as you can see in 1930 was
59.7 in 1930 it was 59.7 in 1940 it was

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
59.7 in 1930 it was 59.7 in 1940 it was
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.500
59.7 in 1930 it was 59.7 in 1940 it was
62 point 9 these blue dots are just

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
62 point 9 these blue dots are just
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.869
62 point 9 these blue dots are just
plotting each of these each of these

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
plotting each of these each of these
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.720
plotting each of these each of these
data points in 1930 is 57.9 it's that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
data points in 1930 is 57.9 it's that
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.099
data points in 1930 is 57.9 it's that
data point right there 1940 it was 62

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
data point right there 1940 it was 62
 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380
data point right there 1940 it was 62
point 9 it's that data point right there

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
point 9 it's that data point right there
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.880
point 9 it's that data point right there
so I just went ahead and plotted all of

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
so I just went ahead and plotted all of
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.329
so I just went ahead and plotted all of
them and then I let Excel figure out a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
them and then I let Excel figure out a
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.560
them and then I let Excel figure out a
line of best fit and Excel I didn't go

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
line of best fit and Excel I didn't go
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.240
line of best fit and Excel I didn't go
into the math of how to do this we'll do

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
into the math of how to do this we'll do
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.460
into the math of how to do this we'll do
that in future videos that's out of the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
that in future videos that's out of the
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.770
that in future videos that's out of the
scope of an introductory algebra but the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
scope of an introductory algebra but the
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.990
scope of an introductory algebra but the
Excel figured out that the line of best

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
Excel figured out that the line of best
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.469
Excel figured out that the line of best
fit the line that goes that is least far

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
fit the line that goes that is least far
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.120
fit the line that goes that is least far
away from all of these points that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
away from all of these points that
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190
away from all of these points that
minimizes the distance from all of these

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
minimizes the distance from all of these
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.080
minimizes the distance from all of these
points is y is equal to 0.23 9 5 X minus

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090
points is y is equal to 0.23 9 5 X minus
 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.840
points is y is equal to 0.23 9 5 X minus
400 0.99 and I'm not going to go into

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
400 0.99 and I'm not going to go into
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520
400 0.99 and I'm not going to go into
what r-squared is just yet but it's a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
what r-squared is just yet but it's a
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.620
what r-squared is just yet but it's a
measure of how good this line is

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
measure of how good this line is
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.490
measure of how good this line is
actually fitting so let's use that let's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
actually fitting so let's use that let's
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.139
actually fitting so let's use that let's
use this table let's use our line of

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
use this table let's use our line of
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.120
use this table let's use our line of
best fit to answer the rest of their

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
best fit to answer the rest of their
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.940
best fit to answer the rest of their
questions so the second question is use

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
questions so the second question is use
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.350
questions so the second question is use
the line of best fit to estimate the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
the line of best fit to estimate the
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.560
the line of best fit to estimate the
life expectancy of a person born in 1955

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
life expectancy of a person born in 1955
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.600
life expectancy of a person born in 1955
so we have two options we could just

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
so we have two options we could just
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.959
so we have two options we could just
eyeball it 1955 is right there so if you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
eyeball it 1955 is right there so if you
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.080
eyeball it 1955 is right there so if you
go up from 1955 you're gonna hit the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
go up from 1955 you're gonna hit the
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359
go up from 1955 you're gonna hit the
line of best fit let me do it in a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
line of best fit let me do it in a
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.380
line of best fit let me do it in a
different color because that's the same

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
different color because that's the same
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.760
different color because that's the same
colors the dots in 1955 you're going to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
colors the dots in 1955 you're going to
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.059
colors the dots in 1955 you're going to
hit the line of best fit right there

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069
hit the line of best fit right there
 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.369
hit the line of best fit right there
and if I were to just eyeball it it

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379
and if I were to just eyeball it it
 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.580
and if I were to just eyeball it it
looks like it's right there this is one

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
looks like it's right there this is one
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.410
looks like it's right there this is one
two three four five so these are

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
two three four five so these are
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.830
two three four five so these are
increments of two so it looks like about

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840
increments of two so it looks like about
 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.569
increments of two so it looks like about
77 years so 1955 it looks roughly equal

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579
77 years so 1955 it looks roughly equal
 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.690
77 years so 1955 it looks roughly equal
to 77 no no no sorry 67 years it'd be

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
to 77 no no no sorry 67 years it'd be
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.930
to 77 no no no sorry 67 years it'd be
clear that look sounded suspicious a 67

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
clear that look sounded suspicious a 67
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180
clear that look sounded suspicious a 67
year life expectancy now we can use the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190
year life expectancy now we can use the
 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.160
year life expectancy now we can use the
equation of this line of best fit to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
equation of this line of best fit to
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.500
equation of this line of best fit to
come up with the exact value when X is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
come up with the exact value when X is
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.800
come up with the exact value when X is
equal to 1955 what is y what is the life

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
equal to 1955 what is y what is the life
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.300
equal to 1955 what is y what is the life
expectancy in years let's get our

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
expectancy in years let's get our
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.729
expectancy in years let's get our
calculator out for this actually let me

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
calculator out for this actually let me
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.280
calculator out for this actually let me
use let me use a graphing calculator for

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290
use let me use a graphing calculator for
 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.119
use let me use a graphing calculator for
this one right now so let me clear this

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129
this one right now so let me clear this
 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.119
this one right now so let me clear this
let me clear everything and then let's

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129
let me clear everything and then let's
 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.390
let me clear everything and then let's
just a punch in 1955 for X so we have

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400
just a punch in 1955 for X so we have
 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:13.309
just a punch in 1955 for X so we have
point two three nine five times 1955

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319
point two three nine five times 1955
 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.379
point two three nine five times 1955
that's our x value minus four hundred

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389
that's our x value minus four hundred
 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.069
that's our x value minus four hundred
point nine nine is equal to sixty seven

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079
point nine nine is equal to sixty seven
 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.879
point nine nine is equal to sixty seven
point two three so our line of best fit

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889
point two three so our line of best fit
 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.059
point two three so our line of best fit
gives us the exact answer of sixty seven

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069
gives us the exact answer of sixty seven
 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.520
gives us the exact answer of sixty seven
point two three years so our eyeballing

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530
point two three years so our eyeballing
 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.500
point two three years so our eyeballing
it wasn't that far off so that's what

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510
it wasn't that far off so that's what
 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.259
it wasn't that far off so that's what
our line of best fit would predict if we

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269
our line of best fit would predict if we
 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.479
our line of best fit would predict if we
assume that a linear model is a good

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489
assume that a linear model is a good
 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.789
assume that a linear model is a good
model to describe this data and all we

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799
model to describe this data and all we
 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.140
model to describe this data and all we
know right now are linear models so

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
know right now are linear models so
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.460
know right now are linear models so
that's what we will use and it actually

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470
that's what we will use and it actually
 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.839
that's what we will use and it actually
looks pretty good it looks seems like it

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849
looks pretty good it looks seems like it
 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.449
looks pretty good it looks seems like it
fits the data pretty pretty good let's

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
fits the data pretty pretty good let's
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.819
fits the data pretty pretty good let's
do the next part use linear

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829
do the next part use linear
 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.830
do the next part use linear
interpolation to estimate the life

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840
interpolation to estimate the life
 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.039
interpolation to estimate the life
expectancy of a person were in 1955 now

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049
expectancy of a person were in 1955 now
 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.789
expectancy of a person were in 1955 now
linear interpolation means let's take

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799
linear interpolation means let's take
 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.860
linear interpolation means let's take
the data points around 1955

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870
the data points around 1955
 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.800
the data points around 1955
so you have this data point from 1950

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810
so you have this data point from 1950
 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.649
so you have this data point from 1950
you have this data point from 1960 let's

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659
you have this data point from 1960 let's
 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.300
you have this data point from 1960 let's
draw a line between those two data

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
draw a line between those two data
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.159
draw a line between those two data
points and assume that the 1955 number

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169
points and assume that the 1955 number
 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.259
points and assume that the 1955 number
would be right in between on the line

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269
would be right in between on the line
 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.659
would be right in between on the line
would be right in between on the line

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669
would be right in between on the line
 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.490
would be right in between on the line
there now we could figure out the

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500
there now we could figure out the
 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.589
there now we could figure out the
equation of that line we have two points

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599
equation of that line we have two points
 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.440
equation of that line we have two points
we have the 1950 data and we have the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450
we have the 1950 data and we have the
 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.899
we have the 1950 data and we have the
1960 data we could figure out the slope

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909
1960 data we could figure out the slope
 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:27.890
1960 data we could figure out the slope
of the line we could

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900
of the line we could
 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.659
of the line we could
that's why intercept then we could

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669
that's why intercept then we could
 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.629
that's why intercept then we could
substitute 1955 in there but this is a

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639
substitute 1955 in there but this is a
 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.260
substitute 1955 in there but this is a
line and 1955 is right in between these

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270
line and 1955 is right in between these
 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.930
line and 1955 is right in between these
two points it's five from either one so

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940
two points it's five from either one so
 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.990
two points it's five from either one so
on this point right here that's on that

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000
on this point right here that's on that
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.790
on this point right here that's on that
linear interpolation on that orange will

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800
linear interpolation on that orange will
 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.770
linear interpolation on that orange will
just be halfway between these two so we

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780
just be halfway between these two so we
 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.230
just be halfway between these two so we
can even average those so let's do that

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240
can even average those so let's do that
 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.950
can even average those so let's do that
so if we just average those sixty eight

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960
so if we just average those sixty eight
 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.800
so if we just average those sixty eight
point two plus sixty nine point seven is

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810
point two plus sixty nine point seven is
 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.170
point two plus sixty nine point seven is
equal and then we want to divide it that

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180
equal and then we want to divide it that
 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.240
equal and then we want to divide it that
answer means our previous answer so that

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250
answer means our previous answer so that
 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.719

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.400
number divided by two is equal to sixty
eight point nine five so part two part

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410
eight point nine five so part two part
 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.430
eight point nine five so part two part
two in through linear interpolation we

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440
two in through linear interpolation we
 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.310
two in through linear interpolation we
get sixty eight point nine five is that

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320
get sixty eight point nine five is that
 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.409
get sixty eight point nine five is that
what I got sixty eight point nine five

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419
what I got sixty eight point nine five
 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.750
what I got sixty eight point nine five
so that is this point right here so

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760
so that is this point right here so
 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.120
so that is this point right here so
linear interpolation is giving us this

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130
linear interpolation is giving us this
 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.230
linear interpolation is giving us this
is linear interpolation on this right

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240
is linear interpolation on this right
 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.150
is linear interpolation on this right
linear int that's giving us a slightly

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160
linear int that's giving us a slightly
 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.249
linear int that's giving us a slightly
higher estimate than our line of best

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259
higher estimate than our line of best
 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:32.900
higher estimate than our line of best
fit across all of the data and you can

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910
fit across all of the data and you can
 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.550
fit across all of the data and you can
even eyeball it if you look at it right

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560
even eyeball it if you look at it right
 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.589
even eyeball it if you look at it right
there let's do the best one the next one

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599
there let's do the best one the next one
 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.900
there let's do the best one the next one
use the line of best fit to estimate the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910
use the line of best fit to estimate the
 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.839

life expectancy of a person born in 1976
 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.089
life expectancy of a person born in 1976
once again we can use the equation of

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099
once again we can use the equation of
 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.969
once again we can use the equation of
the line of best fit plug in 1976 here

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979
the line of best fit plug in 1976 here
 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.110
the line of best fit plug in 1976 here
and see what it gets us I mean we can

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120
and see what it gets us I mean we can
 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.110
and see what it gets us I mean we can
eyeball it 1975 is there 1976 is there

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120
eyeball it 1975 is there 1976 is there
 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.680
eyeball it 1975 is there 1976 is there
it'll be right around there let's

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690
it'll be right around there let's
 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.360
it'll be right around there let's
actually use the actual equation so in

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370
actually use the actual equation so in
 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.659
actually use the actual equation so in
1976 this is going to be the line of

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669
1976 this is going to be the line of
 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.719
1976 this is going to be the line of
best fit the line of best fit is going

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729
best fit the line of best fit is going
 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.450
best fit the line of best fit is going
to give us if we actually figure out

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460
to give us if we actually figure out
 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.219
to give us if we actually figure out
what this line value gives us so we get

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229
what this line value gives us so we get
 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.149
what this line value gives us so we get
0.23 nine five times

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159
0.23 nine five times
 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:18.430
0.23 nine five times
1976 1976 - four hundred

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440
1976 1976 - four hundred
 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.060
1976 1976 - four hundred
point nine nine so seventy two point two

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070
point nine nine so seventy two point two
 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.159
point nine nine so seventy two point two
six years so it gives its seventy two

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169
six years so it gives its seventy two
 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.659
six years so it gives its seventy two
point two six years so equals seventy

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669
point two six years so equals seventy
 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.330
point two six years so equals seventy
two point two six let me make this clear

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340
two point two six let me make this clear
 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.870
two point two six let me make this clear
here these columns this one right here

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880
here these columns this one right here
 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.070
here these columns this one right here
is line of best fit and this right here

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080
is line of best fit and this right here
 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.810
is line of best fit and this right here
is interpolation

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820
is interpolation
 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.690
is interpolation
interpolation now they want us to use

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700
interpolation now they want us to use
 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.490
interpolation now they want us to use
linear interpolation to estimate the

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500
linear interpolation to estimate the
 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.010

life expectancy of a person born in 1976
 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.230
life expectancy of a person born in 1976
so what they want us to do is draw a

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240
so what they want us to do is draw a
 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.470
so what they want us to do is draw a
line between these two points and then

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480
line between these two points and then
 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.290
line between these two points and then
use that line not the whole line of best

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300
use that line not the whole line of best
 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.200
use that line not the whole line of best
fit to figure out what 1976 might have

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210
fit to figure out what 1976 might have
 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.370
fit to figure out what 1976 might have
been now

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380
been now
 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.700
been now
before 1955 was right in between those

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710
before 1955 was right in between those
 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.160
before 1955 was right in between those
two values 1976 is not right in between

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.170
two values 1976 is not right in between
 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.080
two values 1976 is not right in between
those values so let's actually figure

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090
those values so let's actually figure
 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.780
those values so let's actually figure
out the equation of this line using

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790
out the equation of this line using
 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.470

using the points using these two points

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480
using the points using these two points
 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.130
using the points using these two points
using the points 1970 comma 70.8 and

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140
using the points 1970 comma 70.8 and
 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.140
using the points 1970 comma 70.8 and
1980 comma seventy three point seven

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150
1980 comma seventy three point seven
 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.330
1980 comma seventy three point seven
let's figure out the slope of that line

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340
let's figure out the slope of that line
 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.200
let's figure out the slope of that line
of this line right here so the slope is

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210
of this line right here so the slope is
 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.220
of this line right here so the slope is
the change in Y over change in X it's

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230
the change in Y over change in X it's
 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.840
the change in Y over change in X it's
going to be seventy three point seven

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:35.850
going to be seventy three point seven
 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.530
going to be seventy three point seven
minus 70 point eight seventy three point

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:39.540
minus 70 point eight seventy three point
 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.980
minus 70 point eight seventy three point
seven minus 70 point eight that's how

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:42.990
seven minus 70 point eight that's how
 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.690
seven minus 70 point eight that's how
much we changed in the Y Direction

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:44.700
much we changed in the Y Direction
 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.850
much we changed in the Y Direction
divided by how much we change in the X

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860
divided by how much we change in the X
 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:53.840
divided by how much we change in the X
Direction 1982 - 1970 1980 - 1970 so

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:53.850
Direction 1982 - 1970 1980 - 1970 so
 

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.230
Direction 1982 - 1970 1980 - 1970 so
this is going to be equal to let's see

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240
this is going to be equal to let's see
 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.610
this is going to be equal to let's see
three point seven - point eight is two

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620
three point seven - point eight is two
 

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.790
three point seven - point eight is two
point nine so it's two point nine over

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800
point nine so it's two point nine over
 

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.570
point nine so it's two point nine over
ten or it's equal to point two nine we

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580
ten or it's equal to point two nine we
 

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.210
