00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:12.930
to be very careful to separate out
 

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.590
to be very careful to separate out
questions of discrimination questions of

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600
questions of discrimination questions of
 

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.210
questions of discrimination questions of
anti-arab prejudice which there

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220
anti-arab prejudice which there
 

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.190
anti-arab prejudice which there
certainly are right now we have to

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200
certainly are right now we have to
 

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.520
certainly are right now we have to
separate those particular questions from

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:22.530
separate those particular questions from
 

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.380
separate those particular questions from
the broader question of is there a

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:24.390
the broader question of is there a
 

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.360
the broader question of is there a
problem with immigration is there a

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:26.370
problem with immigration is there a
 

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.960
problem with immigration is there a
problem with the United States's feeling

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:29.970
problem with the United States's feeling
 

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.000
problem with the United States's feeling
towards other countries and welcoming

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.010
towards other countries and welcoming
 

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.040
towards other countries and welcoming
people from other countries I think when

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.050
people from other countries I think when
 

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.550
people from other countries I think when
you look globally what we what you have

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:37.560
you look globally what we what you have
 

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.250
you look globally what we what you have
you have to focus on is the fear of the

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260
you have to focus on is the fear of the
 

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.980
you have to focus on is the fear of the
other fear the unassimilated the fear

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:42.990
other fear the unassimilated the fear
 

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.650
other fear the unassimilated the fear
that comes from economic hard times and

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660
that comes from economic hard times and
 

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.800
that comes from economic hard times and
from fear of crime and I think you have

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:48.810
from fear of crime and I think you have
 

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.170
from fear of crime and I think you have
to separate those you have to isolate

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:51.180
to separate those you have to isolate
 

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.680
to separate those you have to isolate
what are the factors that cause people

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:54.690

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:13.820
that direction in the past six months
 

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:33.230
that direction in the past six months
thank you Miss my cities

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240
 

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:38.670
thank you the core question that has

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:38.680
thank you the core question that has
 

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.920
thank you the core question that has
been given to us for this debate the

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:40.930
been given to us for this debate the
 

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:44.460
been given to us for this debate the
question of whether immigration has been

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:44.470
question of whether immigration has been
 

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.380
question of whether immigration has been
fundamentally changed by the events of

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:46.390
fundamentally changed by the events of
 

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.840
fundamentally changed by the events of
911 has been touched on in different

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:48.850
911 has been touched on in different
 

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:53.580
911 has been touched on in different
ways by each of us I would answer that

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:53.590
ways by each of us I would answer that
 

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.770
ways by each of us I would answer that
question along with most I think of the

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:55.780
question along with most I think of the
 

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.080
question along with most I think of the
speakers by saying absolutely a second

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.090
speakers by saying absolutely a second
 

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.930
speakers by saying absolutely a second
for debate has changed in very

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:00.940
for debate has changed in very
 

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.280
for debate has changed in very
significant ways and and a number of

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:05.290
significant ways and and a number of
 

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.250
significant ways and and a number of
those ways have already been talked

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:08.260
those ways have already been talked
 

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.760
those ways have already been talked
about the basic changes I see it in the

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:11.770
about the basic changes I see it in the
 

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:15.030
about the basic changes I see it in the
debate is that we have now been forced

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040
debate is that we have now been forced
 

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.010
debate is that we have now been forced
to confront immigration as an issue as a

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:20.020
to confront immigration as an issue as a
 

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.680
to confront immigration as an issue as a
phenomenon in our society that has very

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:22.690
phenomenon in our society that has very
 

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.140
phenomenon in our society that has very
substantial security dimensions to it

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:25.150
substantial security dimensions to it
 

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.200
substantial security dimensions to it
and that is something that has always

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:28.210
and that is something that has always
 

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:31.710
and that is something that has always
been a characteristic of immigration but

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720
been a characteristic of immigration but
 

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.690
been a characteristic of immigration but
it is something that we have essentially

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:33.700
it is something that we have essentially
 

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.880
it is something that we have essentially
glossed over for most of the last recent

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:38.890
glossed over for most of the last recent
 

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:41.310
glossed over for most of the last recent
years and I would argue have pretty much

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320
years and I would argue have pretty much
 

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.070
years and I would argue have pretty much
glossed over for the last 20 30 years

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:44.080
glossed over for the last 20 30 years
 

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.250
glossed over for the last 20 30 years
but certainly for the last 10 years

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260
but certainly for the last 10 years
 

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.300
but certainly for the last 10 years
fundamentally we have been treating

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:48.310
fundamentally we have been treating
 

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:51.030
fundamentally we have been treating
immigration as an economic phenomenon

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040
immigration as an economic phenomenon
 

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.250
immigration as an economic phenomenon
and we have been seeing it through the

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:53.260
and we have been seeing it through the
 

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.950
and we have been seeing it through the
lens of our economy and through the lens

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960
lens of our economy and through the lens
 

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.130
lens of our economy and through the lens
of the contributions that immigration

00:34:59.130 --> 00:34:59.140
of the contributions that immigration
 

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.320
of the contributions that immigration
makes to our economy those contributions

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:01.330
makes to our economy those contributions
 

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:05.250
makes to our economy those contributions
are by and large very positive and are

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:05.260
are by and large very positive and are
 

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:09.900
are by and large very positive and are
very much a part of the story of the

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:09.910
very much a part of the story of the
 

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:13.340
very much a part of the story of the
incredible economic success of this

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:13.350
incredible economic success of this
 

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:16.860
incredible economic success of this
economy in in recent years but we have

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:16.870
economy in in recent years but we have
 

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.460
economy in in recent years but we have
been quite unwilling to look at the

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:20.470
been quite unwilling to look at the
 

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:23.730
been quite unwilling to look at the
complexity of immigration now we are

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:23.740
complexity of immigration now we are
 

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.040
complexity of immigration now we are
forced to do that with

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:25.050
forced to do that with
 

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.490
forced to do that with
11 because 911 shows us that there is a

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500
11 because 911 shows us that there is a
 

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.280
11 because 911 shows us that there is a
very substantial security dimension to

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:31.290
very substantial security dimension to
 

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.160
very substantial security dimension to
immigration along with the issues that

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:34.170
immigration along with the issues that
 

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.780
immigration along with the issues that
surround the economy and other

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:35.790
surround the economy and other
 

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:39.890
surround the economy and other
characteristics of immigration so the

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900
characteristics of immigration so the
 

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.160
characteristics of immigration so the
debate in my opinion has changed in a

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:43.170
debate in my opinion has changed in a
 

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.280
debate in my opinion has changed in a
fundamental way in a way that is a

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:46.290
fundamental way in a way that is a
 

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:49.610
fundamental way in a way that is a
paradigm shift and in a way that needs

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:49.620
paradigm shift and in a way that needs
 

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:54.170
paradigm shift and in a way that needs
to the demands all of the attention but

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180
to the demands all of the attention but
 

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.680
to the demands all of the attention but
I don't think that that change in the

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:57.690
I don't think that that change in the
 

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:02.300
I don't think that that change in the
debate is translating into a change in

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:02.310
debate is translating into a change in
 

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.970
debate is translating into a change in
the fundamentals of immigration in the

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980
the fundamentals of immigration in the
 

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.770
the fundamentals of immigration in the
fundamentals of our immigration policy

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780
fundamentals of our immigration policy
 

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:11.030
fundamentals of our immigration policy
or of our commitment to continuing to be

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040
or of our commitment to continuing to be
 

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.110
or of our commitment to continuing to be
a nation of immigrants now I think there

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:15.120
a nation of immigrants now I think there
 

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.390
a nation of immigrants now I think there
are a variety of ways of illustrating

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400
are a variety of ways of illustrating
 

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.240
are a variety of ways of illustrating
that point let me just tick off a couple

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:20.250
that point let me just tick off a couple
 

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.680
that point let me just tick off a couple
of them if you look at the legislation

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:23.690
of them if you look at the legislation
 

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.120
of them if you look at the legislation
that the administration sent to the

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:26.130
that the administration sent to the
 

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.940
that the administration sent to the
Congress right after 911 the very first

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:28.950
Congress right after 911 the very first
 

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.380
Congress right after 911 the very first
piece of legislation that the

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:30.390
piece of legislation that the
 

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:32.240
piece of legislation that the
administration sent was basically asking

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:32.250
administration sent was basically asking
 

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:37.370
administration sent was basically asking
for war powers and as the Congress

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380
for war powers and as the Congress
 

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.840
for war powers and as the Congress
passed that within a week them you know

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:38.850
passed that within a week them you know
 

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.190
passed that within a week them you know
I all of us don't even know what

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200
I all of us don't even know what
 

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.710
I all of us don't even know what
happened because it was just it just

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720
happened because it was just it just
 

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.440
happened because it was just it just
happened but the second piece of

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:45.450
happened but the second piece of
 

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:46.910
happened but the second piece of
legislation that was sent was

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920
legislation that was sent was
 

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.490
legislation that was sent was
immigration legislation and it was the

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.500
immigration legislation and it was the
 

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.520
immigration legislation and it was the
legislation that is the source of the

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:52.530
legislation that is the source of the
 

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.800
legislation that is the source of the
issues that are being talked about here

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:54.810
issues that are being talked about here
 

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.770
issues that are being talked about here
because what it resulted in was quite a

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780
because what it resulted in was quite a
 

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.100
because what it resulted in was quite a
substantial well relaxation or

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:01.110
substantial well relaxation or
 

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.860
substantial well relaxation or
broadening of the power of the

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:03.870
broadening of the power of the
 

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:08.300
broadening of the power of the
government to detain non-immigrants

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:08.310
government to detain non-immigrants
 

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.180
government to detain non-immigrants
however the form in which that

however the form in which that

however the form in which that
legislation went to the Congress was

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280
legislation went to the Congress was
 

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.130
legislation went to the Congress was
considerably broader than what it was

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140
considerably broader than what it was
 

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.500
considerably broader than what it was
that was actually enacted and I think

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:18.510
that was actually enacted and I think
 

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.990
that was actually enacted and I think
most of us in the field were very very

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000
most of us in the field were very very
 

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.090
most of us in the field were very very
fearful that that immigration

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:23.100
fearful that that immigration
 

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.510
fearful that that immigration
legislation would just get

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.520
legislation would just get

War Powers legislation did but in fact

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:29.770
War Powers legislation did but in fact
 

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:32.220
War Powers legislation did but in fact
it's quite interesting that legislation

it's quite interesting that legislation
 

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.140
it's quite interesting that legislation
got slowed down to the point that the

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:34.150
got slowed down to the point that the
 

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.490
got slowed down to the point that the
administration had to begin to sort of

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:35.500
administration had to begin to sort of

not questioning and shifting the basic

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:17.650
not questioning and shifting the basic
 

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:20.490
not questioning and shifting the basic

fundamentals as I say of our immigration

system today and its place in in our
 

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.509

society and I think that along with that

00:41:27.509 --> 00:41:27.519
society and I think that along with that
 

00:41:27.519 --> 00:41:32.940
society and I think that along with that
has come an overall public reaction that

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:32.950
has come an overall public reaction that
 

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:35.460
has come an overall public reaction that
I would not have expected I think that

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:35.470
I would not have expected I think that
 

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.890
I would not have expected I think that
it overall in the course of our history

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:37.900
it overall in the course of our history
 

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.529
it overall in the course of our history
when there have been spectacular

00:41:40.529 --> 00:41:40.539
when there have been spectacular
 

00:41:40.539 --> 00:41:43.370
when there have been spectacular
occurrences such as what happened on 911

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.380
occurrences such as what happened on 911

those of us who have been in this field

00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079
those of us who have been in this field
 

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:50.180
those of us who have been in this field
expected a huge immigration backlash and

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:50.190
expected a huge immigration backlash and
 

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:55.640
expected a huge immigration backlash and
expected there to be a real

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:55.650
expected there to be a real
 

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:58.589
expected there to be a real
across-the-board public response against

00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599
across-the-board public response against
 

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:01.380
across-the-board public response against
immigration and it did not happen now

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:01.390
immigration and it did not happen now
 

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.289
immigration and it did not happen now
some of my panelists will have disagreed

00:42:04.289 --> 00:42:04.299
some of my panelists will have disagreed
 

00:42:04.299 --> 00:42:06.660
some of my panelists will have disagreed
on this point but I would argue that it

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:06.670
on this point but I would argue that it
 

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.269
on this point but I would argue that it
did not happen that essentially there

00:42:09.269 --> 00:42:09.279
did not happen that essentially there
 

00:42:09.279 --> 00:42:11.039
did not happen that essentially there
are certainly our problems there are

00:42:11.039 --> 00:42:11.049
are certainly our problems there are
 

00:42:11.049 --> 00:42:12.660
are certainly our problems there are
issues of discrimination that are

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:12.670
issues of discrimination that are
 

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:17.130
issues of discrimination that are
serious issues and those are they are

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:17.140
serious issues and those are they are
 

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.289
serious issues and those are they are
unacceptable and they need that needs to

00:42:19.289 --> 00:42:19.299
unacceptable and they need that needs to
 

00:42:19.299 --> 00:42:21.920
unacceptable and they need that needs to
change but that is different from an

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:21.930
change but that is different from an
 

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:26.269
change but that is different from an
immigration backlash so I think that I

00:42:26.269 --> 00:42:26.279
immigration backlash so I think that I
 

00:42:26.279 --> 00:42:28.529
immigration backlash so I think that I
associate myself with those who have

00:42:28.529 --> 00:42:28.539
associate myself with those who have
 

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:30.359
associate myself with those who have
said that we have not seen an

00:42:30.359 --> 00:42:30.369
said that we have not seen an
 

00:42:30.369 --> 00:42:32.309
said that we have not seen an
immigration backlash and I think that

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319
immigration backlash and I think that
 

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:36.059
immigration backlash and I think that
that actually is quite a responsible and

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:36.069
that actually is quite a responsible and
 

00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:41.039
that actually is quite a responsible and
a sophisticated answer a thing to have

00:42:41.039 --> 00:42:41.049
a sophisticated answer a thing to have
 

00:42:41.049 --> 00:42:44.730
a sophisticated answer a thing to have
seen on the part of the public now I

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:44.740
seen on the part of the public now I
 

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.120
seen on the part of the public now I
think there are some very interesting

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:48.130
think there are some very interesting
 

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:51.349
think there are some very interesting
and important reasons that explain that

00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359
and important reasons that explain that
 

00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:54.539
and important reasons that explain that
and I would divide those reasons into

00:42:54.539 --> 00:42:54.549
and I would divide those reasons into
 

00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:57.180
and I would divide those reasons into
