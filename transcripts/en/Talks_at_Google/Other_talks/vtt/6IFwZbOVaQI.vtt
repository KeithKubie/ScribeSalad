KEITH WRIGHT: Ryan Leslie is
a singer-songwriter, producer,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.210
now tech entrepreneur.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.370
You've done music genres such
as R&amp;B, hip hop, pop, soul,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.280
and even gospel.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.090
Grammy-nominated
Harvard graduate.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.530
He's worked with some artists
such as P. Diddy, Britney

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.580
Spears, Beyonce, Snoop
Dogg, Usher, Fabolous.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.650
The list just goes
on and on and on.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.850
So I think what is also
really interesting,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.800
and how it's relevant
here at Google,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.190
is that he is now a
tech entrepreneur,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.690
and becoming quite well-known
within the tech space.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.870
His recent startup
SuperPhone was actually

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.880
just backed by Ben
Horowitz, which

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.600
I'm sure we all are
very familiar with.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.820
I think it's one of the first
times a big popular artist has

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.180
been backed by a
serious tech VC.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.230
So that's-- you know,
congratulations on that.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.460
That's very exciting.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.554
RYAN LESLIE: Thank you.

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:03.970
KEITH WRIGHT: So
yeah, we're going

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.820
to be touching on a few
different things here today.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.560
I definitely wanted to
hear more about kind

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.990
of what you're doing
in the startup space,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.760
because I think it's quite
disruptive to the music

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.260
industry.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.150
And the music industry, or just
the media industry in general,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.830
has gone through a really big
shift because of technology,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.410
mainly.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.700
RYAN LESLIE: Sure.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.075
KEITH WRIGHT: It's
something that

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:28.810
can be really
leveraged by artists,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.260
but it's kind of
hard to navigate

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.390
when you have new channels
being launched, like,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.270
almost on a daily basis.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.790
And I think you're one of
the few out there independent

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.020
artists that actually
understands this space

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.060
and was able to build
something to help

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.660
young and independent
artists really take advantage

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.945
of this space to
grow their audience,

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:50.070
engage their audience, and
monetize their audience.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.440
So yeah, maybe I could kind
of hand it over to you.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.050
We'd love to hear about what
you've got going on here,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.070
and maybe hear it directly
from yourself on--

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.340
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.160
For sure.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.660
For sure.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.850
So yeah, to talk
SuperPhone, I mean

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.240
it's so interesting and cool
to be here actually at Google,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.740
right?

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.130
Because I remember
actually being at Harvard

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.200
in the late '90s.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.470
So I graduated from
Harvard in '98,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.540
and just learning about email
for the first time, you know?

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.280
Like I actually,
when I was coming up,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.870
I was one of those, like, super
romantics that would actually

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.470
have a penpal, you know, like
really actually write letters

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.540
back and forth to people.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.331
Like being a young
teenager in high school,

00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:40.450
I remember like some girl that
I had met when my family was

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.240
living in Belgium, I actually
kept in touch with her,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.220
writing letters for real.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.700
And I would wait
weeks for a response.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.025
And then we got introduced
to email at college.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:54.360
And I said wow, you know,
this is like cutting the wait

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.230
time down.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.170
It's instant, right?

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.250
It's instant delivery.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.890
I said Mom, look,
you can-- you know,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.380
I'm going to write this to you,
and you're going to get it,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.865
like, now.

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:08.060
And she was like, wow, OK,
Ryan, that's great, I guess.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.390
And I guess later on,
there were-- you know,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.045
the rise of different
email clients,

00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:15.760
whether it's Yahoo
or AOL and, you know,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.350
the rise of different messaging.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.280
But this idea of just human
communication and the way

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.660
that we can actually make
it as instant as possible

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.440
so that it actually feels
as urgent as possible.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.070
And it's so funny
to talk about email

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.630
because, like, now, all
of my different email

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.110
accounts, or whenever
I spin up a new domain,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.490
I install Google Apps, right?

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.114
So I can run my email
through Gmail, right?

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:41.280
And the reason I like running
my email through Gmail

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.050
is because all my other--
everything in my life

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.880
is actually
connected via Google.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.250
So I use Google Photos, I use
Google Drive, I use Gmail,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.750
I use--

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.160
KEITH WRIGHT: You've
adopted the Google stack.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.440
That's for sure.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.190
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah, man.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.000
I've adopted the Google--

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.710
KEITH WRIGHT: You're a
personal Google house.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.876
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah, for sure.

00:03:55.876 --> 00:03:56.380
For sure.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.171
And I love it, man.

00:03:57.171 --> 00:03:59.530
I love the
collaborative documents

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.970
and all kinds of stuff.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.080
And the beauty of it, for me, is
that as awesome as all of that

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.460
is, and as useful
as all of it is,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.130
there are two Google
challenges that I face when I

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.140
went to Google for the answer.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.370
One of them was when I decided
to start giving my phone

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.579
number out to everybody.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.710
So you know, my phone
number is literally

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.600
publicly available
on all my socials.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.516
If you wanted to, you
could text me right now.

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:29.450
I get every single text
message, and I always

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.050
respond at least once to
every single text message.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.130
Now, I'm able to do that
through advanced intelligence

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.280
and auto-response logic,
but I'm able to respond

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.240
at least once to every
single person who texts me.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.800
But I wanted to initially
do this with Google.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.390
I wanted to do this
with Google Voice.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.850
So I was running
into a problem that

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.340
was the same problem,
or challenge,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.460
that every single person who's
building a social audience

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.490
faces.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.890
And that is, I felt
disconnected from all

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.580
of my Facebook friends.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.230
I felt disconnected from
all my LinkedIn connections.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.950
I felt disconnected from
all my Instagram followers.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.550
At the time, Myspace friends.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.650
Twitter followers.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.300
YouTube subscribers.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.340
It's all well and good.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.330
I was watching the numbers
grow and grow and grow,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.704
and I was watching
the engagement

00:05:16.704 --> 00:05:20.660
shrink and shrink and shrink
from a percentage standpoint.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.590
So when I had five Instagram
followers and I got five likes,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.280
I'm at 100% engagement.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.720
And then now I'm at 245,000
Instagram followers,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.600
and I'm only getting,
you know, averaging

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.080
somewhere between 2,500
and 4,000 likes, which

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.460
is putting me in, like,
a 2% engagement range.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.200
And so I thought that
the idea, and what

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.730
was so cool about a
Google Voice number,

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.912
is that the most
powerful social handle--

00:05:47.912 --> 00:05:49.870
and I was having a
conversation with my boy Dan

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.220
Cherry about
SuperPhone, and he said,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.000
well, Ryan, if you
really think about it,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.220
your cell phone number is
a social handle, right?

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.680
And it's really the most
powerful social handle

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.800
because it really
actually gives you

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.040
the ability to
communicate directly

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.290
outside of all the noise
of all of the platforms.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.750
It's actually like a native
social handle, right?

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.800
But the issue with
that social handle

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.470
is that-- the reason why we
don't give it out to everyone

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.650
is because there isn't enough
sophistication on that social

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.410
handle to allow us to manage
conversations at scale.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.220
So that's why we let Twitter
manage our conversations.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.590
That's why we let Facebook, and
that's why we let Google+ or we

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.480
let Instagram manage
the conversations around

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.940
our content that we put out.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.690
But it still doesn't negate
the value and the worth

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.600
and the incredible power
of the cell phone number

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.240
as a social handle, right?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.330
And so I set out to
actually be able to give

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.710
that social handle to everyone,
and be able to actually find

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.080
a way to have a real
exchange, or as real

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.030
of an exchange as possible
over that social handle.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.522
And so like I said, two
ways that I felt really

00:07:04.522 --> 00:07:06.480
challenged when I went
to Google for an answer.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.247
Number one was Google Voice.

00:07:08.247 --> 00:07:10.580
So the first thing about
Google Voice, which is awesome,

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.490
is hey, I can give a number that
wasn't actually my cell phone

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.200
number, right?

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.160
And I can do some-- there's
certain customization that I

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.670
can do around OK, if this person
calls, play this voicemail.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.390
Or if this person calls, let
it go through to my cell.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.950
And there's some
cool stuff there.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.190
But I was actually
left to the restriction

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.000
of my own human capacity
of actually managing

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.890
all this, right?

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.570
I couldn't add--
there was not an API

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.340
for Google Voice at the time.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.460
And even though I'm
like a very XML,

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:47.080
jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, a
little bit of Ruby on Rails,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.790
right, I couldn't actually just
plug into the Google Voice API

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.490
and run these advanced
auto-responses

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.620
that I wanted to run.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.370
I could maybe try to hack
an email auto-response which

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.189
would respond via
text over Google Voice

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:04.730
because it was
connected to my Gmail.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.270
It was very, very challenging
to do something as simple

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.940
as just say thank you.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.010
So my idea was, hey, send me a
text of a receipt from iTunes,

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.800
and I just want to
thank you personally.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.966
Because I feel disconnected.

00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:19.800
I don't know which of
my Twitter followers

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.050
have actually bought my album.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.200
And because iTunes was a black
box, and Amazon, and Google

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.080
Play, and Spotify, they're a
black box in terms of data,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.059
I felt like I didn't have a
real relationship with people

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.190
who were supporting me.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.565
And I wanted to show those
people a little bit more love.

00:08:36.565 --> 00:08:38.250
Right now, if someone
sends me a tweet,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.409
that's cool and everything,
but I don't have

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.264
any depth to that relationship.

00:08:42.264 --> 00:08:44.680
I don't know if they've actually
bought every single album

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680
unless they say it.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.180
But I can't verify
that with Apple, right?

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.800
And so it started out with
a very simple concept--

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.330
text me your receipt so I can
prove that you've supported me,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.200
and I would like to
thank you personally.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.359
And so the first couple
hundred texts was awesome.

00:08:59.359 --> 00:09:00.900
It was like, wow,
I'm meeting people.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.400
It's Keith and it's
Danny and it's Mike

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.690
and it's Nathan and it's
Brandon and, you know,

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.760
it's real people, and I'm
able to text them back.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.710
And then my fingers started
getting tired, right?

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.442
After the first--

00:09:12.442 --> 00:09:14.150
KEITH WRIGHT: I could
have told you that.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.780
RYAN LESLIE: --hundred, 200.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.400
You know, and even
though as magical

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.800
as it was, I
realized like, look,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.422
technology should actually be
able to enable me to personally

00:09:24.422 --> 00:09:25.380
thank all these people.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.410
It should verify
that it's a receipt,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.086
and it should say their name,
probably parse their name

00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:31.460
from the receipt,
say their name,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.610
and say, yo, I really
appreciate you.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.600
And that doesn't mean that
it's any less personal, right?

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.820
It's just the fact that
the one unscalable resource

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.421
that we all have is time, right?

00:09:43.421 --> 00:09:45.420
That's the only thing
that's always running out.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.510
KEITH WRIGHT: I think one big
important word here at Google

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.792
that we use a lot
is scalability.

00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:51.500
RYAN LESLIE: Yes.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.980
KEITH WRIGHT: That's what
you're sort of running into--

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.780
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah,
running into, yeah.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.390
KEITH WRIGHT: Yes.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.440
We hear you 100% on that.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.010
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:56.600
For sure.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.110
So that personally manually
texting everyone back

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.970
thank you is ridiculously
unscalable, unless you just

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.170
want to grow a long
beard, stay in your house,

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.830
don't ever do
anything else but just

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.170
text thank you to
people forever, right?

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.670
So that wasn't scalable.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.762
And I ran into that
challenge, right?

00:10:16.762 --> 00:10:18.220
And then the second
challenge I ran

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.160
into is that I have a
large following in Germany,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.516
in France, in the
UK, in Holland.

00:10:26.516 --> 00:10:27.890
And those people
were excited, oh

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.180
my gosh, Ryan's social handle.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.170
We can text him directly.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.961
You know, I'm going to
send him my receipt.

00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:33.710
I got this from the
German iTunes store.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.420
And then all of a sudden, I
would try to send the response,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.280
and Google Voice
doesn't actually

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.590
allow me to respond to
international text messages.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.010
And so I remember a text coming
in from somebody that said,

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.459
hey, Ryan, I know you
can't text me back, right?

00:10:48.459 --> 00:10:49.750
It was an international number.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.320
I know you can't text me back,
because I did a reverse lookup

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.944
on this number.

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:54.856
I know it's Google Voice.

00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:56.682
I said, OK, this is
a real techie, right?

00:10:56.682 --> 00:10:57.890
He's got to be a real techie.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:58.360
KEITH WRIGHT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.526
RYAN LESLIE: And if you're
interested in doing that,

00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:04.390
there's other platforms that you
can explore which will give you

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:10.410
the kind of control and power
to scale this kind of automation

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.770
intelligently.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.210
And so I looked
into the platform,

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.450
and I wanted to
spin up a number,

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.550
and it was really just an API.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.955
So there was no user interface.

00:11:18.955 --> 00:11:20.310
I had a number.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.340
I could kind of put
a very simple XML

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.710
code which said, hey, if
someone calls, open tag say,

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.200
close tag say.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.181
It was a thanks for
calling, don't leave me

00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:35.430
a message because I don't
know how to get to messages.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.740
Something like that, right?

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.850
And so basically, I
spent a bunch of time

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.650
at Code Academy learning
the basics of how

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.540
to actually interact
with this API

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.520
so I could do three
very simple things.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.630
Number one, when someone
sends me a text message--

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.230
I don't know if
anyone has tried it,

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.540
or if you're watching
at home-- send me a text

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.670
message, the first response, if
you've never texted me before,

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.630
is just going to say, hey,
you know, I need your info,

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.890
because I don't want to text.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.600
Even though it's cool to have
your 10-digit social handle,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.500
I have no idea.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.270
It's just 10 digits, right?

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.004
Or maybe it's more if
it's international.

00:12:13.004 --> 00:12:14.420
So the first thing
I'll do is say,

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.760
hey, look, would you mind
adding yourself to my phone.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.514
And it's the equivalent, like
I'm able to actually scale--

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:21.680
let me see what my phone is.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.580
It's the same thing as
if you're out at a bar

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.460
or you're at a conference
or you're at a festival

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.080
or something, you meet up with
somebody that you think is cool

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.463
and you say, you know
what, real quick, can

00:12:32.463 --> 00:12:34.080
you just add your
info to my phone.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.904
It's easier to have them do
it than you do it yourself.

00:12:37.904 --> 00:12:39.570
And so that's the
first thing SuperPhone

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.070
does is, when someone
texts for the first time,

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.267
it creates a link that
will pre-populate the phone

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.600
number so you don't have to
type the phone number again,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.870
and it's the equivalent of me
virtually handing you my phone

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.070
and you can add your
information in, right?

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.570
That's number one.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.390
Number two is I
wanted it to be smart.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.970
And so in order
for it to be smart,

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.310
it needs to be able to ping
something so that I know

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.960
something else about someone.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:13.100
So it's easy to say, OK,
Keith sent me a text.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.010
He added his contact
information to my phone.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.790
He chose to give me
his Twitter handle,

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.580
so now I can know how many
Twitter followers he has.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.905
Is he very influential on
another social platform?

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:24.530
Do I need to show
him a little bit more

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.730
love because if I
actually say, like, yo,

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.640
Keith, man, you the man, and he
screenshots this and posts it

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.030
on Twitter, more
people will actually

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.120
come to my very
powerful social handle,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.370
which is my cell phone number.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.500
Oh my gosh, Ryan.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.230
You know?

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.960
So that's something
that I wanted to do.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.515
But I said, look, I can
take it a little bit deeper,

00:13:42.515 --> 00:13:45.140
because I actually want to know
if someone's actually supported

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:45.640
me.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.430
So it needs to be able to ping
my e-commerce platform, right?

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.970
So if it can ping my
e-commerce platform

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:58.190
the same way that Amazon
or Apple can look up

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.350
your profile with your
Apple ID and see everything

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.660
you've ever bought, I would love
to have that for me personally.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.600
That would be awesome.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.100
Whether I'm raising money for
a marathon that I'm running

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.180
or whether I'm selling
the album or whether I'm

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.280
selling bracelets or watches
or sneaker collaborations,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.440
I would love to be able to
acknowledge and appreciate

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.310
the people who've actually
bought something or supported

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.220
me or donated or invested.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.370
I need to be able to
ping some database.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.480
And so at the time, they're
now a public company,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.840
I plugged into Shopify.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.250
And so I started selling
my album on Shopify.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.830
And if someone texted me and
gave me their information,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.160
my phone, once they gave
me their information,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.900
would check that email
in my Shopify store

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.400
and, if they hadn't
bought my album,

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.260
very easily say, hey, look,
Keith, it's great to meet you,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.450
man, but it looks like you
haven't got my album yet.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.810
Here's a link to it.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.640
And that's what I
would do, right?

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.180
That's the--

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.500
KEITH WRIGHT: You send me
the same text over the course

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.460
of, like, three weeks?

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.210
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.260
KEITH WRIGHT: Until I buy it?

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:54.590
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.149
No, no, no.

00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:55.690
It actually--

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.065
KEITH WRIGHT: Put
me [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:57.065 --> 00:14:58.300
RYAN LESLIE: No, no, no.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.480
It's really-- it's
like if I really

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.950
thought about how would
I replicate myself

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:10.320
5,000 or 10,000 times, if I
could, how much more willing

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.790
would someone be to actually
get my record if they actually

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.470
had the ability to have
this conversation in person.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.990
I think that percentage
would be much higher.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.080
And then if I can't do
it in person, then maybe

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.747
over video chat.

00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:25.579
Because I've got to
say, yo, Keith, man, you

00:15:25.579 --> 00:15:26.530
want to get my album?

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.220
Like, you've got to
respond, because I'm

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.600
looking right at you, right?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.040
And then maybe text is a
next layer down, right?

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.340
And so if I could
have a text exchange

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.700
and I'm not thinking
anymore about how

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.040
do I message at
scale one to many,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.410
I'm thinking about a
conversation one to one.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.304
And it made all the
difference, right?

00:15:44.304 --> 00:15:45.470
It makes all the difference.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.136
It's one to one.

00:15:46.136 --> 00:15:48.272
I say, OK, yo, I
got your text, man.

00:15:48.272 --> 00:15:49.980
You mind just adding
yourself to my phone

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.800
so I know who I'm talking to?

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.410
Nine out of 10 fans added
their information in my phone.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.265
And then of the nine out of 10
fans that added the information

00:16:01.265 --> 00:16:03.450
to my phone, when I
ping them back and say,

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.577
yo, Keith, great to meet you,
looks like you haven't gotten

00:16:07.577 --> 00:16:09.910
my album yet, here's a link,
why don't you check it out,

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.030
one out of every two
bought the album, right?

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.980
And then 100% of
those people, as long

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.182
as my text stack is stable,
right, 100 of those people

00:16:20.182 --> 00:16:22.640
who actually bought something
from me, they get a thank you

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.590
text saying, yo,
Keith, I saw you just

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.240
got my album five minutes ago.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.400
That's awesome.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.550
Thank you so much.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.670
And anytime you see me
running in the streets,

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.210
man, let's take a
selfie, whatever.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.750
And I see you live in
New York, so anytime

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.600
I'm playing in New York, I'll
make sure to send you a text

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.700
so you don't miss my show.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.200
Right?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.610
And so to really think
about that, like yeah,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.730
like you were talking
about, man, maybe that's

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:51.006
cool for artists and, you
know, independent artists.

00:16:51.006 --> 00:16:52.630
It is powerful for
independent artists.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.030
And so any
independent artist who

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.960
thinks that this is
a really awesome idea

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.270
and they'd love to actually
have a scalable, intelligent

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.550
messaging layer on top
of the world's most

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.070
powerful social handle, which
is a cell phone number, then

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:06.569
great.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:07.443
Just shoot me a text.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:09.839
We'll get you on
the SuperPhone beta,

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.599
and you can use
it to sort of like

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:17.069
have a deeper relationship, have
a more engaged relationship,

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.119
have higher conversions
on your conversations,

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:20.359
all that marketing speak.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.839
But what I really
started to realize

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:28.740
is that the second challenge
that I went to Google to solve

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.040
for me is I can go to Google and
I can search anything, right?

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.670
I can go to Google
say, look, you know,

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.150
is there a list
of names of people

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.980
who lost their lives
in 9/11, right?

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.322
And it'll give it to me.

00:17:41.322 --> 00:17:42.780
What's the biggest
fish that's ever

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.920
been caught in terms of weight.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.920
And it'll give it to me.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.900
What are the statistics of Kobe
Bryant in terms of shots made,

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.140
three points made,
rebounds made, et cetera.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.450
It can give it to me.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.550
But the minute I go to
Google and I say, Google,

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.430
can you tell me about me?

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.557
Can you actually tell me who
I talked to the most in 1998

00:18:00.557 --> 00:18:03.015
when I was coming out of college
looking for an internship?

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:05.190
Can you give me
that information?

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.870
I can't get it, right?

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.720
It's a challenge
that, once again,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.650
I said well, wow, man, it's
like we've been collecting all

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.940
this information, and
actually before I came here,

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.250
I said look, before I'm too
hard on my favorite platform,

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.760
right, can I take a look at
something that I use pretty

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.220
often, my Google Contacts.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.920
And then there is a group in
Google Contacts, a smart group,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.990
that says most contacted.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.020
And so I did some research, you
know, Google's most contacted,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.910
and all the results that
came up was like, hey,

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.320
my most contacted, it
seems like it's off.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.220
It's not accurate.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.100
It's like is it the most used
emails, is it-- what is it?

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.100
And it wasn't like a
great deal of people

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.490
who were expressing
this challenge,

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.450
because I guess most
people, like I said,

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.400
the human capacity for
staying warm or keeping

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.521
your relationships
warm is pretty easy.

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:08.770
It's like hey, it's your
girlfriend, it's your family,

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.624
it's your best friends, it's
people you work with, right?

00:19:11.624 --> 00:19:13.540
But if you want to extend
your network-- let's

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.314
just say like-- let's say
you want to executive produce

00:19:16.314 --> 00:19:18.230
a film because you've
got a little extra money

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.188
and want to be an executive
producer on a film.

00:19:20.188 --> 00:19:23.740
Or let's just say you want to
pick up photography as a hobby,

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.070
or let's just say you
want to find people

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.460
that you can be on a Fitbit
challenge with, or whatever.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.020
Sometimes our human capacity
is so restricted and finite

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.240
to the people that we
communicate with the most

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.850
that we need to rely on some
technology to know like,

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.290
OK, maybe there's some other
relationships I can warm up

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.920
to help me be more of the
person that I want to be one

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.860
day, right?

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.950
And so I started
to-- and this was

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.580
kind of an extension of
what I had already built.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.350
I'd built a very simple
sort of automation chain.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.630
Hey, who are you?

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:01.990
Would you like to get my album?

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.770
Thanks a lot for
getting my album.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.840
And whenever I'm
in your city, I'll

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.080
give you a shoutout so
you can come to my show.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.060
And that was very,
very successful.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:15.010
I did, independently of a record
company, no manager, no label,

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.325
no PR, no music videos, just
like a little documentary

00:20:18.325 --> 00:20:22.420
of my album, we did $2 million
in gross revenue over SMS.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.960
Crazy, right?

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.520
And I know every
single person that

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.150
participated in that campaign.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.970
And even though that's pretty
incredible and crazy to me,

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.022
when you look around
at the companies-- so,

00:20:35.022 --> 00:20:36.480
you know, the
companies, the stocks

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.380
that I love-- Apple, Google,
Amazon, Starbucks-- Google,

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.810
Amazon, Starbucks, Apple,
they already know this.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.990
Facebook already knows this.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.230
Facebook, you know, if
Mark really wanted to,

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:54.480
he could sit down and say, who
are the 850 million people who

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.530
logged into Facebook today.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.281
He could actually
literally just-- I mean,

00:20:58.281 --> 00:21:00.155
it would take a minute,
but he could actually

00:21:00.155 --> 00:21:02.710
literally just go through and
see who all those people were,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:03.130
right?

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.190
And I was watching other
startups do the same thing,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.690
right?

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.410
There is-- you know, when you
look at companies like Mixpanel

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.410
or you look at companies
that give you analytics

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.451
on your user, you look at
companies like Intercom

00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:16.080
for customer service,
they're giving you

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.570
this kind of deep
information about how

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.740
people are interacting with
something you've created.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.010
But for whatever reason, it just
doesn't exist in music, right?

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.696
So if I created an app
for my music, right,

00:21:28.696 --> 00:21:30.320
I would know how many
people logged in.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.361
I would know how much time
they spend in the app.

00:21:32.361 --> 00:21:33.959
I would know what
buttons they click.

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.500
I know what buttons
they don't click.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.670
I know when they log out.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.128
I know how long
they stream a song.

00:21:38.128 --> 00:21:39.010
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.990
And so Spotify is
collecting this information.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.920
iTunes is collecting
this information.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.610
Apple, Pandora, all
these people are

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.030
collecting this information.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.660
And the artists
themselves is still

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.990
living like a Neanderthal,
right, in terms of, like, data.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.740
It's like, OK,
I've got this song.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.390
I'm going to just spray
it into the universe

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.790
and pray that someone
listens to it,

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.130
and pray that someone
buys it, and pray

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.680
that my idea or my cool
gimmick to go viral actually

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.360
gets it widespread enough
that the people that actually

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.700
get it and share it will
eventually feel like,

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.030
oh, OK, I should probably
support this, right?

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.800
And in order to find
success in that way,

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.940
you have to have
ridiculous scale, right?

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.580
And so when you look at,
like, streaming revenue,

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:33.320
or you look at my-- as a Google
partner on YouTube, the revenue

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.920
that I get from
hundreds of thousands

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.300
of YouTube views per month, it's
like a couple hundred bucks,

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:39.900
right?

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.880
And so unless you can get to
ridiculously massive scale,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.010
the little trickling
in-- and that's

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.720
even for me, because I'm going
direct-- the little trickling

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.870
in is just-- it seems like,
man, I can't make a living off

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:52.680
of this, right?

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.660
And then it even
becomes more challenging

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.260
if you sign to somebody,
because what trickles in

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.980
is after everybody else
takes their cut, right?

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.930
And so the idea here is that
if you think about a phone

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.670
number as your most
powerful social handle,

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.780
how much different would
your life be if you actually

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.740
did have a phone number on
every Instagram follower,

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.130
so that when you actually
saw some photographer's

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.750
photo that you really
liked, you could actually

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.970
text them and say, yo,
my wedding is coming up.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.100
Yo, you're so ill.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.760
Would you mind shooting me
and the love of my life?

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.720
I love to be
immortalized in pictures

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.690
through your creativity.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.270
But you know, what
I've been finding

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.951
is that artists and people
who are on Instagram,

00:23:35.951 --> 00:23:37.700
they're scared to
communicate with people.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.140
It's, like, not cool to
jump into your contacts.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.840
You know, jump into your
comment thread per se, right?

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.300
Unless you have
a private profile

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.508
and you've only got your
friends that are commenting.

00:23:48.508 --> 00:23:50.620
Oh, why would I want to
talk to a stranger, right?

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.150
But the idea here is
that-- two things.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:59.850
One, growing up, two ways that
I thought the American education

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.340
system failed me, right.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.250
Number one is they don't teach
financial literacy in schools,

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.750
right?

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.280
So unless your parents or
somebody-- like my parents

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.770
were just like don't
even get a credit card.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.000
Don't borrow from anybody.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.520
So that was their financial
literacy training, right?

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.700
And then I got to college,
and all the tables were set up

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.870
outside of Bank of America.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:22.420
Oh.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.650
go ahead and sign up for
points and everything.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.580
And you know, you're going
to get this kind of limit.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.277
And that new stereo
system that you

00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:30.735
want to have in
your dorm room, you

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.645
can go ahead and get
it right now, today.

00:24:32.645 --> 00:24:34.270
And then you don't
even have a job yet,

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.500
and then you're cleaning toilets
to pay for your stereo system.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.560
I mean, they don't-- I felt like
the American education system

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.240
failed me because it doesn't
teach financial literacy.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.750
It doesn't teach you how
important having a good credit

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.750
score is so when
you move to New York

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.970
and you want to get your lease
and you don't have somebody

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.970
to cosign for you and your
credit score is less than 600,

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.879
you're all the way messed up.

00:24:56.879 --> 00:24:57.920
You know what I'm saying?

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.790
All the way gone.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.367
And I felt like the American
education system failed me.

00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:02.450
They didn't teach me that.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.380
And then number two, I felt
like it doesn't teach you

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.930
about networking, right?

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.860
You don't learn in
school like-- you know,

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.410
there's maybe like
team-building activities.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:13.710
You play some sports teams.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.320
You go and play on tennis,
and you play soccer

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.540
and do wrestling team.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.712
And you try to get
with cheerleaders

00:25:19.712 --> 00:25:21.920
and all kinds of stuff in
high school and everything.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.570
And there's like these social
sort of like microcosms

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.690
which then become
later on the same.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.260
So it's like, you know, the
high school prom king and queen

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.314
is like the equivalent of, like,
the biggest Instagram stars

00:25:35.314 --> 00:25:36.980
today, or the biggest
movie stars today.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:42.046
Like, it just keeps
getting increasingly more--

00:25:42.046 --> 00:25:44.740
how should I say--
challenging to get, like,

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.170
at the top of the social
consciousness, if you will,

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:47.879
right?

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.920
But they don't teach you
about networking, right?

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.780
So once again, you're either
taught this because, you know,

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.790
your family is
well-connected and then,

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.626
when you needed to
get your internship,

00:25:58.626 --> 00:26:00.250
your dad picked up
the phone and called

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.520
a friend who worked
at a biotech firm

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.940
so that you could go be an
intern at the biotech firm,

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.480
et cetera.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.480
Or, you get what I get when
I go and interview kids

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.840
that look like me that
are in the inner cities,

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.110
or people that want
to be interns for me

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.900
and wouldn't get a job because
they dropped out of school

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.740
or they dropped out
of college or they

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.040
lost their athletic
scholarship, so they're not

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.170
qualified for jobs.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.130
They want to work
hard, and I ask

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.870
them-- you know, we
would ask these kids,

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.480
we'd say, what do you believe
is the biggest chal-- what

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.820
are the two biggest challenges
that you believe you face

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.580
between who you are today
and who you would like to be,

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.530
right?

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:42.040
And the two biggest
challenges unequivocally

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.080
are I feel like I
don't have the money,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.510
and I feel like I
don't have the network.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.710
And I say well, wow,
that correlates exactly

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.590
to the two biggest
failures to me of the US,

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.160
you know, American
education system.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:04.520
One, you know, having money in
your savings account is cool,

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.487
but having access
to money from-- you

00:27:06.487 --> 00:27:08.570
know, because I just raised
a round, having access

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.250
to money from
investors, or being

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.870
able to go get a loan has a
lot to do with your ability

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.495
to prove your fiscal
responsibility,

00:27:16.495 --> 00:27:18.370
that you're actually
not going to go and take

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.078
somebody's money.

00:27:19.078 --> 00:27:20.160
Oh, man.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.440
And the music industry
I guess is kind of,

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.630
you know, it's a funny--
it's really funny,

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.275
because people will
take their advance,

00:27:26.275 --> 00:27:30.140
you know-- I think
Kanye said, you know,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.490
I went to [? Jacob ?] an
hour after I got my advance.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.610
Right?

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.000
He just went straight on in.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.250
Wow, you know, I don't even
have to do this on credit.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.520
I got an advance check,
and it's not a loan.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.570
I can just pay it back
over my tiny record

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:44.980
royalties, et cetera.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.840
And so like, that's all very
interesting and everything.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.260
But bringing it
back to SuperPhone,

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.910
I think that, as
a startup founder,

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:58.070
you think about the
challenge that you

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.270
want to solve for, the
way that you really

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.830
want to give to the world.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:07.060
And so when I was growing
up and coming out of school,

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.220
the idea that I thought I
could give to the world,

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.330
or the value I thought I could
give to the world at that time

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.690
was, I can give value to
the world because I get up,

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.070
do a little rap, sing a
little song, make some beats,

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.304
make the world dance,
bring people together,

00:28:21.304 --> 00:28:22.720
they're going to
have a good time.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.410
And then I realized that
that impact was finite.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.230
And the reason it
was finite because--

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.080
is because it was subjective.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.490
Because if people don't like rap
and R&amp;B music, you lose them.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.600
Even though yeah,
they might say,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.680
oh, man, Ryan's really
talented on keys,

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.850
or I really like the beats
he makes, or he dresses cool,

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:46.560
or his music video was awesome,
creativity and art in many ways

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.910
is subjective, right?

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:51.470
And that's why I
guess I would always

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:55.430
be challenged with this idea
that the music business isn't

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.560
a meritocracy.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.200
As much as I've spent into
like spending time trying

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.930
to make the most incredible,
awesome beats of all time,

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:09.620
or I watch friends of mine
that were horn players or bass

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.350
players from Juilliard,
it wasn't that

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.800
the most talented, most
prolific, most proficient

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.840
musicians were the ones that
made all the money, right?

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.129
How many amazing bass
players do we know?

00:29:22.129 --> 00:29:23.920
How many amazing guitar
players do we know?

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.420
How many amazing singers,
you know, hairbrush singers

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.740
do we know, right?

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.960
They're not making the money.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.770
And now the beautiful
thing about social,

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.320
the beautiful thing about
YouTube, the beautiful thing

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.750
about the internet is that
you might have the chance

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.080
to go from being a water
bottle singer to being

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.730
on the forefront of, you know,
the global consciousness,

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:44.320
right?

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.690
But nine times out of 10, that
moment is so fleeting, right?

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.360
So like, I remember that
viral video of the lady.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.710
She went to Kohl's, she
put on the Chewbacca mask,

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.793
and she's just laughing
and laughing and laughing.

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:57.780
And I shared it, and
everybody shared it.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.660
And today, people
remember it, but do

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.140
we feel connected to that
little moment of fame?

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.470
Do we feel connected?

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.560
Do we want to-- is she
making more Chewbacca skits?

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.340
Like, what's actually
happening now, right?

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.370
And yeah, I think that
everybody has their-- you know,

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.390
maybe Warhol called
it 15 minutes.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.410
Maybe it's now five seconds or
five minutes or whatever it is.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.485
But once again, the
idea, two things.

00:30:23.485 --> 00:30:25.360
One is it would've been
great if she actually

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.050
had, like, a SuperPhone number
or something so that she could

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.460
stay in touch with everybody.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.880
But once again, I
started to realize,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.210
like I said, being
a startup founder,

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.580
what was the way that I could
impact the world the most,

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.080
right?

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.350
And not actually being
a startup founder,

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:41.070
just being a person in general.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.580
What's the way I can
impact the world the most.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:49.100
And so initially, I said,
look, my talent and my passion

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.530
first and foremost is music.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.900
And like, I could
have been a doctor

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.530
or I could have
been an economist

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.064
or I could have been
a political scientist

00:30:59.064 --> 00:31:01.730
or I could have been a lawyer or
I could have been a Wall Street

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.840
trader, right, but
my interest was

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.620
trying to give the most value
I possibly could to the world.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.050
And so when I saw people
responding to the music, when

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.870
I see 2,000 people
at Olympia in Paris

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.010
all rapping along
to the same songs,

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.950
and we rashing out on
stage and Gabe is playing

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.629
and John is playing
and Keith is playing

00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:21.920
and people are having a great
time and they're sweating

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.670
and having an awesome
time, I realized

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:28.950
that my reach, once again,
is not scalable, right?

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.660
I can only be in one
city-- well, maybe.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.790
I can probably do to
cities a night, right?

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.680
And give a two-hour
concert at that level.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.050
And even though I'm inspiring
people that are actually

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.330
in the room, that value,
once again, when I really

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.220
start thinking-- you
know, Ben Horowitz

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.070
introduced me to Larry Page.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.410
Ben Horowitz introduced
me to Mark Zuckerberg.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.440
And when you really start
thinking about scalability

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.180
of your impact, I
realized, OK, my impact,

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.310
if I got to be Kanye West, is
going to be finite, you know,

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.750
because even though
Kanye is my homie,

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.980
and he's a polarizing figure and
a lot of people know who he is,

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.590
some people just tune out in
terms of what actual value

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.270
they feel like they
extract from a Kanye record

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.960
or a Kanye concert or
a Kanye fashion design.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.720
Because even still,
like those choices

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.530
that we make around the
clothes that we wear

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.030
is still subjective.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.710
So what is it that
I could actually

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.710
give to the entire world that
would actually be valuable,

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:29.250
right?

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.850
And what I started
to understand when

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.310
I started giving my phone
number out to everyone

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:41.510
was that technology could extend
my ability to manage and keep

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.540
my relationships warm, right?

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.030
I said wow, this is insane.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:48.580
Like, I could actually just
set a reminder every two weeks

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.230
and just say yo to my
mom every two weeks.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.900
It was just a reminder, right?

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.810
And so even though, as
crazy as my life would get,

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.750
or, you know, I'm juggling music
and being a startup founder

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:02.455
or whatever, every two weeks,
technology would send that,

00:33:02.455 --> 00:33:04.670
and it's called a
phatic expression.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:05.390
Small talk.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.810
It would send it to my mom.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:10.600
And I wouldn't have to
worry about the actual sort

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:16.210
of mundane task of going to my
phone, navigating to my mom,

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.460
clicking that, typing yo,
and sending it, right?

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.020
And I wouldn't have to
worry about actually setting

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:26.340
a reminder for myself in my
Google calendar to, you know,

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.500
send a message to my mom.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.880
Just, you know, no
matter what's going on,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.796
send a message to her.

00:33:29.796 --> 00:33:30.870
It could actually do it.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.040
And that's also
kind of polarizing.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.580
If you say, oh,
that's not personal.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.680
The value of that exchange
is not the phatic expression.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.250
It's not the small talk.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.094
It's the initiation
of a conversation

00:33:42.094 --> 00:33:44.510
that's going to be immediate,
that's going to inspire you.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.350
My mom is going to say,
hey, how you doing?

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.500
I'm praying for you.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.610
I see you out here trying
to change the world.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.560
Keep going.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.800
Your father and I,
we're proud of you.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:58.150
The yo, the action,
that's an action that

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.790
can be scaled, right?

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:03.160
And so I started to
realize that SuperPhone

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.600
and in the idea of
SuperPhone, I could also

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.310
offer to the world
something that's valuable,

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:11.989
that's objectively valuable.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:13.210
It's not subjective.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.320
It's not is this
valuable or not.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.400
It's not like my rap song,
do you like it or not.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.610
It's not like my
cool Nike sneakers,

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:20.610
do you like them or not.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:23.409
It's not like my Rolex
watch or my Ray-bans,

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.530
do you like them or not.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.980
Will you pay for them or not.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.428
Objectively, there
isn't a person

00:34:32.428 --> 00:34:34.219
that I've talked to,
that I've interviewed,

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.980
that I've run into
that doesn't find value

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.719
from a warm relationship.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.980
And won't find value from
having more warm relationships

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:49.449
in arenas and spheres and
verticals and pathways

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.710
that they would like
to go down, right?

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:59.110
So if you are a
singer and you have,

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:03.170
attached to your powerful social
handle, you have 3,000 people,

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.520
and they're all college
and high school kids,

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.890
and then you're a singer and you
only have four people attached

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:12.290
to your social handle,
and those four people are

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.920
Craig Kallman, who's the CEO and
chairman of Atlantic Records,

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.770
and Scooter Braun, and Troy
Carter, and Ryan Leslie,

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:23.180
which one of those
two artists would you

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.110
say is more equipped
to actually achieve

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.880
their dream of whatever they
want to do artistically, right?

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.500
The person with the
3,000 followers, or 3,000

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.030
phone numbers of college kids
and high school kids that

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.225
think they're cool,
or the person that

00:35:39.225 --> 00:35:42.170
just has four or five phone
numbers, and you know,

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:46.010
it's the CEO and chairman of a
large record company, a music

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.720
producer, and two
great music managers.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.180
I would argue that a warm
relationship with those four

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.930
people versus a cold
relationship with tens

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.540
of thousands of other
people is actually

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.880
going to trump the person that
has all the big relationships,

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.010
or the big audience per se.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:10.600
And so how is it that technology
could potentially give you

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.920
the support for--
that can actually

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.890
counteract the
restrictions that you have

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.460
in your own mental capacity?

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.900
KEITH WRIGHT: So
this right here,

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.550
I think it can be used
by almost any type

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:26.670
of public figure, and
possibly even brands, right?

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.319
It's a way of looking
at SMS that many

00:36:29.319 --> 00:36:30.485
have looked at social media.

00:36:30.485 --> 00:36:31.794
RYAN LESLIE: Right.

00:36:31.794 --> 00:36:33.460
KEITH WRIGHT: It's a
traditional channel

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.720
that's being used in new ways.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.100
And again, you're talking
about a lot of relevant things

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.360
to Google, whether
you know it or not.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.040
You got scalability.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.420
You're talking about a
personalized CRM database.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.251
You're talking about
segmenting audiences.

00:36:49.251 --> 00:36:50.000
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
KEITH WRIGHT: I actually
do business development

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.070
for Google Analytics 360.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.964
So that's well
within my wheelhouse.

00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:57.880
And that's what we're
doing with large brands.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.660
RYAN LESLIE: Right.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.025
KEITH WRIGHT: But you're also
talking about machine learning,

00:37:01.025 --> 00:37:01.650
as well.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:02.530
RYAN LESLIE: Yes.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:03.650
KEITH WRIGHT:
Artificial intelligence.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.950
RYAN LESLIE: Yes.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.410
KEITH WRIGHT: Being
able to develop

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:09.010
a seemingly one-on-one
relationship with many people

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:10.550
at scale.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.420
So I guess a
question I have is--

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:17.039
let's focus again on
the startup musician,

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:18.080
the independent musician.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.780
RYAN LESLIE: OK.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.154
KEITH WRIGHT:
Like, how would you

00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:24.430
advise a newcomer to the
scene who possibly has

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.280
a lot of talent and could
develop a large user

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.170
base over the course of a couple
years, how would you advise

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:35.640
them in starting out their
mission to become a star,

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.210
I guess, in terms of
managing their database

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.611
and managing their
audience and so forth?

00:37:40.611 --> 00:37:42.735
RYAN LESLIE: So I would
say-- and I do these talks,

00:37:42.735 --> 00:37:44.480
you know, I have
done these talks,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.442
is that like-- first
and foremost, you know,

00:37:49.442 --> 00:37:51.150
to have a warm
relationship with someone,

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.590
there's got to be a value,
a cool value exchange.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.200
So you might meet
somebody at a bar

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.837
and, you know, you're
talking to them,

00:37:56.837 --> 00:37:57.920
what's the value exchange?

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.860
Can you make some
money together?

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.600
Is there a romantic connection?

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.155
You know, what's
the value exchange?

00:38:05.155 --> 00:38:07.040
Is it just a cool conversation?

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.060
Do they make you laugh?

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.770
Or whatever.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.920
And so the beauty
of being a musician

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.710
is that, for people that
do like the kind of music

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.230
you make, that value
exchange is instant, right?

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.050
I like this song.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.140
I like the way they sing.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.920
Cool, you know,
you keep singing,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.275
and I'm going to be your friend.

00:38:23.275 --> 00:38:25.460
There's that kind
of vibe, right?

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:29.380
But what I would say is that a
lot of folks, they come to me

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.700
and they say, Ryan, can
you listen to my demo?

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:37.530
And once again, that requires
my most precious resource,

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:38.600
which is time.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.320
And so I have to
think to myself, OK,

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.800
what are the indicators to
me that I might actually

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.590
love their music?

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:48.750
I might love the way they sing,
and I love their guitar riffs

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.920
or whatever it is.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.620
But what actually-- you
know, what can I actually do?

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.960
Let's say I love it so much
that I even buy their album.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.750
At that point,
the value exchange

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.980
isn't the $10 I gave
them for the album.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.540
The value exchange
is-- you know,

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.640
I got a kid right now who's
building his music career.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.990
His name is William Bolton.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.750
He's an early SuperPhone user.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.140
He has more phone
numbers than he

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.620
has Instagram followers, right?

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.690
And he just played Firefly.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:17.190
You know?

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.360
And he's a grind-- he
went to Boston College.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.350
He grinds.

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:21.135
He loves music.

00:39:21.135 --> 00:39:22.490
He's playing all the time.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:26.680
But I think the most
valuable tidbit of wisdom

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.130
that I ever imparted to him
was this idea of relationship

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.090
management, personal
relationship management.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:35.380
From the first time
that someone texts you,

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.120
can you take a look at the graph
of, you know, when is there

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.377
a flurry of text messages?

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:41.960
When is there a
flurry of phone calls?

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.750
How long does it go before you
have another flurry of text

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:48.220
messages or phone calls?

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.030
And you need to
build a core team.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.770
And I would say,
like, before you go

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:57.605
and decide to build the largest
audience you possibly can,

00:39:57.605 --> 00:39:59.730
who are the people that
make up your core team that

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.938
are the most valuable to you?

00:40:00.938 --> 00:40:03.240
So when you think
of a new artist,

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.840
I would say there's
a few people.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.450
Unless you're a self-contained--
let's say all you do is rap.

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:09.580
You just rap.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:11.430
You need a producer, right?

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:14.135
But it doesn't mean that
the first producer you find

00:40:14.135 --> 00:40:16.760
is going to have enough time to
produce all your beats for you.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.180
So you actually need to have
a warm relationship with five

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.640
producers, or 10
producers, right?

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.360
And maybe one of them might
be Ryan Leslie or Mike Will

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.120
or Brian Cox or Timbaland
or Pharrell or whatever,

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.610
if you got so lucky.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:33.240
But the beauty of it is that
you can go on SoundCloud

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.400
and find five or 10
really-- that's what

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.120
happened with Desiigner, right?

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.010
"Panda."

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:42.950
He found a record-- I think
it was on SoundCloud--

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:44.540
from a producer
and, you know, he

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.500
turned that-- he found it
wasn't a Timbaland record.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.050
It wasn't a Swizz Beatz record.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.930
It wasn't a Pharrell or Kanye
West beat or Ryan Leslie beat.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.150
It was-- I don't remember
the name of the kid,

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:58.970
but he found a beat that
worked for him, right?

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:02.420
And so that's number one, how
many producers do you know?

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.500
Because if you rap,
you need great beats.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.940
And then once you put the
beats together with the raps,

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.871
how many great
engineers do you know?

00:41:09.871 --> 00:41:11.370
And when I talk
about engineers, I'm

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.828
talking about studio
engineers that

00:41:12.828 --> 00:41:14.432
can mix your record
so that it sounds

00:41:14.432 --> 00:41:16.640
competitive with everything
else that's on the radio.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.150
If you only know one, that guy
better be your best friend.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:25.080
Otherwise, invest the time to
go find four or five, right?

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.850
And have warm
relationships with them.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:28.590
SuperPhone can help
you do it, right?

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:32.192
And then once you've got a
great song, then it's about,

00:41:32.192 --> 00:41:34.400
OK, how do you want to
present the song to the world?

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.920
Like, OK, we're in a
visual time, right?

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.940
So you could just
put it on SoundCloud,

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.930
but at least you've got
to put a cover, right?

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:42.770
It could be just
a picture of you,

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.090
but even if it's just
a picture of you,

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:46.661
how many photographers
do you know?

00:41:46.661 --> 00:41:48.160
You know, are you
just going to do--

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.618
are you going to make your
album cover with a selfie stick,

00:41:50.618 --> 00:41:51.150
right?

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.062
Who knows, right?

00:41:52.062 --> 00:41:53.020
That might be creative.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.561
I don't know.

00:41:53.561 --> 00:41:54.830
Like, people love indie stuff.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.020
Oh, he made his album
cover with a selfie stick.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.100
You know?

00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.456
Whatever that is.

00:41:59.456 --> 00:42:00.830
But how many
photographers do you

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.010
know, beyond yourself,
who are actually

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.140
dope that's going to
add to your art, right?

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.310
If you only know one, maybe
it's worth going to-- you know,

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:10.060
reaching out to a few
people on Instagram,

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:13.800
whatever, finding four or five
and having warm relationships

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.850
with those photographers.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.760
Because they might not
always be on call when

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.002
you are-- you know,
you're at the Googleplex

00:42:20.002 --> 00:42:20.960
and you get to talking.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.580
And you know, oh, man, I need
somebody to just take a picture

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.412
and memorialize this moment.

00:42:25.412 --> 00:42:27.120
If one's not available,
it's good to have

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.300
a warm relationship with
two or three, right?

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.020
And then once you've
got the photograph

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.680
and you've got the
song and you've

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.819
got the producer and
everything's looking good,

00:42:34.819 --> 00:42:36.110
now you've got to make a video.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:37.568
How many videographers
do you know?

00:42:37.568 --> 00:42:39.010
Hopefully maybe
the photographers

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:41.327
are also videographers
or editors or post-pro--

00:42:41.327 --> 00:42:43.410
and maybe now you want to
add some special effects

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:43.993
to your video.

00:42:43.993 --> 00:42:45.980
How many post-production
people do you know?

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.880
And the reason why
I'm saying this

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.830
is that you could actually
just buy all of this, right?

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.800
You just go buy a beat.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.910
You just go buy a photo shoot.

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.960
You just go buy studio time.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.930
You just go buy,
you know, the time

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.570
from a post-production house
to do your after-effects

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:05.389
and all your other
post-production.

00:43:05.389 --> 00:43:07.680
But if you're independent
artist, nine times out of 10,

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.090
you can't afford to do that.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:10.590
You don't have the
money to do that.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.300
What you do have is time.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.960
And what time allows
you to do, time

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.540
allows you to build
relationship equity.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:22.270
Because that's the beauty
of the sort of like pyramid

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.540
of relationships.

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.480
The top of the pyramid, the
most intimate human interaction

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.950
is sex, right?

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:30.590
The next level of the
pyramid is, you know,

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:34.867
like a one-on-one studio session
or a one-on-one dinner or, you

00:43:34.867 --> 00:43:35.980
know--

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.360
KEITH WRIGHT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.860
RYAN LESLIE: But we see
where it's going, right?

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.150
KEITH WRIGHT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.190
RYAN LESLIE: Anyway.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.580
But speaking to
somebody one-on-one,

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.630
where you have their
undivided attention, that's

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:44.890
the next level, right?

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:48.260
And then the next level is maybe
a group conversation, right?

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.470
But then, as you get more
and more people around,

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.410
like some people say
you can't have dinner

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:55.910
with more than six people,
because the conversations break

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.410
up and then you
just have two people

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.570
on one end of the
table talking, and then

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.127
the people aren't all actually--
you can't actually all,

00:44:02.127 --> 00:44:03.960
unless you're playing
Monopoly or something,

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.230
how you actually get
everybody together

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.382
all on the same page,
focused on the same thing.

00:44:08.382 --> 00:44:10.215
People have their-- in
dinner conversations,

00:44:10.215 --> 00:44:13.050
they have their own little
breakoff little conversations.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:17.704
Or even if you went with a group
of six people to Six Flags,

00:44:17.704 --> 00:44:19.120
and there's plenty
of people there

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.460
and you can interact
with all of them,

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.910
but you spend the whole day with
just your little party of six,

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:23.410
right?

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:26.750
So you know, there's the
closest human interaction.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.100
Then there's
one-on-one, in person.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.150
Then there's group.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.620
Then there's larger
group interaction.

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:37.860
So even right now, if I walked
out of this Googleplex today

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.970
and I got hit by a
car, you guys are

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:42.660
going to feel it
more because you just

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.790
had a human, a real in-person
human interaction with me.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:49.430
And you'll feel it more than
if you were just following me

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:52.300
on Twitter and you read it,
hey, Ryan Leslie got run over

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.400
by a yellow cab, right?

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.730
You'll feel it more
because you're like, man,

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.230
I was just-- he was just
right there in person, right?

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:03.990
So those in-person
interactions, they require time.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.670
It just costs time.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.494
And this is time you
can't ever get back.

00:45:07.494 --> 00:45:08.910
Time's the most
valuable resource.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:09.910
It's always running out.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:11.180
You will not ever get it back.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.138
You can get money back.

00:45:12.138 --> 00:45:15.410
I could spend $5 on
this bottle of water,

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:17.180
and then I could go make $5.

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.200
But the time that I
spend making the $5,

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.500
I can't get it back, right?

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:27.720
So there's a ridiculous
finite amount of investment

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.620
that you can make in
these sort of, like,

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.670
deep personal interactions.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:35.010
But the beauty of the
return on that investment

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.809
is that people will
do stuff for free.

00:45:37.809 --> 00:45:39.850
But it's not really for
free, because they've got

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:41.200
to invest their time to do it.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.820
But now they feel like
there's a value exchange.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.660
They feel like it's real.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.570
So then it goes
down to like, OK,

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:53.090
I work with some of my
engineers over, like,

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.570
phone calls or video chat.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:55.715
So that's the next level.

00:45:55.715 --> 00:45:58.470
And then after that, I would
say text messaging, right?

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.430
And when we talk about the
strength of the engagement,

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:03.010
or the strength of
the interaction,

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.590
I'm talking about it
because it comes down

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:09.430
to the strength of the
engagement or interaction is

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:13.460
the time of expected response.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.910
This is my thesis.

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.650
The time of expected response.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:19.910
So if I asked you right
now, hey, Keith, man,

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:21.460
what are you doing after this?

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.542
You want to get some pizza?

00:46:24.542 --> 00:46:25.500
KEITH WRIGHT: I'm busy.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:25.640
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.650
KEITH WRIGHT: I
got some meetings.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:26.920
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.610
You've got, yeah.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:28.060
KEITH WRIGHT: Yeah.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.143
RYAN LESLIE: But you
responded immediately, right?

00:46:30.143 --> 00:46:32.530
And that's expected, because
we're sitting right here.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:34.320
If you took 10
minutes to respond,

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.340
I might call an
ambulance, right?

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.020
Man, Keith is just
staring at me.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.570
So the time of
expected response,

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.650
that's how you can
measure, like, sort of

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:49.290
like the power of the
relationship exchange.

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:52.290
So if you're making
love with someone,

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:53.940
and they just are
not responding,

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.280
you really gonna call--
you're just like, oh man,

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.063
is this a corpse.

00:46:57.063 --> 00:46:58.146
KEITH WRIGHT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:58.146 --> 00:47:00.890
RYAN LESLIE: What's
happening, right?

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:05.690
But OK, so it goes from
in person to video.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.050
So if there's video chat
and I say, yo, Keith,

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:08.200
what are you doing?

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.010
You've still got to
respond immediately.

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.590
On the phone, you've still
got to respond immediately.

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:15.820
But the next layer down,
and even though messaging

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.600
is so powerful, it's not
as powerful as a phone call

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.510
or whatever, because the
expected time of response

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.050
isn't immediate.

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.572
If I send a text message to
Keith and I say, yo, Keith,

00:47:25.572 --> 00:47:27.280
what are you doing
after the Google Talk?

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.571
Do you want to have some pizza?

00:47:28.571 --> 00:47:30.380
And it takes him 10
minutes to respond,

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.220
we don't think about it.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.220
Oh, it was 10 minutes.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.678
He must have been
busy or whatever.

00:47:34.678 --> 00:47:36.430
And then it kind of
goes down from there.

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:40.360
Because email, like I can send
emails to people, or in-mail,

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.660
right, and I don't even expect
a response sometimes, especially

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.660
if it's a cold email, right?

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:49.090
And then social, maybe
even weaker, right?

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:52.910
And so for a kid that
doesn't have money,

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.435
the resource that
they do have is time.

00:47:55.435 --> 00:47:58.400
And they can invest that time
in building relationships.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.520
And sometimes, it's great
to shoot for the stars.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.269
Y'all want to be friends
with Ryan Leslie.

00:48:02.269 --> 00:48:03.090
OK, try your luck.

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.840
Go ahead and text
me, see what happens.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.750
You know, if you're
persistent, trust me,

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.250
I've made a lot of
great friendships

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.780
from people just sending
me a text, hey, Ryan,

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:10.732
I saw you talk.

00:48:10.732 --> 00:48:11.940
I thought it was fascinating.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:12.930
I'm a developer.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:14.160
I'm an investor.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.630
I'm an adviser.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:17.600
I'm a musician.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.530
I'm a manager.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:19.780
I'm a producer.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.160
I'm a-- you know, I'm
a college kid that

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.630
just wants to help my network.

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.350
I love all of those
conversations.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:29.430
But I can't scale my day
to more than 24 hours

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:30.500
to reach more people.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.360
So I need a layer of technology
to help me prioritize

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.120
how I spend my time, right?

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.860
But that's what I would say
to a kid that's-- you know,

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.180
if they're trying to make it.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.470
It's not necessarily about,
you know-- first of all,

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.040
it is about the value exchange.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.690
What are you doing
that's valuable.

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.120
How do you make your
artistic expression

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.270
the most potent,
undiluted concentrated

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:53.390
artistic expression that's
powerful that people

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:55.310
can respond to that's honest.

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:58.890
And then, what's your
internal core team.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:02.410
And then after that, when
someone does actually

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.200
interface with your
creativity, what

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.590
are you doing to cultivate
that relationship with them?

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:08.923
So for me, it was pretty simple.

00:49:08.923 --> 00:49:10.290
Hey, who are you?

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:12.490
Would you like to get my album?

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:13.944
Thank you for getting my album.

00:49:13.944 --> 00:49:15.485
When I'm playing
your city, I'm going

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:16.800
to send you a text, right?

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.750
And least I'm able to
do that at scale, right?

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:21.762
I'm not able to do
concerts at scale.

00:49:21.762 --> 00:49:23.220
I can only do one
per night, right,

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.230
because I've got to travel,
I've got to be there in person.

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:26.960
People are not going
to pay to just watch

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.700
me perform on a screen.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.260
They could do that
at home, right?

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.800
So that's what I would say
for a musician is like, OK,

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.570
once you've got your
value proposition,

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:38.490
then you can also--
you know, we're

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:44.900
going to start working with
major record companies, right?

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:49.520
And not because I want to
dilute at all the message

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.840
of SuperPhone really
being for everyone,

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.420
because everyone can
benefit from having

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.590
warmer relationships.

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:57.670
But we're going to start
with record companies,

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:59.965
right, because that's just
something music, people who

00:49:59.965 --> 00:50:01.980
are pursuing music, that's
something that's near

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:02.950
and dear to my heart.

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:07.205
And so it becomes very
transparent for an A&amp;R,

00:50:07.205 --> 00:50:09.100
an artist and
repertoire person who's

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.100
signing an act to say, how
well are you cultivating

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.850
the audience that you have?

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.330
How well are you engaging with
the audience that you have?

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:20.850
How well-- how many SuperPhone
numbers do you have?

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:22.050
How engaged are they?

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.540
How many of them actually buy?

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.100
How many show up to
shows, et cetera?

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.600
Now you can make
informed decisions

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.000
about whether or not to make
an investment in someone.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.430
And that's the same thing
that venture capitalists do.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:34.990
They want to know your
month over month growth,

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:36.750
whether it's a monthly
recurring revenue.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:39.080
You know, your
dropoff, your churn.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.880
You know, they want
to know these things.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.300
And up to this point,
you know, unless you

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.310
were Master P or
Cash Money Records

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.830
back in the day and you--
people saying how are you riding

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:50.910
around in all these cars?

00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:53.730
Oh, I sold 100,000 records
out the back of my trunk.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:56.110
Well, there's something
that's very clearly

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:58.090
correlated with selling
a lot of records,

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:00.210
and then that's why
they made these sort

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.800
of like outsized deals
with Universal Records,

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.860
and millions of
dollars, et cetera.

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.579
But besides that, how do you
make a decision on someone

00:51:08.579 --> 00:51:09.870
when you're going to sign them?

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:13.450
And so the other piece of it
is that like, as humans, we're

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:14.830
just irrational, right.

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:17.370
We make emotional
decisions, right?

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:22.300
So if I'm really close to, like
I said Craig Kallman, who's

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:26.000
the CEO of Atlantic, and he
sees me working really hard

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.400
and, you know, and we're
close and maybe, I don't know,

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.250
maybe I'm a janitor.

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:31.430
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:32.929
But I'm going to
actually find a way

00:51:32.929 --> 00:51:34.805
to spend some face time
with him and say, yo,

00:51:34.805 --> 00:51:35.845
man, I've got my concert.

00:51:35.845 --> 00:51:36.770
Here's my video.

00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:37.910
He's my everything.

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:42.320
And he actually likes the music,
I don't care how much the other

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.780
A&amp;Rs are going to try
to turn this down.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.080
Humans are empathetic.

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:51.190
So when you look at
early-stage startups,

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:52.820
they say well, look,
we love the idea,

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:55.050
but we're going to invest
in the founder, right?

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:58.350
Because the founder came in and
he had such a compelling story,

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:00.490
he doesn't have any
month over month growth,

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:03.195
he doesn't have any revenue,
he doesn't have any numbers,

00:52:03.195 --> 00:52:06.150
he-- you know, he might
have a really bad [? NVP. ?]

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:08.880
But he's so passionate
about what he wants to do,

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.960
how he wants to
change the world,

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.646
and he was going to
work 20 hours a day,

00:52:13.646 --> 00:52:15.612
so, you know, some
investors are going

00:52:15.612 --> 00:52:18.090
to make an irrational
emotional--

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:19.610
and I've done it myself.

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:22.300
I'll write a check just
because I like the founder.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:22.890
I think they're
going to work hard,

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:24.280
I think they'll figure it out.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:29.060
They want to be an entrepreneur,
and they have the stomach

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.370
and they have what it takes to
pivot if their original idea

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:33.920
doesn't work.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.520
I just want to invest
in somebody that's going

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.840
to change the world, right?

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.170
And so that's what I would say.

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:40.890
Whether you're a startup
founder, you're a creator,

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:43.850
you are a jewelry
designer, you're

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:47.020
starting a Shopify store, you
want to start a teaching class,

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:49.495
you're an author,
you're a script writer,

00:52:49.495 --> 00:52:52.910
you're a movie person, you
know, whatever you want to do,

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:55.300
you want to actually
raise money for a charity

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.460
or whatever you want
to do, it comes down

00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:07.630
to ideas are infinitely
more powerful based on who

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.270
they're attached to, right.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.627
Who are they attached to.

00:53:10.627 --> 00:53:13.210
KEITH WRIGHT: I think we have a
little bit more time that we'd

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:16.264
like to actually invest into
some audience questions.

00:53:16.264 --> 00:53:17.180
RYAN LESLIE: OK, sure.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:17.660
Yeah, sure.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.240
KEITH WRIGHT: So
I definitely want

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.280
to open it up to the
audience for a few questions.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.030
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:23.700
Thanks a lot, guys, for
being here for sure.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.130
AUDIENCE: Hey, Ryan.

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:26.320
Big fan.

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.910
So you've been very transparent.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.660
And I know that we're
running low on time,

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.640
but I will be, too.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.570
So I used to sing
backup at a label,

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:35.760
and I left because I thought
I was pretty good-- I think

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.030
I am still pretty good,
but the color of my skin

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.446
is quite different than most
people in the music industry.

00:53:40.446 --> 00:53:41.400
RYAN LESLIE: Right.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:41.900
AUDIENCE: Brown.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:42.535
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:42.535 --> 00:53:42.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.990
And I'm Indian, and I
wanted to keep my name.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:46.660
So like, I made some
personal choices,

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:49.252
and I left Hollywood
because it was, I mean,

00:53:49.252 --> 00:53:51.710
very, very superficial, and I
didn't want to play the game.

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:55.150
So I came to YouTube, and I've
been making music and stuff.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:56.550
But when I would
go to producers,

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:59.400
when I would go to
agents and A&amp;Rs,

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.705
they didn't really care
about how talented I was.

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:04.080
They just cared about how I
can position me in the market

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.059
to, like, sell lots of records.

00:54:06.059 --> 00:54:06.850
RYAN LESLIE: Right.

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:11.030
AUDIENCE: So I'm
wondering, like, one,

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:14.010
how do you feel about how music
is valued today, like we're

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:16.260
looking at, like, 6.9
billion compared to,

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.619
like, over 15 in the late '90s.

00:54:18.619 --> 00:54:19.410
RYAN LESLIE: Right.

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.580
AUDIENCE: And then,
like, is music just,

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:24.700
like, a front for, like,
selling other, like, t-shirts

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.320
and brands?

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.420
Or like are people,
you think, still going

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:30.540
to keep consistently
buy actual album?

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.340
Like not physical, but
like digital albums,

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.740
or are they just
going to consume music

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:35.040
through streaming platforms.

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:35.790
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:36.630
So I mean, listen.

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:39.260
I think human nature
is always going

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:42.790
to be challenging to convince
someone to buy something

00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:45.860
that they could be spending
that money on their kid,

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:49.350
their girlfriend, you know, some
other, like, real experience,

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:52.220
which is why the
bulk of music revenue

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:55.050
is happening from social
experiences, which is,

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.480
yo, on July the 9th, I'm going
to go to the Prudential Center,

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.040
and I'm going to go with
a couple of my buddies

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.300
who are not afraid to
say they're Justin Bieber

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.530
fans, right?

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:08.270
So that's-- and so that's
an experience, though.

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:10.504
You know, it is
about Justin Bieber,

00:55:10.504 --> 00:55:12.170
but at the end of the
day, it's actually

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.220
about the personal
value and experience

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.550
that you get from going to
the concert with somebody

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:18.880
that you care about.

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.540
And that's something that is
etched into the history of you

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.560
guys' relationship.

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.300
Because there's
a very low chance

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.460
that you're going to actually
shake hands with or hang out

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.550
with Justin Bieber after
the concert, right?

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:35.440
And so that's the beauty of
how music is valued, because I

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:39.930
think music-- I think that in
the end of-- when everything

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.510
is said and done, it's
about relationship building,

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:43.010
you know?

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:46.116
So the reason why it's
cool to like a Drake song

00:55:46.116 --> 00:55:47.990
is because everybody
knows it's a Drake song.

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:50.240
So when you're like, (SINGING)
baby, you my everything

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.880
or whatever, you know--
what's his record

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.680
that he has right now?

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.141
(SINGING) I need one dance.

00:55:57.141 --> 00:55:57.765
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:57.765 --> 00:55:58.931
RYAN LESLIE: Exactly, right?

00:55:58.931 --> 00:56:01.760
So people hear it, they respond,
thy all like that song, too.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.830
It breaks the barriers.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:03.920
It starts a relationship.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.990
That's the value, right?

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.830
And so what music can do
is bring people together,

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:10.720
but there needs to
be a value, I think,

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:15.000
beyond if you want the
musician to actually get money.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.440
The musician has to be able to
galvanize, energize, and bring

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.010
people together
for an experience

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:24.210
that they can pay for that's
actually just valuable to them

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:28.630
irrespective of if they
love the artist or not.

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:33.400
Like the thing is is that what's
crazy if you look at bands like

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:39.830
Phish or the Dave Matthews Band,
or you look at even like Iron

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:43.000
Maiden, you know, the people
who line up around the corner,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.240
it's because they don't--
they're not hanging out with

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.200
the lead singers of those bands,
but they sit around and listen

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.389
to those records together.

00:56:50.389 --> 00:56:51.180
They talk about it.

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:51.920
They analyze it.

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.950
Yo, this is so dope, et cetera.

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.150
And the value that
they're getting

00:56:57.150 --> 00:57:00.180
is that their relationship
is deepening because

00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.340
of these conversations
and their likemindedness

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.140
around the music.

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:08.940
So I would say like, look,
you know, I would say,

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:13.457
first and foremost, you know,
is Jay Sean-- is Jay Sean--

00:57:13.457 --> 00:57:15.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah, he
changed his name, though.

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:16.590
RYAN LESLIE: He
changed his name, yeah.

00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:17.120
OK, yeah.

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah. his real
name is Kamaljit Singh.

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:18.866
RYAN LESLIE: OK.

00:57:18.866 --> 00:57:19.242
All right.

00:57:19.242 --> 00:57:19.620
OK.

00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:20.120
Great.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:20.910
Yeah, yeah.

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:23.250
So I mean, look, you know,
at the end of the day,

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:25.990
it also comes down
to what do you

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:31.590
want to invest in order to
achieve your desired outcome,

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:32.380
right?

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:35.990
And so if you don't want
to compromise on it,

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:38.240
then that's an investment
that you don't want to make.

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.100
Like at the end of the day,
everything's an investment.

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:43.342
And every investment
is a compromise,

00:57:43.342 --> 00:57:45.800
because there's the opportunity
cost of what you could have

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.430
done with that money
or what you could

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:49.380
have done by keeping
your name or what

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.800
you could have done by spending
your time doing something

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.030
else, right?

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:54.680
And so it comes
down to what do you

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.223
want to invest to get what you
want out of life, you know?

00:57:58.223 --> 00:57:59.797
And so I don't
know if I'm really

00:57:59.797 --> 00:58:00.880
answering your questions--

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:01.740
AUDIENCE: All good.

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.380
RYAN LESLIE: --at all, but
I would say that, look,

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:04.940
you know--

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:06.170
AUDIENCE: I'll text
you, don't worry.

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.450
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:06.890
Send me a text.

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:07.580
Yeah, for sure.

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:08.955
We'll continue
that conversation.

00:58:08.955 --> 00:58:09.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:10.300
RYAN LESLIE: Great.

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:12.280
RYAN LESLIE: Thanks
for that question.

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:12.850
Yeah.

00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:13.576
KEITH WRIGHT:
Question over here.

00:58:13.576 --> 00:58:14.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:16.480
My question is also kind
of investment-related.

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.530
RYAN LESLIE: Sure.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:21.390
AUDIENCE: Congrats on
the Horowitz fundraising.

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:23.390
My question is,
was there a moment

00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:26.120
where they were kind of sold?

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.730
Was there something that they
saw that really sold them

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:30.080
on giving you funds?

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.432
Only because, like,
obviously, [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:32.432 --> 00:58:33.640
I'm just curious what it was.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:34.640
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:38.722
So let me just first be clear
that it's-- the investment did

00:58:38.722 --> 00:58:40.460
not come from a16z.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.280
It didn't come from
Andreeson Horowitz.

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.770
It came from Ben Horowitz
personally, right?

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:50.524
And I would say-- I would
say a couple things, right.

00:58:50.524 --> 00:58:51.940
Once again, getting
back to, like,

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.980
how you rank relationships.

00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:57.520
So the reason why my phone,
if you put your information in

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.460
and you add your
Twitter account,

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:02.186
it will actually rank you
higher if you have more Twitter

00:59:02.186 --> 00:59:03.560
followers, right,
because maybe I

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.810
should get back to you, right.

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:06.810
So I have 550,000
Twitter followers.

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:09.682
So maybe people are saying,
OK, what he's doing already,

00:59:09.682 --> 00:59:11.140
he's a thought
leader or something.

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.230
People following him.

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:13.100
That's number one.

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:18.170
But number two, I didn't write
a cold email to Ben Horowitz,

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:19.350
right?

00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:22.420
I actually had a very
warm introduction.

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.350
And not only did I have
a warm introduction,

00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:28.660
he set the meeting and he sat
in the meeting during the town

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.800
where I was talking to Ben
about my-- at the time,

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.240
it was more like a
fan phone, right?

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.600
And so-- and that guy
was Tristan Walker.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.790
And once again, he
was an entrepreneur

00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:43.830
in residence at Andreeson
Horowitz, but he was a fan.

00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:47.980
And our relationship had been
built based on him saying yo,

00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.750
I saw those YouTube videos
of you creating music,

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:53.700
I feel like I have a
human connection to you.

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.320
I'll take 30 minutes to listen
to you talk on the phone

00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:00.190
and rant and rave about how
the music industry people are

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:01.800
disengaged from
their audience, they

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.340
don't have any data, whatever,
and I'm trying to solve it.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.670
And I wasn't doing that
to sell him on a startup.

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:11.830
And so the-- first and
foremost, the ability

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:15.260
to sort of form a relationship
through, like, a music

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.880
exchange, to then having
a 30-minute conversation,

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.079
to then him saying, like,
hey, Ryan, you know,

01:00:21.079 --> 01:00:22.870
this is interesting
that you're doing this.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.410
You should meet Ben
Horowitz, right.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.350
And at the time,
I had only built

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:30.170
a single-tenant application,
single-tenant database

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.770
application.

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:33.520
So anyone else who wanted to
try SuperPhone at that time

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.131
would have had to spin up a
whole nother app in Heroku,

01:00:36.131 --> 01:00:36.630
you know?

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.730
And so the bottom line
is that, like, I wasn't

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:41.660
in there pitching to
him and saying like, yo,

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.611
man, like yo, I got this idea.

01:00:43.611 --> 01:00:45.360
We're going to disrupt
the music industry.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.420
I just said, look,
bro, I had a challenge.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.970
I looked, I did an
exhaustive search

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:54.580
to try to solve the challenge.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.050
I could not find it.

01:00:56.050 --> 01:01:00.870
I sat in my living room,
you know, put all the studio

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:03.680
equipment to the side,
and for 60 days just

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.970
ordered Chinese takeout
and, like, taught myself

01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:07.380
how to code, right?

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.530
And I built this
little fan phone.

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:13.660
And he said, bro, that
is who I invest in.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.740
I invest in founders who solve
their own problems, right.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.970
And you know, I feel
like you've solved

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:23.900
a problem for every modern
business, every modern person.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.180
You might be--
eureka fell upon it,

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.120
but every modern person
who's investing time, energy,

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.200
and resources to build
followings on platforms where

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.770
they have no data, no
insight, no analytics,

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:37.515
and giving them a direct line
of intelligent communication

01:01:37.515 --> 01:01:39.000
to people that support them.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:39.600
I'm in.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.790
And I looked at Tristan and
said, what does that even mean?

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:44.170
Right?

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.650
Oh, well, you should
raise a round.

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:48.420
And like, I literally-- it
wasn't even a moment, epiphany,

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.900
it was like he just was
like, yo, man, I support you.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.320
And that's what I'm saying,
is that if you can even

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:58.430
get to the in-person
time, I don't know if that

01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:59.860
was a rational decision.

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:00.910
I don't know if that was.

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.618
You know, I think it
was a good decision,

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.810
because I'm very passionate
about what I'm doing.

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.430
But I had met him
for the first time.

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:09.610
It was 10 minutes
in, or 30 minutes

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:11.820
in to talking to him
about why I wanted

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.030
to solve this, et cetera.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:15.820
But I watched this happen
over and over again,

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:19.310
because the relationship
with Mr. Horowitz,

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:22.070
right, when we came
back to New York City,

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:25.200
and we said, aw, man, Ben
said we need to raise 500.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.180
And I went and, you
know, my boy, once again,

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.690
a warm introduction,
Eric [INAUDIBLE],

01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:33.070
brought me to a
product hunt, you know,

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.980
brunch where we could all talk
about what we're working on.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:38.040
And John Borthwick
from Betaworks

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.290
happened to be at that brunch.

01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:41.331
Said hey, Ryan, I like
what you're talking about.

01:02:41.331 --> 01:02:43.820
You've got 45 minutes
after this meeting.

01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:47.890
And literally 45 minutes later,
we were up another 100 racks,

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:48.530
right?

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:51.190
And maybe that had to
do with just the fact

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:52.830
that, when you see
me talk about this,

01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:54.960
I'm ridiculously
passionate about it, right?

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.690
I mean everything
I'm talking about,

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.245
and I'm going to
go right from here,

01:02:58.245 --> 01:03:00.230
I'm going to call my
engineers and say, yo,

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:04.130
how many actual-- you know, how
many text messages did we get.

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:06.298
And then when it's
on Google Talk

01:03:06.298 --> 01:03:07.672
and it's publicly
available, I'll

01:03:07.672 --> 01:03:09.910
say how many more text
messages do we get.

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:13.250
How can we make this easier
for every single person that

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.605
needs warmer relationships.

01:03:15.605 --> 01:03:16.980
I think eventually,
there's going

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.360
to be, like, a relationship
arbitrage, right?

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.380
Which means that you'll
be able to say, like, OK,

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.380
who's the person
that can give me

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.090
the most valuable
introduction to Ryan Leslie?

01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:30.430
And whereas some people might
say, like, oh, man, maybe I

01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:32.610
should try to get in
touch with Fab-- right,

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:35.390
because I do a whole bunch of
work with Fabolous-- and yeah,

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.160
if he called me and
said yo, Ryan, you

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.410
should meet this person,
I'll do it, right,

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.320
because I've got a
lot of mutual respect.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.230
You actually might be
better off reaching out

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:47.900
to Miles from my team
or Dev from my team,

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.080
these people you see
tagged on my Instagram,

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.200
and actually going at
them, because there's

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.100
going to be a warm introduction
and because I appreciate

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:55.730
their opinions.

01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:56.480
They work with me.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.470
They know who I am.

01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:58.710
They know my work ethic.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.320
They know the type of people
I would invest in, et cetera.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.950
Those are probably an easier
way to build a warm introduction

01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:09.730
into someone who may or may
not make an irrational decision

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:11.020
to invest in you, right?

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.492
And so it's very,
very interesting.

01:04:13.492 --> 01:04:15.200
I mean, I'd never
really gotten to, like,

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.283
the science of networking.

01:04:16.283 --> 01:04:19.890
I had always just left it
to Facebook and Google+

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:22.980
and YouTube and Instagram and
Myspace and all these other

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.480
things.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:28.260
But once you start realizing
that the technology does exist

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.540
to give you the kind of
insight that you need

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.450
to build warm relationships,
that's what I'm saying,

01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:35.500
now I believe that
SuperPhone is actually

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.720
something that's way larger
than what I could contribute

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.840
to the world as a
musician, because this is

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.830
an objective value proposition.

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:45.560
You know, it's even more of an
objective value proposition,

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.930
in my opinion, than Uber.

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:49.170
Because some people,
you know, yes, everyone

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:51.284
would like the convenience
of Uber, right,

01:04:51.284 --> 01:04:53.200
but not everybody's going
to afford it, right?

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.010
Some people are just going to
walk, take the train, you know,

01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.370
take a bike, city
bike or whatever.

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:02.260
And so when you start looking
at the objective value of me

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.120
having a cool
relationship with Keith,

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.760
you've got to understand,
me and Keith go way back.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.910
He actually, you know, he
found me doing whatever

01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:10.025
I was doing on Facebook.

01:05:10.025 --> 01:05:10.900
Sent me a cold email.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.150
I said yo, you work at Google.

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:13.100
We came in.

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:16.057
You know, I was very
not appropriately

01:05:16.057 --> 01:05:17.390
dressed the first day I came in.

01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:21.380
I had, like, cutoff t-shirt
with a Led Zeppelin, you know.

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:21.970
Crazy.

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:24.320
But you know, but we've
actually grown a relationship.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.260
That's why I'm
sitting on this stage.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.710
He said, yo, Ryan, I think
you should have this platform.

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:29.740
That's insane.

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.794
And it wasn't like
I paid for this.

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:33.460
The number of people
that would probably

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.680
love to be able to say
oh, I've got a great idea,

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.260
I would like to just pay for
the Google Talks platform

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.760
to feature me, right?

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.010
It didn't happen that way.

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:44.840
It happened because
I actually-- and I

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.650
don't have the warmest
relationship with Keith,

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:49.200
but we have a relationship.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.797
And we built it,
we cultivated it.

01:05:50.797 --> 01:05:52.380
You know, I've hung
out and had drinks

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.770
and talked to him about startup
ideas and all kinds of stuff,

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:57.130
right?

01:05:57.130 --> 01:06:00.240
And we didn't even have the
best business relationship

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.160
because, you know, whatever we
started working on at Google,

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.110
it wasn't the actual perfect
fit for what I was working on.

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:08.246
But the relationship
is valuable.

01:06:08.246 --> 01:06:09.620
And the other
piece about this is

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:14.840
that the reason why I
think great investors still

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.030
stay in touch with
founders, right,

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:19.660
is because I don't
know a single person,

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.080
I don't know a single
person, even kids,

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.774
I don't know a single person
that if you talk to them

01:06:24.774 --> 01:06:26.440
and you ask them a
question and say hey,

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.636
Keith, man, you
know, in five years,

01:06:29.636 --> 01:06:30.760
where would you like to be.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.800
They never say, oh, I'd like
to be exactly where I am today.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.300
Right?

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:37.239
Everyone says, well, I would
like to have a big dream.

01:06:37.239 --> 01:06:38.280
I want to get my startup.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.790
I want to be promoted.

01:06:40.790 --> 01:06:42.930
I want to make partner
at my law firm.

01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:46.250
So the beauty of
actually-- the beauty

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:49.610
of actually investing in a
relationship at whatever time

01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:53.360
you meet someone is
because, as a human race,

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.850
as a human species, we
all want to advance.

01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:00.570
So if you look at relationships
as like a stock, the minute

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:04.580
you get in, it is a stock
that is always, hopefully,

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.870
if they have any
level of ambition

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:08.649
or have any level-- whatever.

01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:10.690
It's a stock that's always
going to go up, right?

01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:12.030
Because no one ever
want, like-- you know,

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:13.446
people are going
to make mistakes.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:16.212
They might end up in
jail or whatever it is.

01:07:16.212 --> 01:07:18.962
You know, you may
not reap the reward.

01:07:18.962 --> 01:07:20.920
Or they might just turn
out to be a bad person.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.420
How many relationships
have we been

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:23.920
in where we invest
all kinds of time

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.715
and then we just cut
them off completely,

01:07:25.715 --> 01:07:27.040
they might as well be dead.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.430
Don't call me, you
know, restraining order,

01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:30.900
get away from me,
don't-- you know,

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.030
I don't want to see no
texts, you're blocked,

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:35.790
don't talk to my friends, don't
try to reach out to my mom

01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:38.160
on Facebook to get back
with me and all that.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.990
You know, but nine
times out of 10,

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:44.070
if you look at this
objectively, like, man,

01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:47.380
I probably should have
had a better relationship

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.510
with all my exes, right?

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:51.390
Because now all my exes are
doing incredible things.

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:54.900
I mean, I can look at the
work that Kenza Fourati

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.800
is doing for her people, right?

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.470
And I don't have a
relationship with her

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:04.800
because the investment that I
made, the mistakes that I made,

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.107
that investment evaporated
when we-- you know,

01:08:07.107 --> 01:08:08.690
we're not romantically
linked anymore.

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.300
She's married now, et cetera.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:14.540
Like so the idea about,
like, unlearning, or learning

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.090
for the first time
what you've never

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:18.240
been taught about
networking and relationship

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.840
is going to actually solve
for a lot of the challenges

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.060
that everybody feels
like they're facing.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.580
And if you can
have something that

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.680
helps you to
prioritize your time,

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.420
because that is a resource that
we all share, like somebody

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.005
texted me before
this and was like,

01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:35.130
yo, do you have time to
catch up after the meeting.

01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:36.355
I said yeah of course.

01:08:36.355 --> 01:08:38.729
I'm going to invest a little
time, we catch up, see if we

01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:39.812
can do something together.

01:08:39.812 --> 01:08:40.340
That's cool.

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.204
But the bottom
line is that we are

01:08:42.204 --> 01:08:43.870
going to exchange--
we're both investing

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:47.470
an equal amount of time to build
something that hopefully is

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:48.830
going to yield a great result.

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:53.189
So I don't know, necessarily, if
you don't have-- as a founder,

01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:55.050
if you don't have
all the metrics which

01:08:55.050 --> 01:08:58.470
say this is my month over
month, year over year user

01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:01.550
growth, et cetera, can you
actually get to those meetings?

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:04.901
Can you build a-- you can
join startup networks to build

01:09:04.901 --> 01:09:06.859
relationships with hackers,
build relationships

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:10.000
with-- you know, my
buddy is Chris Lyons.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.109
He's the chief of staff at a16z.

01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:13.960
He doesn't make
investment decisions,

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.029
but he does all of
the introductions

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:20.779
and manages all of
the sort of inbound

01:09:20.779 --> 01:09:23.290
with founders and
influencers and investors

01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:24.819
that come all together.

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:26.824
He's been an incredible
relationship, you know?

01:09:26.824 --> 01:09:28.240
So that's what I
was saying, like,

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.660
when we got funded at
SuperPhone, it wasn't like,

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.120
aw, man, this is the
moment in the pitch where

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.609
everybody's eyes
lit up and I knew

01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:36.990
I was going to get my check.

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:40.290
It was really that it was
a human exchange, right,

01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:41.550
at its very core.

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:43.689
And it was about the
value proposition

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:48.450
that initially I was
positioning for, you know,

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:51.279
humans that were doing things
that I did, like did music.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:53.350
But now I realize
that it's a value

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:56.040
proposition for every
human, you know, SuperPhone.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.800
AUDIENCE: But also [INAUDIBLE]
I don't use his products,

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.010
but like his
relationship building

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:03.004
online is actually impeccable.

01:10:03.004 --> 01:10:04.170
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah, for sure.

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:05.870
For sure.

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:08.430
So I mean literally, you know,
if this seems interesting

01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:11.947
at all, like, we do have
a beta pool of artists

01:10:11.947 --> 01:10:13.030
and independent musicians.

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:15.270
But if this seems
interesting at all,

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:17.184
the barrier is you
can't apply SuperPhone

01:10:17.184 --> 01:10:18.850
to your existing phone
number unless you

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:21.190
want to port it to our service.

01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:24.360
But you can spin up,
like, a networking number.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.360
And I guarantee, like,
you know, we'll catch up.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.590
We'll do some research.

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:31.507
We'll try to figure out if it
actually enhances and enriches

01:10:31.507 --> 01:10:33.215
your life and enriches
your relationship.

01:10:33.215 --> 01:10:35.509
We're building those
kinds of metrics.

01:10:35.509 --> 01:10:37.550
It's like a Fitbit for
your relationships, right.

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:40.507
You can finally count your
texts, count your phone calls,

01:10:40.507 --> 01:10:42.840
how long-- when you do make
a phone call with Keith, how

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.430
long does he stay on the phone.

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:47.150
How long does it take for
somebody to respond to you.

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:50.396
What's the time gap between
flurries of conversation.

01:10:50.396 --> 01:10:51.895
And then we're
building an algorithm

01:10:51.895 --> 01:10:53.800
to give you an index
to your relationships.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.320
So every week, you can just
look in and see, like, hey,

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.504
I want to be more
of a family person,

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.420
because last week I
looked at my relationship,

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.964
I don't even talk to my mom.

01:11:01.964 --> 01:11:04.380
I thought I was a family person,
I don't even talk to her.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:07.860
Because who you're talking
to is who you are, right?

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.020
Besides the
self-development that you're

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.240
doing, like working out in
the gym alone or whatever,

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.170
the rest of your life is how
you're dealing with people.

01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:20.087
And so-- but there's no
intelligence around it.

01:11:20.087 --> 01:11:22.170
Like I said, I can't go
to Google and search like,

01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:24.340
yo, who did I spend
time with last week.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.819
But the window into that
is who you're talking to.

01:11:26.819 --> 01:11:28.360
Because you've got
to talk to people.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.265
I've got to talk
to Keith, yo, I'm

01:11:29.265 --> 01:11:30.800
running 10 minutes late, right?

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.830
So it's telling me who I am.

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:35.010
It's telling me what I'm doing.

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:38.860
Messaging is an incredible
window into who you are.

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:39.360
So.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.260
KEITH WRIGHT: I think that's
a great message to end on.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:41.670
So--

01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:42.150
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:43.880
KEITH WRIGHT: Thank you
very much for stopping by.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.345
RYAN LESLIE: Thank you
guys so much for having me.

01:11:45.345 --> 01:11:45.660
KEITH WRIGHT: Really enjoyed it.

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.410
RYAN LESLIE: Yeah.

01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:48.048
And send me a text, man.

01:11:48.048 --> 01:11:49.140
Yeah.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.140
KEITH WRIGHT: All right.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:50.760
I think that's it.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.760
RYAN LESLIE: Thanks
so much, man.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.040
KEITH WRIGHT: Yes.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:52.340
RYAN LESLIE: Appreciate it.

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:53.548
KEITH WRIGHT: It's good, man.

01:11:53.548 --> 01:11:54.790
RYAN LESLIE: Thank you.
