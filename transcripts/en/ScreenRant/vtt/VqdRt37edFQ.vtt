00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.870
Casting is one of the most important aspects
of putting together a film.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.360
The filmmakers have to make sure they have
the right actors for each part in order to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.210
establish the proper emotional connection
with the audience.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.910
This causes them to test several thespians,
and some interesting “what ifs” could

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.170
have drastically altered the course of movie
history.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.470
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 movie castings
that could have changed popular films.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.470
Superman

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.391
Christopher Reeve is still many people’s
version of the perfect Superman, but what

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:32.790
about the Italian Stallion?

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.690
Sylvester Stallone lobbied hard to play the
part, but was turned down because he was deemed

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.719
“too Italian.”

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.340
He later found out that Marlon Brando had
casting approval, and was the one who turned

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.340
Stallone down.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.460
Sly went on to criticize Brando for his part
in the decision, blasting him for using Superman

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.110
as a paycheck and nothing more.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.751
Stallone loved the character and mythology,
so he certainly would have brought the passion.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.399
But would he have done Clark Kent justice?

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.300
We’ll never know.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.860
Star Wars: Attack of the Clones

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.149
George Lucas needed an older Anakin Skywalker
for Episode II, and one name he considered

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.660
was Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.299
Leo met with George Lucas to discuss the part,
but turned it down to work on Gangs of New

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.299
York with Martin Scorsese.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.530
You have to hand it to DiCaprio for his foresight.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.611
Gangs launched one of the most successful
actor-director combos of this century, while

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.350
Hayden Christensen floundered into obscurity
after Star Wars disappointed.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.200
As talented as he is, even Leo may have not
been able to save Lucas’ clunky dialogue.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.540
We much prefer watching him chase Oscars instead
of battle droids.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.540
Jerry Maguire

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.439
Tom Cruise was born to play sports agent Jerry
Maguire, injecting him with a rock star persona

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.190
befitting of his A-list status.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.189
But Cameron Crowe had originally envisioned
a different Tom headlining this comedy: Tom

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.189
Hanks.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.320
But the Oscar winner was too old for the role
by the time Crowe was ready to enter production,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.340
and was already making That Thing You Do!
Hanks is an all-time great, but it’s almost

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.320
impossible seeing him as Maguire after Cruise’s
terrific performance.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.750
Imagining him on the phone with Rod Tidwell
just seems wrong.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.770
Casino Royale

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.010
When the Bond franchise moved on from Pierce
Brosnan, the producers had to do an extensive

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.060
search to find the next 007.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.030
Daniel Craig landed the coveted role, but
one of the names strongly considered was Sam

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.229
Worthington, star of James Cameron’s Avatar.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.290
Craig’s interpretation was a darker iteration,
but he still maintained the dry wit and charisma

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.540
that define the character, qualities Worthington
has not shown in his attempts to become an

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.540
action star.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.319
At least he’ll always have Jake Sully, but
Worthington was not right for Bond at all,

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.689
and Craig has become a fan-favorite.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:26.689
Toy Story

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.840
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are forever intertwined
thanks to their work together in the Toy Story

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.579
franchise, but Hanks could have been paired
up with someone else.

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.329
Pixar originally offered the Buzz Lightyear
role to comedian Billy Crystal, who turned

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:38.329
it down.

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.840
He regretted it after seeing the film, but
in retrospect it was the right call.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.349
Crystal’s hyperactive style may not have
been the best fit for the macho aloofness

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.799
that carried Buzz through the first film.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.370
It would have made the character funny from
the start, and not as convincing for audiences.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.409
And Crystal got an opportunity to work with
Pixar, voicing the lovably zany Mike Wazowski

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.769
in Monsters, Inc.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:58.769
Pulp Fiction

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.999
Jules Winnfield was made to be played by Samuel
L. Jackson, but he almost missed out on his

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.189
career defining role.

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.439
While Quentin Tarantino wrote it specifically
for Jackson, he was very impressed by an audition

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.669
from Paul Calderon.

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:14.049
When Jackson heard this, he flew out to Los
Angeles to meet with Tarantino again and secured

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.049
the part.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.879
He ended up launching his career to superstardom
and earned an Oscar nod, so it was a wise

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:19.879
decision.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.430
Calderon got a small part in the film as bartender
Paul, and he’s so friendly and welcoming,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.099
it’s hard to imagine him reciting Ezekiel
25:17 as a cold blooded killer.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.099
Collateral

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.279
The role of besieged cab driver Max eventually
went to Jamie Foxx and earned the actor an

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.019
Oscar nod, but the character evolved as the
project went along.

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.099
The screenwriter had wanted to use Robert
De Niro in an obvious callback to his famous

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.900
Travis Bickle character, but De Niro was deemed
too old for the part.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.409
In a shocking twist, none other than Adam
Sandler met with director Michael Mann before

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.299
the director decided to go with Foxx.

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.560
To his credit, Sandler has turned in some
dramatic performances, but he’s not as versatile

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.439
an actor as Foxx.

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.459
Batman Begins

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.489
When rebooting Batman, Christopher Nolan tried
out several actors for the Caped Crusader

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.029
and chose Christian Bale to bring the property
back to respectability.

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:10.180
But one other name he considered was Cillian
Murphy, who would play the Scarecrow in all

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.019
three films of the Dark Knight trilogy.

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.599
Murphy’s a strong actor, but if he were
Wayne that would mean someone else would have

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.799
to play Jonathan Crane.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.830
Since Murphy’s turn as the villain was well-received,
and Bale went on to put his stamp on the character,

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.452
we’re happy things turned out the way they
did.

00:04:22.452 --> 00:04:25.639
The Bale voice has gone down in legend.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.200
Captain America: The First Avenger

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.539
Nowadays, it’s hard to envision anyone other
than Chris Evans as the Star Spangled Man,

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.710
but The Office star John Krasinski was in
the running for the role.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.150
He exemplifies the same optimistic gung-ho
attitude that’s so vital for the character,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.340
but it would have been interesting to see
if he had the action chops to pull it off.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.139
Evans looked the part, and already had major
blockbuster experience, playing Johnny Storm

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.860
in two Fantastic Four flicks.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.080
Even if those weren’t great movies, they
still showed Evans had what it took to play

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.340
a likeable superhero.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.340
Back to the Future

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.590
Michael J. Fox is inseparable from Marty McFly,
but scheduling conflicts initially caused

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.900
him to skip out on the film.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.040
Robert Zemeckis originally went with Eric
Stoltz and began principal photography.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.020
But a few days in, he realized something wasn’t
right, and Fox worked a deal to take on the

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.020
role instead.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.590
Zemeckis felt Stoltz wasn’t funny enough
to play Marty, and to his credit the actor

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.789
agreed with the decision.

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.199
The rest is history, and Fox’s sense of
humor and comedic chops made him an instant

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.460
classic with movie fans.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.879
There’s no one else we’d rather see introducing
the world to Johnny B. Goode.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.570
