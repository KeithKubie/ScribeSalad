00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.760
Okay. Let's just simply try and substitute our values in the

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.890
formulas that we know of. Since A and B are independent

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.580
events, the triangle probably is given by the product of A,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.153
product of probability of A and B, so that gives us 0.25.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.550
Probability of A given B, since A and B

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.040
are [UNKNOWN] of each other. Probability of A given

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.644
B is just probability of A, which is 0.5. So then the entropy of A is given by

00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:35.290
this formula. And if we expand on this we get, we get the entropy of A as 1.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.010
Similarly the entropy of B is also 1. What

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.360
is the joint entropy? The joint entropy is given as

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.174
this formula. So if we substitute the values we get the joint entropy of A

00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:54.000
and B as 2. What is the condition entropy of A given B? It is given as this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.200
formula. And if you substitute the values, we

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.160
get the conditional entropy as 1. Mutual information between

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.380
A and B is given by this formula.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.380
And if we substitute the values of the variables

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.128
that we have already calculated, entropy of A and

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:13.144
entropy of A given B, we get 1 minus

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:16.420
1, which is zero. So, since the two coins

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.170
are independent, there is no mutual information between them.
