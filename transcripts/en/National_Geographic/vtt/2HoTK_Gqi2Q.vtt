00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:07.379
While billions of stars are scattered throughout the universe the one at the center of our solar system

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.189
Plays a special role for us here on earth our

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.140
Sun formed about 4.5 billion years ago in the Milky Way galaxy's Orion's fur

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.209
It was born when a cloud of dust and gas known as a solar nebula

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.410
Collapsed and in the middle of this formation matter condensed into a burning ball of gas that became our Sun

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.689
The sun's fiery nature along with a tremendous gravitational pull and an extensive magnetic field

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.718
Helped it to become the heart of our solar system

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.369
The Sun can be divided into six layers or regions the corona the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.629
chromosphere

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.460
the photosphere

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.259
the convective and radiative zones and the core in terms of atom count the Sun is about

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.478
91% hydrogen the sun's fuel eight point nine percent helium and

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.260
point one percent heavier elements such as carbon and nitrogen

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.939
Due to the sun's extreme temperatures these elements stay in a gas like phase called plasma

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.939
In the core

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.769
temperatures reaching at least 27 million degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.430
Combined with the sun's powerful gravity fused together hydrogen molecules to create helium

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.819
Called thermonuclear fusion this releases an enormous amount of energy in the form of radiation

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.409
Electricity solar wind and as we experience on earth

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.610
Life-giving heat and light

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.770
Such volatility is contained. Thanks to the sun's tremendous gravity

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.700
It's strong enough to hold the solar system intact and is primarily due to the sun's size and mass

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.399
Our Sun is the largest and most massive object in the solar system

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.149
it's more than 100 earths wide and

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.470
Could theoretically fit all eight planets inside

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.670
nearly

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.670
600 times

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.070
It also contains approximately ninety-nine point eight percent of all the mass in the solar system

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.070
Because of this mass the Sun has a great pull on the fabric of space

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.100
Creating a gravitational force that causes nearby planetary bodies to be drawn toward it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.499
This gravitational pull allows the Sun to hold together a system of eight planets

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.860
potentially dozens of dwarf planets at least

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.910
170 moons and countless comets and asteroids

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.999
Without the sun's gravity these celestial bodies would drift off into deep space

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.989
Another critical property of the Sun is its magnetic field which encapsulates the entire solar system

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.190
Called the heliosphere this force field protects the planets from harmful cosmic radiation

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.669
It's caused by the sun's plasma pushing electrically charged particles toward the Stars poles

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.419
This process turns the Sun into a giant magnet

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.129
Although the sun's magnetic field is invisible to the naked eye

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.070
Its effects are noticeable

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.359
On the sun's surface are dark areas called sunspots, which marked strong pockets of magnetism

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.680
on

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.980
Earth and on some of the other planets the sun's magnetic field interacts with their atmospheres

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.680
resulting in beautiful Aurora's

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.270
Despite its size and strength the Sun will not last forever

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.430
in about

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.290
6.5 billion years it will run out of its hydrogen fuel

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.369
Expand to envelop Mercury Venus and even earth and then collapse into a small star known as a white dwarf

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.230
in

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.039
The meantime the Sun will continue to play a critical role in the system that bears its name

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.069
the Suns protected magnetic field

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.760
Tremendous gravitational pull and ability to create vast amounts of energy will protect

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.299
Contain and give life to our solar system
