00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.890
- [Instructor] What we're going
to talk about in this video

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.130
is the expansion of presidential power.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.150
We've already seen that the
Constitution talks about

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.760
the different powers that
a president would have.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.860
But as we've gone forward in history,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.680
the Constitution hasn't
imagined every circumstance

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.265
that the president might face,
and so there have been times

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:20.950
when the presidents have used powers

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.870
that aren't explicitly
given in the Constitution.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.720
For example, as early as 1803,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.664
you have the Louisiana Purchase,

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:32.710
where you have Thomas
Jefferson buying land

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.960
from Napoleon's France.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.390
It does not say explicitly
anywhere in the Constitution

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.830
that presidents are allowed to buy land

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.370
from foreign countries.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.450
You fast-forward a good bit
to the Great Depression.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.810
You have Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.810
who serves four terms in
office, four terms in office,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.920
and also starts creating all
of these various agencies

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.920
in order to help stimulate the
economy, so creates agencies.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.800
And many of the things that he did

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.970
were not explicitly listed
as powers of the president.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.740
And as you can imagine, as
any member of the government,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.140
especially the president,
starts taking on powers

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.770
that aren't explicitly listed,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.630
it make make other people
a little bit afraid.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.810
And so in reaction to some of this,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.445
there have been actions taken.

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:24.940
For example, because
FDR had his four terms,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.970
you have the 22nd Amendment.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.160
And the 22nd Amendment says
that no one can be elected

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.800
to the office of the
president more than two times,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.920
and no one can serve more
than 10 years in office.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.690
The 10 years would become a problem if

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.290
you can take on office in the second half

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.840
of someone else's administration

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.400
and then you get elected twice.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.020
And so the 22nd Amendment
was really a check on

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.180
this type of expansion
of presidential power.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.380
Later on, you have things
like the War Powers Act.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.380
Let me write that, War Powers
Act, which is from 1973,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.070
and this is at the end of the Vietnam War.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.250
Congress has been concerned.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.154
How did we get embroiled in the war,

00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:12.360
a war, that in the early days,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.433
did not have any type of
official authorization

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:19.020
from Congress, but American
troops were put on the ground

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.960
in a foreign country.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.640
And so the War Powers Act in
1973 says that a president

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.730
has to get congressional
buy-in within 60 days

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.099
of committing American troops.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.950
But to help us understand this issue,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.920
let's go all the way back
to the Federalist Papers.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.090
Remember, the Federalist Papers
were written in an attempt

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.070
to get the Constitution ratified.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.120
And for the sake of this
video, we're going to focus on

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.790
Federalist number 70, written
by Alexander Hamilton.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.619
In Federalist number 70,
Alexander Hamilton makes the case

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.985
why you need to have a single individual

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.160
who has significant power

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.090
at the head of the Executive Branch.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.640
And you can imagine this would
have made some people wary

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.070
because the United States
had just gotten independence

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.010
from George III, a king,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.040
and so some people might
have been wary about kings,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.710
and might have wanted, maybe
not one person in charge,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.941
or maybe a committee in charge.

00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:16.240
But this is what Hamilton wrote.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.610
Energy in the Executive
is a leading character

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.950
in the definition of good government.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.330
It is essential to the
protection of the community

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.550
against foreign attacks;
it is not less essential

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.020
to the steady administration of the laws;

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.730
to the protection of property
against those irregular

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.850
and high-handed combinations
which sometimes interrupt

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.420
the ordinary of justice;
to the security of liberty

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.220
against the enterprises
and assaults of ambition,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.900
of faction, and of anarchy...

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.530
A feeble Executive
implies a feeble execution

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.580
of the government.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.960
A feeble execution is but another phrase

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.649
for a bad execution; and
a government ill executed,

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:59.520
whatever it may be in
theory, must, in practice,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.170
a bad government...

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.490
That unity is conducive to
energy will not be disputed.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.151
Decision, activity, secrecy, and despatch

00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:12.506
will generally characterize
the proceedings of one man

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:16.400
in a much more eminent
degree than the proceedings

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.750
of any greater number, and in proportion

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.123
as the number is increased,

00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:24.660
that qualities will be diminished...

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.150
So he's making the argument
for an energetic executive,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.060
and he's saying that,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.480
"Look, that power needs to be one person."

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.070
Otherwise, it's going
be diluted amongst many,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.740
and the more people you have
at the top of the executive,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.090
then these qualities of
energy, of decisiveness,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.130
are going to be diminished.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.963
And it's interesting.

00:04:42.963 --> 00:04:45.200
He also talks about secrecy,
which you don't always view

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.260
as a positive, but maybe the argument is

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.930
if you really need to execute well,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.050
you don't have to tell
everyone what you're doing,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.100
especially if you're
trying to conduct a war

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.130
and you don't want national
secrets to get out.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.240
The plurality of the Executive
tends to deprive the people

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.003
of the two greatest
securities they can have

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:07.380
for the faithful exercise
of any delegated power.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.620
So here he's further
building the case that hey,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.490
if you have many people in the executive,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.010
at the head of the executive,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.850
it's going to deprive the
people of two great securities.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.700
First, the restraints of public opinion,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.900
which lose their efficacy,
as well on account

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.340
of the division of the censure
attendant on bad measures

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.780
among a number, as on
account of the uncertainty

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.210
on whom it ought to fall.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.250
So he's saying the
restraints of public opinion

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.760
don't work as well if there's
many people at the top.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.440
If many people are making
these executive decisions,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.050
then they don't know
who to hold accountable.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.500
They don't know who to blame.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.800
And secondly, the opportunity
of discovering with facility

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.181
and clearness the misconduct
of the persons they trust,

00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:56.205
in order either to their
removal from office

00:05:56.205 --> 00:06:00.890
or to their actual punishment
in cases which admit of it...

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.630
So once again, they're
saying if it's one person

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.840
leading the executive and
they do something bad,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.750
you can punish them.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.186
You can remove them from office.

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:10.450
But if it's many people, who do you blame?

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.881
It might not be easy to
hold them accountable.

00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:15.730
But then if we fast-forward to 1973,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.380
think about the situation
that the country was in.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.710
We were at the end of the Vietnam War.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.090
President Nixon was going through

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.180
the Watergate investigations,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.850
and you have the author
Arthur Schlesinger Jr.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.570
writes The Imperial presidency.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.120
And it says right over here,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.530
"The Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian traces the escalation

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.750
"of Presidential power and
considers what Congress

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.390
"and the people can do about it."

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.670
And here is an excerpt of what he wrote.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.300
Secrecy seemed to promise government

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.750
three inestimable advantages:
the power to withhold,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.420
the power to leak and the power to lie...

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.210
So it's clear that Arthur
Schlesinger is not as big of a fan

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.889
as secrecy as Alexander Hamilton was.

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.030
The power to withhold held out the hope

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.205
of denying the public the
knowledge that would make possible

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:11.800
an independent judgment
on executive policy.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.370
The mystique of inside
information -- "if you only knew

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.760
"what we know" -- was a
most effective way to defend

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.510
the national security monopoly

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.760
and prevent democratic
control of foreign policy...

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.250
So he's saying, look, if you allow people

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.930
to just not tell you things,
they'll just say, hey,

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.300
if you only knew what we knew,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.950
you would do what we're
doing, but we can't tell you

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.020
what we know, so you
just have to trust us.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.060
The power to leak meant the
power to tell the people

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.010
what it served the government's purpose

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.850
that they should know...

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.020
So once again, they can
hold secret, and say,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.240
"Hey, trust us. We're doing
what's the right thing,"

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.660
but then they could selectively leak

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.930
so that only certain information gets out

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.800
that once again, could be in
the interest of those in power.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.310
The power to withhold and the
power to leak lead inexorably

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.995
to the power to lie.

00:07:55.995 --> 00:07:59.050
The secrecy system instilled
in the executive branch

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.900
the idea that foreign
policy was no one's business

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.940
save its own, and the
uncontrolled secrecy made it easy

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.540
for lying to become routine.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.916
It was in this spirit
that Eisenhower concealed

00:08:10.916 --> 00:08:14.160
the CIA operations it was
mounting against governments

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.340
around the world.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.310
It was in this spirit that
the Kennedy administration

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.870
stealthily sent the Cuban
brigade to the Bay of Pigs,

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.700
and stealthily enlarged
American involvement in Vietnam.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.060
It was in this spirit that
the Johnson administration

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.680
Americanized the Vietnam War,
misrepresenting one episode

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.530
after another to Congress and the people--

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.740
Tonkin Gulf, which was
the resolution based on a

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.810
perceived attack on an American ship,

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.324
which was later judged
to be just an explosion,

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:48.022
the first American
ground force commitment,

00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:52.440
the bombing of North
Vietnam, My Lai and the rest.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.810
And the My Lai Massacre
is a famous massacre

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.420
that eventually got out
and it showed a massacre

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.080
of civilians in Vietnam.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.680
But I'll let you decide.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.270
And it doesn't have to be the case

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.632
that Alexander Hamilton was right 100%

00:09:06.632 --> 00:09:10.350
or that Arthus Schlesinger is right 100%.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.850
It could be the case that,
well, for the most part,

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.660
it is important for an
executive to have some degree

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.590
of secrecy.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.403
Even some of the things
that Arthur Schlesinger

00:09:18.403 --> 00:09:20.776
has talked about, where
we're talking about

00:09:20.776 --> 00:09:24.230
the Bay of Pigs or we're talking
about the CIA operations,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.880
remember, this was during the Cold War.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.570
You had the Soviet Union out
there with all of its spies.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.000
If it knew what was going on,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.100
it might be able to
undermine American actions.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.740
So some degree of secrecy
absolutely was necessary,

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.760
but on the other hand,
maybe there is a point

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.400
that sometimes that secrecy
does allow those in power

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.840
to do things that would
make the general public

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.970
very upset about their actions.
