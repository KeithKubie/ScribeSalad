00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.690
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Greetings.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.880
So I'm Pam Jackson, Director
for the Center for the Book,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.240
which includes the poetry
and literature center here

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.840
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.860
And I'd like to welcome
you this afternoon,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.830
thank you so much for being here.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.110
Today is a really, really special
day and we're here to celebrate

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.210
with a series of events that starts
with this afternoon's concert.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.840
So, today we are here to celebrate
the conclusion of the second term

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.960
of the US Poet Laureate Juan
Felipe Herrera and what an honor

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.150
and a privilege it is to be here
to be part of this amazing day.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.030 position:56%
Especially because of the remarkable
and phenomenal artistry of this man.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.900
I just use the word
"magical", just magical.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.360
That's who you -- I'm
talking right now,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.950
so just excuse me while
I talk directly to him.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.580 position:56%
But you know we're here to celebrate
you and honor you for your work

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.900
and your service to the
country and in representation

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.500
of the poet laureate ship.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.990
There have been a remarkable
series of activities and events

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.030
over the last couple of
years, so today we celebrate

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.910 position:56%
with some more remarkable events
culminating with a new concert today

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.230
and we'll follow by some
evening festivities I'll mention

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.530
just briefly.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.550 position:56%
But I'll start by saying that
today's series of events are brought

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.120
to you by the poetry
literature center in partnership

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.690
with the Library of Congress
American Folk Lives Center.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.530 position:56%
And the music and Hispanic divisions
of the Library of Congress.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.560
And here at the Library it's our
mission to really promote ourselves

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.040
as the first cultural
institution and in service

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.210
of being the first cultural
institution we focus

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.610
on providing American people
and globally with a rich diverse

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.870
and enduring source of
knowledge that can be relied upon

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.800
to stimulate intellectual
and creative endeavors.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.960
And we especially believe
that our poet laureate

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.390
and the events both today

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.190
and throughout the two terms
he served have done just that,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.320
to empower us to expand
our thinking,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.960
to have us be intellectually
and creatively endeavoring

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.240
on our own and for a purpose.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.860
Because it's not just to do it
but it's for a purpose and one

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.010
of the things that we talk about
here is to broaden our sense

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.100
of the world through the arts
and the culture that we celebrate

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.740
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.970
So this afternoons event is
the first of Speak the People,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.290
the Spark el poema event and
includes a choral performance

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.200 position:56%
by the Fresno State Chamber Singers.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.640
These singers hail from
Mr. Herrera's hometown

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.900
and will perform newly
commissioned pieces developed

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.250
in collaboration with
our poet laureate.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.950
Their performance credits include

So, they're with us today to
conclude their own 2016/2017 season

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.040
with a fabulous presentation
of music, lyric and poetry.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.080

&gt;&gt; We want to make note that
the festivities will continue

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.360
after today's concert this
evening starting at 7:00 p.m. here

in the Thomas Jefferson Building,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.250
downstairs in the Coolidge
Auditorium.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.040
There's an event that
includes a panel discussion

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.610
about the continuing emergence of
Latino culture and its influence

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.880
on the nation featuring
our own Juan Felipe Herrera

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.420
and then that's followed
by a concert

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.130
with the Grammy award winning
East LA Chicano Rock band Quetzal

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.150
and they will be closing
out the celebration.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.300 position:56%
Now we should also mention there
are a couple of displays downstairs,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.000

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.440
So, just a bit of housekeeping
before we get started

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.090
to avoid unnecessary distraction.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.890
If you've not already done
so please take a moment

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.410
to silence your mobile devices.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.740

She's a phenomenal artist in her

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.840

Fresno and the College of
Arts and Humanities I would

like to thank you all for joining
us today and we are so honored

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.230
to be a part of this
event Juan Felipe.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.930
I would also like to take a moment

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.900
to thank our provost
Lynette Zalezny,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.140
our Dean Saool Himina Sendoval

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.510
and our associate dean Nora
Chapman for joining us today.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.050
[ Applause ]

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.800
&gt;&gt; And for their immense
support, thank you so much.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.980
I arrived in Fresno about
nine months ago and soon

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.990
after had the opportunity to meet
Juan Felipe for the first time

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.760
as he asked me to put together
a choir for this event.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.150
And during that time we have had
the distinct honor of getting

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.320
to know Juan Felipe and learn
about this extraordinary man,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.020
not only through his words but
through the generous spirit

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.990
with which he approaches
life every day.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.080
Today's program will feature five
new compositions by my colleagues,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.800
Dr. Ben Boone and Dr. Ken
Frolick and you should know

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.160
that this is the first time Juan
Felipe's words have been set

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:12.530
to song, and been given a
new life beyond the page.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.270
These pieces as you will
see, tell the story of a man

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.990 position:56%
and his journey not just through
the last two years as poet laureate,

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.880
but they also beautifully highlight
those that have played a role

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.940 position:56%
in who he is today, from his parents
to his school teacher Mrs. Sampson,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.030
who helped him find his voice,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.780
to his student Mia Barraza
the fireball of his life.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.560
And events from his
tenure as poet laureate

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.590
that have touched his heart.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.180
This program will then conclude
with a piece called the road,

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.380
written by Dr. Frolick
which reflects a tapestry

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.910
of sound reflected in this piece
which highlights the journey

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.780
of Juan Felipe's voice
and the many voices

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.320 position:56%
that have helped him along his road.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.120 position:56%
I would like at this time to express
my sincere gratitude to Juan Felipe

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.560
for asking us to be a
part of his journey.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.510
Thank you.

I will walk across the wilderness

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.350
of desert storms and thorns across
the darkness of moonlit storms.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.480
I will sow all the
lost giving songs.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.980
I will gather all the
flourishing words.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:13:00.420
I will remember all
the ancestors gone.

your youngest horse bred child

and I will say to others for
each and every one of you I sing.

I am your youngest horse bred child.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:11.990
I will say to the others for each
and every one of you I will sing.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:20.510
For each and every one
of you, I will sing.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.510
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And the song,

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.890
the song began back in third grade.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:22.130
I was in Logan Heights , San Diego
and I was always you know speaking

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.670
in Spanish, that's my language
and I had been prohibited

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.150
from speaking in Spanish.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:32.110 position:56%
And the day came when Mrs. Sampson,
Mrs. Lellia Sampson in Logan Heights

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:36.960
in San Diego, California said,
"Come on up to the front, come on.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.860
Come on up and step to
the front and sing".

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.980
And I said "I don't
know if I can do that".

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.690 position:56%
To myself I said, "I don't think
so, no one has ever said that to me.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.510
No one has ever invited
me to the front, no one".

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.960
So what does that mean?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.850
So I stepped up to the front
as best as I could and I sang,

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.150
I sang Three Blind
Mice, the great opera.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:13.480
And then she turned to me and she
said, "You have a beautiful voice".

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:21.380
And from that day on to this
very day, this very moment

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.140
that was the key to my life.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.920
And I took that key
and I took those words

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.080 position:56%
and I gave them to everyone I could.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.210
That's what she was
telling me that the beauty

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:38.670
in my voice was the beauty
in everyone's voices.

And that voice kept

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.260
on singing and began to grow.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:27.450
It began to glow, as time went
on and then what happened was

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:33.530
that at Fresno State recently
I opened up the laureate lab,

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.130
President Costa was so kind.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:41.450
And Provost Lynette
Salezny was so kind

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.500
and the librarian was
so kind Peter McDonald.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:50.680
And Saool Himenez, Sandoval our
dean of humanities was so kind.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.480
And a student came and became
my, one of the students that came

00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.810
to be a grad assistant for the lab
where we explore and experimented

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:04.980
with words and paint and plastic
walls and murals and sculptures

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:11.610 position:56%
and paper and plaster and sounds,
with poetry, Mia [Spanish] Martinez.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:16.860 position:56%
She was just so eager and interested
and full of intensity and passion

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.780
for the language and
poetry, beautiful talent

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.540
and amazing woman was
coming to class one day.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.240
Was coming to the college one
day and was a torrential rain

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.800
at that particular moment and
she was getting on freeway 41.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.300
So she made it to the freeway and
that rain and all that happened

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.910
at that moment caused
her car to flip

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.300
over into the next lane
of the opposite way.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:52.080
And a big truck came and
that was the end of her life.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.970
So, in one of her poems she --

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.030
which is called "I am this
United States" shows you the kind

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.650
of passion she has, she had
and continues to have today

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.990
with this beautiful, amazing choir.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:10.340
And that's the intensity and
that's the poem that we are going

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.920
to sing this beautiful choir
is going to present to you.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.560
Mia [Spanish] Martinez's
words, her poems.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.810

all the women, all the students

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:27.510

&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And that song is based

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:27.150
on Mia [Spanish] poem parading
down Blackstone Avenue.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:32.200
And that voice, that poem has
reached all of us with the voices

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.400
of our chamber singers and
now you have her voice,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.700
her encouragement and her energy.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.270
And then it makes me ask the
question what can a poem do?

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.670
What can we do when
something takes place?

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.750
Something that leaves us helpless?

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.140
Something that's far
away, maybe it's Boston,

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:57.900
maybe it's a terrible incident
and maybe it's the massacre

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.950
that we all know about
in South Carolina.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.980
So I said what can I do?

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.760
I think what we can all do is make
an offering, maybe just to meditate

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.450
on it, maybe it's to say hello.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:13.170
Maybe it's to let go of some
of the things that keep us

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:18.480
from being really intimate and
caring and maybe it's also a poem

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.230
that we can write and
send to the people.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:28.740
And this poem, by poem speaks about
this and it was actually received

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.960
in South Carolina and was put on
a newsletter throughout that area

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.790
in particular and the church
where all this took place.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:42.640

end the violence.

would blow it on all the streets

from the mountains and valleys,
the yards and the migrant fields.
