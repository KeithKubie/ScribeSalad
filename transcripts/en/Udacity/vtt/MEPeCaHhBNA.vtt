Hey Anthony how was your weekend?

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; It was ok.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.769
I was visiting a friend in
San Francisco, but I got kind of lost.

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:14.360
&gt;&gt; Did you ever find your friend?

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.250
&gt;&gt; Eventually.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.430
It kind of took a while.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.390
&gt;&gt; I hate getting lost, but it's always
nice when you can find your way.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's sort of
like learning to code.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.990
I remember learning my first language
and not really knowing what to do next.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.300
&gt;&gt; And that's why you're here.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.530
The purpose of this course is to help
you in your journey as a new programmer.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.600
And to show you some different paths
you can take within the world of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.970
programming.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.780
I'm Georgia and i'm a course
developer here at you Udacity.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.420
I'll be your guide as you
navigate this course.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.290
&gt;&gt; And I'm Anthony and
I'm the course manager.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.080
We'll be sharing some common experiences
that many new programmers have.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.490
&gt;&gt; Let's start with the different
paths you can take within the world

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.030
of programming.
