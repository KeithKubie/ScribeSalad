00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:22.750
Thank you, all. Thank you, President Spar,
Ms. Golden, President Tilghman, Members of

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:32.410
the Board of Trustees, distinguished faculty,
proud swelling parents and family, and gorgeous

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:48.591
class of 2010.
If you are all really, really lucky, and if

00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:55.780
you continue to work super hard, and you remember
your thank you notes and everybody's name;

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.969
and you follow through on every task that's
asked of you and also somehow anticipate problems

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:12.820
before they even arise and you somehow sidestep
disaster and score big. If you get great scores

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:21.590
on your LSATS, or MSATS, or ERSATS or whatever.
And you get into your dream grad school or

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.530
internship which leads to a super job with
a paycheck commensurate with responsibilities

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.159
of leadership or if you somehow get that documentary
on a shoe-string budget and it gets accepted

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.540
at Sundance and maybe it wins Sundance and
then you go on to be nominated for an Oscar

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:52.950
and then you win the Oscar. Or if that money-making
website that you designed with your friends

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.140
somehow suddenly attracts investors and advertisers
and becomes the go-to site for whatever it

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:11.039
is you're selling, blogging, sharing, or net-casting
and success shinning, hoped-for but never

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.310
really anticipated success comes your way
I guarantee you someone you know or love come

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:35.419
to you and say, "Will you address the graduates
at my college?" And you'll say "Yeah sure,

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:55.769
when is it? May 2010? 2010? Yeah sure, that's
months away and then the nightmare begins.

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.980
The nightmare we've all had and I assure you,
you'll continue to have even after graduation,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:12.670
40 years after graduation. About a week before
the due date, you wake up in the middle of

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:25.929
the night, "Huh, I have a paper due and I
haven't done the reading, Oh my god!"

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:39.510
If you have been touched by the success fairy,
people think you know why. People think success

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:49.090
breeds enlightenment and you are duty bound
to spread it around like manure, fertilize

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.340
those young minds, let them in on the secret,
what is it that you know that no one else

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:09.229
knows, the self examination begins, one looks
inward, one opens an interior door. Cobwebs,

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:19.130
black, the lights bulbs burned out, the airless
dank refrigerator of an insanely over-scheduled,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.729
unexamined life that usually just gets take-out.
Where is my writer friend, Anna Quindlen when

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.060
I need her? On another book tour.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:47.250
Hello I'm Meryl Streep, and today, Class of
2010 and I am really, I am very honored, and

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:54.790
humbled to be asked to pass on tips and inspiration
to you for achieving success in this next

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:04.190
part of your lives. President Spar, when I
consider the other distinguished medal recipients

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:11.930
and venerable Board of Trustees, the many
accomplished faculty and family members, people

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:19.090
who've actually done things, produced things,
while I have pretended to do things, I can

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:27.910
think about 3,800 people who should have been
on this list before me and you know since

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:37.460
my success has depended wholly on putting
things over on people. So I'm not sure parents

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.450
think I'm that great a role model anyway.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:49.240
I am however an expert in pretending to be
an expert in various areas, so just randomly

00:05:49.240 --> 00:06:00.180
like everything else in this speech, I am
or I was an expert in kissing on stage and

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:15.620
on screen. How did I prepare for this? Well
most of my preparation took place in my suburban

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:24.490
high school or rather behind my suburban high
school in New Jersey. One is obliged to do

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:34.830
great deal of kissing in my line of work.
Air kissing, ass-kissing, kissing up and of

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:42.780
course actual kissing, much like hookers,
actors have to do it with people we may not

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:52.840
like or even know. We may have to do it with
friends, which, believe it or not is particularly

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:02.870
awkward, for people of my generation, it's
awkward.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:10.889
My other areas of faux expertise, river rafting,
miming the effects of radiation poisoning,

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:19.460
knowing which shoes go with which bag, coffee
plantation, Turkish, Polish, German, French,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:26.460
Italian, that's Iowa-Italian from the bridges
of Madison county, bit of the Bronx, Aramaic,

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:34.930
Yiddish, Irish clog dancing, cooking, singing,
riding horses, knitting, playing the violin,

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:43.630
and simulating steamy sexual encounters, these
are some of the areas in which, I have pretended

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:50.660
quite proficiently to be successful, or the
other way around. As have many women here,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:08:02.590
I'm sure.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:09.000
Women, I feel I can say this authoritatively,
especially at Barnard where they can't hear

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.199
us, what am I talking about? They professionally
can't hear us. Women are better at acting

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:28.770
than men. Why? Because we have to be, if successfully
convincing someone bigger than you are of

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:35.550
something he doesn't know is a survival skill,
this is how women have survived through the

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:51.240
millennia. Pretending is not just play. Pretending
is imagined possibility. Pretending or acting

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.390
is a very valuable life skill and we all do
it. All the time, we don't want to be caught

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:04.089
doing it but nevertheless it's part of the
adaptations of our species, we change who

00:09:04.089 --> 00:09:13.990
we are to fit the exigencies of our time,
and not just strategically, or to our own

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:21.110
advantage, sometimes sympathetically, without
our even knowing it for the betterment of

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.440
the whole group.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:32.980
I remember very clearly my own first conscious
attempt at acting. I was six placing my mother's

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:41.170
half slip over my head in preparation to play
the Virgin Mary in our living room. As I swaddled

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:54.000
my Betsy Wetsy doll I felt quieted, holy,
actually, and my transfigured face and very

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.029
changed demeanor captured on super-8 by my
dad pulled my little brother Harry to play

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:09.930
Joseph and Dana too, a barnyard animal, into
the trance. They were actually pulled into

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:18.590
this nativity scene by the intensity of my
focus. In my usual technique for getting them

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.980
to do what I want, yelling at them would never
ever have achieved and I learned something

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.890
on that day.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:34.230
Later when I was nine, I remember taking my
mother's eyebrow pencil and carefully drawing

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:42.570
lines all over my face, replicating the wrinkles
that I had memorized on the face of my grandmother

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:51.070
whom I adored and made my mother take my picture
and I look at it now and of course, I look

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:59.420
like myself now and my grandmother then. But
I do really remember in my bones, how it was

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:10.690
possible on that day to feel her age. I stooped,
I felt weighted down but cheerful, you know

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.000
I felt like her.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.810
Empathy is at the heart of the actor's art.
And in high school, another form of acting

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:30.880
took hold of me. I wanted to learn how to
be appealing. So I studied the character I

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:37.520
imagined I wanted to be that of the generically
pretty high school girl. I researched her

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:46.620
deeply, that is to say shallowly, in Vogue,
in Seventeen, and in Mademoiselle Magazines.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:53.960
I tried to imitate her hair, her lipstick,
her lashes, the clothes of the lithesome,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:00.100
beautiful and generically appealing high school
girls that I saw in those pages. I ate an

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:10.260
apple a day, period. I peroxided my hair,
ironed it straight. I demanded brand name

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:18.910
clothes, my mother shut me down on that one.
But I did, I worked harder on this characterization

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:26.230
really than anyone I think I've ever done
since. I worked on my giggle, I lightened

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:38.649
it. Because I like it when it went, kind of
"ehuh" and the end, "eheeh" "ehaeaahaha" because

00:12:38.649 --> 00:12:46.590
I thought it sounded child like, and cute.
This was all about appealing to boys and at

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:52.290
the same time being accepted by the girls,
a very tricky negotiation.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:13:00.431
Often success in one area precludes succeeding
in the other. And along with all my other

00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:10.780
exterior choices, I worked on my, what actors
call, my interior adjustment. I adjusted my

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:19.830
natural temperament which tends to be slightly
bossy, a little opinionated, loud, a little

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:34.120
loud, full of pronouncements and high spirits,
and I willfully cultivated softness, agreeableness,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:44.910
a breezy, natural sort of sweetness, even
shyness if you will, which was very, very,

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:54.490
very effective on the boys. But the girls
didn't buy it. They didn't like me; they sniffed

00:13:54.490 --> 00:14:03.560
it out, the acting. And they were probably
right, but I was committed, this was absolutely

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:15.149
not a cynical exercise, this was a vestigial
survival courtship skill I was developing.

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:21.040
And I reached a point senior year, when my
adjustment felt like me, I had actually convinced

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:29.421
myself that I was this person and she, me,
pretty, talented, but not stuck-up. You know,

00:14:29.421 --> 00:14:38.959
a girl who laughed a lot at every stupid thing
every boy said and who lowered her eyes at

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:47.620
the right moment and deferred, who learned
to defer when the boys took over the conversation,

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:55.790
I really remember this so clearly and I could
tell it was working, I was much less annoying

00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:02.730
to the guys than I had been, they liked me
better and I like that, this was conscious

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:13.649
but it was at the same time motivated and
fully-felt this was real, real acting.

00:15:13.649 --> 00:15:20.390
I got to Vassar which 43 years ago was a single-sex
institution, like all the colleges in what

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:27.310
they call the Seven Sisters, the female Ivy
League and I made some quick but lifelong

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:37.520
and challenging friends. And with their help
outside of any competition for boys my brain

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:50.360
woke up. I got up and I got outside myself
and I found myself again. I didn't have to

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:56.860
pretend, I could be goofy, vehement, aggressive,
and slovenly and open and funny and tough

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:06.579
and my friends let me. I didn't wash my hair
for three weeks once. They accepted me like

00:16:06.579 --> 00:16:17.959
the Velveteen Rabbit. I became real instead
of an imagined stuffed bunny but I stockpiled

00:16:17.959 --> 00:16:26.709
that character from high school and I breathed
life into her again some years later as Linda

00:16:26.709 --> 00:16:32.240
in the "Deer Hunter." There is probably not
one of you graduates who has ever seen this

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:41.959
film but the "Deer Hunter" it won best picture
in 1978 Robert De Niro, Chris Walken, not

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:50.060
funny at all. And I played Linda, a small
town girl in a working class background, a

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:58.930
lovely, quiet, hapless girl, who waited for
the boy she loved to come back from the war

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:11.019
in Vietnam. Often men my age, President Clinton,
by the way, when I met him said, "Men my age,

00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:19.230
mention that character as their favorite of
all the women I've played." And I have my

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:30.320
own secret understanding of why that is and
it confirms every decision I made in high

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.859
school. This is not to denigrate that girl
by the way or the men who are drawn to her

00:17:36.859 --> 00:17:43.990
in anyway because she's still part of me and
I'm part of her. She wasn't acting but she

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:52.529
was just behaving in a way that cowed girls,
submissive girls, beaten up girls with very

00:17:52.529 --> 00:18:02.279
few ways out have behaved forever and still
do in many worlds. Now, in a measure of how

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:06.960
much the world has changed the character most
men mention as their favorite is, Miranda

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.960
Priestly.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.759
Now as a measure of how the world has changed.
The character most men mention as their favorite.

00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:16.139
Miranda Priestly. The beleaguered totalitarian
at the head of Runway magazine in Devil Wears

00:18:16.139 --> 00:18:27.330
Prada. To my mind this represents such an
optimistic shift. They relate to Miranda.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:36.080
They wanted to date Linda. They felt sorry
for Linda but they feel like Miranda. They

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.710
can relate to her issues, the high standards
she sets for herself and others. The thanklessness

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:50.570
of the leadership position. The "Nobody understands
me" thing. The loneliness. They stand outside

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:55.070
one character and they pity her and they kind
of fall in love with her but they look through

00:18:55.070 --> 00:19:02.460
the eyes of this other character. This is
a huge deal because as people in the movie

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:08.559
business know the absolute hardest thing in
the whole world is to persuade a straight

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:18.720
male audience to identify with a woman protagonist
to feel themselves embodied by her. This more

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:25.139
than any other factor explains why we get
the movies we get and the paucity of the roles

00:19:25.139 --> 00:19:32.690
where women drive the film. It's much easier
for the female audience because we were all

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:39.549
grown up brought up identifying with male
characters from Shakespeare to Salinger. We

00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:48.480
have less trouble following Hamlet's dilemma
viscerally or Romeo's or Tybalt or Huck Finn

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:56.759
or Peter Pan -- I remember holding that sword
up to Hook -- I felt like him. But it is much

00:19:56.759 --> 00:20:07.690
much much harder for heterosexual boys to
identify with Juliet or Desdemona, Wendy in

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:15.471
Peter Pan or Joe in Little Women or the Little
Mermaid or Pocohontas. why I don't know, but

00:20:15.471 --> 00:20:22.789
it just is. There has always been a resistance
to imaginatively assume a persona, if that

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:33.440
persona is a she. But things are changing
now and it's in your generation we're seeing

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:46.429
this. Men are adapting... about time...they
are adapting consciously and also without

00:20:46.429 --> 00:20:51.200
consciously and without realizing it for the
better of the whole group. They are changing

00:20:51.200 --> 00:21:00.830
their deepest prejudices to regard as normal
the things that their fathers would have found

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:08.019
very very difficult and their grandfathers
would have abhorred and the door to this emotional

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:18.729
shift is empathy. As Jung said, emotion is
the chief source of becoming conscious. There

00:21:18.729 --> 00:21:28.429
can be no transforming of lightness into dark
of apathy into movement without emotion. Or

00:21:28.429 --> 00:21:37.090
as Leonard Cohen says pay attention to the
cracks because that's where the light gets

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:45.019
in. You, young women of Barnard have not had
to squeeze yourself into the corset of being

00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:59.149
cute or to muffle your opinions but you haven't
left campus yet. I'm just kidding. What you

00:21:59.149 --> 00:22:07.070
have had is the privilege of a very specific
education. You are people who may able to

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:15.029
draw on a completely different perspective
to imagine a different possibility than women

00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:18.229
and men who went to coed schools.

00:22:18.229 --> 00:22:24.169
How this difference is going to serve you
it's hard to quantify now, it may take you

00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:34.609
forty years like it did me to analyze your
advantage. But today is about looking forward

00:22:34.609 --> 00:22:42.479
into a world where so-called women's issues,
human issues of gender inequality lie at the

00:22:42.479 --> 00:22:49.850
crux of global problems from poverty to the
AIDS crisis to the rise in violent fundamentalist

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:56.859
juntas, human trafficking and human rights
abuses and you're going to have the opportunity

00:22:56.859 --> 00:23:06.019
and the obligation, by virtue of your providence,
to speed progress in all those areas. And

00:23:06.019 --> 00:23:16.279
this is a place where the need is very great,
the news is too. This is your time and it

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:23.340
feels normal to you but really there is no
normal. There's only change, and resistance

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:28.039
to it and then more change.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:32.830
Never before in the history or country have
most of the advanced degrees been awarded

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:41.129
to women but now they are. Since the dawn
of man, it's hardly more than 100 years since

00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:49.509
we were even allowed into these buildings
except to clean them but soon most of law

00:23:49.509 --> 00:23:58.950
and medical degrees will probably also go
to women. Around the world, poor women now

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:07.840
own property who used to be property and according
to Economist magazine, for the last two decades,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.679
the increase of female employment in the rich
world has been the main driving force of growth.

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:20.999
Those women have contributed more to global
GDP growth than have either new technology

00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:30.029
or the new giants India or china. Cracks in
the ceiling, cracks in the door, cracks in

00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:37.509
the Court and on the Senate floor.

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:47.599
You know, I gave a speech at Vassar 27 years
ago. It was a really big hit. Everyone loved

00:24:47.599 --> 00:24:54.720
it, really. Tom Brokaw said it was the very
best commencement speech he had ever heard

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:04.900
and of course I believed this. And it was
much easier to construct than this one. It

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:15.809
came out pretty easily because back then I
knew so much. I was a new mother, I had two

00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:27.379
academy awards and it was all coming together
so nicely. I was smart and I understood boiler

00:25:27.379 --> 00:25:33.629
plate and what sounded good and because I
had been on the squad in high school, earnest

00:25:33.629 --> 00:25:42.029
full-throated cheerleading was my specialty
so that's what I did but now, I feel like

00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:52.080
I know about 1/16th of what that young woman
knew. Things don't seem as certain today.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.919
Now I'm 60, I have four adult children who
are all facing the same challenges you are.

00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:58.919
I'm more sanguine about all the things that
I still don't know and I'm still curious about.

00:25:58.919 --> 00:25:59.919
What I do know about success, fame, celebrity
that would fill another speech. How it separates

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:00.919
you from your friends, from reality, from
proportion. Your own sweet anonymity, a treasure

00:26:00.919 --> 00:26:03.229
you don't even know you have until it's gone.
How it makes things tough for your family

00:26:03.229 --> 00:26:10.379
and whether being famous matters one bit,
in the end, in the whole flux of time. I know

00:26:10.379 --> 00:26:19.849
I was invited here because of that. How famous
I am. I how many awards I've won and while

00:26:19.849 --> 00:26:29.289
I am I am overweeningly proud of the work
that, believe me, I did not do on my own.

00:26:29.289 --> 00:26:37.629
I can assure that awards have very little
bearing on my own personal happiness. My own

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:47.019
sense of well-being and purpose in the world.
That comes from studying the world feelingly,

00:26:47.019 --> 00:26:54.629
with empathy in my work. It comes from staying
alert and alive and involved in the lives

00:26:54.629 --> 00:27:00.659
of the people that I love and the people in
the wider world who need my help. No matter

00:27:00.659 --> 00:27:09.119
what you see me or hear me saying when I'm
on your TV holding a statuette spewing, that's

00:27:09.119 --> 00:27:12.629
acting.

00:27:12.629 --> 00:27:27.899
Being a celebrity has taught me to hide but
being an actor has opened my soul.

00:27:27.899 --> 00:27:34.659
Being here today has forced me to look around
inside there for something useful that I can

00:27:34.659 --> 00:27:41.789
share with you and I'm really grateful you
gave me the chance.

00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:48.549
You know you don't have to be famous. You
just have to make your mother and father proud

00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:55.289
of you and you already have. Bravo to you.
Congratulations.
