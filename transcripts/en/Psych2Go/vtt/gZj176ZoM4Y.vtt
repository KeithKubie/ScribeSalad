00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.689
Although we have a choice in becoming the people we strive to be it is without a doubt that our

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.790
childhoods shape us to a certain extent

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.690
How we choose to react to different situations and the way we express ourselves our behavioral patterns that are formed starting at a young age

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.110
When we first begin to learn how to make sense of our immediate environment

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.210
Marriage and family counselors  Dr. Mllan and Kay yerkovich discovered that everyone has a certain love style based on their upbringing

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:37.239
A love style is comprised of our tendencies and inclinations of how we respond to our romantic partners

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.089
But understanding how we love we can learn how our love styles affect our relationships.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.459
Hera are dr. Milan and Kaye yorkovich's five love styles

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.309
On:e the pleaser. The pleaser often grows up in a home with an overly protective or angry and critical parent. As children,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.029
pleasers do everything they can to be good and to be on their best behavior,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.459
so as to not provoke a negative response from their parent, Pleaser children don't receive comfort.

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.139
Instead they spend their time and energy giving comfort to their reactive parent.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.949
Pleasers are uncomfortable with conflict and deal with disagreements by often giving in or making up for them quickly.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.600
They usually have a hard time saying no and because they want to minimalize conflict,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.629
they may not be truthful and lie to avoid difficult confrontations. As pleaser children grow into adults,

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.219
they learn to read the moods of others around them to make sure they can keep everyone happy.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.280
However...

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.799
When pleasers feel stressed or believe that they are continuously letting someone down, they can have a breakdown and flee from relationships.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.619
Pleasers often spread themselves thin, trying to be everything to everyone when it's not realistic and

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.229
instead of forming healthy boundaries for themselves,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.500
they focus more on the needs and desires of others in order for pleasers to cultivate stable relationships,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.479
they have to be honest about their own feelings rather than trying to do what is expected of them

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.939
Two: the victim. The victim often grows up in a chaotic home.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.847
Victims learn to be compliant in order to survive by putting less attention on themselves so they can stay under the radar. To deal with

00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:16.779
their angry violent parents, victim children learn at a very young age to hide and stay quiet.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.839
Because being fully present is painful for them,

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.959
victim children often build an imaginary world in their heads to cope with the dangers. They face on a daily basis.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.760
Victims have low self-esteem and usually struggle with anxiety and depression. They may end up marrying controllers

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.940
who mirror the same behaviors as their parents. Victims learn to cope by being adaptable, and going with the flow.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.979
They are so used to chaos in stressful situations that when they do experience calmness,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.299
it actually makes them feel uneasy because they anticipate the next blow up in order for victims to cultivate healthy stable relationships,

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.839
they have to learn self-love and stand up for themselves when a situation calls for it, instead of letting their partner walk all over them.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900
Three: the controller.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.079
The controller

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.259
usually grows up in a home where there wasn't a lot of protection, so they learn to toughen up and take care of themselves.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.729
They need to feel in control at all times to prevent the vulnerability

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.049
they experienced in their childhood, from being exposed in their adulthood. People with this love style believe that they're in control when they can avoid

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.470
experiencing negative feelings of fear, humiliation, and helplessness.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.819
Controllers, however, don't associate anger as vulnerability. So they use it as a weapon to remain in power.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.279
Controllers have rigid tendencies, but may also be sporadic and unpredictable.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.690
They don't like stepping out of their comfort zones because it makes them feel weak and unprotected.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.639
They prefer to solve problems on their own, and like getting things done in a certain manner,

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.819
otherwise they get angry. In order for controllers to form stable long lasting relationships,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.410
they need to learn how to let go, trust others, and keep their anger at bay.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.669
Four: The vacillator.  The vacillator often grows up with an unpredictable parent.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.789
Vacillators learned that their needs aren't their parents top priority. Without consistent affection from their parents,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.219
vacillators develop a deep fear of abandonment,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.479
but when the parent finally feels like giving their time and attention to them, vacillators are usually too angry and tired to receive it.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.209
As vaciillators enter adulthood

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.440
they try to find the consistent love they were deprived of as children... Vacillators have a tendency to idealize new relationships,

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.549
but once they feel led down or disappointed, they grow dejected and doubtful.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.209
They often feel misunderstood and experience a lot of internal conflict and emotional stress within their relationships.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.940
They can be extremely sensitive and perceptive,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.549
which allows them to detect even the slightest change in others and no when people are pulling away.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.060
In order for vacillators to cultivate healthy stable relationships,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.359
they need to learn how to pace themselves and get to know someone before committing to soon and getting hurt by their own expectations.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.549
Five: the avoider. The avoider often grows up in a less affectionate home that values independence and self-reliance.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.270
As children,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.410
avoiders learn to take care of themselves starting at a very young age and put their feelings and needs on hold to deal with their

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.109
anxieties of having little to no comfort from their parents.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.140
Avoiders tend to like their space and rely on logic and detachment more than their emotions.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.770
They get uncomfortable when people around them experience intense mood swings. In order for avoiders to cultivate healthy

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.409
long-lasting relationship,. They need to learn how to open up and express their emotions honestly.
