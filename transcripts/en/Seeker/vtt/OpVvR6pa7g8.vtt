00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.670
I am in the middle of a huge dilemma, I really
don’t like jellyfish, they freak me out,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.480
but I love lasers… they’re so cool!

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.870
And this new science is making lasers with
jellyfish!?

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.170
AHHH!!

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.359
Hey photonic reflectors, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.079
When lasers were first invented, they were
called “a solution looking for a problem.”

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.960
In the decades since then, we’ve found a
number of ways to make lasers useful.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.039
Barcode scanners, industrial cutting, surgeries,
pointing at things... you name it!

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.010
Now, physicists and bioengineers are collaborating
to help us make new, even more specialized

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.579
lasers… thanks to proteins from jellyfish.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.809
But first... lasers were theorized in 1917
in a paper by Einstein, and first accomplished

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.970
in 1960 by T.H.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.300
Maiman.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.040
LASER is an acronym for Light Amplification
by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.690
Lasers make light, but not like regular light
bulbs.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.610
In a regular lightbulb, electrons are pushed
through a filament, causing them to get excited.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.670
That excitement causes them to throw little
photons of light and heat energy every which

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.670
way!

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.670
It’s chaos!

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.940
Lasers are far more precise…

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.210
A laser takes the same principle of emitting
light, but instead of going every which way,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.650
it’s an organized, tightly packed, beam
of photons.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.720
This organization requires specific substances
to emit their photons in a specific way so

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.100
the photons are monochromatic, coherent and
directional!

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.570
Put simply, a lightbulb is a running herd
of people, but a laser is a marching army.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.350
Different substances produce different wavelengths
of light, and different types of lasers are

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.240
good for different things.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.840
Red laser light can be used in sensors, spectrometers
and CD-players and can be made by exciting

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.600
a helium-neon gas or garnet.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.160
Blue or violet lasers can be used for data
storage applications (it’s what’s in a

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.450
blu-ray player) and in medical and and are
made by exciting gallium nitride…

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.450
But I digress.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.160
One of the most advanced laser types yet invented
is a polariton laser.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.130
It’s created by exciting the atoms of a
supercooled Bose-Einstein condensate (a crazy

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.630
state of matter) to create half-matter, half-light
quasiparticles...

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.630
Yeah.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.710
It’s pretty insane science, and not the
easiest thing to do.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.710
These polariton lasers can be used in quantum
physics, to tag cancer cells, or to make data

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.120
transfers faster, but they’re so hard to
make!

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.470
Supercooling ain’t easy!

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.100
Which brings us back to jellyfish (shudder).

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.480
In 2011, scientists pulsed low energy light
onto lab-grown cells containing a green fluorescent

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.810
protein (GFP) from the Aequorea victoria jellyfish.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.840
By putting them into a mirrored chamber, the
cells created an organized beam of monochromatic

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840
photons!

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840
Green laser light!

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.240
These were the first biological lasers!

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.730
Now in this new 2016 study, the researchers
took that GFP and grew it on a bed of e.coli

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.420
bacteria -- creating enhanced GFP (eGFP) that
glows way brighter.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.180
// enhance *air typing* // they created a
500 nanometer-thin film of this eGFP, placed

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.240
it into a mirrored housing… pulsed it with
light… aaaaand!

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.240
VOILA!!

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.680
A polariton laser for quantum applications
at room temperature!

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.430
No supercooling required!

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.430
Easy!

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.720
See, the reason they needed supercooled lasers
in the first place was to keep the photons

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.040
from moving around too much -- super-cold
particles behave better.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.120
But, the jellyfish proteins are barrel-shaped,
causing the photons to align perfectly.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.440
It only makes green light, but the hunt is
on for more glowing proteins… coral have

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.860
one that glows red…

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.370
From jellyfish, to lasers, to bioengineering
to quantum physics.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.530
I’m jelly.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.280
That’s super cool.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.690

Of course, this new study is predicated on
the fact that the jellyfish had glowing cells

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.370
in the first place!
