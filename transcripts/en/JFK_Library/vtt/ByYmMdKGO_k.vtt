00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.489
- In a moment of uncertainty
for so many of us.

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:05.680
A moment when so many of
us are asking ourselves

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.373
and each other what we
can do for our country.

00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:10.547
I can't think of a more
important lesson to draw upon

00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:13.994
than this key fact, that
it's up to all of us.

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:16.120
Young people and aged are at heart

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.364
to come together, find
out what beliefs we share

00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:20.736
and work towards solutions.

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:25.280
Tonight is an important
one for many reasons.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.577
Tonight we pay tribute
to the power of politics.

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:29.438
To enable young Americans to have a real,

00:00:29.438 --> 00:00:32.248
tangible, positive impact
on their community.

00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:34.995
And tonight we celebrate the
capacity for public service

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:38.566
outside of elected office, to
take on difficult challenges

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.624
with a new perspective.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:41.885
We can all make a difference

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:44.408
and tonight we honor two
people whose lives and careers

00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:47.785
prove that no matter how
difficult the challenge may seem

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:50.641
and how unfavorable the odds may be,

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:52.902
it's possible to do a
great deal of constructive

00:00:52.902 --> 00:00:55.701
and lasting work in your
community and beyond.
