00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.740
&gt;&gt; Well good morning again and
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.350
I'm John Cole, I'm the Director
of the Center for the Book

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.670
in the Library of Congress.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.360
Thanks for coming to our
very special Books and Beyond

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.270
for Young People's program.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.800
Our Center for the Book promotes
books, reading, libraries

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.630
and literacy to people of all ages
nationwide and here at the library,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.970
we have a room well,
actually three rooms

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.300
for those under 16 years of age.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.610
It's called the Young Reader's
Center, opened in 2009.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.810 position:56%
The center is on the ground floor
of this beautiful Jefferson Building

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.500
and there, with a parent or a
guardian, you can attend one

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.800
of our many programs or read the
latest books for young people.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.750
This morning I want to acknowledge
the Yount Reader Center Head,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.720
Karen Jaffe who with her staff

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.820
and volunteers have organized
this wonderful program.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.130
Karen, please stand up.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.930
Let's give her a hand.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.120
[ Applause ]

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.320
&gt;&gt; This actually is an annual
program for the Center for the Book

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260
and its Young Reader's Center.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.410
It's called The Jonah
Solkoff Eskin Memorial Program

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.090
and it has been funded for seven
years by Barney and Marsha Eskin

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.520
who are here with their son, Lee.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.990
Please, I would like these
three wonderful people to stand

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.510
and be acknowledged by our crowd.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:05.170
[ Applause ]

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.780
&gt;&gt; And in addition, here
at the Library of Congress,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.720
we love to add more resources
from our wonderful programs.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.230
Today, another sponsor is the
library's Veteran History Project,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.380
which collects, preserves, and
makes accessible the war stories

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.270
of America's Veterans.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.680
This project accepts Veteran's
recorded oral histories as well

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.740
as the collections of
original photographs, letters,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.190
military documents, diaries,
maps and other written materials.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.610
Any student over 15 can
participate by asking an adult,

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.600
or an older sibling or friend to
join you in interviewing a Veteran.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.740
You might know a Veteran from
your own family, neighborhood,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.930
or even a school whom you can
invite to participate with you

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.880
in this important project.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.220
You can visit the Library

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.860
of Congress website
for more information.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.710
But let me tell you
about today's audience.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.080
We don't have time for our usual
school by school cheerleading

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.370
so please hold your applause
until I go through the list.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.970
Representing the military is Joint
Base Fort Myer-Henderson Hall

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.400
in Virginia and Joint Base Andrews
Naval Air Facility in Maryland.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.860 position:56%
Both have brought military families,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.910
home schooled students
and Girl Scouts.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.560
Schools represented from
the District of Columbia,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.660
Washington School for Girls,
Stuart-Hobson Middle School

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.150
and Richard Wright
Charter Public School.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.440
From Virginia is Osbourn
Park High School.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.440
We also have representatives from
the Stonewall Jackson High School,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.010 position:56%
Prince William County Public Schools
and Arlington County Public Schools.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.510 position:56%
Let's have a round of applause for
all of our students, their teachers-

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:08.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.690
&gt;&gt; And we also thank their
chaperones and parents.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.430
It is now my pleasure
to introduce David Mao,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.230
who is the Acting Librarian
of Congress.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.810
For you kids, that means he's
a big shot okay [laughter].

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.130
David oversees the entire library
and its various service units

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.180
to insure the library's
services to Congress

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.630
and to the entire American
people are provided effectively.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.210
He previously served as
Deputy Librarian of Congress

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.640
and as the 23rd Law
Librarian of Congress.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.940
Please welcome David Mao.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.740
David?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:53.890
[ Applause ]

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.190
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:07.110
[ Applause ]

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much John
and good morning to all of you.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.100
Welcome to the Library of Congress
on this 72nd Anniversary of D-Day.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.870
Today's program was inspired
by Michael Grant's recent book,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.190
Front Lines, and it gives
us an opportunity to talk

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.800
about imagined roles of women in
the military during World War II

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.490
and also gives us an opportunity to
compare the events of World War II

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.940
with 21st century military life.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.600 position:56%
Now, Front Lines the book is the
first in a planned trilogy of books.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.180
Mr. Grant is also the
author of the Gone series

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.170
and the Magnificent Twelve series

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.020
and he spent much of
his life on the move.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.110
He was raised in a miliary
family and as I understand it,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.320
spent his years in 13 different
schools in five different states

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.100
and Europe so quite a
lot of moving around.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.570
His Front Lines book
imagines a World War II

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.120
with enlisted service
members of both genders

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.160 position:56%
and it specifically chronicles three
young women of diverse backgrounds

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.850
who are placed in combat alongside
of their male counterparts

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.150
so Michael, thank you very much

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.820
for joining us today
to discuss your book.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.120
I want to introduce the other
guests but before I do that,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.310
I want to ask you to read a
short passage from Front Lines

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.320
so that we can set the stage
for today's discussion.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.970
&gt;&gt; Should we do that now?

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.270
&gt;&gt; Yup, cool.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.570
You can sit there.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.450
&gt;&gt; Oh excellent, so much easier.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.860
I'll just stretch out here.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.370 position:56%
I've chosen a passage that's only I
think about 78 pages long [laughter]

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.640
so it shouldn't be a problem.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.490
Where we are right now is that one

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.810
of our main characters
Rio has been dragged along

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.490
on a mission that's not going to go
very well but it involves a landing

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.110
on a beach and this is her first
time in any kind of serious trouble

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.670
and they're jumping off
the boat right then.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.970
"Rio lurches to her right.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.780
Three steps, four, five, ten,
fifteen, counting them off,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.450
drops to her knees, plants the
butt of her rifle and lies face

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.390
down on her belly with the
weapon pointing towards

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.480
where she thinks the
machine gunner might be.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.490
Fifteen hundred rounds per minute,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.090
the standard German machine gun
fires fifteen hundred rounds

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.390
per minute.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.520
The machine gun opens up again,
loud but distant followed by softer

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.520
but way too near pff pff
sounds as the bullets hit sand.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.060
Soft whimpering noises are
coming from her throat,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.750
unlike any sound she's
ever made before.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.920
A split second slower than
Rio had hit the ground,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.260
Kerwin [phonetic] cries out.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.140
He says, "Oh."

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.060
Just that, "Oh."

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.800
Rio sees him fall backwards.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.100
His head lands in the edge

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.440
of retreating foam,
legs folded beneath him.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.890
"Castle, you hit?"

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.190
No answer.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.490
"God no, God no, God no."

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.560
The Jeep roars and splashes
out of the landing craft

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.710
and instantly draws the fire
of the enemy machine gun.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.010
"Are you hit?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.310
Castle, are you hit?"

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.610
"Doc? Doc?"

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.910
someone yells.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.740 position:56%
The Jeep swerves left and goes nose
down in a hole, rear wheels spinning

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.770
and throwing up a plume of sand.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.820
"Richlin, give doc a hand with
Castle", Sergeant Cole yells.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.210
"Stick, get that BAR up
onto that dune there.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.520
Put some fire on that machine gun.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.820
Take gear with you.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.680 position:56%
Castain, Pang, Suarez [assumed
spellings], stay low and follow me."

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.610
Rio crawls towards her stricken
comrade, elbows digging,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.980
knees pushing, heart gone mad.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.390 position:56%
The doc who came to shore with
fourth squad is hunched over Castle.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.010
He grabs at something in his
medical kit and now Rio sees

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.630
that Castle is flailing
spasmodically,

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.250
arms and legs jerking,
torso heaving.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.020
An advancing wave covers
his face and foam.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.010
"Pull him back, pull him back,
pull him back God damn it!

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.060
He'll drown" the medic shouts.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.730
Rio grabs Castles legs and
has to rise to her own knees

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.030
in order to get leverage.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.480
She is acutely aware of her exposed
back but hauls him out of the surf.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.440
"Hold him down" the medic
says through gritted teeth,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.190
as he tears open a bandage.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.560 position:56%
"Gotta stop the bleeding, his neck."

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.000
"Take it easy Castle,
take it easy" Rio says.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.190
Blood pulses from Castle's throat

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.000
like a garden hose
someone is kinking

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.150
and releasing, kinking
and releasing.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.790
The blood looks like chocolate
syrup in the darkness.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.250
Kerwin is making guttural sounds,

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.670
words full of urgency
with no vowels.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.040
Rio rises again just high enough to
place her hands on Kerwin's chest

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.700
and hold him down but as she does
this she feels slippery warmth

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.190
and realizes that large quantities

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.560
of blood are gushing
from his upper chest.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.790
He's been hit twice, not once.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.090
"Gotta take it easy, Castle.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.390
Let doc work."

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.280
It wound sound better if my
teeth weren't chattering,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.810
but Kerwin isn't hearing her.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.110
He jerks wildly, tries to
say something that comes

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.660
out as a plaintive grunt,
then lays back down quieting.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.900
Doc slaps a pressure
bandage on but the artery

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.720
in Castle's neck has barely slowed.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.350
It's like trying to block a
fire hydrant with your fingers.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.170 position:56%
Doc rips Castle's uniform shirt open

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.910
and there's a second hole
near, too near to his heart.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.200
The medic curses and then
covers that by telling Castle,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.500
"It's okay, it's okay soldier.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.800
You'll be okay.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.730
Going home is all, going home."

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.650
It's a lie, but Kerwin
never hears it anyway.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.460
Rio feels his heart stop.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.830
One second there's a wild beating
thing in his chest, then nothing.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.740
Kerwin's last breath was a
slow, wet, wheeze of exhalation

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.400
as if he's sinking back into
an easy chair after a long day.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.960
The machine gun shatters
and digs divots pff pff pff

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.680
in the sand near Rio so she has
to roll away clutching her rifle

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.000
to her chest with blood
slicked hands.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Kerwin is dead without ever
getting a chance to speak.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.510
His final intelligible word was
just that single syllable, "Oh."

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:38.040
[ Applause ]

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.340
&gt;&gt; So that was cheerful [laughter].

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.500
&gt;&gt; Well thank you for that
very descriptive reading,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.260
thank you so much.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.510
We're also very privileged
today to have joining us

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.510
for today's discussion
Lieutenant Commander Kristen Hansen

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.510
and Captain Rebecca Murga.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:11:02.060
[ Applause ]

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.700
&gt;&gt; Lieutenant Commander
Hansen is a graduate

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.570
of the United States Naval Academy.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.950
She made her first deployment to
Iraq and Afghanistan in support

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:14.410
of Operation Iraqi Freedom and then
joined Operation Enduring Freedom.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.940
After graduating from Navy Fighter
Weapon School, yes that's Top Gun,

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.690
she became a strike
fighter tactics instructor.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:27.040
Commander Hansen, to her credit,
has 66 combat sorties over Iraq,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.550
Afghanistan and Syria
and 472 carrier landings.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.760
As a Public Affairs Officer,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.450
Captain Murga has captured
the soldier's story in combat.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.420
She was attached to a special
operations command supporting SEAL

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.970
teams and Special Forces
in Afghanistan.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.040
She received the Bronze
Star for her service

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.520
and the Meritorious Service
Medal for service in Iraq.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.180
Currently, she's Captain in the
Office of Chief Army Reserve.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.290
Thank you both very
much for your service

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.510
to our country and
for your sacrifices.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:09.200
[ Applause ]

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.760
&gt;&gt; Our very special guest
today is Dr. Jill Biden.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.420
She knows sacrifice as well and
Dr. Biden, we are very proud

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.360
that you are joining us and
you are a Blue Star Mom,

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.330
so thank you for being here.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.950
Military families founded Blue Star
Families to support one another

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.590
and to enlist the community in
supporting military families.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.460
As Second Lady, Dr. Biden
works to bring attention

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.750
to the sacrifices made by
military families as part

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:41.320
of her Joining Forces
initiative with Michelle Obama.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.960
Dr. Biden also works tirelessly
to highlight the importance

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.710
of community colleges
in America's future.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.010
She's a lifelong educator
and continues to teach

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.860
at a community college
in northern Virginia.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.250
Among her many accomplishments,

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.060
Dr. Biden co-founded the
Book Buddies program,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.790
which enlists trained
volunteers to provide instruction

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.600
to young students who need
extra support in literacy,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.540
something that's very near
and dear to our heart here

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.740
at the Library of Congress.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.710
Dr. Biden is also the author of
Don't Forget, God Bless Our Troops.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.210
Today's program will offer insights
into the unique relationship

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.300
between literature and
history and we're very honored

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.880
to have her facilitate
this conversation.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.390
At the end of the program, we'll
have time for questions and answers

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.200
and it will be followed by a
book signing with both Dr. Biden

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.360 position:56%
and Mr. Grant, so enjoy the program.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.160
Thank you very much.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:40.570
[ Applause ]

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:45.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you so again, my name is
Jill Biden, I am a military mom.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:52.080
Our son Beau was deployed
to Iraq for a year in 2008,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.960
and one of the things that I've
spent the last eight years doing is

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.440
traveling the United States
and really around the world

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.380
and meeting with military families.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:11.600
We've gone to bases in
Germany, and in Japan,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.020 position:56%
and all over the United States and
one of the focuses that we've had is

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.370
to talk really to women
in the military

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.260
and to see what their lives are
like and whether they're a spouse

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:31.200
or whether they're a fire
pilot, or on the front lines,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.020
that's been our focus to see how
we can help military families.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.650
Michelle and I have spent
really the last eight years

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.430
of this administration
working on that subject.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.310
How many people in the
audience are a family

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:50.740
who is connected to the military?

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.720
Wow! A lot of you.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.080
Great, so this is perfect
[laughter].

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:05.550
Today, we have two really special
women here because if you think

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:13.070
about it, how many, I guess kids
actually have their moms deployed?

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:19.440
It's hard to see because
the lights are in our eyes

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.380
so nobody really has a mom
deployed well, some of the moms

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:28.400
that I've met have told me really
if you think about all of you think

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:34.130
about your mom being deployed and
what you would kind of miss right?

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.820
Because the moms tell me, the moms
who are in the military service,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.720
they tell me how hard it
is for them to be away

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.860
on those special occasions like
when their son or daughter is going

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.950
to college, or they
missed their graduation,

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.960
their high school graduation or
being there for special birthdays

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.600
or all kinds of special events.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.860
So, if you think about that event
and not having your mom there

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:06.370
and having your mom in Iraq or
Afghanistan it's kind of hard

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.490
so you can see it from
both points of view.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.090
You can see how the moms
are missing their children

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:16.960 position:56%
and the children are missing their
mothers so this is truly a sacrifice

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.990 position:56%
that I think female military leaders
make when they join the service.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.000
Has anyone here in the
audience, has anyone thought

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.800
about joining the military?

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.200
Okay, a couple, all right.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.960
As you've meet Kristen
and you've met Jessica-

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.260
&gt;&gt; Rebecca.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.560
&gt;&gt; Rebecca-

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.730
&gt;&gt; I'll be Jessica
for you thought ma'am.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.960
&gt;&gt; Okay [laughter], I'm
sorry so I'd like for them

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.940
to tell you their stories and
why they went into the military,

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.530
and what kind of jobs they do,

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:04.190
and you'll see really how
special they are so Kristen,

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.490
do you want to start with yours?

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.030
&gt;&gt; Sure, hi everybody, I'm Kristen.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.800 position:56%
I grew up in Weymouth, Massachusetts
which is about 30 minutes south

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.840
of Boston and for as
long as I can remember,

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.850
I grew up wanting to
be an astronaut.

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:19.850
I was upset when I
went to kindergarten

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:21.920
because I could not
watch shuttle launches

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.720
so my poor parents thought
I would grow out of it

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.070
and I never did, to their dismay.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:31.470
But when I grew up I was like
well, I have to join the Air Force,

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.770
that's what astronauts
did and come to find

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.840
out the Naval Academy has the most
astronaut graduates in the country

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.390
so I was very binary and I was
like well, I'm going there.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.180
And dad drove me down to Annapolis
and I was totally smitten.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.280
I loved everything about it
and my mom was totally dismayed

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.290
when I came back and realized I
wasn't going to change my mind

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.660
so went to Navy, had an awesome
time there, played soccer,

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.810
studied aerospace engineering.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.120
When I graduated, I was lucky
enough to select aviation,

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.340
went to flight school down
in Pensacola and Meridian

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.990
and was lucky enough to get
F18s out of flight school.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.160
I got sent over to
Lemoore, California which is

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.390 position:56%
about 45 minutes south of Fresno and
I have somehow managed to live there

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.820
for just over a decade now,
which is probably a world record

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.650 position:56%
in the military, not having to move.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.200
I've done three operational
tours over there

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.320
and an instructor tour
and had a fabulous time.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.990
As they said, I've
done a couple of trips

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.930 position:56%
over to the Gulf and to Afghanistan.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.120
We actually just got home a year
ago with my current squadron

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.630
so it's been a fabulous
experience for me.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:45.460 position:56%
The people have been outstanding and
I get a somewhat expensive aircraft

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.200
to fly around on the
government's dime so thanks

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.510
to all the taxpayers [laughter],
I really appreciate it.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:57.920
[ Applause ]

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.870
&gt;&gt; That's pretty impressive
really, to think of all the things

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.480
that you've done and the
career path that you've chosen.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.270
So will you be deployed again?

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.570
&gt;&gt; Probably.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.990
I think I probably have about one
more operational tour so I'm going

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.300
to an instructional tour for about
two and a half years in November

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.100
and then rotate out of
there and go back to sea

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.330
for about a 30 month tour and then
I'll be right about the time I have

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.940
to decide if I want to get
out or stay in so we'll see.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.330
I have at least seven more years
before I have to grow up I guess.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.390
&gt;&gt; All right, Rebecca, do you
want to tell us your story?

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.390
&gt;&gt; Sure, I'm originally
from Chicago, Illinois.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.060
Anybody from Chicago in here?

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.450
Probably not.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:42.750
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, one person.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.360
It's hard to see.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.840
&gt;&gt; So, when I was a kid I
actually wanted to be a filmmaker.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.560
I went in to watch a film called
Annie, and I left and told my mom,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.730
" I want to be Annie" and she
said, "Well, you have parents,

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.670
you cannot be an orphan"
[laughter] and so I realized

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.740
that I wanted to make films.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.030
And so, I went to school and
studied television production

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.490
and I was a senior in college
going that route when 9/11 happened

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.440
and for me, I just really
wanted to serve and give back

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.040
so I joined the Army,
which is the best branch

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.410
in case you don't know [laughter].

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.430
&gt;&gt; How many years have
we won in football?

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:28.200
&gt;&gt; I know, I know, not a good
football team but a fun branch.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.600
So when I was in, at the time
my civilian job was working

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.210
in sports production so
I was working for ESPN

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:41.110
and Comcast doing some really
cool, fun things with the Yankees,

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.950
and when I deployed the Army
found out and they were like well,

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.740
you're going to tell
soldier stories now

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.960
so it was an incredible experience
because I spent about three years

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.400
between Iraq, Afghanistan,
and Kuwait traveling around

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.400
and interviewing soldiers
and videotaping them

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.900 position:56%
and basically telling the American
public what these men and women did.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:12.100
And in 2011, at that time I was one
of the first women to get attached

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.960
to Navy Seals and Special
Forces and Navy Seals (Navy)

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.860
in case you don't know, are some
of the most awesome folks out there

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.170
and Special Forces as well.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.270
And women, at the time
of Afghanistan,

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.570
nobody had talked to them.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.280
Nobody knew what they were
doing or how they were working

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.270
so what they did is they took a
bunch of women in the military,

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.230
they put them with the Navy Seals
and basically our job was to go out

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.090
and talk to these women,
and talk to children,

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.420
and find out what they were doing
because as most people know,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.230
the status that women have in a
country is directly correlated

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.940
on how well that country
does economically,

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.530
how well it does socially, so
that was a big part of what I did.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.290
And while I was over there, I
remember I was in the middle

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.230
of Afghanistan and a buddy of
mine said to me, "You know,

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.530
if you could do one
thing for the rest

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:04.830
of your life what would that be?"

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:09.050
And I said, "I want to make
films" and that's what I did.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.500
He said you survived two years
in the middle of a war zone,

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.710
how hard can being a filmmaker be?

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:20.510
He had obviously never been to
Hollywood [laughter] so I went

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.670
to Los Angeles and spent the
last three years making films

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.780
and I'm finishing up a short
film that is going to be

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.960
on HBO probably next
fall, which is really cool

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.620
and it's basically telling
stories about that film

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.500
about a wounded warrior
who comes back

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.260
and so I realized my calling
now is really telling some

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.560
of those stories.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.860
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.160
&gt;&gt; What's the title?

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.500
&gt;&gt; It's called, One Halloween,
which is a very short film

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.660
about 15 minutes but we had 25
Veterans come and work on the set

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.270 position:56%
and a couple Vets here actually
supporting me that were on that set.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.070
I've got to give a
shout out to them.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:59.720
[ Applause ]

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.020
&gt;&gt; Hi, welcome.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.890
&gt;&gt; And it's great because as you
know, when you serve and you're

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.270
in the military, you're part
of a family and when you leave,

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:10.510
sometimes it's hard because
that family's not there anymore

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.210
but you do have organizations like
Veterans in Film and Television

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:18.020
that you support one another and
you tell the stories and I realize

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.080
that that's what I want to do

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.050
so my experience being
deployed has really prepped me

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.460
for the challenges of
Hollywood, I guess.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.510
&gt;&gt; I bet it has.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.200
Well you've really led an
interesting life as well.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.770
&gt;&gt; Well I think, someone once said
something, it's not at the end

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.460
of your life it's not the person
with the most money that wins,

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.430
it's the person that
has the best stories

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.330
and so spend your life trying

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.050
to make really good
stories in your life.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.430
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that's important
that the kids in the audience,

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.570
all the students in the
audience hear your stories

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.970
because I don't know what
perceptions they have of women

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:03.190 position:56%
in the military, which is kind of
interesting Michael for you that one

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:08.230
of the things I wanted to know,
how did you choose this topic?

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.880
&gt;&gt; Well, I never believe in a
single motivation for everything

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:16.640
so there's always multiple motives
and part of it was marketing,

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.690
part of it was I like
history, and I'm frustrated

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.190
with the way history is taught and
I care about it and I care about it

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.680
as only a high school dropout
who came late to it can.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.040
&gt;&gt; Oh, you dropped
out of high school?

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.690
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah-

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.840
&gt;&gt; Remember their inspirational
stories [laughter]?

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.140
Nothing like that.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.440
&gt;&gt; Did you get your GED?

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did get a GED yes,

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.040
because I'm very good
at taking tests.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.040
Then I went to college and
I dropped out of college.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.070
[ Laughter ]

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.540
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, I teach
college, stay in college,

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.840
stay in school [laughter].

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.900
&gt;&gt; I tell everybody, one of
my stablemates where I work,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.970
the publisher I work for is
Veronica Roth, who did Divergent

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.570
and Veronica came right
out of college at like,

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.240
age 22 or whatever and
wrote a best-seller.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.830
Do it her way and not mine.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:12.870
If you're looking for a role
model, go for Ms. Roth and not me.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.210
That was part of it.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:20.630
Mostly to me, the threshold is am
I going to have fun doing this,

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.540
which sounds, I know I'm
supposed to have some grand motive

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.870
and some big long explanation
but honestly,

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.180
it was interesting in
terms of marketing.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.400
We were trying to see
whether this kind of thing,

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.310
whether you could do old
history in the young adult,

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.330
whether that was going
to be a thing,

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.260
so I told my editor
I'm putting a bet

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.530
down on this, let's
see if this works.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.820
We'll see how that goes.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.150
But mostly, I was interested
in history

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:49.710
and I'd started reading The
Liberation Trilogy by Rick Atkinson

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.710
because my father in law had
forced it on me and I thought man,

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.770
I don't want another
book about World War II,

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.460
and I started reading it and about
halfway through I'm just like,

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.750 position:56%
this is like so much story you know?

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.490
Almost like story as a commodity
like, thousands of pounds worth

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.080
of story and so I wanted
to kind of get into it

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.600
and I thought I can do that,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.360
I can make it more interesting,
more accessible maybe.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.810
I'll add a couple changes.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.100
I made two big changes
in Front Lines,

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.710
one is by inventing a 1940
Supreme Court decision, which is-

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.180
&gt;&gt; Do you want to tell
them what that was?

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in my fictional
world in 1940,

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.390
the Supreme Court decision
comes down that opens the draft

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:32.240
and enlistment to women so
it's a big shock to society

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.280
but then this all happens
before Pearl Harbor and then

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.850
at Pearl Harbor, at the point
where the book starts society

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:42.910
and individuals are really confused
about what this is going to mean,

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.770 position:56%
whether it's really going to happen.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:49.240 position:56%
The girls who enlist don't
actually expect to end up in combat,

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.510
they think they're probably
going to end up as secretaries

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:56.350
or driving trucks maybe so they're
a little shocked that they end

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.350
up on the front lines, which I
expect a lot of male soldiers-

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.250
&gt;&gt; Or nurses probably, stereotypes.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the stereotypical jobs,
so I thought that was interesting

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.440
and I thought it would be fun
to write and also give me lots

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:15.800 position:56%
of excuses to do travel that I could
write off on my taxes [laughter].

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.140
&gt;&gt; He's irreverent, isn't he?

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:22.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Always a consideration, I'm going
to Europe this summer to research.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.940
I just want to jump in and
say when they first asked me

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.540
to do this panel, I thought it
was me and some kid book writers.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.620
There's one kid book writer here
but she's also Dr. Jill [laughter]

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.430
and then weeks later they go,
oh and Jill Biden will be there.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.730
I go, "What?

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.030
What? Back up."

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.030
But I thought no, that's
fine, I'm used to academics.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.270
And then they tell me that two
actual combat officers are going

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.280
to be there and I was right on
the edge of going I can't do this

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.840
because I make stuff up,
they do things [laughter].

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.760
Big gap between make stuff
up in the comfort of my home

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.860
and actually going out and being
in trouble in dangerous areas

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.940
so if you have questions, I guess
we're going to do Q&amp;A later on,

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.540
I should probably get all questions
that involve multi book series

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.050
and how to write them and
all questions having to do

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.930
with actual stuff involving
combat should-

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:24.220
&gt;&gt; So you two have read the
book, so how true do you think

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.930
that Michael made the
characters to your experience?

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.230
&gt;&gt; She has not read the book.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.530
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:32.750
&gt;&gt; She's top of her class and
I'm like the kid in the back

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.550
that forgot to read the book.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.040
[ Laughter ]

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.230
&gt;&gt; She's waiting for the
Cliff Notes to come out.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.830
&gt;&gt; I was like, tell me a
little bit about the book.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.540
&gt;&gt; You should have
gotten a synopsis.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.610
You know you can go
on Google and do that.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.780
&gt;&gt; I read them because then I
know what my students have read,

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.510
whether they've read the
book or the synopsis.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.050
[ Laughter ]

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.760
&gt;&gt; I'm terrible in history so I
will not judge any historical-

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.060
&gt;&gt; That's probably good.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.000
&gt;&gt; I have no yeah, but we were
talking a little bit before

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.920
and I thought the characters were
very well captured and especially

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.860
on the way from day one they
start off at training until hey,

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.520
we've now been through some
stuff and now we're a family

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:20.810
that transitioned through that,
I think is very well done.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:24.610
I was laughing at, there's a point

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:28.010
that I think it's Rainy that's
getting on the train ready to leave

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:33.080
and they're looking at the train
station and she notices it's weird

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.570 position:56%
because the guys were saying goodbye
to the girls as they're going off

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:42.650 position:56%
to war and I chuckled because last
Christmas my roommate and one or two

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:47.190 position:56%
of the other girls on the ship with
me, and there are far more girls now

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.540
than there were when I started off,

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.490
this last cruise we actually
had quite a bit and you'd go

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.510
in the bathroom and like, I
have to wait to take a shower?

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:58.060
This is new, I've never
had this problem before.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.040
&gt;&gt; It's a good thing,
it's a good thing.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.070
&gt;&gt; It's nice that, way easier to
have a girl's night out now so,

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.330
but the boys had actually come out
to visit the girls at Christmas

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.470
and when they had come back they
said it was a really weird dynamic

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.060
because the boys literally said
goodbye to the girls and got

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.970
in a taxi and went back to the
airport and the girls went back off

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:22.720
to war and that it was almost a
mirror image of the two scenes.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.440
I think things like that were
captured very well and a lot

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.760
of the little bit of razzing
that goes back and forth

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.630
in the transition between I don't
really care where you come from

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.980
or who you are as long
as you do your job well,

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.760
and we did it together that
becomes, that matters more

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.860
in the end then your
roots and if you're a girl

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.700
or a guy or what race you are.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.770
I thought that was pretty cool.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.070
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.060
&gt;&gt; I think it's interesting too
like, when I interviewed one

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.470
of the first women Rangers to
graduate from Ranger school

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.060
and I don't know if you guys know
the combat exclusion rule for women

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.640
in combat, even though women have
been there World War II like,

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.140
I've interviewed women
Veterans who I remember going

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.730
to VA there was a little old woman
there and she was like, "Yeah,

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.530
I served" and you don't
hear a lot of those stories.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:08.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.940
&gt;&gt; But I interviewed one of
the first women to graduate

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.310
from Ranger school and she said
the same thing, when you're dirty,

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.720
and tired, and hungry,
and you need someone

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.630
to carry a little bit more
weight, you do not care what

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.570
that person looks like,
what their nationality is,

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.470
where they're from, or
what their gender is.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.100
You just want someone that's
going to be there for you and kind

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.120
of have your back,
which is interesting.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.250
When you're exhausted you just
don't care what that person looks

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.240
like that's next to you, you know?

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.300
&gt;&gt; Well, the military
really is a family you know,

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.000
and that's the feeling
I get wherever we go.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.850
I think it is just
such a special family.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:51.190
&gt;&gt; And it can be very dysfunctional
at times too [laughter] you know,

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.330
like you have brothers in
your family who I always say

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.650
if you're a woman you have to just
learn to deal with you're going

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.830
to listen to every sports fact that
there possibly is on the planet,

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.250
you're going to hear guys arguing
about cars, and this and that,

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:11.760 position:56%
and it really is being surrounded by
an incredible group of men and women

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.820
but brothers that you, I'm sure you
guys have brothers that you love

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.840
and brothers that drive you insane.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.710
That to me has always
been what the military is.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.320 position:56%
It's a wonderful family but family
can drive you insane too [laughter].

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.620
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.000
&gt;&gt; For the record, we
used to say that the guys

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.760 position:56%
in my squadron talked more about
hair and fashion than the girls did.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.060
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.290
&gt;&gt; We had more discussions on who
could come up, Fury had just come

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.060
out and they all wanted
the Brad Pitt haircut

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.600 position:56%
and they would go spend an hour at
Zara when we pulled into port and me

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.310
and my friend were just
like, "What are you doing?"

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.840
We're like, "That should be us."

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.980
&gt;&gt; Of course it should be pointed

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.270
out in World War II things
were substantially different

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:56.070
in that the Army was segregated,
segregated openly racist

00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:00.680
and I've masked the "N"
word throughout the book not

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.240
because I didn't want to because
I don't like masking anything,

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.530
but it would have been an
imposition on the librarians

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:11.880
who have a very hard time stocking
the book as a result but racism

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.820 position:56%
at that time wasn't under the radar.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.000
It was right out there and open.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.340
People would tell you to your
face, people would say any number

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:26.980
of things, anti-Semitism, racism,
and those play parts around my book

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.930
and also the sexism
would have been obvious

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.040
but I felt it would have a
different character to it.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.340
&gt;&gt; Uh huh.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.520
&gt;&gt; Because I think people acquire
kind of a vocabulary of hate.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.210
They learn how to hate, they
learn how to express thoughts

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:48.910
that are racist, or sexist,
misogynist, but in 1942,

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.280
that wouldn't have happened yet.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.580
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.520
&gt;&gt; Because women were not yet
liberated and men were not

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.350
yet feeling threatened by
women in the workplace,

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.640
that came after World War
II after they realized oh,

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.770
that riveting job I used to have,

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.080
turns out my wife does
it just as well as I do.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.590
So yeah, at that point
the Army was very much

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:11.420
that Black units were not allowed
in combat until the very end.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.730
&gt;&gt; Did you realize that?

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.070
Did most of you realize that?

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah so one of the two
changes I made in the book I mean,

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.270
in addition to inserting women into
it I moved the combat involvement

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.390
of African-American units
earlier than they were in fact,

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:27.240
because for fictional reasons
I needed it to be that way

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.310
because I had a character
I needed to get in play.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.470
Other than that, I tried
to stay very accurate

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:37.730
and I've had people say, gotten
reviews of it saying well,

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:43.820
really you were unsparing in your
treatment of racism and misogyny

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.220 position:56%
and I wrote back to one person, "No,
actually I probably dialed it back

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.480
by 25 or 30 percent, it would
have been worse I think."

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so for those of you
who have not read the book,

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:59.450
there are three female characters
so Rio is sort of the I don't know,

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.140 position:56%
sort of the sassy one would you say?

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.060
&gt;&gt; She's the all American
girl basically.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.410
She's actually based in my head
on Audie Murphy, who was a guy

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:11.270
and I use Audie Murphy
for a specific reason.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.340
Audie Murphy, if you don't
know, Audie Murphy was a soldier

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.850
in World War II who tried to
enlist, who was a kid from Texas.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.330
His parents I think were dead, he
was living with his sister and went

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:22.920
and tried to enlist in the Marines

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.270
because he thought they
were the biggest, baddest.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.780
Are they the biggest and baddest?

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.080
&gt;&gt; No, no.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.380
&gt;&gt; This guy right down here-

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.680
[ Laughter ]

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.040
&gt;&gt; He's got a whole different
opinion on it, just saying.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.060
[ Laughter ]

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.280
&gt;&gt; He tried to enlist in the
Marines and they told him go away

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.630
because you're too small and
you look kind of effeminate,

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.160
you look kind of like a girl.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.720
He went to the Navy and they
told him exactly the same thing

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.760 position:56%
and he finally got in the Army, the
Army trained him, sent him to Italy,

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.320
he was deployed and even after he
was deployed his officers didn't

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.350
want to let him get to the front
line because he was a tiny,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:58.190 position:56%
little guy and looked kind of
effeminate from their point of view.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:02.270
He was in fact, five feet, five
inches tall and weighed 110 pounds,

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.960
which is almost exactly the size
of the average American woman today

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.300
and Audie Murphy, for those
of you who don't know,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.440 position:56%
is the most decorated soldier in
the American forces in World War II.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.210
He won basically every medal you
can get including the big one

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.230
so that's who Rio is.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:25.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And the Rainy was another
character and she was a Jewish woman

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.890
and so she went in to
fight against the Germans

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.790
and really had this strong
passion that all she wanted

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.290
to do was kill Nazis and so-

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.190
&gt;&gt; She's the only one of the three
who really has what you would think

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.730
of as a classic motivation, I
want to go to war to kill people.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.860
Rio is very much swept along
and the reason I did that was

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.990
because when I was doing
research and listening

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:49.230
to first person narratives
you'd hear guys say it

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.530
over and over again.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.670
I didn't go to save the world,
I didn't go for this or that,

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:56.020
I just felt like I had to,
I felt like I was swept up,

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.710
I felt like it was time,
my friends were going,

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.190
and so there was that kind of feel.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:04.050
A lot of the guys who enlisted,
and I assume the same would be true

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:07.140
of Rio, she enlisted
because her friend was.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And to avenge her sister's death.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.420
&gt;&gt; And to avenge, yeah and
she had a personal motive

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.190
because she had a sister die
and though is much hipper.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:20.320
She's a big city girl, she comes
from New York City, she's Jewish,

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.240
she knows that Jewish families
have already started kind

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.850
of to get the feeling that hey,
we're not getting a lot of letters

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.590
from the relatives in Poland,
I wonder what that's about,

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.120
so it was already beginning to
settle into the Jewish community

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.150 position:56%
that this was something specifically
heinous going on for Jews.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:40.720
Of course they knew obviously about
the Nuremberg laws by that point

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:47.200
and then Frangie Marr is just in it
basically because her dad got hurt-

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.500
&gt;&gt; And she's African-American.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's a Black girl from-

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.190
&gt;&gt; Small, terrible soldier right?

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's a terrible
soldier but she wants-

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.390
&gt;&gt; [Laughter] You made her
out to be a terrible soldier.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.710
&gt;&gt; But she wants to be a
medic and she's from Tulsa

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.340
and I used Tulsa deliberately
and for people who don't know

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.930
about Tulsa, I would urge you to
learn some of the history of Tulsa

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:09.770 position:56%
because it's not great but it's an
interesting sideline that gets woven

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:13.970
in later on in the
narrative so yeah, yeah,

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.530
three main characters
and a couple of others.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.410
&gt;&gt; And Frangie went in
because they needed the money,

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.710
they were very poor.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:22.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, her dad was out of work.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.040
He'd been injured and
for practical reasons,

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.220
which is again another
big motivation

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.910
from people especially
in those days.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:33.300
This was a poor country, we were
just getting over the Depression.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:38.830
There was a lot of people for whom
not much money was a lot of money.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.130
Ten dollars was the difference

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:44.200
between you keep your
house or you don't.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.840
Different now, now
it's a hundred dollars.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.610
&gt;&gt; So she had to go in
to support her family.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:48.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.210
&gt;&gt; She was helping to
support her family.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.070
&gt;&gt; She was helping,
she needs the paycheck.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.800
&gt;&gt; So that's why she went in.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.400
&gt;&gt; So then your next books
will be the three stories

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.170
of where the three women end up?

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm going
to stick with them

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.020
so I've already written book two.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.440
That's in the can, in other
words I've written it,

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.390
it's been edited and
I'm done with it.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:11.760
It goes from the invasion
of Sicily up through Italy

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.530
and then book three, which will
be D-Day through the liberation

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:19.030
of [inaudible] and probably
some aftermath depending

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.830
on how bloated the damned
thing is by that point

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.590
and what my editor is
telling me in terms of length.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.370
She doesn't like books
over 500 pages.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:31.190
&gt;&gt; So when you started out, did you
think there are some things I want

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:34.520
to get off my chest, or some
themes I want to reveal?

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.820
&gt;&gt; No, I never do that.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.120
&gt;&gt; No?

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.490
&gt;&gt; And it's odd because my
books are generally considered,

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:44.030
I spend a lot of time talking
about philosophy, about ideas,

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:49.800 position:56%
and about abstractions and God knows
in real life I'm a huge egomaniac

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.580
but in my books, I don't want
to be present in the books.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.200
I don't want people to see me.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:58.290
I want them to just look at the
characters and if there are ideas

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:02.070
that come out then I want to
present them as fairly as I can.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.920
I've had people ask me again
and again are you Christian,

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.000
are you atheist because
they don't know,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.970
because I've discussed
religion repeatedly in my books

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:14.240
and I've tried to be fair
to all sides of the topic.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:19.170
It's not my job as I see it,
to force my ideas on readers.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.980
My job is to tell a story
and if in the process

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.870 position:56%
of me telling a story that's
entertaining they reach a conclusion

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.500
or think about something,
that's great.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:34.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; All right well stylistically, I'm
an English teacher so when you talk

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.800
to the reader and you
say gentle reader,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.660
that sort of threw me off a little
bit so where did that come from?

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:48.220
&gt;&gt; That's an old form that you'd
see back more in Victorian era.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.520
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.980
&gt;&gt; So I did that deliberately
as kind of a throwback

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.010
because it's meant to sound ironic.

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:59.320 position:56%
It's meant to sound a little bit, I
don't know a little sneering almost.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.210
Not quite but you know,
a little bit of,

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:05.290
it's a bit of that you don't know
what's going on, I'm telling you

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:09.440
so there's narrator who we don't
know the identity of the narrator.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.740
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.320
&gt;&gt; Who has just a couple of
bits scattered throughout.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.740
&gt;&gt; Will you reveal that?

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.040
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, yeah.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.340
At first I didn't know
who it was [laughter]

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.780
because I don't plan books,
I make them up every day

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.870
as I go along although in
this case you know, Mr. Hitler

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:32.110
and Mr. Churchill kind of wrote the
script and now I'm following along.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.830
Spoiler alert, we still
win [laughter].

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:44.120
&gt;&gt; Are there any comments that you
would like to make to the audience?

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.780
Any of our-

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:49.500
&gt;&gt; And we'll do questions, we're
going to do questions right?

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.800
You guys have questions?

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.980
If you don't , we're just
going to sit here and stare

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.470
at each other [laughter].

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.030
Yeah, yeah you.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.340
&gt;&gt; What inspired me?

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.590
I've got to tell you the
truth, I never think about the,

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.230
I never look at it as inspiration.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.130
I don't treat this, and part

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:12.020 position:56%
of the reason is I think writers get
a little over themselves you know,

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.870
get a little full of themselves
sometimes and start talking

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.910
about inspiration and start talking
about opening a vein and bleeding

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.550
on a page and all this stuff,
he says cleaning up his language

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.480
at the last second [laughter].

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.880
That's not my approach.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.090
My approach is this is my job.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:32.380
I go do my job every day so before
I became a writer I'd been a waiter

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:33.680
for 10 years.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.080 position:56%
Matter of fact, Annapolis, Maryland,
you ever go to Middleton's?

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.380
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.680
&gt;&gt; Middleton Tavern?

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.980
&gt;&gt; Love it.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.280
&gt;&gt; I used to wait tables
at Middleton Tavern.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.820
I was a waiter for 10 years,
I cleaned toilets with my wife

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:47.180
for two years, we had a janitorial
service and so that's where I come

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.740
from and I look at this as this
is my job, I work hard at it,

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.550
I get up every day and I do
it, I don't tolerate this talk

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.950
of writer's block or
any of this nonsense.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:01.600
It's my job to get up and do it
and by the way, when I say job,

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.680
it's the best job in the world.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.680
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, tell us where you write.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.980
Okay, listen.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.040
&gt;&gt; Well at the present, I'm
writing mostly on my deck,

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.180
which is on the side of a hill
looking out over San Francisco Bay

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.030
so I sit there and look at there's
the city and there's this much

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.400
of the Golden Gate over
here, I can see it sticking

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.150
up over Belvedere Island
and then there's Alcatraz

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:24.560
and all this other kind of stuff
so I go out there and I work

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.470
for about three hours a day,
drinking coffee and smoking cigars.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:29.770
Don't smoke cigars [laughter].

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:31.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:32.890
&gt;&gt; You can drink coffee.

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.520
Don't, you'll look ridiculous
with a cigar, seriously.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:40.060
It's like, the best job in the
world and as I sometimes point

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.760
out to audiences, I generally
earn more than the President

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:46.400
of the United States and nobody
calls me up at 3:00 in the morning

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.270
to tell me something blew
up somewhere, you know?

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:50.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So writing is a great profession.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.650
&gt;&gt; It's great man, if you
can make a living at it,

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:54.960
it's the best thing in the world.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.640
If people knew how easy
it is and how great it is,

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:03.600
we'd have people [laughter],
we don't want to tell them.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.680
What they do is way harder.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.590
They have to fly airplanes.

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:13.070
&gt;&gt; I want to know what's
the theme of your story.

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:14.370
&gt;&gt; The theme?

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:15.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:16.970
&gt;&gt; I don't know, did a
teacher put you up to that?

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:18.300
Where are you?

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.330
[ Laughter ]

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:21.630
&gt;&gt; Right there?

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:22.930
Is that a-

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.230
&gt;&gt; What's wrong with themes?

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:25.980
You know I'm a teacher right?

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.640
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.780
Look, I look at these things,

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:33.180
for me I follow certain very
simple rules on writing.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.560 position:56%
The first is, it's always character,
everything else is subordinate

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.390
to character so if you're, are
you thinking about being a writer?

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:41.690
&gt;&gt; Uh-uh.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.150
&gt;&gt; Okay, you don't want
to do that [laughter].

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:46.600
For people who are
thinking about it,

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.790
job number one is make
your characters real,

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:51.500
make them authentic
and that's how I start.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.760
I start with character, then I
go to setting, and from then on,

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.620
I just make stuff up but I never
really sit down and think oh,

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.810
what's the theme of this.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.110
It's not like that.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:05.510
&gt;&gt; But when you read you should
think, what is the theme of this?

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:12.690
[ Laughter ]

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:14.260
&gt;&gt; Right here, dude.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:21.070
&gt;&gt; How long does it take
you to write a book?

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:22.370
&gt;&gt; How long does it
take me to write a book?

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.520
This one took me about six months.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.280
Usually it takes me
about six months.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.580
&gt;&gt; It's pretty thick.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I write two books a year usually.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:37.760
&gt;&gt; How long did it take
you to write your book?

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.510
&gt;&gt; One month.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.180
[ Laughter ]

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.480
&gt;&gt; Revised answer.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:50.440
&gt;&gt; It's still six months yeah,
dude, other dude right there.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.690
&gt;&gt; Out of all the books
that you have written,

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.310
which one is your favorite?

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:59.720
&gt;&gt; My favorite is always the last
one that I've written successfully

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.400
so I'm very fond of the Gone series

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.300
because that basically pays the
bills but I'm happy with this one.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.440
I'm glad I pulled it off,
I'm glad I didn't screw it

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.200
up because I've written 150
books and I've got to tell you,

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.710
you would think by
now that when I sit

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.250
down to write a book I'd be
like, all Mr. Confidence,

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.970
I know what I'm doing and
that's so not the case.

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.300
I start every single time and
sit there and I'm a few pages in

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.270
and I go, everybody is going
to realize what a fake I am,

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.080
everybody is going to realize
I don't have any talent,

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.380
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.540
This obviously makes no sense,
no part of this is good.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.260
And then at some point in there,
I'll flip to the other side and go,

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.350
my God, I'm a genius,
look at this [laughter].

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:40.650
This is amazing.

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.950
And then I finally send it off to
my editor and as soon as I hit send

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:48.260
on the email I'm like, oh God, it's
a piece of crap, it's terrible.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.540
It's the same cycle
each time dude you know.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:51.840
That's the way it is.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.410
Okay, we've got to go to-

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.720
&gt;&gt; Miss Kristen, why do
you think that you stuck

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.810
to astronaut since you were little?

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.110
&gt;&gt; Can you say that again?

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.410
Sorry.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:04.710
&gt;&gt; Why do you think you stuck

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.190
to being an astronaut
since you were little?

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:11.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Um, I got lucky in that I
happened to know what I wanted to do

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:14.600
and along the way I didn't
find anything that I wanted

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:19.410
to do more I guess, so I know a
lot of friends who fly with me know

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.610 position:56%
who didn't start out wanting to fly.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:25.050
They just followed a path
and they end up there.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:31.370
I will say that I'll never
be an astronaut at this point

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:35.600
but it definitely got me
to where I needed to be

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.880
and at this point I really think
that the military for me is kind

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.230
of a calling and I love everything

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:45.640 position:56%
about it except maybe really bad
nights in the weather trying to land

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.260
on a moving ship but
that's a different story.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.840 position:56%
I think somebody, I was just reading
a blog from a current astronaut

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.050
and he said you know, I have
a bunch of friends who set

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:00.500
out to be an astronaut and that's
all they cared about the entire way

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.380
and they were so focused on that
they forgot to enjoy the journey

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:09.680 position:56%
and forgot to do what they wanted to
do along the way so I definitely say

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:14.250
that for all you guys as you
go through school and college

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:16.660
and start getting jobs,
do what you want to do.

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.690
Have a goal but don't make
that be only focus in your life

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:24.780
so for me right now, flying
jets has been awesome.

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.570
I haven't found anything I want to
do more yet so I'm going to stick

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:32.820 position:56%
with it for a little while until
they fire me so I think looking back

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:36.640
on it, the journey has definitely
been the best part of that

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.670
and wanting to be an
astronaut got me to that point

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.900
so I'm thankful it's
something that I did stick

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.110
with because it got me
to where I am today.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:45.990
Does that answer your question?

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:47.440
Cool.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.340
&gt;&gt; It's a great message,
enjoy the journey.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.150
&gt;&gt; What was your favorite
part of writing the book?

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:59.610
&gt;&gt; My favorite part?

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:02.460
Well, I actually kind of
got to I like the research

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.020
so I've been really straining
to try to make this as accurate

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:11.310
as possible even though I'm
obviously not a historian

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:13.610
or a high school graduate.

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:14.910
&gt;&gt; You are.

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.210
&gt;&gt; I know.

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:17.510
&gt;&gt; Now you are.

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:18.810
&gt;&gt; Well now I am, that's
right, you're right.

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:21.820
The research part was actually
kind of fun and fun in strange sort

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.540
of ways like for example, I
wanted to be super accurate

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.860
so when I was talking about the
girls were learning how to fire,

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.540
well the girls and the guys were
all learning how to fire the M1

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.460
and windage and elevation,
so that part I was able

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:40.890
to find the original video online
that the Army produced in 1942,

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:43.610
and so I just lifted big
sections of dialogue straight

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:48.010
across because I was
determined to be accurate.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:51.490
But also, you get to do
weird, cool stuff like I drove

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:56.100
around Sicily just looking at
stuff going okay, if I was walking

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.160
if I wasn't in this car, how
much harder would that be?

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.460
What's the slope like?

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.290
What can I see from here,
what can I see from there?

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:03.780
That's all kind of neat.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.590
I went down to Las Vegas
where they allow you

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:10.410
to fire all the weapons well,
not all the weapons obviously,

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:16.210
the handguns and the
infantry weapons M1, 45, BAR,

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:20.700
and got to fire all those just
because I wanted to be accurate

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:25.260
about how they feel, how
they sound, the little stuff

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:28.230
like is there muzzle flash at the
end of a Thompson sub-machine gun?

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:31.710
Yes, that kind of stuff so
that kind of stuff was all fun.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.010
I enjoyed that.

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:35.040
&gt;&gt; If you live through the
characters then it's kind

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.000
of interesting that you wrote
about women because you're a man.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.300
&gt;&gt; I am, yeah.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:45.720
&gt;&gt; So finding that voice I
mean, it has to be unusual

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.450
to see a woman's perspective
I think.

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:52.320
&gt;&gt; No and I'll tell you why and
I don't want to get too heavy

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.610
or serious about this but we have
this assumption that we're dealing

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.320
with people as a class
of people, as a group

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.860 position:56%
but if you're writing character,
you're writing a specific individual

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:05.500
so it's like saying the
body of women are X. Well,

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.860
that says absolutely nothing
about one individual woman.

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:13.610
If the body of men are such
and such, the entire population

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:16.160
of Black people, the entire
population of Latino's,

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.730
you can't extrapolate from
that and conclude anything

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.820
about a single individual.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:24.210
You can however, you
write about the individual

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:25.690 position:56%
but I've also got a lot of practice.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:29.410
My wife is an author, Katherine
Applegate, The One and Only Ivan,

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:35.960 position:56%
we wrote a lot of books together and
as I work with her on many, many,

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:41.410
many books like, literally 100,
I've to this day written more books

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.110
as a woman than I have as a man.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:44.410
&gt;&gt; Have you really?

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:45.710
&gt;&gt; In fact, I'm the guy who-

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:47.010
&gt;&gt; That's interesting.

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:48.310
&gt;&gt; When Jessica and
Elizabeth Wakefield

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:50.340
in Sweet Valley Twins got
their first period [laughter]-

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.170
&gt;&gt; Oh my God.

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:57.160
&gt;&gt; Probably some of the kids don't
know what that means [laughter].

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.510
&gt;&gt; You see how young
they are, right?

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.050
[ Laughter ]

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:05.350
&gt;&gt; It's a form of punctuation.

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:07.100
&gt;&gt; Yes, perfect.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:11.670
&gt;&gt; The British say full stop.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.800
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think we're
going to take one question.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:19.210
I think Sasha, you had somebody
standing in line with you?

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.920
One final question.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.780
&gt;&gt; How many books have
you written in total?

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.650
&gt;&gt; Well we think it's about 150.

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:30.740
It's hard to count them all because
some of them we were ghost writing

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:35.260
for somebody else, some of the
ones we created were ghost written

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.600
for us, sometimes we've
had series that we started

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.980
that were then perpetuated
by other writers but in terms

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.500
of what we actually sat down
and did this with, typed with,

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.570
we think it's about
150 give or take.

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:51.660
&gt;&gt; Do you know what he
means by ghost written?

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, ghost written is
when you do all the work

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.470
but the other person gets
the credit [laughter].

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:59.840
By the way, this is a
concept totally unknown

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.170
in the military I'm sure.

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.200
[ Laughter ]

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah we call it every day.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:10.020
&gt;&gt; No you do, that's like
there's an author of record

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.120
who supposedly writes the books
but then they're actually written

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.000
by somebody else and we were
the somebody else in many cases

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.670
for a while, my wife and I.

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:23.090
&gt;&gt; I hate to interrupt
this amazing conversation

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:28.390 position:56%
but we have more things coming so I
first want to thank our participants

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:34.510
on the stage, Kristen,
Rebecca, Michael and Dr. Biden.

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:38.200
[ Applause ]

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.310
&gt;&gt; And David Mao and
John Cole as well.

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.870
Thank you very much.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:47.520
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
