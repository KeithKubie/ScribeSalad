00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.400
[inaudible]

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.970
<v 1>like a boss.
Let's get back to what went down this fucking week.
Damn God.</v>

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.480
Damn.
Mother fuckers,

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.440
Alabama Crimson tide one yet another fucking championship.

5
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.110
Oh God dammit.
Georgia had a bad,

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.940
I'm on the fucking ropes and then the second half came along.
And what happened?

7
00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:31.090
Georgia goes right out there and blocks a punt.

8
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.643
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

9
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.620
<v 1>I don't know.
Can somebody tell me how that guy was offsite?</v>

10
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.220
Can somebody tell me why a bigger deal was not made other than on the mad dog

11
00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:58.874
show?

12
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.020
They blew too brutal fucking calls when Alabama was making a great comeback.

13
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:06.044
Okay,

14
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.130
great coaching decision by Nick Saban to put that freshman kid in a quarterback

15
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:17.570
and to stick with them.
And how about the,
uh,

16
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.540
the start and not being a cunt about it?
That was all great.

17
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.290
And then they had that running back that came in and they started using in many

18
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:27.740
ways in the second half,
Alabama didn't,
he was just killing Georgia.
However,

19
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:32.270
I don't,
I don't use that fucking guy was not offsides.
They blocked the punt.

20
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.600
You looking at at least three points on that drive.

21
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:37.100
Granted people can missed field goals.

22
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.310
God knows Alabama knows about that come the end of the game.

23
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.930
Then they miss the face masks call and they call a ticky tack pass interference

24
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.430
on third nine.
Um,

25
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.110
those are the games.
When you're rooting for your team's getting fucked you,

26
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:56.750
you literally sit there going like,
this is literally,
it's just a t.

27
00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:01.730
It's a TV show.
He can't have one team just beat the shit out of the other team.

28
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:05.780
Everybody's going to turn the channel
present real.

29
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.860
That football game was like watching an episode of the Super Friends back in the

30
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.830
day,
right?
Every fucking episode was the exact same with the super friends.

31
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.873
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

32
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.663
<v 3>justice</v>

33
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.840
there are assembled the world's more greatest heroes created from the cosmic

34
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:34.220
legends of the universe.
Superman.
Okay.

35
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.800
<v 1>Something would happen and then all of a sudden it just looked like,
you know,</v>

36
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.580
whatever.
Superman had kryptonite around his neck,

37
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.350
a Batman and Robin would tied together.
And I'd like,
they think like they cared,

38
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:52.010
but you know,
tying that are heading towards a bud saw and all that type of shit.

39
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.990
And then something would happen.

40
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.370
That stupid fucking monkey from the wonder twins would do something

41
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.263
<v 3>face monkey.</v>

42
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.910
<v 1>And the second they played that song,
wait</v>

43
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.430
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

44
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.160
<v 1>and then I remember I would get a sense of relief every time I was watching that</v>

45
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.130
cartoon.
I'm like,
Oh fuck,
is this the episode Superman dies?
I mean,
I was young,

46
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.430
I didn't know any better.
And the second they would start playing that song,

47
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:24.590
I knew that they will.
They were gonna make that comeback.

48
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.810
That's what the Alabama fucking band should've been playing when they,

49
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.540
when Alabama came running out in the fucking second half.

50
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.760
Oh,
maybe when they called off sides in that block,
pun.
Um,

51
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.500
you gotta give it up to Alabama,
even though I'm kind of being a cunt,

52
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.730
bringing those things up.
But Hey,
I mean,
that did happen.
That was bullshit.

53
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.750
The guy didn't even fucking move.
I Dunno.
Maybe.

54
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:52.890
Maybe the referee had a better angle.
I Dunno.
I don't want,

55
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.080
I don't get how you miss a face mask when it was done to the guy carrying the

56
00:03:57.081 --> 00:03:59.750
football.
I mean the whole fucking stadiums looking at the guy,

57
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.690
his head turns around.
Ah,
say it.
We didn't see it.

58
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.660
Um,
here's what I want to know.

59
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:11.050
Who's more hateable bill Bellacheck or a Nick Saban.

60
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.150
And secondly,
why do you hate them?
Like everyone says,

61
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.700
Nick Saban is the devil.
Why is he the devil?

62
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:22.900
Because he's so good at what he does.
You know,

63
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.010
stupid thing.
I Dunno.

64
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.270
I think the media fucking hates bill Belicheck cause he makes that job so

65
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:32.670
fucking difficult because he knows that if he opens his mouth,

66
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:36.420
the media is going to make his job more difficult by exaggerating anything that

67
00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:40.410
he said given the other team.
Bolton board material.
MMM.

68
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.510
Masterful.
The way he handles the press,
he gives them nothing.

69
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.870
He looks at them and he's like,
you people are not my fucking friends.

70
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.590
I am required by the NFL to stand here and answer your questions,

71
00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:55.550
but I am not required to give you anything more than two fucking syllables per

72
00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:56.384
question.

73
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.960
<v 4>All right,
coach,</v>

74
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.370
do you think the fans have a right to know about what happened to them with jam

75
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.480
or on Sunday?
I've already covered this.

76
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.540
<v 5>[inaudible] to build something like that.
You can stick.
Okay,</v>

77
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.870
but somebody's situation,
we don't try and find out if I've already covered it.

78
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.730
One specific to Chandler,
how much will,
what happened affect your usage?

79
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:20.820
You know the way you use them in the game against the chiefs.

80
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.110
What happened on Sunday?

81
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.090
<v 4>Well,
we'll find out on Saturday.
I get to Xerox,
actually cover it again,</v>

82
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.870
planning,
send it over to Kansas City if you'd go,

83
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.970
I mean it might be easier for all of us.

84
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.620
<v 1>All right.
I love it.</v>

85
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.410
I wish more coaches would do that.
More players would do that.
You know,

86
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.530
Shaq used to do it.
You ever Seen Shaq?
Like when I,
when he,

87
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.610
what he's doing like on TBS or whatever,
t and t,
whoever does the fucking NBA,

88
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.860
just total sky,
affable brick area stair.
I right.

89
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.030
Nobody would do like a,
he's talking joking around animated and all that,

90
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:02.861
but what he used to do those,

91
00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:06.220
those interviews at the end of the game he just be like,
cool beer,

92
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.770
get rid of the ball.
Prejudicial.

93
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.450
He just went into like worker era or whatever you see on any other show.

94
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.410
It seems like a completely different guy.

95
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.780
That's what you learn after you get burned by those fucking nonathletic fat fuck

96
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.940
cops that are in the sports media.

97
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.210
<v 2>I know you were frustrated at how the fishing officiating went down the stretch</v>

98
00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:32.150
there,
but you guys pulled it out.
It was a big

99
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.530
[inaudible] shack where I live.
I know.

100
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.190
<v 1>Or maybe I just love when Alabama loses,</v>

101
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.280
like my favorite part of that game was fucking Nick Saban's face at halftime.

102
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.540
He had to do that fucking
what did he had to do that interview,

103
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.370
that stupid fucking interview.
Why they stopped those poor bastards,

104
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.340
the most important game of their goddamn career and they got to sit there and

105
00:07:06.341 --> 00:07:10.360
talk to fucking Susie sweet shoes as they before they go with it.

106
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.760
<v 2>There are banks are running hard quarterbacks.</v>

107
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.780
Make some really good decisions allowed you to get out to a 13 of a lead going

108
00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:17.614
into the locker room.

109
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.520
<v 1>I also think Georgia's front forward and credible like that interception that</v>

110
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:26.190
kid had.
I mean usually defensive Lineman,

111
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.280
uh,
I dunno,
they're just not quick enough.

112
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.350
Ricocheted off the how many found it in the air and then caught it,
um,

113
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.600
in that close to the quarterback.
That usually does not happen.
And uh,

114
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.450
yeah,

115
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.980
they amazing front for and George's quarterback to the freshmen obviously kind

116
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.930
of sucks that they ended up losing the game.
I feel.

117
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:48.960
I actually will tell you this,

118
00:07:48.961 --> 00:07:52.170
I felt bad for Nick Saban when that kid missed that field goal.

119
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.663
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

120
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.620
<v 1>it's funny,
for some reason I didn't feel bad for the kid.</v>

121
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.740
I felt bad for nick say,
but

122
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.990
I forget what he did.
He just threw his fucking arms up.
Like,

123
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.520
what do I have to do?

124
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.510
How big a genius do I have to fucking be to fuck it.

125
00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:41.980
Help you sons of bitches across the God damn gold line so he can win this thing

126
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:46.860
and go,
go home.
I want.
What more do I have to do?
Yeah.

127
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.780
I would love to interview coaches and be like,

128
00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:52.770
what goes through your fucking brain?
All right.

129
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.670
Like an offensive coordinator,
whatever you call all the right place,

130
00:08:56.671 --> 00:09:01.110
you play in fucking
high stakes chess,

131
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.910
where you literally,
your house,

132
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:08.130
your family standard of living is on the line because if you suck,

133
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.920
you're going to get fired.
And then w then way you're gonna go,

134
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.870
you're gonna have to fucking sell your house.
You Ain't know the deal pill.

135
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.370
We know that deal.
And you call all the right play.

136
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.900
60 minutes of playing chess on television where every fucking Douche in the

137
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:26.220
world like myself is going to second guess you who has never even coached the

138
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:30.270
game at a pop Warner level.
You get all the way down there.

139
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.160
It's a fucking chip shot.

140
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.240
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

141
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.080
<v 1>And this soccer style con goes in there and fucking Mrs said like,
just what?</v>

142
00:09:39.081 --> 00:09:43.570
Like how do you sleep that night?
I,
I can't,

143
00:09:43.571 --> 00:09:44.990
I can't imagine.
You know what I mean?

144
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.740
Everybody talks about the field goal kickers when they miss it and what they

145
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:52.640
have to deal with.
You know,
it's,
it's very simple.
Okay.

146
00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:55.640
Nobody knows what a field goal kicker looks like.
You move out of this state,

147
00:09:55.641 --> 00:10:00.500
you start selling cars,
you begin a new life,
egg,
noodles and ketchup somewhere,

148
00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:01.334
right?

149
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.980
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

150
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.130
<v 1>I can't imagine the coach.
So you got it.
How do you go to sleep at night?</v>

151
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:11.230
You know,
and you know,
your wife doesn't understand.
College is just a game.

152
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.250
Come back to bed.
I don't understand what is wrong with you.

153
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.650
You're scaring the children,
Michael.

154
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.133
<v 0>Okay</v>

155
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.690
<v 1>guys.
Just I would,
you know what I would do?</v>

156
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:29.691
I would just be standing up in my living room drinking with my headset still on

157
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:34.780
staring at the fucking wall.
Okay.
Kids,

158
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.620
we're going to go to bed early tonight.
Your father's had a tough day.

159
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.640
I Dunno.
That's what I see when I,
when Nick Saban's losing,

160
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.880
when I look at that guy's fucking face,
it's just like,
I would not,

161
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.880
it's just not a guy you'd want.
You would want to piss off.
Um,

162
00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:57.010
I love those guys that are going bald and they still dye their hair and they

163
00:10:57.011 --> 00:11:00.100
still keep it like long.
I don't know.
What is Nick Saban Doin?

164
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.700
Please got cotton candy on top of his head.
Um,

165
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.510
anyways,
let's plow ahead.
By the way,
Nhl fans,
did you happen to catch?

166
00:11:10.511 --> 00:11:15.430
Did you happen to see the fucking best game of the year?

167
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.980
<v 3>They look great on the Justice League.</v>

168
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.520
There are assembled the world's greatest heroes from the cosmic legends of the

169
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:39.814
universe.

170
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:40.980
<v 0>Superman.</v>
