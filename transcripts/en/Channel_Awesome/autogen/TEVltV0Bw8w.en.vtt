it's the fact there's so many other
 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.240
it's the fact there's so many other
films that have used these cliches and

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250
films that have used these cliches and
 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.000

uh there's a bit in the middle where
 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.500
uh there's a bit in the middle where
there's like a talent contest and he

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510
there's like a talent contest and he
 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.050

goes up to perform and it just seemed

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060
goes up to perform and it just seemed
 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.850
goes up to perform and it just seemed
like an excuse to throw in another song

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860
like an excuse to throw in another song
 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.300

and it's not even like I don't know but

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310
and it's not even like I don't know but
 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.950
and it's not even like I don't know but
for me it wasn't as good as like the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960
for me it wasn't as good as like the
 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.080
for me it wasn't as good as like the
other songs in the movie so and when the

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090
other songs in the movie so and when the
 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.820
other songs in the movie so and when the
scene wraps up and then you see they're

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830
scene wraps up and then you see they're
 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.620
scene wraps up and then you see they're
trying to get to where they're trying to

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630
trying to get to where they're trying to
 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.420

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210
um I think that you know this might be
 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.510
um I think that you know this might be
the only time ever where I've actually

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520
the only time ever where I've actually
 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.760
the only time ever where I've actually
said you know you can't killed off the
