00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 align:start position:0%
does that makes sense
 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.330 align:start position:0%

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 align:start position:0%
so so these are hypotheses how do we
 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.580 align:start position:0%
so so these are hypotheses how do we

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 align:start position:0%
validate them so this is where we run
 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.050 align:start position:0%
validate them so this is where we run

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
could start with any of them sort of
 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.779 align:start position:0%
could start with any of them sort of

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:49.949 align:start position:0%
first so for example if you wanted to
 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:51.830 align:start position:0%
first so for example if you wanted to
validate<00:06:50.100><c> whether</c><00:06:50.580><c> anybody</c><00:06:51.030><c> would</c><00:06:51.479><c> leave</c><00:06:51.810><c> a</c>

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
is a fake door so if your want to
 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
is a fake door so if your want to

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
interaction with that feature and then
 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.620 align:start position:0%
interaction with that feature and then
you<00:07:05.190><c> record</c><00:07:05.490><c> whether</c><00:07:05.729><c> anybody</c><00:07:06.210><c> interacts</c>

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 align:start position:0%
you record whether anybody interacts

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
validate now what if people actually
 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
validate now what if people actually
start<00:07:38.820><c> leaving</c><00:07:39.090><c> comments</c><00:07:39.300><c> like</c><00:07:39.449><c> they</c>
