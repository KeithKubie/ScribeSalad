00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.819
Venture for America is a nonprofit fellowship
program for college graduates who want to

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.730
learn how to build businesses and create opportunities,
become entrepreneurs really.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.839
What we do is we recruit top grads.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.450
We bring them to a training camp for five
weeks at Brown University, my alma mater.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.830
We bring in entrepreneurs, investors, venture
capitalists, McKenzie, IDO to help train them

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.840
in what it takes to build a company.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.109
And then they work in startup companies in
Detroit, New Orleans, Providence, Cincinnati

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.210
and eight other U.S. cities for two years.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.840
And at the end of those two years they’ll
have a sense of how these businesses grow

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.840
and develop.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.210
They’ll be working with a more experienced
entrepreneur during that time.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.790
At the end of the two years they can either
stay at that company as a manager and leader

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.090
or they can even start their own companies.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.730
And we have a set of angel investors and a
seed fund to invest in them.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.780
So you can think of it as a two year extended
entrepreneur apprenticeship program that has

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.920
the immediate effect of helping companies
expand and hire more people and hopefully

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.340
create more jobs.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.280
Our immediate goal as an organization is to
help create 100,000 new U.S. jobs by 2025

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.869
by helping these companies grow and also training
the next generation of entrepreneurs.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.530
So there are six default paths for young smart
people in the U.S. today – financial services,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.270
management/consulting, law school, medical
school, graduate school/academia and Teach

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.270
for America.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.620
So these are six things and these six things
will comprise between 50 and 70 percent of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.109
university graduates from any national university
in the U.S. I mean they really add up very

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:30.109
quickly.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.310
They also tend to concentrate our talent in
one of six geographies – New York City,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.640
San Francisco/Silicon Valley, Washington D.C.,
Boston, Chicago and L.A.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.530
So in essence we have a system that’s driving
our most talented graduates to one of six

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.390
activities in one of six places.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.689
And over the long term this is not a great
thing for the economy, especially if you consider

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.049
that so many of these graduates are heading
to professional services contexts that exist

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.509
to serve essentially large companies that
after they get big enough to a point where

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.859
they can hire an investment banker, consulting
firm or a law firm.

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:07.439
So the metaphor I use is that it’s like
we’re investing in tons of layers of icing

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.360
and forgetting to bake the cake.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.830
What we need to do is we need to send more
talent to early stage businesses that can

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.110
grow and prosper, expand, hire people, maybe
even create hundreds of new jobs.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.120
And then if they become mature then they can
hire professional services firms to help them

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.300
expand in various ways.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.720
But the first order of business is helping
the firms come into being and to grow.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.990
36 percent of this year’s Venture for America
class was comprised of women.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.830
And we think that’s a good start but not
nearly where it needs to be.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.800
We need to get it up to 51 percent to mirror
the population and also the college graduate

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800
ratio obviously.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.020
You know, I think people respond very powerfully
to role models.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.110
Like they see examples, they want to see someone
who’s like them.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.920
And so there are some fellows that are women
that come to us and say hey, I’d prefer

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.650
a female led company.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.490
And so when we go out to the startup landscape
in these cities and you look around, I mean

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.790
the proportion of companies that right now
– not even in tech but just, you know, in

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.860
startups and growth companies in these cities
– unfortunately it’s certainly well below

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.530
51 percent at least of the companies that
we see and interact with.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.720
And so, you know, we see there’s a lot of
work to do at every level.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.750
But we think a lot of it does begin as women
looking up and saying like hey, who are the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.990
people that are doing this that are like me.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.320
And I think that’s one reason why someone
like Sheryl Sandberg has set such a huge powerful

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.780
example because now, you know, women look
up and see that there are leaders in these

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.850
industries that are women that are doing amazing
things.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.350
I think there’s certainly a desire among
this generation to have a positive impact

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.490
to build something new.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.880
And I see this when I interact with college
students around the country that they very

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.040
badly want that sort of option.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.840
But when the rubber hits the road it’s really
about who’s making them a job offer when.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.150
And so if you’re a senior in college and
you’re looking for a job, it’s all about

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.870
who’s extending you a genuine path and who’s
recruiting you, who’s making you feel wanted,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.980
who can you take home to your parents figuratively
speaking and say hey, mom, guess what?

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.220
I’ve got an offer from Deloitte.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.079
Then your parents will be very, very happy.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.889
So those are the variables that really matter.

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.389
Like people talk about the, you know, the
wants and needs of the generation which are

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.830
obviously very important.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.639
But it’s equally important what are the
genuine choices they’re being presented

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.639
with.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.449
And those things are a function of resources.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.800
So what Venture for America does is we try
and provide a genuine path toward startups

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.199
and growth companies in Detroit and New Orleans
and other parts of the country that might

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:48.530
not be top of mind for a recent college graduate
really by extending some of the same resources.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.229
So that if you join VFA you’ll end up with
some of the same network and community and

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.849
training and support that many of these young
people are seeking through other means.
