GARY OLSON: We
study collaboration,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.240
but we also practice it.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.470
And we're going to
talk about today, it

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.950
has involved all these people,
some of whom you may know.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.470
Julie has been an intern
here a couple of times,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.577
and Amy is now family
member at UIUC whatever.

00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:33.660
I'm going to do for the
first little chunk of this

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.820
and then Judy will take over
and do the second chunk of it.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.580
As Dan mentioned, we've
been in this space

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.737
of studying collaboration
for a long time.

00:00:42.737 --> 00:00:44.820
I think the very first
project we were involved in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.100
was in the mid '80s.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.010
So it's now getting
close to 30 years.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.500
We actually built in the late
'80s a program called ShrEdit.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.020
It was a shared editor, which
is actually functionally very

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.310
close to what Google
Docs is today.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.880
We did a whole series
of studies, both of face

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.470
to face meetings and distributed
meetings, using ShrEdit.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.450
So we were into this
space a long time ago.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.840
And it's fun now for us to see
that everybody in the world

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.940
can get access to these kinds
of capabilities, which we have

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.767
developed as a research
tool many years ago.

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:25.600
We published this paper,
"Distance Matters,"

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.610
in year 2000.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.530
In 2008, we published
a book, MIT Press

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.880
on "Scientific Collaboration
on the Internet."

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.870
And we just now, within
the last few weeks,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.410
published a book
with Morgan Claypool,

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.260
called "Working Together Apart."

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.210
And the central theme
in a lot of this work

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.150
is trying to understand
the mix of technology

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.070
and social practices
that go together

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.390
to make collaboration work.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.860
And that's the main
theme of our work.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.410
We've explored over the years
many different technologies,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.640
many different
kinds of situations,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.000
small groups, large
groups and so on.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.450
And I think we've actually
made some progress.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.962
And in fact, this 2014
book is the latest turn

00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:06.420
of the crank on
what we think we've

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.380
learned over this
long period of time.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.510
We have six topics
to talk about today.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.604
We'll talk about some
of them quite briefly.

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:16.270
We've been doing a
study of the roll-out

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.290
of Google Apps on
university campuses.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.550
I'll talk a little
bit about that.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.830
We've done some work on
how people deal with cloud.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.330
Not so well it turns out.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.730
Julia Haynes is doing some
work on studying collaboration

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.950
in seed accelerators.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.180
And then we have a whole
series of microprojects,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.930
where I'll be spending
more time on these,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.115
then on these early ones.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.990
So we've had an opportunity
with our support from Google

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.220
to study how Google
Apps is playing out

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.690
on a series of
university campuses.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.775
So we've done a study on six
campuses, five UC campuses

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:53.150
plus university
of Michigan where

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.330
we have strong connections.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.400
And we've actually done
a variety of things.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.020
The main thing has been an
annual survey of undergraduates

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.270
on these campuses
about their practices

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.810
and using Google Apps.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.420
We've done other things
like survey administrators.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.880
We've looked into the
clubs because they turn out

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.700
to be a vector for adoption
of these technologies.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.880
We've talked to faculty and
graduate students as well.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.970
But I'm going to
focus here mainly

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.830
on the stuff we've done
with undergraduates.

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:27.940
OK let me talk briefly
about the cloud.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.035
There's more than
one cloud obviously.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.030
We are not alone out
there in the cloud.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.280
One of the things we looked
at, we did a study-- primarily

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.770
Amy Voida did this
study-- an interview study

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.770
of faculty and graduate students
about their use of Google

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.980
Apps in research collaborations,
in teaching, and so on.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.910
And one of the themes
that emerged from this

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.000
was how much trouble people
were having with the cloud.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.240
And a whole variety of issues.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.170
And as I say, only point
to, we had a paper at Chi

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.520
this last year.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.500
It has a lot of detail in
it about what we found.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.769
But for example, we found
that the average number

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.440
of email accounts in the
people we interviewed was five.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.240
It ranged all the
way from 1 to 12.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.620
So people are managing a whole
bunch of different identities,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.960
not just for mail account
but for other things; cloud

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.520
services of various
kinds and so on.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.630
And there is confusion.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.020
It's also the case
that things don't

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.360
act the same in the cloud.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.360
So if you're working on Google
Drive with a bunch of documents

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.737
and materials, or you're
working, say, on Drop Box,

00:04:49.737 --> 00:04:50.820
things behave differently.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.760
Things come and go.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.645
Your permissions are
more complicated,

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:55.770
they're not the same in
the different environments,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.269
and so on.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:59.760
So just a lot of
different confusions

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.140
about what is going on, which
is why we talked about this

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.070
has thunder in the cloud.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.287
As I say, the story is
that people are still

00:05:07.287 --> 00:05:08.370
quite confused about this.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.286
I think there's an
interesting follow up study

00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:12.270
to do to see if
people are sorting out

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.860
what's happening with the cloud.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.030
But it's a source of
confusion to a lot of people,

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.010
and you can see a lot of the
empirical details in the Chi

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.510
paper.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.151
OK with that, any
questions about,

00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:28.650
that was very brief
about the cloud.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.159
Any questions?

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.700
It's not surprising that it is
a little confusing for people.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.283
JUDY OLSON: Can you
go back one slide?

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.280
This part is the thing
that confuses me.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.910
So when I work with
different people

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.290
they say, oh I just
put it in Drop Box.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.717
That was the first time
I'd heard about Drop Box,

00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:49.800
was when somebody said
well that's where I put it.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.802
As opposed to talking
about it before and about

00:05:51.802 --> 00:05:53.760
how we're going to manage
all of our documents.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.140
This is several years ago.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.080
But now, I'm looking
for a document

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.700
like the last
presentation here, and I'm

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.390
looking all over
my file structure.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.250
Cannot find it.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.310
What did I call it?

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.700
It should be in
the Google folder.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.080
And it turned out, no
it was in Google Drive.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.340
So it was 20 minutes
lost on that.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.570
So searching over
everything, I'm not sure.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.702
In academics any
way, we collaborate

00:06:18.702 --> 00:06:21.160
with a lot of people and they
have lots of different habits

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.340
and so I have to think
about how we doing this one.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.040
I want to touch
briefly on some work

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.735
to Julia Haynes is doing
about seed accelerators.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.090
There is a delay.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.930
Here we go.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.450
All right.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.740
Seed accelerators, born
in Silicon Valley, where

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.800
you bring together a
lot of entrepreneurs,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.640
give them by the time to
learn from each other,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.930
present to each other.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.860
It's a big contest and at the
end there are some winners

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.980
and they get venture capital.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.520
So the question
is, how does this

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.240
translate to places
around the world?

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.031
More and more people
are interested in this

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:57.470
because they want to
develop applications

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.150
for their own people,
in their own situation.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.440
So around the world.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.240
Julia's interviewed
a number of people

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.700
in every major geographic region
that has the seed accelerators.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.530
She visited accelerators
in North America, Africa,

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.190
Australia, and Asia.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.240
And then she just came back from
a three months in depth field

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.510
at one accelerator in Singapore
following nine start-ups.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.270
And she's about to go off
to Buernos Aires, Argentina.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.800
These are just photographs from
her particular experiences.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.390
We have only a few
nuggets of what she found.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.660
And I think this is really
interesting that Silicon Valley

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.800
culture does not travel well.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.570
So US values have shared risk,
equity, accepting failure,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.940
openness to differences,
which is the lifeblood of how

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.650
these accelerators
work around here.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.950
Do not translate well
when you go to places,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.530
she noticed in Asia,
where there are

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.970
values a hierarchy
status and collectivism.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.000
And so a lot of mismatch on how
the behavior of the people is

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.130
and how they're coming
out with the ideas.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.150
Here's a good example.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.160
In Korea, being an entrepreneur
is being considered a failure.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.000
Around here it's kudos
for being an entrepreneur.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.420
But since 80% of their
gross domestic product

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.630
comes from 10 conglomerates.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.580
If you don't work for one
of them, you're a failure.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.780
And so the people who
are working in these seed

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.300
accelerators have a very
different cultural view

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.000
about what they're doing.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.500
So this is all work in progress.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.049
She'll probably
finish in a year.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.250
And we can report back
on what she's finding.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.200
There's a lot of stuff
happening about what's

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.640
happening inside Google Docs.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.230
And how do we look at it,
what are the activities, how

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.240
do people really collaborate
at the much more micro level.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.970
We've been doing a
lot of visualization

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.300
of the collaboration
inside Google Docs.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.700
we are using a variation
of history flow, which

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.850
Fernando Villegas and
Martin Wattenberg,

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.560
developed a number of years
ago to look at Wikipedia.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.300
Wikipedia.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.270
So we translate that
into Google Docs.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.150
The time goes this way.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.020
Color is a person.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.010
And this is just the volume
of what they are developing.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.370
So somebody put in the
title of the document.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.610
Somebody put in a chunk.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.780
There's some editing.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.010
A whole bunch more and self
editing, that black here,

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.050
it's actually a darker
orange and various kinds.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.370
It's self editing, editing
somebody else's stuff.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.120
A whole bunch more
added at the beginning.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.340
This chunk maintained.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.840
And then just lot more editing.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.740
So this is one document.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.930
This is another one with
a lot more activity.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.720
And the same number
of people doing stuff

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.580
but you could see how things in
both cases, things are growing.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.370
I'm going to show you some cases
where they don't just grow.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.340
People will cut whole
pieces out of things.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.230
But this is an
instant visualization

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.640
about what went on.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.530
If you're an author of
one of these things,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.930
what would you want to look at?

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:11.360
Who cut my stuff, who's editing,
where has nobody edited?

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.730
Maybe I should go in and
read some of that stuff.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.927
Or for researchers,
just to find out,

00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:17.260
well what's interesting in here?

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.175
Where is the good stuff, what's
the characteristics of things

00:10:20.175 --> 00:10:22.550
that change a lot, and the
characteristics of things that

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.420
don't?

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.700
So I have 97 documents.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.340
What's nice about
this is it's a grid.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.270
It's the same four
or five assignments

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.450
done by lots of different teams.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.670
And so I could say,
is this assignment

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.300
generating a signature way
of working, or at a teams

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.840
develop a signature
way of working.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.370
So is it the document,
or is it the team?

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.240
It'll be a mix, but
it'll be interesting.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.250
We also have some
real world documents,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.330
that people have
developed in Google Docs.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.120
Several big grant proposals.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.810
And Gary's and my book
we wrote in Google Docs,

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.310
until the very end
when it had to be

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.590
translated into other formats.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.470
And that gets interesting
because we do know,

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.752
we know the whole back story
about who wrote who and why.

00:11:06.752 --> 00:11:08.460
GARY OLSON: And who
deleted what and why.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.300
JUDY OLSON: And who
delayed who and why.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.320
In our background now
the famous chapter nine,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.220
which was written, and then
I wrote the second half

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.760
and he deleted the
whole second half.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.210
So we had some
discussion about that.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.160
And then he started
on the second half

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.100
and then I convinced him to
revert, and explained about,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.890
it was a whole story.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.720
But we really know the
back story of that one.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.000
The famous chapter nine.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.570
All right.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.790
So what are we looking for.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.160
So in these
visualizations, I was

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.450
interested in things
like that got cut.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.920
Can you see where it just
goes up instead of down?

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.280
So that's not an addition,
that's a deletion.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.240
So I look inside the
document and it turns out

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.070
the students are having a
conversation in the document.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.240
It says down here, hey
guys just a bullet points

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.970
in each section.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.260
Turn that into paragraphs later.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.330
This is when it's due.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.690
And that gets deleted later.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.240
I hope you guys work on
this tonight and tomorrow.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.840
I'd rather have
this done tonight,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.590
especially since I
can't work after class,

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.900
but you guys might.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.000
So that's text.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.660
It's not a comment,
it's text in there.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.380
And then later of
course, they delete it,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.359
because it has to be all
cleaned up and stuff for me.

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:22.650
The other thing that was
interesting in this particular

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.990
document is, how much heavy
editing there is here.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.060
This part stays pretty stable.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.360
This part has everybody in it,
so I wanted them to go and look

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.730
and what's in there, what
were they discussing,

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.080
is this the business case?

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.630
So pitching their idea
for a particular project.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.640
I think that this
is going to lead

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.070
to high quality, when
everybody's in it.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.220
As opposed to you do part
one, I'll do part two.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.610
Here was a surprise.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.410
And of course, I went right
back to the algorithms saying,

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.910
what's going on
here, is this a bug?

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.820
The answer is no.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.650
They started working
on this document

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.740
and orange guy came in here
and deleted the whole thing.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.690
Said this is a mess.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:11.130
And what he pasted in was a
template for a scope statement.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.370
And then he said,
well not all of this

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.630
is relevant for us, in
fact this whole second half

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.084
we don't need.

00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:19.250
And then they started
fleshing out what was in that.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.920
But he said the structure
of this is a mess,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.330
and so I'm going
to just start over.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.970
So again, we've got some
things, big things cut.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.580
And a great big thing
at the end that was cut.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.660
And this started
giving us ideas about,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.010
well what is the API giving us?

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.180
So if you look in this
particular document,

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.330
this again is a conversation at
the beginning where everybody's

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.360
saying, how do you
use Google Docs?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.750
They're teaching each other.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.250
And then of course,
that's not going

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.890
to be in the final document.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.840
These turn out to be
comments unattributed

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.220
to the location in
which they arose.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.054
So that's what the API gives
us, is there's a lot of text.

00:14:01.054 --> 00:14:02.970
And of course, somebody
came and cleaned it up

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.470
before they turned into me.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.190
So we have to work
with the people, who

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.670
if we want to
pursue this, we want

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.380
to work with people about
what can the API give us,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.560
both about the common
structure and then,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.380
as you'll see in a minute,
about simultaneous work.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.960
But this is Facebook
about three days ago.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.770
This is Ben Bederson--
a number of you

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.180
know Ben-- saying
I just finished

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.950
creating my most complicated
spreadsheet ever with Google

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.320
Spreadsheets to support a
collaborative review by six

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.520
people of 30 proposals.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.980
So instead of using
one application that's

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.090
out there like what manuscript
central and stuff like that,

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.680
he did it in Google
Spreadsheets.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.900
It replicates the basic
conference review system

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.640
but without any code.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.800
Is complicated enough.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.510
And so he's showing
a piece of it

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.540
to give us ideas
about what you do,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.620
that's collaborative but
structured by somebody

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.680
at the beginning.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.180
My favorite comment is
from his wife down here.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.240
Alison Druin said
something about geekiness

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.500
that he's going to broadcast
all of this on Facebook.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.930
So we've been looking
at spreadsheets.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.130
Did an interview study,
a short study about,

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.490
who's using spreadsheets
collaboratively and for what.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.350
There's a TV show
production crew.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.490
There's an evaluator
and clinical reporting

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.170
at mental health facility.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.370
Manager billing, senior
contract and grant analysts,

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.685
all of which are using
spreadsheets collaboratively.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.400
So early findings on this.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.550
Knowing who created what in a
spreadsheet is very important.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.020
You want to know to audit or
check things as they change.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.320
It could be of value
it could be a formula.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.160
They brainstorm
about the structure

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.140
and then roles about
who will fill in what.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.740
It's very structured about the
roles and responsibilities.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.140
People asked
permission to change

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.140
things they didn't originate.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.630
And changing
formulas or structure

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.510
is critically more important
than changing values,

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.350
because it's all hidden
and not revealed very well.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.260
There are visualization of
formula structures, like which

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.120
cells are involved,
that already come

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.380
with a number of
spreadsheet applications.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.010
But we'd like to
look at authorship

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.234
and values and things like this.

00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:21.900
A very complicated
problem, because it's

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.930
very multi-dimensional.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.940
We have other things
we've been playing with.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.800
One is just how much activity
is there in a particular cell.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.470
And then some basic statistics
about, who did what when.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:40.680
About adding structure,
adding values, editing.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.670
So who's the major
editor and how

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.640
did this progress over time?

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.930
So this is as far as
we are on spreadsheets.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.570
Ideas welcome about how
to develop this further.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.150
The problem is that it's
a two dimensional thingy.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.300
And I think we're going to
have to use animation in it.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.522
Or decide from the
end users, which

00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:01.480
are the things that are
most important for them

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.039
to find out, and then do
some analysis of that.

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:09.680
That's it on where we are in
visualization of collaboration.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.740
As I say, lots of ideas welcome.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.000
On that they are tough problems.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.569
The second is, we have to
be careful about saying more

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:21.000
is better, because it might
be the small things that make

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.170
something good or the
final structure of being

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.470
in a single voice
and not being abrupt.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:33.460
The next set of studies, we are
embarking on is about quality.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.470
Does the document
have better content.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.920
Does it cohere?

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.400
What could we detect to alert
authors too low quality.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.620
And what social practices
make a good document.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.980
So that's the next chunk
of work that we're doing.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.900
Several of us think
that the heavy editing

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.890
of each other's work suggests
that there may be contentions

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.890
or it may be somebody's cleaning
things up to make it one voice

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.310
or to make it cohere.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.390
So that would be sessions that
we would look at about where,

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.470
are these and what
actually is going on.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.500
We're going to have to do some
quality assessments of what's

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.170
going on, does this
actually make it better.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.440
But we would like to do as
much as we can automatically.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.910
And so we're
working on something

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.660
we called Novox,
which is new voice.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.030
We analyze the text for
style changes in particular.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.600
So the back story here is
that a co editor of a book

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.620
called Ways of Knowing in HCI,
and some people in the room

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.647
are chapter authors.

00:18:34.647 --> 00:18:35.480
GARY OLSON: Authors.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.440
JUDY OLSON: Yes.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.210
There are 19 chapters in
the book and 39 authors.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.620
So there are a lot of
co-authored chapters.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.980
And in some of the early
drafts, I as an editor,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.830
could immediately tell
that the voice changed.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.150
And then there would be a
comment back to the people ,

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.730
make this one voice.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.560
Well I think we can
do better than that.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.940
What is it that I'm picking up?

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.690
What kind of a
linguistic analysis

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.130
can we do to figure out
that the voice has changed,

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.570
and something has to be
made more coherent in style?

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.730
We don't need to do the
kinds of linguistic analysis

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.195
to find out whether
Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:17.230
All I need to know
is something changed.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.650
So that's easier to
do, thank goodness.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.520
So we would like
eventually to if we

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.540
find those abrupt changes, to
be able to alert the author,

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.610
not with a paper clip, but
with some kind of indicator

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.870
that maybe you ought to
think about this to make this

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.830
into one voice.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.090
And eventually maybe even
to suggest, in what way

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.530
the voice has changed.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.350
I noticed a lot of things
about the use of however,

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:47.080
and but, and semicolons,
bullets versus paragraphs,

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.240
the things that are
big changes in there.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.690
We have a program
now that will look

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.430
at known indicators
of style change.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.400
David Guthrie is here at Google.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.700
He has done some of this
seminal work about what

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.700
are the things that are
indicators of style change.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.710
Function words, not the
content, but the function words.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.150
Average sentence length,
syllables per word.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.220
So he writes at a level
that's for graduate students

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.430
and I write for
elementary school kids,

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.740
you're going to be
able to pick that up.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.150
In sentence like and
the kinds of words.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.040
We have a corpus
that we are building.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.270
Some we actually know the
answer who wrote what,

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.180
because we have revision
histories in Google.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.200
So we can be blind
to that and then

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.280
check our algorithms
to see whether we

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.590
got the change in voice.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.400
So we're working
on this right now,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.900
we have an analysis of
paragraph by paragraph

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.440
for about 45
different indicators.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.020
And at the point
of trying to say,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.440
which of the big ones,
what changes over time.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.440
But we're just in the
midst of that one sorry.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.570
OK we have one more, that is
a glimmer in a student eye

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.170
and I'm totally
supporting this one.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.230
I think this is just fun.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.240
May work, may not.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.530
So helping people
communicate across cultures.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.510
So we already know from a lot of
our research on cross culture,

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.290
that people from
different countries,

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:20.270
different habits from in
their local culture, not just

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.466
countries, have different
ways of communicating.

00:21:22.466 --> 00:21:24.090
We've done a lot of
research about what

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.340
do we already out there on this.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.060
We know there's
differences in eye contact,

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.200
whether you're supposed to
look at somebody or not.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.650
Whether that means
attention or deference.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.610
There's big differences in
pause structure for example,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:44.170
in America, we will
wait max two seconds.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.870
So if you end
speaking and if nobody

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.400
says anything in two seconds,
you have the floor again.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.242
And then we're all stepping
over everybody sentences.

00:21:54.242 --> 00:21:55.700
We don't even finish
our sentences,

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.741
somebody else is talking.

00:21:56.741 --> 00:21:59.180
That's the American way.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.760
And it turns out
in other countries,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.920
you're supposed to stop and
value what you just heard.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.620
Think about it before you
then give a comment next.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.790
So it's like a
nine second pause.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.860
Imagine those two people
talking to each other.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.114
One doesn't say anything.

00:22:17.114 --> 00:22:19.530
Right, because he hasn't waited
long enough for me to say,

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.670
this is the time for
me to jump in here.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.220
So one person's
talking all the time.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.900
One person's not talking at all.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.700
And the person who is
talking all the time

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.980
thinks the other guy
has nothing to say.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.490
And the guy who has
quote, nothing to say

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.310
thinks this guy is rude.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.130
And things go badly.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.690
So that's one. [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.970
Also expressing the negative.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:43.300
There's a paper study of
long distance collaboration

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.350
at Google, that we've
been looking at,

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.210
where expressing the negative
is a really hard problems.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:54.330
For example in India, you don't
say you can't do something.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.400
And yet the people
from the US needed

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.640
to know whether
this is beyond what

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.100
their time and resources were.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.570
It turns out the
solution is to say,

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.980
what more resources do you
need in order to get this done,

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.690
as opposed to can
you get this done.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.580
You get a very different
response from that.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.720
But you need to know
these things in order

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.160
to have these
convocations go well.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.420
So the thing is to
find a middle ground.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.520
Later I'll look at that
cartoon it's really cute.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.380
OK in some, that's
what we're doing.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.660
We've got a lot of stuff
going on the macro.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.230
A lot of attention on
the micro about what's

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:33.550
going on inside Google
Docs for collaboration.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.950
Looking for indices of quality.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:39.010
Trying to extend to spreadsheets
and other kinds of documents.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.170
And we need some help.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.900
So if you can
guide us to people,

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.070
who can help us with
API, that's critical.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.600
The other is more ideas about
how to visualize some of this

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.070
and what's important
to you, when

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.360
you use various kinds
of Google applications.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.150
OK.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:58.840
Thank you.
