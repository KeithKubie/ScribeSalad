ANDREW BROGDON:
What's up, everybody?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.535
I'm Andrew Brogdon, and welcome
back to the Mobile Ads Garage.

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:11.660
Today, we're going to cover
some new stuff designed

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.120
to make setting up
AdMob Mediation easier.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.617
And we'll have screencasts
for iOS and Android.

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:18.450
This is actually going
to be a short episode

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.380
since streamlining the mediation
setup process means I have less

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.080
that I need to show you.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.400
Now, we've talked
about mediation before.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.470
In particular, there's
an episode from last year

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.120
that covered what
mediation is and how

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.170
adapters fit into the process.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.689
If you haven't seen
it yet, I highly

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.410
recommend clicking on
that preview next to me.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.110
Because today, we're
going to build on

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.300
that with some new stuff
the team has rolled out

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.430
to make getting mediation
adapters into your apps

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.584
simpler.

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:44.000
I should mention that this
effort is just getting spun up,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.310
so not every network
and format is covered.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.470
But for those that
are, it's pretty great.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.470
And the first reason
why is open source.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.150
We love open source
here at Google.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.316
And we've worked with some
of our mediation partners

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:57.860
to open the source for the
adapters to their SDKs.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.090
And the resulting code
is now hosted at GitHub.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.040
There are two repos, one
for iOS and one for Android.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.790
They contain the
adapters themselves,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.639
along with a sample adapter
project for each platform.

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:11.180
And I'm going to have links to
them at the end of this video.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.560
So that's the first cool part.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.630
The second is Bintray.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.700
So we took that open
source, compiled it,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.614
and put the adapters
up on Bintray,

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:20.780
which means we've been able
to make JCenter packages

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.590
and CocoaPods for them.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.350
So for these adapters,
you no longer

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.420
have to go hunt down a
JAR file or framework,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.640
do a manual download, and
then manually integrate

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.810
into your project.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.270
For these, you can just
add a line to your pod file

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.570
or build.gradle, do a pod
install or gradle sync,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.400
and you've got the adapter.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.090
All right.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.340
So let's hop into Android
Studio so I can show you how

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.870
this works for Android apps.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.370
All right.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.037
So this is just a
simple Android app.

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:46.620
And all the action
we're interested in

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.320
takes place in this file--
the apps build.gradle.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.570
I want to add new
dependencies to this block

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.490
and get mediation
adapters from JCenter

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.750
into my project that way.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.420
And just to be clear, if I
hop over to the project level

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.720
build.gradle--

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.440
there we go-- you'll
see this bit, which

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.380
defines JCenter as a repository
for the entire project.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.229
So it's automatically used
in the apps build.gradle

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.462
as a source for those
gradle artifacts.

00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:14.170
Let's get the Chartboost
Adapter imported

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.044
with a compile statement
in the dependencies block.

00:02:17.044 --> 00:02:18.710
Now this is just for
the adapter itself.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.754
So it doesn't link in
the Chartboost SDK,

00:02:20.754 --> 00:02:23.170
but you do have a version
number on the end that tells you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.480
which version of that
SDK it matches up with.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.271
So it's pretty easy
to stay in sync.

00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:28.770
There we go.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.440
Dual gradle sync.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.520
So that's pretty cool.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.500
Let me go ahead and add
a couple more, though.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.420
Here's the adapter for
unity, for example.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.569
The Unity Ads SDK.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.610
We can just drop that in.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.260
There you go.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.093
It also has a version
number that matches up

00:02:44.093 --> 00:02:45.980
with the Unity Ads SDK.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.650
And here's one for mediating
ads from the Facebook Audience

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.280
Network as well.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.730
So you see you have all these
version numbers on them tied

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.890
to their respective
mediated SDKs,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.139
so you never have to worry about
what's compatible with what.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.680
So now that I'm
done, I have adapters

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.570
for three different
networks in here.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.350
But I still need their SDKs.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.540
Chartboost distributes
theirs as a JAR file,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.170
so I can't just drop
it in the Libs folder.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.090
Unity uses an AAR file, though.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.445
And Facebook's SDK actually has
a gradle artifact of its own,

00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:15.820
which means I can come in here
and add that line as well.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.090
And my application will have
both the FAN SDK and the AdMob

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.280
Adapter that matches it
and be ready to mediate.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.960
There we go.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.130
Audience-network.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.290
As you can see, those
version numbers line up.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.107
There we go.

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:32.690
So this is pretty
much the whole deal.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.910
Rather than chasing
down individual adapters

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.684
from a bunch of
different download sites,

00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:38.600
you can add them straight
to your build.gradle

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.470
and, in some cases, even import
the mediated SDK that way, too.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.486
So it's much simpler.

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:45.190
All right.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.224
That's Android, and
it's not bad, right?

00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:49.390
A few clicks and a little
gradle tweaking and you're

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.820
pretty much in business.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.690
Now, as I mentioned
before, so far

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.850
this is just with a subset
of our partner networks.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.170
But we're working to
add more all the time.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.370
In fact, here's a live stream
of one of our engineers

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.055
hard at work right now.

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:04.965
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:12.157 --> 00:04:12.740
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.020
I love working on a team.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.620
OK.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.286
Next, I'll show you
how to use CocoaPods

00:04:17.286 --> 00:04:21.010
to get one of these adapters
into an iOS project.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.747
So for iOS, this is going
to be all about CocoaPods.

00:04:23.747 --> 00:04:25.330
You can see I'm in
a project directory

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.370
right now with an
existing pod file.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.070
So I'm going to update that
to get some mediation adapters

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.440
and SDKs into my project.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.870
Just open it up in vim.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.120
And you can see the line
for the Mobile Ads SDK.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.902
I'm just going to go in
right underneath that.

00:04:39.902 --> 00:04:42.360
And I'm going to add the pod
declaration for our Chartboost

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.800
Adapter.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.710
Google mobile ads
mediation chartboost.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.860
And now I'm going to save
that and pop back out

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.070
to the Command prompt.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.030
And I'm going to run pod update,
which is going to spit out

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.440
a whole mess of stuff.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.032
So let's talk about this.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.740
First thing, you can
see that the adapter

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.510
pod has been installed.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.010
That's right there.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.650
And the Chartboost SDK has
been installed as well,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.150
with matching versions.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.380
Wherever possible, the adapters
pod spec lists the matching SDK

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.580
as a dependency.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.350
So it should be downloaded
for you automatically.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.490
And just like that, my project
has the adapter, and the SDK

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.020
and is ready to mediate.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.900
Man, that was fun.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.520
Let's add some more.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.200
I can come in here again.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.540
And there we go, vim pod file.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.870
And I can add both the Unity and
the Facebook Audience Network

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.700
Adapters as well.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.760
Just drop them in right below.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.020
There's Unity and
there's Facebook.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.520
Cool.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.790
Let me save that and
do another pod update.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.980
And chug away.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.320
So if I do a quick
LS, you can see

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.210
all those pods are in place.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.490
And if I pull the
workspace open in Xcode,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.399
those pods will
be there as well.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.440
Let's get it up in Xcode.

00:06:04.051 --> 00:06:04.550
Cool.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.200
So that's how this
works for iOS.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.450
All the magic really
happens in that pod file,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.160
bringing in
dependencies for you,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.770
with much less hassle than going
out and finding them by hand.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.780
So that's iOS.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.610
And that's about it
for this episode.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.620
But I do have some
resources for you.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.455
First up are links to
the two GitHub repos

00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:22.580
you saw earlier, the ones
that host our open source

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.430
adapters for Android and iOS.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.264
Next, we've got our
mediation networks page,

00:06:27.264 --> 00:06:29.055
which has instructions
for getting adapters

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.010
for all the networks
we're partnered with,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.940
whether we have the adapters
up on Bintray yet or not.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.330
Next, I've got links
to our mediation guides

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.400
in case you'd like to
learn a little bit more

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.191
about the details of
implementing mediation

00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:41.750
in your apps-- things like
network-specific values

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.152
and so forth.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:45.110
And finally, if you've
got a technical question

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.484
about something
you've seen here,

00:06:46.484 --> 00:06:48.560
you're welcome to bring
it to our support forum.

cover, leave a comment below.
