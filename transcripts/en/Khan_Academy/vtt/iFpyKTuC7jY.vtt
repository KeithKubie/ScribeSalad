00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.700
In the last video we used
the divergence theorem

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.530
to show that the
flux across this

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.510
surface right now, which is
equal to the divergence of f

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.660
along or summed up
throughout the entire region,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.804
it's equal to 0.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.220
And what I want to do in this
video is think a little bit.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.860
When you get an
answer like 0, you

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.110
want to think about why is it?

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.170
This is saying that there's
no net flux across the surface

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.000
right over here.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.260
Or if you sum up all of the
divergences in this volume,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.050
you are getting 0.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.270
So why is that?

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.880
Well, the simple way
to think about it

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.410
is, when we took the divergence
of f, this vector field f

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.790
is hard to visualize,
but the divergence of f

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.620
is fairly easy to visualize.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.140
The divergence is
equal to 2 times x.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.990
So over here you're
going to get,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.710
as you go further and
further in this direction,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.600
as x becomes larger,
your divergence

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.060
becomes more and more positive.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.950
So you have kind of a
divergence of 2 right over here.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.620
You have a divergence
of 1 along that line.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.620
And you have a divergence
of 0 right there.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.780
And that's also true,
obviously, as you go higher.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.238
Because you're just
changing the z.

00:01:00.238 --> 00:01:01.400
You're not changing the x.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.004
So all over here you
have positive divergence.

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:05.670
Over there you have
positive divergence,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.060
and not just along that plane.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.530
But if you go in the
x direction as well,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.250
this whole region of space,
you have positive divergence,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.125
I guess you could say, in the
positive x side of our octant.

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:19.250
But then as you go on that
side, on the other side,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.950
you have negative divergence.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.340
And this diagram is symmetric
with respect to the zy plane.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.850
And so those divergences
cancel them out.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.790
You would have had
a positive flux

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.940
across the surface or a
positive value right over here.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.400
Instead of calculating
it for this region,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.600
we had calculated
for region that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.407
was just between x is 0 and 1.

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:41.990
So let's just think
about that region.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.160
So that region that would have
been cut off right over here.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.020
That would have been cut
off right over there.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.770
And so the back--
I guess you could

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.140
say the back wall of that,
the back wall of this,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.330
would have been the zy plane.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.770
Now if we care
about this volume--

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.670
so we're essentially
eliminating the rest of it.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.310
So let me try to eliminate
it as best as I can,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.039
change the colors.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.800
So if I eliminate that part
of it over there and all

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.260
maybe even what we
see, all of that-- I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.880
should have deleted that first.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.520
So if we eliminate
the back part of it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.420
and we're just dealing
with it when x is positive,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.360
then our entire solution
that we did in the last video

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.560
would have been the
exact same, except now x

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.230
is going to vary between--
instead of negative 1 and 1,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.370
it'll vary between 0 and 1.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.050
And so our bounds
of integration, x

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.130
is going to go between 0 and 1.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.990
And then in that situation,
our final answer-- this part,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.610
this would be between 0 and 1.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.060
That would all be 0.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.980
And we would be left
with 3/2 minus 1/2.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.810
3/2 minus 1/2 is 1 minus 1/6,
which is just going to be 5/6.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.030
And so when you just think
about this part of it--

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.880
this side of it, this one
that I've just drawn-- you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.090
had a positive flux of 5/6.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.560
On the other side you had
a negative flux of 5/6.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.910
And then they canceled out.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.330
One way to interpret
that is, if we thought

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.360
about the entire surface, like
what we saw in the last video,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.896
then you had an aggregate
inward flux in the last video.

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.020
That's why it was negative.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.790
And then it's completely
offset by an outward flux

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.796
right over here, the positive.

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:26.920
You had a negative divergence
in that other region,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.040
and you have a positive
divergence that completely

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.130
offsets it in this
region right over here.
