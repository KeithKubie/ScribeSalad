maybe you can interpret a totally

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:06.139 align:start position:0%
whole thing so I'm assuming this is what
 

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:10.059 align:start position:0%
whole thing so I'm assuming this is what
they<00:08:06.289><c> were</c><00:08:06.349><c> going</c><00:08:06.620><c> for</c><00:08:07.240><c> but</c><00:08:08.709><c> but</c><00:08:09.709><c> I</c><00:08:09.769><c> say</c><00:08:10.039><c> that</c>

00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:10.069 align:start position:0%

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
do not show what he wrote instead they
 

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
do not show what he wrote instead they

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.230 align:start position:0%
visually show it you know that that's
 

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.629 align:start position:0%
visually show it you know that that's
