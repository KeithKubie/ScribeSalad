00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:01.375
- [Instructor] Talk about the main types

00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:03.538
of statistical studies.

00:00:03.538 --> 00:00:05.999
So you can have a sample study

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:08.735
and we've already talked
about this in several videos

00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:12.287
but we'll go over it again in this one.

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:16.454
You can have an observational
study, observational study.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:25.265
Or you can have an experiment, experiment.

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:29.777
So let's go through each of these

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:31.757
and always pause this
video and see if you can

00:00:31.757 --> 00:00:34.061
think about what these words likely mean,

00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:35.675
or you might already know.

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:38.066
Well, sample study, we have looked at.

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.284
This is really where
you're trying to estimate

00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:44.092
the value of a parameter for a population.

00:00:44.092 --> 00:00:45.725
So what's an example of that?

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:48.991
So let's say we take the
population of people in a city,

00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.742
and so that could be hundreds
of thousands of people,

00:00:51.742 --> 00:00:54.413
and the parameter that you care about is

00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:58.580
how much time on average do
they spend on a computer.

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:02.202
So the parameter would be
for the entire population.

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:04.050
If it was possible, you
would go talk to every,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.833
maybe there's a million
people in the city.

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:07.959
You would talk to all
million of those people

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.118
and ask them how much time
they spend on a computer

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:11.387
and you would get the average

00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:13.080
and then that would be the parameter.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.913
So population parameter,
population parameter,

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:23.193
would be average time
on a computer per day,

00:01:24.274 --> 00:01:27.524
average daily time, time on a computer.

00:01:33.883 --> 00:01:35.880
Now you'd determine that it's impractical

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.262
to go talk to everyone, so
you're not going to be able

00:01:38.262 --> 00:01:40.784
to figure out the exact
population parameter,

00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:42.709
average daily time on a computer,

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.812
so instead, you do a sample study.

00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:48.401
You randomly sample, and
there's a lot of thought

00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:52.153
in thinking about whether
your sample is truly random,

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:54.648
so you randomly sample and there's also

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:56.694
different techniques of randomly sampling.

00:01:56.694 --> 00:02:01.474
So you randomly sample
people from your population

00:02:01.474 --> 00:02:05.084
and then you take the average
daily time on a computer

00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:08.346
for your sample, and that
is going to be an estimate

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:11.319
for the population parameter.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.734
So that's your classic sample study.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.323
Now in an observational study,

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:19.823
you're not trying to estimate a parameter.

00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:24.377
You're trying to understand
how two parameters

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:28.072
in a population might
move together or not.

00:02:28.072 --> 00:02:30.994
So let's say that you
have a population now,

00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:34.161
so let's say you have a population of,

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:41.489
let's say you have a
population of 1,000 people.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.486
1,000 people, and you're
curious about whether

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:48.251
average daily time on a computer,

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:52.322
how it relates to people's blood pressure.

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:54.879
So average computer time,

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.378
oh, I shouldn't be writing this way.

00:02:56.378 --> 00:02:57.683
Instead of average computer time,

00:02:57.683 --> 00:02:59.505
it should just be computer time.

00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:03.672
Computer time versus blood
pressure, blood pressure.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.303
So what you do is you apply
a survey to all 1,000 people

00:03:12.303 --> 00:03:14.985
and you ask them how much
time you spend on a computer

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:17.214
and what is your blood pressure?

00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:19.095
Or maybe you measure it in some way,

00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:21.707
and then you plot it
all, you look at the data

00:03:21.707 --> 00:03:25.771
and you see if those two
variables move together.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:27.408
So what does that mean?

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:28.908
Well, let me draw.

00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:37.760
If this axis is, let's
say this is computer time.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.357
Computer time, and this
axis is blood pressure.

00:03:45.473 --> 00:03:46.723
Blood pressure.

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.650
So let's say that there's one person

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.584
who doesn't spend a lot
of time on a computer

00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:55.841
and they have a relatively
low blood pressure.

00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:57.571
There's another person
who spends a lot of time,

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.068
has high blood pressure.

00:03:59.068 --> 00:04:00.818
There could be someone who
doesn't spend much time

00:04:00.818 --> 00:04:03.402
on a computer but has a
reasonably high blood pressure,

00:04:03.402 --> 00:04:07.018
but you keep doing this and
you get all these data points

00:04:07.018 --> 00:04:11.128
for those 1,000 people, and
I'm not going to sit here

00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:15.295
and draw 1,000 points, but
you see something like this,

00:04:16.353 --> 00:04:20.224
and so you see, hey, look, it looks like

00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:21.546
there's definitely some outliers

00:04:21.546 --> 00:04:25.071
but it looks like these two
variables move together.

00:04:25.071 --> 00:04:27.211
It looks like, in general,
the more computer time,

00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:29.157
the higher the blood pressure,

00:04:29.157 --> 00:04:32.110
or the higher the blood
pressure, the more computer time.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.329
And so you can make a conclusion here

00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:36.469
about these two variables correlating,

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.035
that they're positively correlated.

00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:40.491
There is a positive, a
reasonable conclusion

00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:42.555
if you did the study
appropriately would be

00:04:42.555 --> 00:04:44.891
that more computer time correlates

00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:46.573
with higher blood pressure

00:04:46.573 --> 00:04:48.104
or that higher blood pressure correlates

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:49.674
with more computer time.

00:04:49.674 --> 00:04:51.404
Now, when you do these
observational studies

00:04:51.404 --> 00:04:53.227
or when you interpret these
observational studies,

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:55.486
when you read someone
else's, it's very important

00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:58.858
not to say oh, well, this shows me

00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:02.002
that computer time causes blood pressure,

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:04.616
because this is not showing causality,

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:06.427
and you also can't say,
maybe you might say,

00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:09.388
somehow blood pressure causes more people

00:05:09.388 --> 00:05:11.278
to spend time in front of a computer.

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:13.324
That seems even a little bit sillier,

00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:15.422
but they're actually the same

00:05:15.422 --> 00:05:17.724
'cause all you're saying is
that there's a correlation.

00:05:17.724 --> 00:05:19.721
These two variables move together.

00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:22.542
You can't make a
conclusion about causality,

00:05:22.542 --> 00:05:25.061
that computer time causes blood pressure

00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:29.596
or that high blood pressure
causes more computer time.

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.444
Why can't you make that?

00:05:31.444 --> 00:05:35.133
Well, there could be what's
called a confounding variable,

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:38.761
sometimes called a lurking variable,

00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:43.309
where let's say that, so
this is computer time.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.809
Computer time, and this is blood pressure.

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:53.748
Looks like building, so
blood, blood pressure.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.018
And it looks like these
two things move together.

00:05:59.018 --> 00:06:01.264
We saw that right over here in our data,

00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:04.265
but there could be a root variable

00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:06.424
that drives both of these,
a confounding variable,

00:06:06.424 --> 00:06:07.852
and that could just be the amount

00:06:07.852 --> 00:06:09.660
of physical activity someone has.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.823
So there could just be a
lack of physical activity

00:06:11.823 --> 00:06:14.406
driving both, lack of activity.

00:06:16.606 --> 00:06:19.599
People who are less active spend

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.192
more time in front of a computer,

00:06:21.192 --> 00:06:25.359
and people who are less active
have higher blood pressure,

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:28.100
and if you were to control for this,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.644
if you were to take a bunch of people

00:06:29.644 --> 00:06:33.011
who had a similar lack of activity

00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:34.726
or had a similar level of activity,

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:36.587
you might see that computer time

00:06:36.587 --> 00:06:39.698
does not correlate with blood pressure,

00:06:39.698 --> 00:06:42.065
that these are just both
driven by the same thing

00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:43.853
and what you're really
seeing here is like, okay,

00:06:43.853 --> 00:06:48.020
people who aren't active
drives both of these variables.

00:06:51.027 --> 00:06:53.177
So once again, when you do
this observational study

00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:56.475
and if you do it well,
you can draw correlations

00:06:56.475 --> 00:07:01.165
and that might give you decent
hypotheses for causality,

00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:03.436
but this does not show causality

00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:07.408
because you could have
these confounding variables.

00:07:07.408 --> 00:07:10.314
Now, experiments, and experiments are

00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:12.508
the basis of the scientific method.

00:07:12.508 --> 00:07:16.675
Experiments are all about
trying to establish causality,

00:07:18.253 --> 00:07:20.157
and so what you would do is

00:07:20.157 --> 00:07:22.014
if you wanted to do an
experiment, you would take,

00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:23.125
and you probably wouldn't be able

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:24.377
to do it with 1,000 people.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:25.470
Experiments in some ways are

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.347
the hardest to do of all of these.

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:30.997
Maybe you take 100 people, 100 people,

00:07:30.997 --> 00:07:34.747
and to avoid having this
confounding variable

00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:39.486
introduce error into your experiment,

00:07:39.486 --> 00:07:42.536
you randomly assign these
hundred people to two groups.

00:07:42.536 --> 00:07:45.619
So random assign, it's very important

00:07:46.693 --> 00:07:48.110
that they're randomly assigned.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.002
And that's nice, you might not know

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.917
all of the confounding variables there,

00:07:51.917 --> 00:07:55.018
but it makes it likely
that each group will have

00:07:55.018 --> 00:07:57.743
a same amount of people
with lack of activity

00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:01.276
or the activity levels on
average in each of the groups,

00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:03.818
when they're randomly assigned,
it gives you a better chance

00:08:03.818 --> 00:08:06.093
that one group doesn't have
a significantly different

00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:08.052
activity level than the other.

00:08:08.052 --> 00:08:09.725
And then what you do is you have

00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:12.108
a control group and you
have a treatment group.

00:08:12.108 --> 00:08:14.128
Once again, you've randomly assigned them.

00:08:14.128 --> 00:08:16.795
So a control and then treatment.

00:08:19.027 --> 00:08:20.872
And what you might say is, okay,

00:08:20.872 --> 00:08:23.750
for some amount of time, all
of you in the control group

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.917
can only spend max of 30
minutes in front of a computer,

00:08:32.843 --> 00:08:34.620
or maybe if you really
wanted to do it, you'd say

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.675
you have to spend exactly
30 minutes on a computer

00:08:36.675 --> 00:08:38.427
and that's maybe a little unrealistic,

00:08:38.427 --> 00:08:39.787
and then the treatment
group, you have to say,

00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:43.095
you have to spend exactly two
hours in front of a computer,

00:08:43.095 --> 00:08:45.386
and I'm making up these numbers at random,

00:08:45.386 --> 00:08:47.721
and it would be nice to see, okay,

00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:50.612
what as everyone's blood
pressure before the experiment?

00:08:50.612 --> 00:08:52.922
And you'd say, okay, well,
the averages are similar

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:55.024
going into the experiment,

00:08:55.024 --> 00:08:57.866
and then you go some amount of time

00:08:57.866 --> 00:08:59.482
and you measure blood pressure,

00:08:59.482 --> 00:09:01.743
and if you see that, wow, this group

00:09:01.743 --> 00:09:03.755
definitely has a higher blood pressure,

00:09:03.755 --> 00:09:07.373
this group has a higher blood pressure,

00:09:07.373 --> 00:09:10.456
so the blood pressure is higher here,

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:14.208
and once again, some of this might have

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:16.077
just happened randomly, it
might've been the people

00:09:16.077 --> 00:09:18.701
you happened to put in
there, et cetera, et cetera,

00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:21.229
but depending if this was
a large enough experiment

00:09:21.229 --> 00:09:23.600
and you conducted it well,
this says, hey, look,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.695
I'm feeling like there
is a causality here,

00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:30.241
that by making these
people spend more time

00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:31.966
in front of a computer,

00:09:31.966 --> 00:09:35.150
that that actually raised
their blood pressure.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.905
So once again, sample study,

00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:40.407
you're trying to estimate
a population parameter.

00:09:40.407 --> 00:09:43.535
Observation study, you are
seeing if there is a correlation

00:09:43.535 --> 00:09:45.520
between two things and
you have to be careful

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.039
not to say, hey, one is causing the other

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:49.904
'cause you could have
confounding variables.

00:09:49.904 --> 00:09:52.342
Experiment, you're trying to establish

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:56.509
or show causality and you do
that by taking your group,

00:09:58.808 --> 00:10:01.384
randomly assigning to
a control or treatment.

00:10:01.384 --> 00:10:04.248
That should evenly or
hopefully evenly distribute.

00:10:04.248 --> 00:10:06.180
Not always, there's
some chance it doesn't,

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.187
but distribute the confounding variables

00:10:08.187 --> 00:10:11.770
and then on each group,
you change how much

00:10:14.268 --> 00:10:16.173
of one of these variables they get

00:10:16.173 --> 00:10:18.533
and you see if it drives
the other variable.

00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:20.074
So anyway, in the next two videos,

00:10:20.074 --> 00:10:21.830
we'll do some examples of identifying

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.546
these types of sample studies

00:10:23.546 --> 00:10:25.638
and thinking about what
we can conclude from them,

00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:27.786
or these types of statistical studies

00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:30.859
and see what we can conclude from them.
