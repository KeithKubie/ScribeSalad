it'S so smooth and so dense it's it's Just like meat Density i

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:12.309
want to tell you a Really quick little Story When i was about 5 Years old My

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:15.458
Family and i we Lived in france for One year and

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:21.819
My parents and My Sister They all loved to eat Baguettes and ham and

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:24.669
For Some reason at That Age i

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:26.539
Don't know i don't know Why

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:32.018
But some reason i didn't Really like ham back that Now i love Him and so i remember my mom and dad They Would Always

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:37.629
Buy me a pack of Baloney and so This so i ate a lot of Bologna When i was in france

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.739
When i was a Little Kid

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:47.529
This Brings Back Memories This tastes Like It tastes Similar to Bologna That Brings back some some Great Childhood

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.839
Eating Memories

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:01.558
While that tastes Great After That Amount of sausage

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:05.368
At This Market is Really Nice and It Would Be a Great place to come if you want

00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:10.529
To try some They have They have the full selection of Classic German Bavarian Food and it's a Nice Place to relax?

we're gonna Head on we're gonna proceed onwards from Here for the day i

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:22.768

If you take a Big bite it's a Little Bit stringy But then It sort of Dissolves at The same Time

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.120
It has a Natural Sweetness to it do

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.980
Break This bone Off There's Still some Good meat Down there

I had to go for another Classic munich mug

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.349
It is really refreshing something That i've Been wanting to try is this dish Right Here Which is a

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.839
Type of Mixed Salad With onions and i think Normally you eat It with pretzel i think and i

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.079
Think you can Kind of scoop Up some of the some of The Salad

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.099
I'm not Actually sure exactly What it is but i've Just Been seeing a Lot of People Eat

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.650
It and It Looks Good and with some of The Red onions

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.470
or a Lot of The Red onions

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.240
Very Cheesy and then

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:29.959
I think it's a cheese diP mmm Really Really rich it's really Thick and Sticky

00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:38.049
That's a Little Bit of a Oh Yeah it's definitely cheese There's a Little Bit of a Nutty taste as well

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:49.700
The Pretzel Will no longer be complete Without this dip and This he said these are beef Sausages and Be There

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.640
There are these services is really long and Skinny Sausage

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.740
And You Said it's a lower it's a Bit of a Leaner sausage and Got It with Sauerkraut

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.210
It's a Pretty dense sausage and You can Tell That it'S quite low in fat compared to other versions at least

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.369
It'S flavorful it's awesome with that mustard and i love the Sauerkraut

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:30.820
