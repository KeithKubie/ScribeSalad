00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.007
You should start your experiment
by choosing what it is you want to

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:03.600
focus on.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.178
For example, do you want to improve
traffic or the number of sign ups?

00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:10.600
Do you want to increase the number of
people who are actually buying your

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.200
product or service?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.900
Or do you want to increase a sharing
between people on social sites?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.560
Once you choose what
you want to focus on,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.950
you can start coming up with ideas
on what you can do to tweak it and

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.740
actually move that needle, on those
metrics that you're interested in.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.230
I think about things that would
really make a difference.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.320
So Ronnie and
I went to the drawing board for

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.170
a aBARKment,
to come up with a list of ideas.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.060
We decided to focus on increasing
conversions people just visiting our

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.430
site to actually signing
up to use aBARKment.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.980
Some of the ideas we came up with were
changing the text on the landing page

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.180
to explain aBARKment differently.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.950
Changing the color and the size of
the sign up button, trying a different

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.770
messaging in our emails, adding
a video showcasing happy customers.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.220
Highlighting a few positives
reviews on the landing page,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.850
or even designing a whole
new landing page.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.269
Now we need to narrow down our ideas to
three maybe four of the most important

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.588
ones that would make the biggest impact.

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:10.810
We also want to think about which ones
we can actually implement easily and

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.490
what are some quick ones.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.260
For example, designing a whole new
landing page may be harder than just

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
moving the sign up button
to the top of the page.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.540
Next as any scientist would,
you should create a hypothesis and

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.320
measure your base lines you actually
know if you're causing change.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.840
For your hypothesis think about this,
if we do blank,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.490
our blank will grow by blank.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.280
So for aBARKment, if we move the sign
up button to the top of the page,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.440
our conversions will grow by 8%.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.100
Now later on we can try the rest of
our ideas and experiment on those too.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.120
But we should test one thing at a time,
so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.950
we can isolate the specific change and
move the needle that way.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.030
For a baseline, we can look at our
conversions through Google Analytics

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090
before we make the change
to see what they are.
