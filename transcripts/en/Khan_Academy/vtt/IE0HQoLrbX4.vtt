00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:01.861
- [Instructor] Do some more examples

00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:03.723
subtracting decimals.

00:00:03.723 --> 00:00:05.447
So let's say we wanna figure out

00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:07.280
what two minus 1.2 is.

00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:10.646
Pause this video

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:13.506
and see if you can calculate this.

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:16.501
So there is multiple ways to tackle this.

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:18.765
One way is you could say,
"Look, this is the same thing

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:20.182
"as two minus one

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:26.069
"minus 2/10."

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.781
This is two minus one and 2/10.

00:00:28.781 --> 00:00:30.094
So we're subtracting one,

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:33.056
and we're subtracting 2/10.

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:36.290
Now two minus one is pretty
straightforward to compute.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.413
Two minus one is going to be one,

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.601
and then we need to
subtract 2/10 from that.

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.258
So one is the same thing as 10/10.

00:00:44.258 --> 00:00:47.425
We could say this is 10/10.

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:51.243
10, write it this way.

00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:55.446
10/10, and we're gonna subtract 2/10.

00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:56.989
What is that gonna give us?

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.555
Well, that's going to give us,

00:00:58.555 --> 00:00:59.434
if we have 10/10,

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:00.883
and we take away 2/10,

00:01:00.883 --> 00:01:03.675
that's going to give us 8/10.

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:04.763
Lemme write it down here.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:08.096
8/10, which is the same thing

00:01:09.314 --> 00:01:11.564
as 0.8, or 8/10.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:14.875
One way to think about this

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:18.042
is if you're subtracting 0.2 from one,

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:22.274
if you view this one as a 1.0,

00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:29.109
instead of expressing this
as one, one, and 0/10,

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:30.861
we are thinking about this

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.694
as zero ones and 10/10.

00:01:35.968 --> 00:01:37.810
And when you think about it as zero ones

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.430
and 10/10,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.346
well, 10/10 minus 2/10,

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:43.591
it's easier to then think about, well,

00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:45.270
10 of something minus two of something

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.441
is gonna be eight of something.

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.167
It's gonna be 8/10.

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:51.787
Now we can also visualize
this on a number line,

00:01:51.787 --> 00:01:56.288
so for example, let me
draw a number line here,

00:01:56.288 --> 00:01:59.126
and so zero, one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:01.336
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:04.531
That's one, one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:06.463
seven, eight, nine.

00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:07.758
That is two,

00:02:07.758 --> 00:02:09.825
so we're starting at two,

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:13.262
and we're subtracting one and 2/10.

00:02:13.262 --> 00:02:14.521
So one way to think about it is

00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:16.785
we first subtracted one.

00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:18.356
We first subtracted one,

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:21.277
and then we subtracted 2/10,

00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:25.444
and that got us to the point
8/10 on the number line.

00:02:27.704 --> 00:02:29.897
Another way to think about this,

00:02:29.897 --> 00:02:32.203
and the whole point here is
to see multiple strategies

00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:34.447
and for you to think about
what strategy you like the most

00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:36.287
and to realize they all
get you to the same place.

00:02:36.287 --> 00:02:38.586
If you're thinking about
it in a reasonable way,

00:02:38.586 --> 00:02:39.419
is you could use,

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.068
what's the difference between two and 1.2?

00:02:42.068 --> 00:02:45.341
So 1.2 sits here on the number line,

00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:46.948
so what's the difference between two

00:02:46.948 --> 00:02:49.276
and one and 2/10?

00:02:49.276 --> 00:02:50.820
Another way to think about it is

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.713
how many tenths do you have to add

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:56.482
to one and 2/10 to get to two?

00:02:56.482 --> 00:02:58.183
Well, if you've already got 2/10,

00:02:58.183 --> 00:02:59.484
you need to add another 8/10

00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:01.020
to get to the next whole.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.559
So you have to add 8/10,

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.476
or you have to add 0.8.

00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:09.100
So the difference between two and 1.2,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.854
the difference between two and 1.2

00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:13.187
is equal to 0.8.

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:16.597
Let's do a few more examples

00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:19.284
that get a little bit more involved.

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:20.659
So let's say we wanna calculate

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.492
what 3.8 minus 1.5 is.

00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:28.582
Pause the video and see
if you can calculate this.

00:03:28.582 --> 00:03:29.818
Well, just like before,

00:03:29.818 --> 00:03:33.594
we could view this as three minus one,

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:35.946
so we're subtracting the ones

00:03:35.946 --> 00:03:37.613
plus 8/10

00:03:39.464 --> 00:03:41.297
minus 5/10.

00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:50.935
Notice we have three and 8/10

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:52.485
minus one and 5/10,

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:55.677
minus one and minus 5/10.

00:03:55.677 --> 00:03:57.158
And so now we can figure out,

00:03:57.158 --> 00:03:59.414
okay, three minus one,

00:03:59.414 --> 00:04:01.390
that's just going to be equal to two,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.046
and then 8/10 minus 5/10,

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:07.709
well, that is 3/10,

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.216
and so this is going to be two and 3/10,

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:14.383
which of course we could write as 2.3.

00:04:16.377 --> 00:04:17.595
That seemed pretty straightforward.

00:04:17.595 --> 00:04:21.144
Let's do one that's a
little bit more involved.

00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:25.920
Let's say we wanna calculate
four and 5/10 or 4.5,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.003
minus two and 8/10 or 2.8.

00:04:30.786 --> 00:04:34.342
Pause the video and see
if you can calculate this.

00:04:34.342 --> 00:04:36.653
So you might wanna do
the exact same thing.

00:04:36.653 --> 00:04:37.957
You might say, "Okay, well,
this is the same thing.

00:04:37.957 --> 00:04:39.142
"Let's think about the ones."

00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:40.975
This is four minus two

00:04:43.014 --> 00:04:44.681
plus 5/10

00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:51.307
minus 8/10.

00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:55.806
Four and 5/10

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.767
minus two and minus 8/10,

00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:01.758
minus two and 8/10.

00:05:01.758 --> 00:05:03.808
That's exactly what we have up here.

00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:06.889
Then you would say,
"Alright, four minus two,

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.403
"that is two."

00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:11.406
But then you get to 5/10 minus 8/10,

00:05:11.406 --> 00:05:13.473
and there's multiple ways to tackle this,

00:05:13.473 --> 00:05:15.346
but you might say, "Oh,
how do I take away 8/10

00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:17.943
"if I've only got 5/10 here?"

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:19.514
And there's a bunch of strategies

00:05:19.514 --> 00:05:21.058
that you could think about.

00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:22.569
You could say, "Hey, what if I can get

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.206
"some more tenths here?"

00:05:24.206 --> 00:05:26.373
So this is 5/10

00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:30.445
minus 8/10.

00:05:32.275 --> 00:05:33.834
What if I could get some more tenths here?

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.329
The best way I can think of it is like

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:37.329
what if I were to break up these ones

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:39.849
because one is 10/10?

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.599
So I could view a two

00:05:42.736 --> 00:05:44.069
as one plus one,

00:05:45.698 --> 00:05:49.865
or I could view this as one plus 10/10.

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:56.395
So if you view a two as one and 10/10,

00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:58.129
you can then just add those.

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.911
You could then figure out what is 10/10

00:06:00.911 --> 00:06:02.578
plus 5/10

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:07.992
minus 8/10?

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.116
What is that going to be?

00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:17.572
Well, this is a little
bit more straightforward.

00:06:17.572 --> 00:06:21.739
10/10 plus 5/10 is going to be 15/10,

00:06:24.623 --> 00:06:25.751
and if you have 15/10

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:27.597
and you take away eight of them,

00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:30.063
you're going to be left with 7/10.

00:06:30.063 --> 00:06:32.303
So this gets us to

00:06:32.303 --> 00:06:34.386
one plus 7/10,

00:06:36.176 --> 00:06:38.139
so all of this

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.223
when you compute it,

00:06:39.223 --> 00:06:41.093
that is 7/10,

00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:43.653
which I could write as 0.7,

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.850
which is equal to,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.517
so this is equal to one and 7/10.

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:55.389
Now there's other strategies
that you could do here.

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:56.351
One strategy that,

00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:58.854
and this is the one that I
typically do in my head is

00:06:58.854 --> 00:07:00.437
I write this as 4.5

00:07:03.452 --> 00:07:04.285
minus 2.5

00:07:07.825 --> 00:07:08.658
minus 0.3,

00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:11.606
or four and 5/10

00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:13.230
minus two and 5/10

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.742
minus 3/10.

00:07:14.742 --> 00:07:16.792
Now why did I write it this way?

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:20.686
Because I find this pretty
straightforward to compute,

00:07:20.686 --> 00:07:22.022
and then once I get that answer,

00:07:22.022 --> 00:07:23.983
I just have to take away 3/10.

00:07:23.983 --> 00:07:25.423
So for example,

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:27.347
well, if I have 5/10 here,

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:29.123
and I'm taking away 5/10,

00:07:29.123 --> 00:07:30.848
those are gonna knock each other out,

00:07:30.848 --> 00:07:33.841
and so I'm just gonna be
left with four minus two,

00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:35.225
which is gonna be two,

00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:39.691
and then I have to take away the 3/10.

00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:41.320
This is a pretty straightforward way

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.888
of doing it in your head.

00:07:42.888 --> 00:07:45.577
So what's 3/10 less than two?

00:07:45.577 --> 00:07:48.068
Well, you can visualize a
number line in your head.

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:51.841
Well, that's gonna be one and 7/10,

00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:53.841
one and 7/10,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.853
and if this feels strange how I got,

00:07:57.853 --> 00:07:59.196
oh, one, I wrote 7/100,

00:07:59.196 --> 00:08:00.926
one and 7/10.

00:08:00.926 --> 00:08:03.689
And if this seems strange
how I got there that fast,

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:05.262
just think about this.

00:08:05.262 --> 00:08:08.261
This is the same thing as one plus one

00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:10.094
minus 3/10,

00:08:11.727 --> 00:08:13.232
and this one right over here

00:08:13.232 --> 00:08:17.110
is the same thing as 10/10,

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.600
and so 10/10 minus 3/10.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.381
That over there is going to be,

00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:25.277
that is going to be 7/10,

00:08:25.277 --> 00:08:27.558
so it's going to be one and 7/10,

00:08:27.558 --> 00:08:29.142
which is what we got before.

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:30.877
So the whole point here is to appreciate

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:34.054
there's multiple strategies
for subtracting decimals,

00:08:34.054 --> 00:08:36.166
some that you can do a little
bit more automatically,

00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:37.425
but it's really good to think about

00:08:37.425 --> 00:08:38.559
what's going on in your head.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.212
And some strategies are
actually better in your head

00:08:41.212 --> 00:08:42.422
than on paper,

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:44.860
or at least more easy in your head.
