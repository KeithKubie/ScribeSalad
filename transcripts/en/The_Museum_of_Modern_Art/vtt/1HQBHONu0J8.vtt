00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.720
We are on the sixth floor of the Museum of
Modern Art.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.350
My name is Paola Antonelli.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.890
I'm a Senior Curator in the Department of
Architecture and Design here at MoMA.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.390
And together with a quite outstanding curatorial
team – I cannot name all the names right

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.750
now, but you should look them up – I organized
the exhibition "Items: Is Fashion Modern?"

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.620
This is the first fashion show that MoMA has
done in more than 70 years.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.640
That means that the last time MoMA tackled
fashion and garments was in 1944,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.100
when a curator called "Bernard Rudofsky" did
an exhibition called "Are Clothes Modern?"

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.359
And that's where the subtitle of this show
comes from.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.680
"Items" consist of 111 items of clothing or
things that we can wear on our body that had

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.489
a strong impact on the world in the past 100
years.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.559
As curators of design at MoMA, we believe
that it is our task not to tell people what's

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.780
good and what's bad, but rather
help people develop and sharpen their own

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.260
critical tools.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.270
So by coming to this exhibition, people will
have this kind of shock of the familiar.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.270
Right?

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.200
They will see pieces that they own in the
context of a museum exhibition in such like

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.740
an august hall as MoMA.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.870
And that kind of moment of recognition will
spark a new reflection on the things we wear.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.420
And also, ultimately, on the impact that they
have on society, and also on the environment.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.840
There are many museums that do
fashion shows, and they do a great job at

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.440
that.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.720
We didn't want to repeat what they already
do.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.560
We didn't want to do a monographic show about
the mastery of one designer.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.180
We didn't want to talk about one style in
a particular moment.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.799
That's not our expertise.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.070
What we're really good at is design.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.720
So we decided to do a design exhibition about
fashion in which we would focus on every single

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.360
item and really look at the way this item
was born, why it was there, what

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.360
it implies, what the sociological, historical,
technological, and also aesthetic context

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.040
is.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.380
This particular platform gives a sense of
what it means to do a design show with fashion

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.700
as the subject.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.200
You see, it starts with a piece of high fashion.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.150
It's Rei Kawakubo, Comme des Garcons 1997,
a collection called "Body Meets Dress – Dress

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.849
Meets Body," when a journalist from "The New
York Times," Guy Trebay, came to see the exhibition

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.420
and noticed that this piece is next to Vivienne
Westwood's bum bag and to a fanny

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.450
pack from MTV from the 1980s.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.260
He told me that, actually, when he interviewed
Kawakubo in '97 after this collection had

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.560
been released, she told him that she had been
influenced by kids in the street wearing fanny

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.160
packs.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.780
And you'll see in this platform, you move
from this idea to actually, maternity, the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.500
first Snugli that was designed in the early
1970s.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.560
And then a prototype that we commissioned
of a young Chinese designer, Wei

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:09.060
Hung Chen, of a modular maternity dress, and
then examples of maternity clothes from the

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.610
1950s.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.310
You see, this platform is about bodies changing,
bodies not being always perfect but getting

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.220
fat, getting thin, getting pregnant, having
accidents.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.709
Just the idea that fashion has to accommodate
a changing body and not oblige the body to

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.540
adapt itself to it.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.409
These sculptures that you see here,
they're quite gorgeous, they come from the

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.319
previous MoMA show about fashion, the 1944
"Are Clothes Modern?"

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.019
So these beautiful plaster statues that you
see here represent what female bodies should

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.550
have looked like in different moments in history
to match the fashion of that time.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.680
So this crazy centaur shape is from the middle
of the 19th century.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.540
And then you move to the Victorian era, all
the way to the flapper, concave,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.579
breastless shape.

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:09.790
So it's a way to point out how fashion sometimes
does not match reality and human bodies.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.810
This platform puts next to each other the
bikini and the burkini.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.720
One would think that they are polar opposites
but in truth they represent two different

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.440
examples of attempts to legislate women’s
bodies in history.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.590
Not only that, you can find pictures from
the same beaches in south France in which

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.560
in the 1950s police were harassing women for
wearing too little and last year they were

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.890
harassing women on the same beaches for wearing
too much.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:46.260
So it’s fascinating how modesty or the sense
of what is decent and indecent is legislated

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.950
in different ways in different moments in
history and different locations.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.040
The exhibition will also address the idea
of luxury.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.230
You know, what luxury means to us today, the
power of brands, the idea of scarcity whether

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.410
real or provoked by a marketing campaign.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.850
And for instance, you see here the Birkin
bag.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.220
This is the one that really belonged to Jane
Birkin, and it's beaten up and it had stickers on.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.100
It's like so different from what you would
think an "it" bag to be.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.740
Usually, it's kept pristinely and perfectly.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.960
We also have a great, great
New York-born and bred example in the work

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.060
of Dapper Dan.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.260
In the 1980s, he had a great boutique in Harlem
and he made his own clothes.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.940
He was a great tailor and also super-elegant
person.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.960
And he wanted to carry Louis Vuitton and Gucci,
but the companies did not really see eye to

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960
eye, or were not interested.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.960
Who knows?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.600
So he decided to make his own.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.880
And with that silk screen over there, he was
creating jackets that were absolutely his

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.500
own tailoring and his own design that had,
that carried also those logos.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.870
People have no idea of what an excitement
it is to work on an exhibition.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.660
I like to say that when you're
a curator, you're a little bit like a director

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.430
and a producer of a movie, and MoMA is the
studios.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.470
But you get to work with an amazing crew of
individuals that…

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.400
Well, of course, the curators, but then there's
the registrar that takes care of every single

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.970
item that comes into the exhibition.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.840
There's the art handlers that set everything
up.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.270
For this exhibition, we had an incredible
master dresser, Tae Smith, with her crew.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.680
And also, there's the Audio Visuals people.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.060
And sometimes they are responsible for the
real success of certain installations,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.060
for instance, the tattoos here.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:38.540
So for this installation, the team and I wanted
to render the fact that tattoos have been

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.460
forever in history and very much part of many
cultures.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.670
But lately, they have become also a fashion
for people that do not necessarily belong

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:52.710
to cultures that have tattoos as tradition
but want to kind of represent their own personality

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.710
in different ways.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.580
So in order to do so, we wanted to show different
tattoos.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.860
And what our Audio Visuals crew
did is they took pictures of tattoos on bodies,

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.840
and then they remapped them onto mannequins.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.280
Which by the way, are real people, not the
usual Size 0's.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.530
This is a special order, Size 10, so a real
woman.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.660
They remapped them so that they also can follow
the curves of the body.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:25.120
It's a very complex and fascinating work that
is completely rendered effortless when you

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.500
watch it, but in truth is a marvel
to reckon with.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:35.120
And we're getting now to a section that we
call the "Power Section."

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.860
Actually, it is a section in which we try
to discuss the idea of power.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:45.140
There's the Savile Row suit that we start
with, and then there's the unstructured suit

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.850
with Armani in the 1980s and Yamamoto.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.580
One of the masterpieces in the exhibition
is the Zoot Suit that we borrowed from the

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:00.290
museum in Los Angeles, LACMA, the Burton suit,
a Bill Blass, all the way to women's

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:06.720
suits that nonetheless still mimic and adapt
men's hard power for women.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:14.700
So it really is about this staple of power
that has been for many, many decades, the

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.440
suit.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.540
In particular, the Savile Row suit.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.330
But in this day and age, you should not be
sure that the person wearing the Savile Row

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.630
suit in the room is the tallest poppy.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.280
It's not necessarily so.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.730
The tallest poppy, in truth, might
be wearing this t-shirt.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:36.960
That's really what power is today – the
ability to be yourself no matter the circumstances

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.060
and to really project your identity.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.980
And it's also good to be able to end the whole
exhibition with the white t-shirt.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:49.260
In front of the Savile Row suit, of course,
but also by itself, it condenses all the issues

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.150
that we have tried to discuss in this exhibition.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:58.120
It talks about aesthetics, it talks about
ethics, it points back to the raw materials

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.640
that sometimes are gathered with
violence and with injustice, if you think

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.440
of picking cotton.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.730
And it goes on all the way to the end of the
life cycle of garments to the idea of waste

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:15.100
that sometimes Western societies saddle Eastern
and Southern societies with.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:21.960
So it's a whole world, a whole universe of
issues and of possibilities, and of responsibilities

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.270
that people should make as their own when
they decide to wear a particular garment.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.320
If you want to find out more about
the white t-shirt, about the Savile Row suit,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.060
about the designers behind the items and about
the circumstances around them, please go on

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.830
the Coursera platform.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.360
We have produced a whole online course that
is called "Fashion as Design."

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.810
