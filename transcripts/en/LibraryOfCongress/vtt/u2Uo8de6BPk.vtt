00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.390
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Hi,
I'm Anya Creightney,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.400
and this is the Letters About
Literature video series.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.480
Today, we will be talking
about the format of a letter.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.330
Letter writing is one of the
oldest communication systems

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.250
and it is one we
still use regularly.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.350
Today, we're going to be
reviewing the parts of a letter

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.190
and how they can be
formatted depending

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.410
on who the sender
and reader are.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.780
As we know so far, there
are five parts of a letter.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.370
The heading, the
greeting, the body,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.400
The closing, and the signature.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.710
For Letters About
Literature's purposes,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.540
the heading is the area where
you date your completed letter.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.380
In the greeting, give a
salutation to the person

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.450
to whom you are writing,
also known as the addressee.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.200
This part is a little tricky,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.280
because the salutation
largely depends

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.410
on your relationship
with the addressee.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.460
For example, you should
not be overly affectionate

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.130
with someone you barely know.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.860
That would be like saying I
love you to a total stranger.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.420
So, it's advisable to
analyze your relationship

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.630
with the addressee before you
use words that are inadequate.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.820
An example of a greeting you can
use when you are not familiar

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.240
with the person you are
writing to, is "Dear sir"

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.690
Or you can also use
"Mr.", "Mrs."

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.600
Or "Miss" if you know
the name of the person

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.220
to whom you are writing.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.870
For more informal letters,
such as those you send

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.880
to your friends and family
members, You could use words

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.180
like "Hi", "Hello",
and "Greetings".

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.300
Now that you have the
greeting all ready,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.420
let's work on the
body of the letter.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.530
The body of the text
is where the majority

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.790
of the information is written.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.300
This is where you will express
how the book you read changed

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.720
the way you saw yourself
and the world around you.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.310
Remember to divide your
message in paragraphs,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.940
depending on topic, And try
to group similar information

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.500
in the same paragraph.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.740
Following the body, there
is the closing statement.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.340
Just as with the greeting,
you must be careful

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.250
about the words you
choose to end your letters.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.740
Some closing statements
that are safe to use

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.620
when the person is
not a close friend are

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.880
"Sincerely" or "Warm regards".

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.850
If you are familiar with the
person you are writing to,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.610
appropriate closing
statements are "With love",

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.180
"With thanks", and
"see you soon".

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.490
These statements carry a
more affectionate message

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.230
to the person you
are writing to.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.970
After the closing statement,
remember to sign the letter

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.050
and write your name in
block letters below.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.840
Writing your name underneath
your signature ensures the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.870
reader will know
exactly who you are

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.270
because sometimes
signatures are not so clear.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.210
Well, this will be all for
this lesson on letter format.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.510
I hope you learned something.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.390
If you have any questions
or doubts,

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.920
feel free to ask your
teachers and librarians.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.520
I am sure they are more
than willing to help.
