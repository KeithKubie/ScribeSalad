DAVID AUERBACH:
Thanks for hosting me.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.780
I realized I should
probably just cover

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.970
my history for anyone
who didn't know it.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.874
I grew up in the 1980s
programming in Logo.

00:00:17.874 --> 00:00:19.290
I learned how to
do the triangles.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.850
I learned how to do the turtles.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.770
Can I actually just
get a show of hands?

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.956
Who here has programmed in Logo?

00:00:25.956 --> 00:00:26.580
That's amazing.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.820
You know, I spoke at a business
conference the other day.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.200
No one raised their hands.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.130
I said, OK, who here
is programmed in LISP?

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.630
No one.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.820
I said, who here
has heard of LISP?

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.680
No one.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.920
It was like, wow, it's just
all R and Python these days.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.050
So, yeah, so I grew up on Logo.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.450
In the '90s, my wife
and I-- who is here--

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.810
majored in computer science.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.970
And we worked at Microsoft.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.560
And I'm going to be
talking a bit about that.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.801
And then after a couple
of years at Microsoft,

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:02.550
we came to Google.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.550
We were here and I
was here in the 2000s.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.110
And I worked on the
web mirror team,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.530
which was part of
the crawl back then.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.870
And because I was
a little crazy,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.130
I decided to give it up and
become a writer and critic

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.180
and technologist.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.950
And this is sort of
the result, my book.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.260
And but it's really
good to be back.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.255
I mean, we were on the
fourth floor back then.

00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:29.310
And this brings back
a lot of memories.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.660
So this has a special
meaning for me.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.140
So I was going to read
a couple sections that,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.390
hopefully, are relevant to
more computer-oriented people.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.070
But first, as proof
of my bona fides,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.140
you may notice that
it's called "Bitwise."

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.230
And those are actual
bitwise operators

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.970
on the cover, something
I made sure of so

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.345
that people would
say, no, I just

00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:58.670
didn't look in a library
of computer terms

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.610
and picked one
that sounded cool.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.150
The real discovery though
was this bit of art

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.360
by Richard McGuire.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.509
He's a cartoonist who does
some "New Yorker" covers.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.870
And if you noticed the
pipe and the ampersand,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.250
those are indeed
bitwise operators.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.270
And I was very happy to find
that piece of art and use it.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.570
So the first part I'd
like to speak about is--

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.530
this is actually a tale
of my time at Microsoft.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.800
And bizarrely enough,
we have someone here

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.150
who was actually there at the
time on the very same team.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.730
So he can verify that I'm
not embellishing this.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.480
And this section is
called "Chat Wars."

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.980
And it begins with a
quote from Grace Hopper,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.490
"It's easier to ask forgiveness
than it is to get permission."

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.620
And now you'll see why.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.730
[LAUGHS]

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.250
At 22, when I was just
out of college and still

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.020
a green software
engineer, I thought

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.420
America Online and AOL won.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.940
The battle made the front
page of the "New York Times."

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.059
The public was beginning
to care about code.

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.600
This wasn't the code
that would crack

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.060
the secrets of mathematics or
the nature of the universe,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.030
but it was the lifeblood
of our economy and society.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.160
It was the summer
of 1999, and people

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.410
were starting to realize
that the internet and the web

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.570
were becoming a new
dynamic circulatory

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.650
system for informations,
coordination, and life itself.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.660
The summer before my
final year of college,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.490
I interned as a
software engineer

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.900
at Microsoft in Redmond.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.490
I was assigned to
the group that was

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.760
building MSN Messenger Service,
Microsoft's instant messaging

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.420
app.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.900
And after receiving my degree, I
went on to join them full time.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.780
The unwieldy name was cooked
up by Microsoft's marketing

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.030
department which had a
reputation for always picking

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.130
the clunkiest and least
imaginative product

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.640
names: Buddy List, C
U C Me, MSN Messenger.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.920
No, it was MSN
Messenger Service,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.410
but I'll call it
"Messenger" for short.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.930
At the time, the big
players in instant messaging

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.280
were AOL Instant
Messenger, Yahoo, and ICQ.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.710
AOL Instant Messenger--
AIM for short--

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.420
had tens of millions of users.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.430
AOL had become the
country's biggest dial-up

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.920
provider in the mid '90s
by blitzing mailboxes

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.090
with CD-ROMs.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.450
And all AOL users
automatically became AIM users.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.000
Yahoo and ICQ each
had millions of users.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.838
These are paltry numbers
by the standards of 2018,

00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:19.379
but they were
meaningful in the '90s.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.070
After my team finished
developing the client code,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.040
we had some downtime while
waiting for the server team

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.776
to finish their
Hotmail integration.

00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:33.400
We couldn't release
without their work.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.440
We fixed every
bug we could find.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.480
One of the problems
was getting new users

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.520
to join Messenger when
so many people already

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.810
used other chat programs.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.030
Unlike email, which
has the standard SMTP

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.997
format across all programs,
these chat networks

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.080
didn't talk to each other.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.950
AOL didn't talk to Yahoo
which didn't talk to ICQ,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.730
and none of them
would talk to us.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.380
AOL had the largest user base.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.050
So we discussed the
possibility of adding code

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.290
to allow Messenger to log into
two servers simultaneously,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.200
Microsoft's and AOL's, so that
users could see their Messenger

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.090
and AIM buddies on a
single list and talk

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.010
to AIM buddies via Messenger.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.326
We called it "interop."

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:13.970
AIM's protocol was
known as OSCAR,

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.170
stood for acronym for Open
System for Communication

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.666
in Realtime.

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:20.760
It was undocumented.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.730
So me and my mentor at the
time signed up for AIM accounts

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.610
and watched the AIM client talk
to the server using a network

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.540
monitor.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.430
I saw the protocol
that AIM was using.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.040
My mentor Chris had
figured out a large chunk

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.921
of OSCAR this way.

00:05:33.921 --> 00:05:35.920
And after he left the
team, I picked up his work

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.794
and finished the job.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.210
So, you know, did
AOL notice that there

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.520
were some odd messages heading
their way from Redmond?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.480
Probably not.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.980
They had tens of
millions of users.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.380
And we were mimicking their
protocol reasonably well.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.966
But I thought this little stunt
would be deemed too dubious

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:55.840
and excised from Messenger
before it shipped.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.400
But management liked it.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.690
So on July 22, 1999, Microsoft
entered the chat markets

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.980
with MSN Messenger Service
complete with a AOL interop.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.380
No one had warned
AOL of our gambit.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.910
And they weren't
happy with what we

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.350
termed our "unauthorized
interoperability."

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.450
Quickly, they blocked
Messenger from connecting

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.060
to their servers by veering
their protocol messages in ways

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.650
we hadn't anticipated.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.440
Users who tried to contact
their AIM buddies from Messenger

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.690
would receive a pop-up
instant message saying,

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.540
"Use an authorized AOL client
at this link," with the URL.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.440
But as long as Messenger sent
exactly the same protocol

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.810
messages to the AOL
servers, AOL wouldn't

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.210
be able to detect that
a user was on Messenger.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.070
So I took the AIM
client and meticulously

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.990
checked for differences
in what it was sending

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.510
and then changed our client
to mimic it once again.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.970
Messenger users received an
upgrade with this new fix.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.890
And because this was the dial-up
days, the client was tiny.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.880
It was literally 300 K. It
was not even a megabyte.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.174
But AOL, again, caught on and
switched their protocol up.

00:06:57.174 --> 00:06:59.590
We matched their client again,
pushed out another upgrade.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.230
We went back and forth
at least a dozen times.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.080
At one point, AOL
sneakily excluded users

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.174
logging on from Microsoft
headquarters IPs

00:07:08.174 --> 00:07:10.090
from their changes so
that we would be unaware

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.970
that either Messenger users
were receiving an error message.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.520
After an hour or two of
scratching our heads,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.040
a team member sick at home
notified us that, yes,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.880
she was getting disconnected.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.180
And a shout-out
to Kara for doing

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.950
that amazing work [LAUGHS]
when we were all going crazy.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.060
Microsoft and AOL were
both tech titans in 1999.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.260
Soon, the press got
a hold of the story.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.410
On July 24, the "New York
Times" printed "In Cyberspace,

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.400
Rivals Skirmish Over "Messaging.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.900
"AOL kept blocking us," wrote
the paper of record, quote,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.610
"but Microsoft
refused to roll over.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.200
Late Friday, the
software giant said

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.950
that it revised its MSN
Messenger program to circumvent

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.910
America Online's roadblock.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.490
Within hours, America Online
answered that challenge

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.240
with a new block."

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.825
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:52.825 --> 00:07:54.366
It was like reading
about a wrestling

00:07:54.366 --> 00:07:57.850
match in which I was the
mysterious masked challenger.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.590
OK, so another quote.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:06.580
This is from the great
20th century polymath Jacob

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.940
Aronofsky.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.750
"Progress is the exploration
of our own error."

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.330
And I think anyone who's
been a software engineer sure

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.990
knows that.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.054
So the messenger war was a rush.

00:08:17.054 --> 00:08:19.720
Climbing into work every morning
to see whether the client still

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.150
worked with AOL was thrilling,
even if it usually wasn't.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.320
When it wasn't working, I
looked through the reams

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.640
of protocol messages
to figure out

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.056
what had changed, fixed the
client, tried to get an update

00:08:30.056 --> 00:08:31.850
out the same day.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.510
I had no idea who my adversaries
were, but I'd been challenged,

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.909
and I wanted to win.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.110
And our users cared, too,
and they wanted us to win.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.780
And this was, you know, having
actual users on your side

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.169
at Microsoft and those days
was actually somewhat unusual.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.660
[LAUGHING] So AOL tried
different tactics.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.847
At one point, I thought
that they were identifying

00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:51.430
the Microsoft client
because it wasn't

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.460
downloading the advertising
that the AOL client downloaded.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.860
So I updated our client
to download it all

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.730
and throw it away.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.469
AOL included mysterious
protocol messages

00:09:00.469 --> 00:09:02.760
that didn't seem to affect
their client but broke ours.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.000
So I fixed that.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.340
One day, I came in
to see this embedded

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.740
in the messages from
the AOL server, "Hi.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.600
-Mark."

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.520
It was a little
missive from engineer

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.420
to engineer, hidden from the
corporate media and PR worlds

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.960
that were arguing over us.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.910
I felt solidarity with
him even though we

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.500
were on opposing sides.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.070
In the press, AOL was
pushing propaganda

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.440
about how Microsoft was
behaving like an evil hacker

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.120
by asking for AOL passwords.

00:09:30.724 --> 00:09:31.930
But this wasn't true.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.970
But we were allowed
only to respond

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.080
through the PR department.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.850
My team was sealed off,
but our code wasn't.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.870
And then, one day, AOL
stopped blocking us.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.730
It was strange to
encounter sudden silence

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.222
as though the enemy had abruptly
yielded the battlefield.

00:09:45.222 --> 00:09:46.930
And while I wanted to
believe we had won,

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.285
I suspected AOL wouldn't
give up without a word.

00:09:50.285 --> 00:09:52.842
And a week later, we
found that Messenger

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:53.800
had been blocked again.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.680
But this time was different.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.470
The AOL server was sending a
huge chunk of new gobbledygook

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.910
that I could not understand.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.830
And it looked like this.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.850
The first couple lines are the
standard AOL protocol header,

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.850
the 2A02779C.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.000
This is all fairly
standard stuff.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.530
But from these 90, 90, 90, 90,
onward, it was incomprehensible

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.417
and didn't bear any relation
to anything the AOL service had

00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:22.500
sent their client or ours.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.900
The vast expanse of
double zeros in the middle

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.870
was also mysterious,
since a bunch of zeros

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.140
couldn't contain much meaning.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.180
Our client ignored it.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.690
But the AOL client responded
to this gobbledygook

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.700
with a shorter version
of the same gobbledygook.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.060
I didn't know what it was.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.812
And it was maddening.

00:10:38.812 --> 00:10:40.410
After staring at
it for half a day,

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.690
I went over to Jonathan,
a brilliant server

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.747
engineer on our team, and
asked what he thought.

00:10:44.747 --> 00:10:46.830
And he looked at it for a
few minutes and he said,

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.390
this is code.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.514
Specifically, well, that's code.

00:10:51.514 --> 00:10:52.680
Actually, most of it's code.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.900
But the most important part is
down here as you might guess.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.600
It was actual x86 assembly code.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.480
The repeated 90s
had tipped him off

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.510
because they signify
a no-op instruction

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.400
x86 assembler
telling the processor

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.440
to do nothing for one cycle.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.000
So the pieces came together.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.640
Normally, protocol messages
read as data, not as code.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.320
But AOL's client had
a security bug in it.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.370
It had a buffer overflow in it.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.120
And, actually, let me
ask, how many people

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.380
know what a buffer overflow is?

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.920
I'm going to skip
over, oh, everyone.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.170
We're going to skip over that.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.240
Actually, for all the
viewers in TV land,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.170
it basically means is
that you can run over

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:37.050
the edge of an
assigned spot in memory

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.350
and overwrite the program
code with whatever you want.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.000
So they were overwriting
it with x86 assembler.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.550
And they were controlling the
function of the AOL client.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.780
It's a huge security hole.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.240
And AOL knew about this
bug in their programming.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.780
And now they were exploiting it.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.650
The double zeros were filling up
space in the program's buffer.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.240
And once it hit the
end of the buffer,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.820
it overwrote the executable
code with the remainder

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.340
of the protocol message.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.280
This is the new code
which caused the client

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.060
to look up a particular
configurable address in memory

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.976
and send it back to the server.

00:12:16.976 --> 00:12:19.170
And this was tricky
and much trickier

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.030
than anything
they've done so far.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.850
And it was a bit outside
the realm of fair play,

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.360
hacking into their own client
using an unfixed security

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.550
hole, a hole that our
client did not possess.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.660
It was a "Rommel, you
magnificent bastard" moment.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.000
And I was out of my depth.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.939
Someone else at Microsoft--

00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:40.230
I never found out who-- told
the press about the buffer

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.540
overflow, figuring that if
people knew that the AOL

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.150
client had a huge
security hole in it,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.100
AOL would be forced
to patch their client

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.660
and would no longer
be able to exploit it.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.650
So according to the security
expert Richard M. Smith,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.560
a certain Phil Bucking
of Bucking Consulting

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.810
sent him an email,
alerting him to the buffer

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.820
overflow in the AOL client.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.316
"Dear Mr. Smith,
I am a developer

00:13:02.316 --> 00:13:04.440
who has been working on a
revolutionary new instant

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.870
messaging client that should
be released later this year.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.850
Because of that, I
followed with interest

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.710
the battle between
AOL and Microsoft

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.110
and have been trying to
understand exactly what AOL

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.900
is doing to block
Microsoft and how Microsoft

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.700
is getting around the blocks.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.250
Up until very recently, it's
been pretty standard stuff.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.500
But now I fear AOL
has gone too far.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.430
It appears that the AIM client
has a buffer overflow bug.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.620
By itself, this may not
be the end of the world

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.962
as Microsoft has
surely had its share."

00:13:30.962 --> 00:13:35.690
[LAUGHTER] Yes, yes.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.480
"But AOL is now exploiting
their own buffer overflow bug

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.510
to help its efforts to block
MSN Instant Messenger."

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.970
So it's a bit
ham-fisted, I think.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.980
The developer of a
revolutionary new app

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.990
takes sides in the
Microsoft-AOL war

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.850
without promoting his own app?

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.630
The email also includes
this actual trace.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.460
This is from the
email, because I

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.590
don't have my notes from
it anymore, because those

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.410
were confidential.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.390
But I can still have that.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.140
And if Phil Bucking's
text and his name

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.390
weren't suspicious
enough, he'd also

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.020
sent the message from one
of Microsoft's computers

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.910
at a Microsoft IP.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:14.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.610
The IP address showed
up in the email headers.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.110
And Microsoft's
digital fingerprints

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.140
were all over the email.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.380
Smith accused Microsoft
of sending the email,

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.570
and Microsoft fessed up.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.330
The news story that emerged
covered Microsoft's attempt

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.300
to bad-mouth AOL under a
fake identity, an easier sell

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.670
than explaining the
buffer overflow.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.410
People on various
security forums

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.540
ascertained that the
buffer overflow was real

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.280
and invade further against AOL.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.500
But the press wasn't
paying attention.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.410
The buffer overflow persisted
into several later versions

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.590
of AOL's client.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.160
AOL never admitted a
thing, and the press never

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.790
did understand it.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.100
So we gave up.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.830
And I licked my wounds, and
I joined the server team.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.610
The larger lesson
of the messenger war

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.980
was that the workings
of code were no longer

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.080
a private matter known
only to those steeped

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.100
in the law of computing.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.770
They were increasingly
becoming public affairs

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.320
that impacted national
and even global events.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.960
And, you know, certainly
coming in the wake of Cambridge

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.460
Analytica, it proved
more true than anything

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.990
even when I read this.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.680
The chat wars were to me
a duel between a handful

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.840
of people within two
gargantuan companies.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.680
And yet, they became a national
news story for a brief period.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.312
Looking back, it was
the first inkling

00:15:27.312 --> 00:15:28.770
I had that it wasn't
just computers

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.600
that were permeating all our
lives but the code itself.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.420
And yet, few grasp code's
function and its impact,

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.430
something that is
still true today.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.980
The ultimate outcome
of the conflict

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.430
resulted from buffer overflow
whose existence was never

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.540
agreed upon because neither
reporters nor the public

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.680
understood it.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.690
So sometime after
I left Microsoft,

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.970
I met one of the AOL engineers
who had worked against me.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.550
We had a huge laugh over it.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.770
And I complimented him on
the genius of the buffer

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.300
overrun exploit, even
as I bemoaned my loss.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.860
It had been a great game,
I said, and he agreed.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.250
We were both dumbstruck
that we were still

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.750
to a very small number of
people who knew the real story

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.640
after all of these years.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.560
So that's the buffer
overflow story.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:18.530
The second section-- if you can
hold your questions to the end,

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.130
I was going to read two
more short segments that

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.780
relate to-- well,
the fact of the book

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.800
goes all over the place.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.640
How many of you know "Dwarf
Fortress," by the way?

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.430
Just a couple?

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.290
OK, I'm not going to be speaking
about that today, although I

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.990
did think about
talking about it.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.460
But I discussed
that in the book,

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.580
because I think it's a good
example of how computers can

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.900
and cannot model the world.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.300
So this is a section called
"Truthtellers and Liars."

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.700
It begins with a
Charles Sanders Peirse

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.750
quote, "All that logic warrants
is a hope and not a belief."

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.820
So there is a type
of puzzle made

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.460
most famous by the
logician Raymond Smullyan

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.620
and by the movie
"Labyrinth" that involves

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.750
liars and truthtellers.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.001
And how many of you know these
sorts of liar-truthteller logic

00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:03.500
puzzles?

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.460
Yeah, OK, we'll
just skip over that.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.828
I'll just give you a variant
that I gave to my daughter.

00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:11.119
Let's say, we've got two doors.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:12.980
And behind one is a
huge amount of money,

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.550
and behind the other is a shark.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.210
I decided that the
lady or the tiger

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:21.240
was a bit of a relic
from an earlier era,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.300
so I changed it
to money or shark,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.200
which I thought was
very, very contemporary.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.830
OK, so the writing on the doors;
on door one, "The shark is

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.481
in here;" door two,
"Both doors are lying."

00:17:31.481 --> 00:17:33.230
Well, door two must
be lying, because it's

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.180
impossible to truthfully
say that you're a liar,

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.980
so door one must be
true, or else door two

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.030
would be telling the truth.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.821
The shark is behind
door one, and the money

00:17:39.821 --> 00:17:41.240
is behind door two.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.210
I compulsively worked through
hundreds of these as a kid.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.450
And I was fortunate my mother
stumbled on Smullyan's book

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.650
"Alice in Puzzle-land."

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.770
How many of you read
"Alice in Puzzle-land?"

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.197
I was going to say, there's
got to be at least a couple.

00:17:54.197 --> 00:17:56.780
And that became my introduction
to the field of Boolean logic,

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.730
in liar-truthteller puzzles
and logical paradoxes.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.920
Smullyan's use of Lewis Carroll
suited the truthteller puzzles

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.457
since, you know, Carroll
had been a logician himself.

00:18:08.457 --> 00:18:10.040
And some of the
puzzles in these books

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.290
grew extraordinarily
ornate, requiring

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.205
multiple levels of inference.

00:18:14.205 --> 00:18:16.580
Sometimes they didn't tell
you what one or another person

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.079
had said.

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:18.770
Sometimes "yes" and
"no" were replaced

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.920
with nonsense words like "bal"
and "da" that meant yes or no,

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.200
but you didn't know which.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.100
There were even
abstruse puzzles that

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.100
attempted to explain Kurt
Godel's Incompleteness Theorem,

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.890
but it was above my
head at that age.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.550
But one puzzle
genuinely irritated me.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.530
And this is a simplified
version of it.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.520
So a man is trying to figure
out which of two caskets

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.980
contain a portrait.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.000
On the first portrait, we have,
"The portrait is not in here."

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.680
And the second casket said,
"Exactly one of these caskets

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.680
is telling the truth."

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.831
So where's the portrait?

00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:53.330
Well, whether or not the second
casket is telling the truth,

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.260
the first casket must
not be, because it says,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.030
"The portrait is not in here."

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.590
Either the second
casket is true,

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.990
and the first casket
is therefore false.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.050
Or the second casket is false,
and thus the first casket

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.090
must be false as well,
or else the second casket

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.215
would be telling the truth.

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.360
In the puzzle, the man
also figures the portrait

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.560
is in the first casket.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.840
He opens it up
and finds nothing.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.340
The portrait's in
the second casket.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.840
He is utterly baffled.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.360
And so was I. And the
answer seemed indisputable

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.040
in this very simple puzzle.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.190
So here's what Smullyan
wrote as an explanation.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.830
"Without any information given
about the truth or falsity

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.170
of any of these sentences,
nor any information given

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.036
about the relation of
their truth values,

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:33.410
the sentences
could say anything,

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.804
and the object
could be anywhere.

00:19:34.804 --> 00:19:36.720
Good heavens, I can take
any number of caskets

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.330
that I please and put
an object in one of them

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.490
and then write any inscriptions
at all on the lids,

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.090
and these sentences won't
convey any information."

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.360
I felt cheated.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.700
I felt that Smullyan had
made an implicit promise

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.890
that he would be providing
logic puzzles that made sense.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.060
But I grudgingly observed
the other puzzles explicitly

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.110
claimed that the rules
were being obeyed.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.890
And in this puzzle, there
was no such guarantee.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.990
The lesson was that
truth and falsity

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.780
are not absolute but
relative to a context.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.230
Outside that context, statements
lose sense of meaning.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.450
Without the guarantee that
rules are being followed,

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.580
we can never be sure that
our reasoning is valid.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.280
And nowhere is that more
true than in the logical

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.880
and contextually isolated
world of computers.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:24.570
So from there, I go on to
talk about bits themselves.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:32.180
Bits are commonly represented
by the degree of voltage on--

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.510
in transistor.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.530
And there's nothing true
or false on circuit boards

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.580
containing transistors-- the
binaries between the voltage

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.160
being on or off.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.345
Off isn't actually zero
as I made sure to say.

00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:48.550
And the binary isn't between
true or false or even 0 and 1.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.190
No one is actually interested
in whether gates output

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.110
a voltage signal
except in as much

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.800
as that signal represents
something else.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.970
And what such signals
represent in a computer

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.760
is an abstract notion of
logical truth and falsehood,

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.280
which is a notion imposed by us.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.230
Truth and falsehood
are conceptions

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.630
that we apply to the presence
or absence of a signal

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.640
at a particular point
on a circuit board.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.610
The binary
representation of truth

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.800
is so ubiquitous
that we chronically

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.460
[? complate ?] logical true
false and computational 1 0,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.190
on off binaries.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.900
A programming language permits
me to have a Boolean variable.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.460
Let's call it is
this thing on, which

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.200
can be either true or false.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.930
And the simplest representation
and most common representation

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.510
would be to use 0 for
false and 1 for true.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.970
But what if with this
numerical representation

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.257
we run across a 2 or some
other number that's not 0 or 1?

00:21:37.257 --> 00:21:39.340
We could declare those
numbers to be meaningless--

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.367
neither true nor false.

00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:42.700
But we don't want a ternary
logic in which there are not

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.910
two, but three options--

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.340
true, false, and meaningless.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.560
So in C the convention
is that 0 is false.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.380
And any other number is true.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.660
This representation appeals
to our common convention

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.670
of equating truth
with existence.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.890
Falsehood is nothing--
absence, emptiness, is zero.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.980
Truth is presence of
validity existence.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.250
Anything other than zero
even a negative number--

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.680
for those of you who
use Microsoft H results

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.750
you know that it's
reversed in that way.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:12.610
And 0 is actually the
standard success result--

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.010
something that
caused a lot of bugs

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:19.780
when people just
used to not sign on H

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.760
results thinking that
they were binary results.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.675
A programmer is--
and I include myself

00:22:24.675 --> 00:22:26.050
in this-- is
conditioned to treat

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.590
true and false as synonyms
for 1 and 0 respectively.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.780
True and false become
the two possible values

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.710
for a single bit in
a two bit system.

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.114
It is two value system.

00:22:38.114 --> 00:22:38.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.930
These truths and
falsehoods remain a purely

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.670
formal convention
even though the words

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.840
contain metaphysical
weight within them.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.540
If I write God
exists equals true,

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.777
that obviously doesn't
cause God to exist.

00:22:48.777 --> 00:22:50.860
Nor does it cause the
computer to think or believe

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.970
that God exists.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.860
All it does is set a
signal somewhere deep

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.260
in the recesses of
a computer's memory.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.910
That line of code,
however, suggests

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.685
more than just the changing
of signal on a circuit board.

00:23:00.685 --> 00:23:03.320
Any meaning we assign
to true and false

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.830
besides the signals being
on or off is interpretation.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.880
If I say God exists, I'm making
a claim about the real world.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.640
When a program contains a
statement God exists equal one,

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.270
it merely indicates the
alteration of a signal.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.850
So computers don't
understand the difference

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:19.870
between true and false.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.195
Nor do they understand
what the concepts mean.

00:23:22.195 --> 00:23:25.570
And if a computer is to gain any
grasp on truth as we understand

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.530
it, it will have to be someplace
other than in its bits.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.010
And another quote
from Thomas Pynchon--

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.034
"Who claims truth,
truth abandons."

00:23:36.034 --> 00:23:39.210
And there's a little
historical context.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.990
The history of logic
has long wrestled

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.780
with the problem of getting
that true to mean more than one

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.250
or on--

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.580
the problem of getting true to
say something about the world.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.980
The difficulty started
long before computers.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.420
We may think that
we can patently

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.880
tell the difference between
a true and a false statement.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.460
But outside of logic puzzles
pinning down this distinction

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.740
proves horrendously
vexing to the point

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.920
that both Western philosophers
like Sextus Empiricus

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.410
and Eastern philosophers
like Nagarjuna

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.230
question whether the truth
of anything could be known.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.230
These concerns, which might seem
like philosophical navel gazing

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.450
became far more urgent
once formal logic

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.620
entered the picture.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.260
The great logician
Alfred Tarski,

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.400
an influence on computer science
and artificial intelligence,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.080
coined Convention T
as a minimal criterion

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.857
for the truth of the statement.

00:24:24.857 --> 00:24:26.440
Here are two examples
of Convention T.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.200
Actually how many of
you know convention T?

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.910
Not too many.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:30.409
OK.

00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:31.660
Logic's not in these days.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.618
All it is is you put a
sentence in quotes like,

00:24:33.618 --> 00:24:34.400
"The sky is blue."

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.960
The sky is blue is true if
and only if the sky is blue.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.880
I am a jelly donut is true if
and only if I am a jelly donut.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.200
And a great deal of
philosophical ink

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.760
has been spilled
on Convention T.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.460
But I think most people will
agree that this criterion is

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.190
not especially helpful as a
practical guide to determining

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.730
the truth of a statement.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.640
And yet we may even despair at
how little progress Convention

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.060
T seems to make over Aristotle's
definition of over 2000

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:01.990
years ago.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.490
To say of what it is--

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.880
to say of what is that it is
not or of what is not that it is

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.990
is false.

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.740
While to say of what
it is that it is

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.050
and of what is not
that it is not is true.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:16.850
Not so helpful.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:17.350
OK.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.330
Yeah.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.980
But whatever truth
may be, we can

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.320
conclude that in order to
interact well with the world,

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.630
computers must be
able to distinguish

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.570
between true and false in
the same way as humans do.

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.750
"The inadequacies of
logicians' attempts

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.410
to collapse the difference
between a logical truth

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.140
and a worldly truth have
been made all too clear

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.370
in the computing age.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.610
The mathematician and
phenomenologist Gian-Carlo Rota

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.410
put this bluntly.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.450
"Mathematicians are
therefore mystified

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.370
by the spectacle of
philosophers pretending

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.890
to re-inject philosophical
sense into the language

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.370
of mathematical logic.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.340
The fake philosophical
terminology

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.770
of mathematical logic
has misled philosophers

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.570
into believing that
mathematical logic

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.120
deals with the truth in
the philosophical sense.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.320
But this is a mistake.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.390
Mathematical logic
deals not with the truth

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.160
but only with the game of truth.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.440
The snobbish symbol
dropping found nowadays

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.600
in philosophical
papers raises eyebrows

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.490
among mathematicians
like someone

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.386
paying his grocery bill
with Monopoly money."

00:26:15.386 --> 00:26:18.180
Rota here echoes Plato's,
who was one of the first

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.070
to find that truth as
a practical matter--

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:25.515
a matter of action rather than
a pure theoretical abstraction.

00:26:25.515 --> 00:26:27.630
And Paul Friedlander's summary--

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:31.140
"Truth in Plato's system is
always both reality of being

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.410
and correctness of
apprehension and assertion."

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.300
Or in William James's words--

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.770
"Truth happens to an idea.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.560
It becomes true-- is
made true by events.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.290
The troublesome gap is not
between logic and language,

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.880
between logic and reality.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.494
Symbols and proofs cannot
close that gap on their own."

00:26:48.494 --> 00:26:50.600
Finally, three quotes-- one--

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.572
Tarn Adams is actually the
author of "Dwarf Fortress."

00:26:53.572 --> 00:26:56.030
"You activate bugs and little
parts of the code from eight,

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.840
six years ago where you just
didn't balance the numbers,

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.030
because it didn't matter."

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.700
And the great computer
scientist Alan Perlis--

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.890
"Every program is a part
of some other program

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.780
and really fits"-- something
that everyone in this room

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.570
I'm sure already knows.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.912
And finally, this
is my daughter.

00:27:11.912 --> 00:27:13.370
And this is something
she-- this is

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.720
a song she wrote, which I think
sums it up better than me.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.780
"And errors can happen
to you and computers,

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.980
because you are a computer.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.640
Go and do it.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.510
Program yourself.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.470
Just do it.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.400
Explore your toes.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.330
Explore your nose.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.015
Explore everything
you have goes.

00:27:26.015 --> 00:27:27.390
And if you don't
want to do that,

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.260
you can't even live, not even
houses, because houses are us."

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.010
All right.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.059
That is what I wanted to end on.

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:35.559
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:36.525
Thank you.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.890
AUDIENCE: I've thought
a lot in my life

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:45.970
about how a deep understanding
of computer science

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.800
shapes my worldview
and makes me think

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.220
of the world in
computational terms.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.390
And at the same
time, I've thought

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:56.140
a lot about how kind of
similarly to what you're

00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:00.010
saying that that's
insufficient to kind of bridge

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.070
the gap between conscious
reality or reality

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.920
in general and you know, physics
and math and all of that.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.390
And I feel like in many
ways this computational way

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.940
of thinking about the
world is extremely useful

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.730
and at the same
time very clouding,

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.980
because it makes us
overreach in the way

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.540
that you were alluding
to in your last piece.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.540
I was just wondering
whether you could elaborate

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.750
on your thoughts on that.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.390
DAVID AUERBACH: Yeah, I
mean this is something

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.098
that I can speak about,
because I'm here,

00:28:27.098 --> 00:28:29.590
which is that one of
the strangest things

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.630
was that as a
software engineer I

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.130
felt like I was
surrounded by people

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.365
who thought it was enough.

00:28:34.365 --> 00:28:34.865
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:34.865 --> 00:28:36.940
I thought there must be
something wrong with me,

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.965
because everybody else
seemed so definite.

00:28:38.965 --> 00:28:42.220
And I feel like it's
just not working for me.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.230
And honestly a large
part of the book

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:49.900
is me trying to elaborate on why
I was so dissatisfied with it,

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.220
which is one of the
reasons why I don't program

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.510
full time anymore.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.590
And I had been--

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.530
I was a lit geek
from a young age.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:07.030
And I like some of the
formal experimental books.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:12.250
Like, there's a French
author, George Perec,

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.010
who wrote a book called "Life
A User's Manual," which is

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.430
Donald Knuth's favorite novel.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.960
And everything is sort of
mathematically structured

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.450
by all sorts of
formal mechanisms.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.430
And it's beautiful.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.790
And I found out actually
in researching the book

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:33.220
that Perec had been writing
another project in which he

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:38.110
needed a 12 by 12 Graeco
Latin square in the late '60s.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.090
And there had been
a paper written

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.800
on computationally
generating them,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.920
because he couldn't
make one by hand.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.870
And I think that--

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.140
was it Euclid or Euler who
thought that there didn't even

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.710
exist Graeco Latin squares
beyond a certain single digit

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.884
size-- but someone had written
a paper on computationally

00:29:56.884 --> 00:29:57.550
generating them.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.560
And the co-author
was Donald Knuth.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.080
So Perec wrote to
Knuth back in the days

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.610
before Knuth was quite the
household name that he is today

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.310
and got a two 12 by 12 square.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.380
So I love that
point of connection.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.800
And that, I think, was
one of the things that

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.860
helped keep me
going and thinking,

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.520
OK, there is room to try to
merge these two approaches,

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.760
because for many years, I did
feel like my mind was on two

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.070
parallel tracks, because I
was doing some literature

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.900
stuff in the background.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.270
And then this was my job.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:31.990
And I did--

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.990
I enjoyed it a lot.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.070
But but each one I
think felt incomplete.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:41.560
And I couldn't see how to
sort of draw them together

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.130
in any way.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.760
And for many years, I did seem
to be quite separate pieces,

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.640
because a lot of the literature
and philosophy I studied

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.690
was resolutely non-quantitative
and even non-logical.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.260
And as Gian-Carlo
Rota points out,

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:01.900
the attempts to integrate
them were very ham fisted.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.920
That continues even to this day.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.560
One of the things
I'm working on now

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.850
is Shakespearean authorship
attribution using machine

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:10.780
learning methods.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.800
And it's not-- this is basically
the plot of T statistics

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.940
of words mapped
against frequencies.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.842
And because these
machine learning models--

00:31:20.842 --> 00:31:25.810
these were using decision trees
random forests and a method

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:27.430
called [? mirror ?]
shrunken centroid.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:32.400
But because the models
were all opaque,

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.540
the internal results
of the decision trees

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.300
weren't presented.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.390
I had to rip the models apart
to sort of figure out actually

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.927
how is this
attribution being made.

00:31:41.927 --> 00:31:43.510
And it seems like
they were just being

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.530
made on the basis of a
handful of very popular words.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.110
Like, and is used
very frequently

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.720
by authors who aren't
Shakespeare and is not

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.450
used very frequently by
Shakespeare comparatively

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.360
on a consistent basis.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.830
But if you don't actually
have this breakdown,

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.130
it can look very impressive.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:09.730
So I think there's still a lack
of good understanding as far as

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.140
how you draw these
things together.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.100
And part of that is
because of the problems

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:19.090
with semantic understanding
that computers still have.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.590
I was always
something of a skeptic

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:24.600
when it came to semantic
AI, good old fashioned AI.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.460
And I guess I felt a little
vindicated now that the much--

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:37.960
the neural nets and other
supervised training--

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.330
learning techniques-- sub--

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.220
symbolic techniques
were sort of pooh

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.830
poohed in the late 20th century
and the mid-20th century

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.850
in particular.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:48.450
But once you have enough
data, suddenly they

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:52.170
go way past anything that
symbolic AI has accomplished.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.910
So that's sort of
a rambling answer.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.230
And I guess the short
answer is that, yeah--

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.985
is that I treat it
at great length in--

00:32:57.985 --> 00:32:58.485
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:58.485 --> 00:33:01.606
--the book.

00:33:01.606 --> 00:33:05.270
Would anyone else like to
ask anything whatsoever?

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.269
AUDIENCE: So the two
excerpts you read were--

00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:08.560
one of them was very narrative.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.103
And the other one was very--

00:33:11.103 --> 00:33:14.710
what's the word-- expository.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.450
And what's the balance that
you were trying to strike?

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.340
And like, what is the book like?

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.367
Is it a lot of
narrative structure?

00:33:23.367 --> 00:33:24.450
Is it a lot of exposition?

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.520
Do you like munch them together?

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.650
DAVID AUERBACH: Yeah,
well hopefully they--

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.760
I skipped over the transition.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.110
I tried to have it be both.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.210
I mean, I was
encouraged-- apparently--

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:40.160
so I am naturally sort
of a top down writer.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.470
So if I had just gone at
it, it might have been

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:47.130
more directly philosophical.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.620
But a lot of people
said, no, no, no, David.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.190
You should make
it more personal.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.490
And some of the
stories are good.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.949
But I tried to-- but there's
plenty of the parts of my life

00:33:55.949 --> 00:33:58.240
that I left out, because I
thought they were completely

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.290
boring or irrelevant.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.710
So to the extent that
I talk about my life

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:05.940
it is always in the service
of the larger points.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:11.310
And the balance is I don't--

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:12.550
it's hard to say.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.120
I don't know what
the balance is.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.010
Would you say
it's-- is it 50/50?

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.650
I guess my point,
though, is that having

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:23.310
read books of both sorts I
think that you actually do

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.420
need both pieces--

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.130
that I actually-- I--

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:31.830
after many years looking at
politics but also arguments

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:35.040
of other forms it does seem
that stories are actually

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.000
better at convincing people
than arguments per se.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.130
And so crafting
a narrative story

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:46.199
that illustrates a point in a
more concrete and visceral way

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:50.100
can actually be more effective
than a deductive argument

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.530
in which you argue
from first principles,

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.860
because there's usually some
assumption made in there

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.580
or some prior if
you're a Bayesian

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:03.170
that if you don't agree on,
you'll just say no, no, no,

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.350
this is completely invalid.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.475
I'm not going to follow it.

00:35:05.475 --> 00:35:07.590
But you know, you got a story.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:12.230
And the thread of narrative
is carrying you through.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.460
That's sort of my
thinking about it.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.190
Hi.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.230
AUDIENCE: I'm just
wondering if I

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.240
could ask you about your
process writing this book.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.340
I know you said in the Q&amp;A
how, like, you ended up

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.560
finding narrative themes
that you might not

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.880
have intended initially.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.710
Like, how was the
process in general?

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.835
DAVID AUERBACH: Oh, my God.

00:35:27.835 --> 00:35:29.601
You read the Q&amp;A. Oh, my God.

00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:30.100
OK.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.100
Well, oh, boy.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:37.895
Let me say something
that I haven't already.

00:35:37.895 --> 00:35:41.570
The process-- well,
actually to return

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.760
to the previous
question, I did start off

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.650
by writing some pretty
theoretical stuff.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:49.110
And I think my editor sort of
reacted with horror saying--

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:49.985
there was an entire--

00:35:49.985 --> 00:35:51.476
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:51.476 --> 00:35:53.030
There was an entire--

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.610
back in the day I did
compiler research.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.920
I loved working on
compilers, because it

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.320
was like-- it's like, oh,
it puts everything together.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.510
And I had a chapter on
compilers and compilers

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.660
as illustrating the structure
of abstraction layers

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.740
and computers.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.730
That chapter got cut.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:15.080
And it got replaced with
a chapter on my daughter.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:20.630
And you know, what can I say?

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.680
Maybe it will go
into the next book.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.120
But so it was a matter
of approximation.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.580
And it was a way of--

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:33.640
I had some existing
pieces that I'd written.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.960
There is one in particular
called the "The Stupidity

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:41.351
of Computers" for n+1 that
I think did provide the germ

00:36:41.351 --> 00:36:41.850
for this.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:48.110
And what I set out wanting to
do was to write something that

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:52.430
wasn't necessarily for
a technical audience

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.530
although I tried
very hard to make it

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:58.290
so that someone technical
would read it and say,

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:01.730
OK, this person
speaks my language,

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.810
because whenever I'd
written for various venues

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.136
I would often speak to a
software engineer there.

00:37:08.136 --> 00:37:09.260
And they'd say, oh, my God.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.370
I'm so glad you're
writing for us.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.786
You actually
understand computers.

00:37:11.786 --> 00:37:15.990
And I-- this happened
enough that I was like, OK,

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:20.210
there's a gap here in terms
of people do not want to read

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:28.010
another abstract critique of
how the post-modern structure

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:34.230
of computation is altering
the nature of subjectivity

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.250
in the postmodern age-- you
know, something like that--

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:41.810
you know, that being
able to talk about this

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:45.890
in which the particulars of the
computer science matter is I

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:50.270
think something that actually
is very useful and helpful.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:55.670
And so I wanted to
sort of communicate

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:58.940
that toolset as well as
some greater reflections

00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.870
on that toolset--

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.060
things that I didn't
know when I even--

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:06.410
in college but sort of had come
to from thinking about them.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:10.950
I'll tell you I was a columnist
for Slate for some years.

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:14.690
And one of these shockingly--
well, there were two columns--

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:16.430
actually there
were three columns

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.910
that I wrote that were
incredibly surprisingly

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:20.420
popular.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.640
One was on the amazing
kids game Robot Odyssey.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.020
How many people here ever
played Robot Odyssey?

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.760
The hardest computer
game-- it was--

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.320
you had to use logic
gates to program robots.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.900
This was made for the
Apple II in, like, 1984.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.480
It is the hardest computer
game I ever played.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.610
I didn't solve it
until I was in college,

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:46.760
because what it asks you to
do with logic gates is so damn

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.740
abstract.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.060
And I didn't possess
those skills back then.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.480
That one was a huge hit.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.710
A piece on Roko's
basilisk was a huge hit,

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.537
because everybody
loves Roko's basilisk.

00:38:56.537 --> 00:38:58.370
And if you don't know
about Roko's basilisk,

00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.800
you should look it up.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.350
And the third one was about
Wittgenstein and philosophy

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:05.930
of language and how it
related to computer science

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.540
and how it had helped me
understand some of the things

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.420
I was talking about.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:14.510
And so in some ways,
those three pieces

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:19.360
understanding that computers
were now touching everyday life

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.920
and that the best way
of understanding this

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.540
was to both have a grasp
of bits and the structures

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.870
of computing, as well as the
larger picture of what they

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.760
meant in terms of
everyday living

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.400
was something that I
wanted to communicate.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.890
And then I thought I could
hopefully have something

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:38.140
useful to contribute on.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:38.840
I don't know.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.470
Does that answer your question?

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.967
Thanks for reading
the Q&amp;A. I think

00:39:41.967 --> 00:39:44.300
I also said that it was the
hardest thing I'd ever done.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.450
And I still agree with that.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.830
It was not-- writing is hard.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.054
I don't recommend it to
anyone who absolutely

00:39:51.054 --> 00:39:51.970
doesn't need to do it.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.397
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:54.397 --> 00:39:55.730
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:57.180
I look forward to
reading the book.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.050
DAVID AUERBACH: Thank you.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.508
AUDIENCE: So I don't know if
you answered this in the book.

00:40:00.508 --> 00:40:03.710
But there's been a lot of talk
last few years about teaching

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.900
computational thinking
to more and more people

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.615
or more simplistically teaching
programming to everyone.

00:40:08.615 --> 00:40:12.180
And I'm curious what you think--
whether this is a good thing.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.952
Or is it being overhyped?

00:40:14.952 --> 00:40:16.910
DAVID AUERBACH: I mean,
I guess it can be both.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:17.844
There's always a hype.

00:40:17.844 --> 00:40:19.760
There's always hype
around something or other.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.343
It's like, you can
say to some extent,

00:40:21.343 --> 00:40:25.730
oh it's teaching kids about
big data and a good thing

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:26.450
or overhyped.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:29.270
Well, yes, it's good to
know about those things.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:32.180
But the words big data
may make you think,

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.490
oh, well, let's not
teach it like that.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:41.400
And I think everyone can
certainly benefit from knowing

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.070
how code works just in the way
that I think they're going--

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.850
people should-- can benefit from
knowing a bit about how machine

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.760
learning models work and
how they can and can't--

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.600
what they can and can't do.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.930
At the same time, you
know, marketing it

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:02.370
as, oh, this is going to be
of practical usage to you

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:04.287
and you should definitely
become a programmer

00:41:04.287 --> 00:41:06.370
or something like that I
don't think is necessary.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.050
I think that it would be better
to propose this as, yes, this

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.200
is fundamental knowledge
in the same way

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.920
that mathematics is logic--
having some base even

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.250
theoretical appreciation
of what an algorithm is,

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.110
how an algorithm can work.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:25.109
Maybe this is because I found
this stuff really interesting.

00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.650
I don't know.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.725
We recently picked up a
book for my seven-year-old--

00:41:28.725 --> 00:41:30.930
a mathematics book
for a 7-year-old

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.467
that was recommended to
us by someone or other.

00:41:33.467 --> 00:41:35.550
And they said, yeah, yeah,
this is great for like,

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.380
really getting
your kid into math.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.110
And it was written
in [? LaTeX. ?]

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.222
And I said, OK, good sign.

00:41:42.222 --> 00:41:44.430
But I started reading the
problems, like, oh, my God.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.480
There's group theory
for seven-year-olds.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.920
I was like, this is insane.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.640
I was like, this
is very impressive.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.490
But I literally--

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.400
I'm-- the number of kids
who can absorb this level

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.934
of abstraction, because
it was like, OK, well,

00:41:58.934 --> 00:42:01.350
let's say you have beads on a
chain that alternate between

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.860
these three types of beads,
what is the 493rd bead?

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.060
I was like for a seven-year-old?

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.380
It's like, all right.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.550
So I think it's a good thing.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.540
I think that unfortunately,
especially ed tech being

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.000
the way that it
is, there's reason

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.400
to worry whether the right
things are being taught,

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.620
you know?

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.990
If you just teach people
how to design a clock

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.210
and put it up on a screen,
that's interesting.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:31.140
I mean, it will get you
some appreciation and use.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:35.370
But I think that
putting it into context

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.400
can be useful as
well, just this--

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.290
I mean, it would be as if you
only did like arithmetic word

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.230
problems in your entire
time at school, you know,

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.899
instead of going on to
algebra and calculus.

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:49.440
I don't know.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.500
Does that answer your question?

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.083
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:51.083 --> 00:42:52.260
DAVID AUERBACH: OK.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.550
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
a [INAUDIBLE] Logo

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.160
example before.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.870
And I wonder what
you think about

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:03.930
like this educational
programming things--

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:09.030
where we're going and what
would be the future of Logo

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.990
we're teaching?

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:11.198
DAVID AUERBACH: I don't know.

00:43:11.198 --> 00:43:12.360
I mean, I look at Scratch.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.250
And I have such mixed
feelings about it,

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.130
because on the one
hand, it's great to have

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:22.470
the notion of
imperative language

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:26.430
and functional abstraction.

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:28.830
But on the other hand,
it's like, they are talking

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:30.440
about recursion, you know.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:41.910
Where are the-- that I feel like
to some extent there's some--

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.100
I do feel that you
could introduce

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.740
some of these concepts-- some
of the higher order concepts

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.600
in a cool way earlier on.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.490
But at the same time I--

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.440
you know, the fact that the
kids are doing them is good.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.840
And I mean I've seen
other computer games--

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.540
I've seen other,
like, kids games

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.530
that work on similar principles.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:13.522
But I think to some
extent, you know,

00:44:13.522 --> 00:44:15.980
it doesn't necessarily have to
take the form of programming

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.790
per se as much as
it is a certain form

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.750
of algorithmic abstraction.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.320
And it doesn't necessarily
require programming so much

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.880
as learning the
nature of how data

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.360
structures and certain
algorithms can fit together.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.510
And I'm saying that vaguely,
because I'm just thinking back

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:39.500
to the various things I did
when I was a kid that gave me

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.250
an appreciation.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.610
You know, I think Truth Teller
and Logic Polls are great

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.790
as well.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:48.960
And there are probably other
forms of puzzles that I

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.460
haven't--

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.140
that I'd never have played
that would be great as well.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.970
And I think that--

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.544
well, we're all here at Google.

00:44:58.544 --> 00:44:59.960
But if some of us
worked on trying

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.376
to figure out what
those are, that

00:45:01.376 --> 00:45:04.230
would be wonderful, as well.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:06.050
There was a puzzle
game I played recently

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.720
called Stephen's Sausage Roll.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.780
Does anyone know that?

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.750
It is the hardest
puzzle game I've

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:13.960
played in many, many years.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:21.470
And I felt it training my
brain quite well in terms of--

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:22.700
I mean, it is--

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.310
you can see how it was
very heavily influenced

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.080
by abstract algebra.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:33.050
But it translates those
concepts into applications

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:36.260
within this game so that
you aren't doing, you know,

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.660
purely abstract exercises.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:42.030
But you're actually executing
in a vaguely algorithmic manner.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.370
So I hope there's
more of that honestly.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:50.090
I think there's a lot
of room for improvement.

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.180
Certainly, you know, I look at--

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.750
actually it's
interesting, you know.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.958
My daughter's learning chess.

00:45:54.958 --> 00:45:56.900
And I feel like in some
ways chess tutelage

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:00.770
has been developed very
well, because the levels

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.020
of abstraction you treat
[? and trust ?] sort of go up

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.140
that ladder like that.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:08.390
And it's because you have
such an established context

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.070
that it's helpful.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:12.950
So in some ways, I would
say that learning chess

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:15.230
may actually be better for
you than learning Scratch.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.180
I don't know.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.130
AUDIENCE: In chess,
it really gets better.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.680
I mean, like he beats me
in chess at this point.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.570
DAVID AUERBACH: Yeah,
I mean there's a real--

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:24.120
you know.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:24.620
What?

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.640
I was six years old.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.570
And I had an Apple IIe
with a monochrome monitor.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:30.590
But here you have--
you can draw shapes.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.030
And that was cool enough for me.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:35.140
I mean and I have a
short attention span

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.420
and need lots of stimulation.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.290
So I don't think kids
would hate it today.

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.540
AUDIENCE: I try to replace
[INAUDIBLE] with JavaScript

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.437
and explain, like, to my son how
to draw with the shapes and--

00:46:44.437 --> 00:46:45.770
DAVID AUERBACH: With JavaScript?

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:47.570
Oh, you're just
torturing him now.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:48.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:48.602 --> 00:46:50.310
AUDIENCE: He didn't
seem very interested.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:50.875
So--

00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:51.850
DAVID AUERBACH: Sorry?

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:53.780
AUDIENCE: He didn't
seem that interested.

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.738
DAVID AUERBACH: That's
because it's JavaScript.

00:46:55.738 --> 00:46:56.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:01.550
Try Python at least,
you know, or APL.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.600
Maybe he'll like the cool
little, like, you know,

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.280
the symbols.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.195
I don't know.

00:47:06.195 --> 00:47:07.061
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:07.061 --> 00:47:07.560
Sorry.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:12.320
If I had been introduced to
JavaScript when I was six,

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.126
I probably wouldn't
be a programmer.

00:47:14.126 --> 00:47:20.960
So-- does someone else
have a question back there?

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.891
Peter, you must have a question
and give me a hard time.

00:47:25.891 --> 00:47:27.890
AUDIENCE: --too much
weight on logic and reason?

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:28.760
DAVID AUERBACH: Do I what?

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.593
AUDIENCE: Worry that
you put too much weight

00:47:30.593 --> 00:47:31.669
on logic and reason.

00:47:31.669 --> 00:47:33.460
DAVID AUERBACH: Didn't
I just criticize it?

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:39.920
AUDIENCE: Well, yes, but
there was a lot of philosophy

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.150
and logic in there.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.120
I mean, the
background experience

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.210
there is the discovery
that winning an argument

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:48.230
doesn't make you right.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.880
DAVID AUERBACH: Yeah.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.570
AUDIENCE: So--

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.020
DAVID AUERBACH: Well,
I mean, to some extent

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.700
I was hoping to play
to this audience.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.860
I wouldn't have
read that section

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.550
to an audience of lit majors.

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:02.090
But this is presumably what
folks here do all the time.

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:06.980
And you know, maybe software
engineers have changed.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:14.420
But I feel that the impulse to
quantify and regiment things

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.230
logically is still pretty
strong amongst software

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:22.170
engineers and other sorts
of engineers and scientists.

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.200
And so I think it's
worth exploring.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:28.070
And I think that the
stuff I talk about still

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:32.570
underpins a lot of arguments.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:33.380
I think it even--

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.360
you know, if you look at--

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.290
you can see it--

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:40.550
I guess if I were talking to
an audience of statisticians,

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.380
I'd probably be talking about
Bayesianism and frequentists.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.410
And you could come
up and ask me,

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:47.930
do you think you place too
much emphasis on statistics?

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:50.850
And it's like, well, you
know, it's everywhere.

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:53.880
So the world may place
too much emphasis on it.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.380
But--

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.850
AUDIENCE: Do you think software
engineers actually believe

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.450
in truth in their programs?

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:59.440
DAVID AUERBACH: No, no,
no, I mean, that's a--

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.460
what do I think software
engineers believe?

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.170
I think that software
engineers have

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:08.840
a tendency towards reifying
contingent categories

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:16.370
as literal and permanent.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:24.200
For example, these four
personality tests--

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.150
maybe people don't like--

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:27.860
maybe people don't
go for Myers Briggs.

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.530
But you know apparently
we subject a lot of people

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:33.170
to classifying people
into four colors--

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:36.296
green, blue, gold, and orange.

00:49:36.296 --> 00:49:39.950
And apparently most people
turn out to be greens.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:43.850
So if this is something that
we all take seriously here

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.800
at Google, I would say--

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.800
well, I know you don't
take it seriously, Peter.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.875
But would you argue that most
people take it seriously here?

00:49:51.875 --> 00:49:52.845
AUDIENCE: I can't tell.

00:49:52.845 --> 00:49:53.636
DAVID AUERBACH: OK.

00:49:53.636 --> 00:49:55.399
My experience was that they do.

00:49:59.231 --> 00:50:03.040
AUDIENCE: It's easy
to do over weight

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.092
what shows up on
weird mail threads

00:50:05.092 --> 00:50:06.550
or in fact, any
mail thread, right?

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.540
DAVID AUERBACH: This
is just from talking--

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.230
AUDIENCE: --what people believe.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.760
DAVID AUERBACH: This was
just talking to people.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.110
I mean, I didn't read mail
threads when I was back here.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:12.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:13.290
--seemed healthy.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:15.310
AUDIENCE: Well, if this were
address a statistical group,

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:17.830
we would argue about your
sampling procedures, right?

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:18.220
DAVID AUERBACH: We could.

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.200
But don't you think you're
putting too much emphasis

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:20.783
on statistics?

00:50:20.783 --> 00:50:23.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:26.940
AUDIENCE: No, I think that's
the only way to truth.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:31.210
DAVID AUERBACH: Well,
so there you go.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:37.150
Perhaps overweighing the logical
truth in that definition--

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:39.645
AUDIENCE: I have what I think
is a very relevant question.

00:50:39.645 --> 00:50:41.020
I was wondering
if you could talk

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.990
about what it's like to
write for and be criticized

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:45.355
by programmers on the internet.

00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:51.250
DAVID AUERBACH: Yeah,
I mean, I'll be honest

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.500
and say people were
actually really nice.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.020
I think-- and this is--

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:59.670
it sort of reinforced that
a lot of the feedback was,

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:00.400
oh, my God.

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:03.520
Finally someone who
knows about coding.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.430
So I would say if
anything I was spoiled,

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:10.270
because I think that there's
not a lot of technical knowledge

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:13.870
on display at least in these
so-called popular press

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:24.400
or you know that I wouldn't
say I've gotten a lot of flack.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.840
But in general, I
think that if anything,

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.887
I detected that there was
a certain frustration.

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.470
And I mean this is
frustration of sort

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:33.970
of getting writ
large at this point,

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.490
because you have a
larger cultural clash.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:37.990
And this is something
that I've seen

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.200
being involved in like
the New York writing scene

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.130
and how much resentment
or at least loathing there

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:51.730
is towards the Silicon Valley
and tech people of all stripes.

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:54.700
And this can extend to
an ontological critique

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.370
that anyone in
programming must therefore

00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:02.230
be an awful evil positivist,
which again, yeah, Peter,

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.830
you're right.

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:03.460
They aren't.

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:07.780
But you know, there
are lots of big names

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.930
who speak for
technical companies who

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:15.460
certainly qualify more on the
positivist side of things.

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:21.610
And there's a lot of unjustified
anger towards them, which

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.110
I think is based in ignorance.

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:26.680
I also think that,
yes, the worldview

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.380
could do with some intelligent
critiques rather than

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.180
ignorant critiques
that just cause them

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:36.850
to double down and think
that you know maybe we

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:40.540
should go back to
Ayn Rand, because she

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.530
was right after all.

00:52:47.279 --> 00:52:47.820
I don't know.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:51.940
Is that-- how's
that for an answer?

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.680
I mean, it's a culture clash.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.010
It really is.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:59.740
But and I guess
the thing is is I

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:01.870
have an affection for
both sides I suppose,

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:06.310
as well as frustration with
perhaps closed mindedness

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:13.062
that occurs of which I have my
own variants of it, you know.

00:53:13.062 --> 00:53:14.520
Am I going to sit
here and tell you

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.960
that you should Jacques Derrida?

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.185
Hell no.

00:53:17.185 --> 00:53:22.170
Am I going to tell you that
you should sit here and read--

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:24.570
I don't know Denis Diderot?

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:25.443
Yes.

00:53:25.443 --> 00:53:28.290
So you know, there's
stuff to be gained.

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.210
But unfortunately
what rises to the top

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:32.280
is not always the best stuff.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.830
AUDIENCE: You mention that
writing is very hard work.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:36.625
And you wouldn't
recommend it to anyone.

00:53:36.625 --> 00:53:39.240
So do you plan to
continue writing?

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.686
And will it be on
a similar topic?

00:53:41.686 --> 00:53:43.310
DAVID AUERBACH: Yeah,
I have a problem.

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:45.390
Yeah, I mean it's--

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.610
you do it if you can't
do anything else.

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:50.040
I mean there's a Thomas
Mann quote where he said,

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.290
a writer is someone for
whom writing is harder

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:53.800
than it is for anyone else.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.144
And I don't think--

00:53:55.144 --> 00:53:57.060
I don't know that that's
true for all writers.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.620
But it's certainly true for me.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:04.630
And I just-- it
scratches some itch.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:09.390
And you try to do it so that
you hopefully are serving

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.070
some greater purpose with it.

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:13.620
But that's the sort of
question that can make you

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.610
very, very self-conscious
in a hurry.

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:18.410
But I do plan to continue it.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:21.120
I'm writing a young
adult novel right

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.340
now to get a complete
break from this,

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:27.350
because I didn't want to
write about myself anymore.

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:27.900
But yes.

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:32.280
I have more to say
about computers.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:37.840
And hopefully, that'll be
in coming in the short term.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.051
AUDIENCE: What is short term?

00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:41.050
DAVID AUERBACH: Oh, boy.

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:43.110
Knowing life-- I mean, God.

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:46.060
You know, life cycles of
books are much slower.

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.460
So it depends if--

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.520
how-- next few years I hope.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:55.230
I hope sooner if the
publishing industry

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.990
decides to speed up its cycles.

00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:00.750
But I mean there was
like a year turnaround

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.540
after finishing this before
it actually came out.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:09.364
So it's-- I do miss the
rapid release cycles of, hey,

00:55:09.364 --> 00:55:10.530
I just [INAUDIBLE] this fix.

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:11.370
Let's push it out.

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:11.960
All right.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.091
Good night.

00:55:13.091 --> 00:55:15.090
If I could do that with
a book, that'd be great.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.119
That's why I still
blog sometimes

00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:19.410
just because being able to
write something and actually

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:25.140
put it out there for consumption
the same day is amazing.

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.376
And one of my most popular
pieces in the last year I

00:55:27.376 --> 00:55:28.500
actually went through that.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.230
And I had-- which was my
explanation of the finale

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:31.980
of "Twin Peaks--

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.890
The Return," which I wrote in
a couple of days, posted it.

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:37.080
And apparently a lot
of people really wanted

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:40.740
answers, because overnight
I get like literally

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.440
like 10,000 times more
traffic than my little blog

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.000
has ever seen before.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.824
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:45.824 --> 00:55:46.648
AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:55:46.648 --> 00:55:48.420
I watched like five episodes.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.770
And then I felt like it
doesn't make any sense.

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:52.520
Like, there's like
horrible things.

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.270
I didn't continue.

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:54.500
But then I was curious.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:57.002
DAVID AUERBACH: I mean, what
I always told people-- look,

00:55:57.002 --> 00:55:59.460
if you're not enjoying it moment
to moment, don't watch it.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.470
You won't-- it's not worth it.

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:04.220
But at the end of it, I
did want to know more.

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:08.610
So anyway, thank you
very much, everybody.

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:09.407
It's been great.

00:56:09.407 --> 00:56:09.990
It's been fun.

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:13.340
[APPLAUSE]
