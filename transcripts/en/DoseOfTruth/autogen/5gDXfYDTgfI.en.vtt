00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
in the next part of this story there's
some<00:00:03.179><c> parallels</c><00:00:03.600><c> with</c><00:00:03.780><c> Abraham</c><00:00:04.230><c> and</c><00:00:04.259><c> and</c>

some parallels with Abraham and and
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.260 align:start position:0%
some parallels with Abraham and and
that's<00:00:04.950><c> built</c><00:00:05.220><c> into</c><00:00:05.430><c> the</c><00:00:05.609><c> narrative</c><00:00:05.970><c> I</c><00:00:06.060><c> think</c>

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 align:start position:0%
that's built into the narrative I think
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.250 align:start position:0%
that's built into the narrative I think
because<00:00:06.540><c> Isaac</c><00:00:07.440><c> is</c><00:00:08.660><c> Abraham's</c><00:00:09.660><c> descendants</c>

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
because Isaac is Abraham's descendants
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
because Isaac is Abraham's descendants
and<00:00:10.410><c> so</c><00:00:10.620><c> we</c><00:00:11.490><c> have</c><00:00:11.639><c> to</c><00:00:11.790><c> keep</c><00:00:11.940><c> the</c><00:00:12.240><c> narrative</c>

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 align:start position:0%
