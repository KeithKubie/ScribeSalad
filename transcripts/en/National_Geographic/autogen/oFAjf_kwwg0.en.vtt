more frequently could this be why the
 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.370
more frequently could this be why the
disease is far more common here than in

disease is far more common here than in
 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.400

about how widespread rabies is among the

about how widespread rabies is among the
 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.590
about how widespread rabies is among the
countries bat population what we don't

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600
countries bat population what we don't
 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.189
countries bat population what we don't
know is how this disease is persisting

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199
know is how this disease is persisting
 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.110
know is how this disease is persisting
in the vampire bats and we and as a

correlative that we don't know where it
 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.640
correlative that we don't know where it
is in vampire bats so again much more

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650
is in vampire bats so again much more
 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.969
is in vampire bats so again much more
widespread potentially it's all it's

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979
widespread potentially it's all it's
 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.050
widespread potentially it's all it's
always present than these populations

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060
always present than these populations
