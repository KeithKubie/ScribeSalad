This is Jocko podcast number one 84 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.980
Jocko Willink. Good evening. I go. Good evening.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.090
It's been awhile since we've done some Q and a and there's been a lot of

4
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:18.570
questions so let's get into it. Ready to go to it. Okay.

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.580
Question number one Jocko. I'm having issues playing the game,

6
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:24.810
quote unquote at work.

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.350
I'm quiet and friendly but I prefer to work hard rather rather than stand out

8
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:31.224
and talk.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.060
I found I have trouble forming more personal connections with my boss and

10
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:38.220
coworkers. What are your tips?

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.290
So look, when I talk about playing the game,

12
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:46.320
I'm not talking about the fact that you have to change your entire personality

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.270
profile to start to connect with people. That's not what I'm saying.

14
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:54.750
You don't have to go from being someone that's what they say,

15
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.930
quiet and friendly to.

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.160
You don't have to become some chatty extrovert running around making small talk

17
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:04.500
with everybody. And on top of that,

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.610
there is a little bit of a statement here that says, you know,

19
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.710
I'd rather work hard as if there's,

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.850
these are mutually exclusive things, which they are certainly not.

21
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.740
So this being forming relationships with people and playing the game does not

22
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.360
interfere with your work at all.

23
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:25.110
I'm not saying that you sit around and talk when there's work to be done,

24
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.963
but

25
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.530
there's going to be natural breaks in whatever you're doing.

26
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:36.240
There's going to be moments where skip the action pauses and you get a chance to

27
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:41.160
connect with somebody. So that's fine. So, so what are some tips that,

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.190
how would you do this? Sorry, I thought about this.

29
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.860
Have you want to start with something small? Right. But you want to engage,

30
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:53.100
this is the key point. I don't just want to throw something at you.

31
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:54.390
I want to talk at you.

32
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.390
And besides when it's much easier just to let someone talk about themselves.

33
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.910
So the, what I'm, what my advice in this particular question is,

34
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.960
is to tell them something about yourself,

35
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:11.940
like something minor about yourself.

36
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.090
But then that kind of ties into something that you can ask them and then they

37
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.280
can talk to you. Because most people like to talk about themselves.

38
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.150
So you ask them a question about themselves and then you go,

39
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:28.380
so you know something, something maybe something slightly related to work.

40
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.040
So it's not just some random statement that you're making, you know,

41
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.570
s you'd say,

42
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.600
you know what we did yesterday at work here reminded me of something.

43
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.880
Right. It reminded me of something else.

44
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.420
And then maybe it reminded me of a movie, Hey,

45
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.490
you know what we were doing yesterday reminded me of this movie.

46
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.840
Have you seen that movie? And at least you're going to get, well no,

47
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.470
cause I don't watch a lot of movies or no, I haven't seen that movie. Or Oh,

48
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:56.970
I've seen that movie. If it's a popular movie,

49
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:58.350
but chances are they're seeing it. You know what I mean?

50
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.250
And all of a sudden you've got a little bit

51
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.610
<v 1>of a conversation going and that's all we're looking for.</v>

52
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.740
We're not looking to turn into like chatty, catty, we're just trying to build,

53
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.450
build relationships with people. So you know who they are. So they,

54
00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:16.060
they know who you are. That's what we're talking about. Nothing crazy.

55
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.580
Start small build from there. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty straight forward. Yeah. In, in,

56
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:25.210
through that building process. What it Kinda found is one,

57
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.200
and I guess maybe this is a little tactical thing you can kind of throw out

58
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.580
whenever, but you know,

59
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.060
and you know when people give you advice or they tell you something about

60
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.360
themselves that something, I don't know, whatever, whatever the story is, right.

61
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.750
And maybe some strategy they use to do Xyz.

62
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.860
It can be super small if you let them know that you've remembered like in the

63
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.050
future, later on when you see him again, you say,

64
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:51.280
I remembered what you said last week, you know, tie it in this yet.

65
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.260
And it can be the smallest that that purple belt, Jujitsu,

66
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:57.790
mental, Jujitsu, I like it.

67
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.540
It can be the smallest thing and it just makes me feel good so that that person

68
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.050
will just essentially feel more open with you. Like, oh my gosh,

69
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:12.190
I'm [inaudible] pays this guy really pays attention to me. Oh yeah.

70
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.220
Makes them feel valuable. All that stuff just on that small level, you know?

71
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.860
So as far as building little relationships,

72
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.630
I'd say that's a cool thing to kind of remember to do. If he can't, I tend,

73
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.860
it's a cool kind of thing to remember too. All right,

74
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.170
next question Jocko.

75
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.100
May I ask your advice for addressing a cowboy quote unquote mentality among

76
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.680
teams working in dangerous environments?

77
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.090
How would you shift the culture to kill complacency too aggressively identify

78
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:43.360
and mitigate risk as a point of professional pride?

79
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.693
Okay.

80
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.930
This is something that we'll definitely saw it in the seal team seat all the

81
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:53.920
time in the civilian sector, you know, construction companies, power companies,

82
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:58.630
companies where people are doing dangerous work, right? Policing,

83
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.510
firefighting, anything, anything that has any element of danger.

84
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.660
You definitely see this. And like I said, certainly it's on the seal teams.

85
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.620
And the answer to this is a common answer for many leadership situations is you

86
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:13.240
have to explain why. So let me put it in a little context.

87
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.250
What you have to do is you have to say, Hey,

88
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.460
let me explain to you what happens when someone gets hurt or injured on this

89
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:22.090
job. Okay. First of all,

90
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.010
we get the loss of that person on the job that the job that we're working on,

91
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.960
the project that we're working on, it falls back.

92
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.750
There's paperwork that has to be filed, which by the way,

93
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.270
the paperwork hurts the progress of our project as well.

94
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.150
Our budget's impacted because now we've got to bring someone else on board.

95
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.063
We've got to train them.

96
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.460
We take a reputational hit as a company.

97
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.700
Right? What, what kind of a,

98
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.270
what kind of a company can't do a job without getting someone hurt, right?

99
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.490
I mean, this isn't a high bar. It's not a very high bar to say, Hey,

100
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:57.590
can you complete this task without getting someone injured?

101
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.340
<v 0>Yeah. And all of a sudden we got a g, we got, Hey, you know what? Our company,</v>

102
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.380
we don't, we get a lot of people hurt. Well,

103
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:05.510
what does that tell you about the company? It's a reputational hit.

104
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.010
Who are you going to hire? You're not gonna hire.

105
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:10.910
The one that's got people getting hurt all the time. So there's that.

106
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.970
The and what does that do?

107
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.300
What does that do to your reputation in terms of everything else?

108
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.530
Because if you're gonna a bunch of people hurt,

109
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:20.480
how can I expect you to keep your timelines?

110
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.020
How can I expect you to stay on budget? So

111
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.310
it's those things. It's those,

112
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.930
that kind of reputation that you get if you are getting people hurt.

113
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.730
And then also what does it do? What does it say about your team?

114
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.630
If you've got people getting hurt, and again, this is what I'm talking about,

115
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.790
a conversation that you're having with the group, with the team. You're saying,

116
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:46.340
look, what kind of a team are we? If we got people getting hurt,

117
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.870
what does that say about us? It says we're lack lackadaisical.

118
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.620
It says we're complacent. It says we don't pay attention.

119
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.480
What does it say about our leadership? If we got guys getting hurt,

120
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:59.060
what does that say about our leadership says we don't care about our people,

121
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.370
which by the way it says we don't care about our people. It means,

122
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.770
it says we don't care about our job. It says we don't care about our reputation.

123
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.480
Says what you do. We just don't damn care.

124
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.220
And what does it say about you? The individual,

125
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.120
what you know what it says about you an individual. If you get hurt,

126
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:17.150
you know what it says about you. You're a knucklehead and you got hurt.

127
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.220
You couldn't follow the procedures, you didn't follow the procedures.

128
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.370
You thought you were smart and you got complacent. Now you got hurt.

129
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.750
So these are the things when I talk about explaining why those are where I'm

130
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.730
going to start and now I'm going to explain and connect the dots so that the

131
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.751
purse, the individual,

132
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:40.751
see that someone getting hurt is actually the least professional thing that you

133
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:46.720
can do from a leadership perspective. If I let one of my guys get hurt, um,

134
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.380
that's just, that's just

135
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.660
Lily's professional thing I can do from an individual contributor perspective.

136
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.610
If I'm getting hurt, guess what? I didn't follow procedures. Okay, look,

137
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.200
are there accidents that happened? Yes, there are.

138
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.830
But what I'm saying is if you get an accident that could have been prevented,

139
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:07.460
that should have been prevented. And I as an individual let it happen.

140
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.170
That is absolutely my fault.

141
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.380
It's like when you've got a guy getting ready for an MMA fight and they get cut,

142
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.260
they weren't wearing head gear and it's like, look, I get it.

143
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.410
But that was dumb and I've had that happen. I mean,

144
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:24.020
I've had it happen with my fighters. I've seen it happen. All kinds of,

145
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:27.530
it happens in the UFC all the time, right? You've got a fight coming up.

146
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.040
You're going to fight for the title for the UFC title.

147
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:33.830
You're going to make possibly millions of dollars.

148
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.870
You're going to be the champion of the world. Oh, two weeks out, got a cut,

149
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.150
got a cut on my head, help, you know, blew out my ACL doing take down defense.

150
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.690
Right? Look, I get it. Accidents happen.

151
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:49.330
But what was really happening right at that moment?

152
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.800
Was it a random accident or we were doing something that we shouldn't have been

153
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:55.680
doing. So if we start to lean, look,

154
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.820
having accidents is actually an unprofessional thing to do.

155
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.020
It's a weak thing to do. It's a bad thing to do. When we let it happen,

156
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:09.450
it hurts everyone, not just the individual involved.

157
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.160
That's the attitude that we, we kind of come with, you know, we had the,

158
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.830
in the uh, in the,

159
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.270
in the navy you have like alcohol programs,

160
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.230
so hey, this is our program for you know, alcohol,

161
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:29.340
here's how we're trying to combat having people have alcohol related incident.

162
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.630
And when I was at trade Ed,

163
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.660
they had someone come in to like give us a talk about alcohol and then,

164
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.730
and then when they got done, the guy says, okay, you know, sir,

165
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:44.730
I was the guy in charge. He goes, what's your alcohol policy?

166
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.910
And I didn't have one and I didn't have one. And I was like, okay, hey cool.

167
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.740
I'll come up with one. Here's the alcohol policy. If you get hurt

168
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.700
or sorry, if you get drunk and you can't,

169
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.180
if you get drunk and you get in trouble or you get in a fight or you get

170
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:07.620
arrested or you get a DUI and you take time away from being deployable,

171
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.040
you are doing owl cadas job for them.

172
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.470
There's the alcohol policy. So now all of a sudden it's not like hey cool,

173
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:21.330
we're, we're, we're like Rah Rah. No. All of a sudden, hey man,

174
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:25.680
do we want to help the enemy by taking ourselves off the battlefield.

175
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.850
I mean there's nothing more that al Qaeda wants than for this seal to be

176
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.210
arrested for DUI and non deployable.

177
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.990
You just did al-Qaeda's job for you. Yeah.

178
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.660
So that's the kind of thing that I'm going to build the culture around. Yeah.

179
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.890
And that's the same thing you can do with people that are,

180
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.390
have that cowboy mentality.

181
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.010
You shift it so that that cowboy mentality becomes the thing that hurts our

182
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:51.540
reputation, that hurts our,

183
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.200
that hurts the company reputation and it hurts our individual personal

184
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:57.720
reputation as a man.

185
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.510
I couldn't even prevent my,

186
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.570
my shift from getting hurt from having someone get injured. Yeah,

187
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.380
so that's what you like. It feeds into their professional pride,

188
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:14.740
especially when you use the word unprofessional. No. Yeah. You know, like,

189
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.510
yeah, man, I knew you knew what you're doing on that one.

190
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.920
And then on the flip side, if you say consummate professional, right? Ooh,

191
00:11:22.921 --> 00:11:26.310
that's a good uncle. If ea, if your man, you can do it,

192
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.050
doesn't even matter the job you can do.

193
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:33.051
You can have your own lawn mowing business when you're 13 years old.

194
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.020
If you're, someone says, Hey, that guy, that kid's a consummate professional.

195
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:41.310
You're like, hell yeah. Hell yeah. I'm going to have to push back a little bit.

196
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:42.540
I don't know if there's too many.

197
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.850
I don't know if there's too many situations where you would say a 13 year old

198
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.003
lawn mower.

199
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.730
Now we know that mark the way the where your kid is heavily involved in

200
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.070
lawnmowing with marks, meticulous mowing. Yes. Yes sir. He is.

201
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.840
<v 1>But even, I don't even know if I'd call him a consummate professional.</v>

202
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.050
I wouldn't either. But if you, if you were just working towards it,

203
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.930
if you were to do so, mark would feel really good if you said,

204
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:07.920
that's what I'm saying is you can't be just throwing words around. Okay.

205
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.770
You can't just throw around consummate professional about low moments.

206
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.600
Now let's say the guy was a greenskeeper like on a golf course. Sure.

207
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.860
Now that person could be a consummate professional cause he's got to dial stuff

208
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.060
in and then maybe,

209
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:26.260
I guess you get to a certain level of just straight landscaping where, Oh,

210
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:29.470
you know what? There was a water, there was a, the pipe exploded. Oh,

211
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.880
Jocko came in. He had that whole thing resodded receded.

212
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.030
Took him four hours. That guy is a consummate professional,

213
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.380
so I guess I'll take it back. Well, I'm just saying reserve it.

214
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.920
Don't play with it. Okay. Don't play with that. Flying that finger on. Yeah,

215
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:49.560
exactly right. Yeah. Well, um, the,

216
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:54.400
the drip and that, that was very clever on your part. What was,

217
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.090
when you said you're doing okay, does job for you because think about it.

218
00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.403
I mean, you know,

219
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.620
there's nothing worse for a guy in the military is you are actually helping the

220
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.280
enemy right now. And then how you say it like you named names,

221
00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:11.770
you know it's not like you said the enemy, which I get. That's good too.

222
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:15.400
But it's way better to be like you're doing a new name the the PR because JP

223
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.600
will say that to right. Where he'll be like, um,

224
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.530
there was a sign or something about a sign or maybe he'll just say it.

225
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:23.820
He'll be like, your your enemy. Thanks you for not giving 100% today. Great.

226
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.590
Remember that one and it's good. That's a good one. And it sounds cool too.

227
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.380
I get it, but it is real general.

228
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.830
So you hear that 10 times or every day or whatever you like. Okay, cool.

229
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.300
It sounds cool, but it won't really affect your professional pride all the time.

230
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:40.030
Sometimes it does something, but if you name the enemy, you know,

231
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.920
like if you have some adversary, you know, and they thank you, that person,

232
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:48.010
whatever John Smith, you know, for not giving 100%, you know,

233
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.330
it might feed into, so you saying [inaudible] thanks you, you know,

234
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.820
for getting arrested. So I'm like, yeah man, think about it from the flip side,

235
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:58.480
right? What if you think of like an al Qaeda fighting team, right.

236
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.630
And one of them gets cut, like one of their effective fighters gets caught,

237
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.000
I don't know, doing something that they don't like gambling,

238
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.030
going to a strip club, I don't know, whatever. And they say, Hey,

239
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:14.370
you're not allowed to fight anymore for us. So he gets like exiled or whatever.

240
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.350
[inaudible] that's sweet. We want them to do that.

241
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.800
We might even send them some strip club recommendation. You see what I'm saying?

242
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.750
So it's literally, you're literally doing that literally. Yeah.

243
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.930
That's good. Clever, clever.

244
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.710
All right, next question. Hi. Juggle.

245
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.400
You answered a question about complainer's and said you'd listened to the,

246
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.860
because well it should be listened to them, right? You know,

247
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.440
you said you would listen to them because you can learn what the problems are.

248
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.320
I like it and people like to be heard.

249
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.700
But how do you handle chronic complainer's

250
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.520
<v 0>the type of people who become cancerous? I'm a huge fan of extreme honesty.</v>

251
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:02.570
Should take thanks for your time. Uh, yeah. This, this is the cause, once again,

252
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:07.430
for my favorite, my favorite general remedy in,

253
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.000
in leadership situations is you take this person and you put them in charge,

254
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.500
put him in charge. Yeah.

255
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.370
And this is one of those classic things where someone says, hey,

256
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.030
why are we even doing it this way? And you say, Oh, Echo, you don't like that.

257
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:22.460
Cool. Why don't you come up with a plan and you go execute it however you want.

258
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.470
And, and that does one of two things. Either they, they say,

259
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.310
OK and they step up and then they have to figure out how hard the job,

260
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.770
the task is. And they have to get it done. And it's,

261
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.600
they learn from it and they get humbled by it and they recognize the, the, the,

262
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.370
the burden of responsibility that a leader actually has, which is all good.

263
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.990
Or they just say, no, no, no.

264
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.240
And they stopped playing this cause they don't want to get tasked with anything

265
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:50.000
again. Now what you gotta be careful with it.

266
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:55.100
A lot of these answers that I give you could go like in the wrong direction.

267
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.190
So what I mean by that is echo says, hey,

268
00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:03.680
I don't like we do the way we're doing this. And I go, okay,

269
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:06.800
well then you're in charge. You know what I mean? I do it like that.

270
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.180
It's a punishment.

271
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:12.170
It's a punitive thing that isn't absolutely not what I'm talking about. I said,

272
00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:14.210
you know what? I go, you're pointing out some good stuff.

273
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.720
You're pointing out some definite shortfalls in the way that this is happening.

274
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.770
I'll tell you what,

275
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.040
why don't you actually just take responsibility for this and you can run this

276
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:24.890
task and you can make this happen. Cause I, I think, you know,

277
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:27.200
just based on some of the things you've pointed out already,

278
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.080
I'm not even calling them complaints based on some of the things you pointed out

279
00:16:30.081 --> 00:16:32.930
already. I think you could probably improve upon our process quite a bit.

280
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.210
You know, so you've gotta be careful.

281
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:38.250
I'm not talking about being a jerk to someone. Yeah.

282
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.100
I'm talking about act and this is the thing is like, it's like there's, there's,

283
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.470
there's this thing where what I'm doing, I'm not just playing the game.

284
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.440
You ever, you ever have ever told us in Jujitsu, I'm like, Hey,

285
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.760
if you want to set me up with the choke so that you can get my arm,

286
00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.020
you have to actually do the choke. You have to actually apply the pressure.

287
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:01.340
If you don't apply the pressure, I'm not defending it.

288
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.160
My name's not going to go where you want it. You have to actually do it.

289
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.310
And if I don't defend it the way you expect me to, then you just choked me.

290
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.640
Yeah. It's the same thing here. I'm not saying you just say,

291
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.450
well why don't you do it then? No, you have to actually say, hey listen,

292
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.110
I think this is what's going on. I think you have some good points.

293
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.740
Why don't you take lead on this? And we'll see if you can, you know,

294
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.410
remedy the situation. Cause I think you've got a pretty good chance of doing it.

295
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.140
This isn't, I'm not doing this as a punitive thing.

296
00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:28.970
I'm doing it because it's the best thing for the team.

297
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.460
You've got a legitimate complaint, you've got a bunch of them.

298
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.370
Let's get you in a position where you can sort some of those things out.

299
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.330
So yeah, so that's, that's that when you get people that are complaining,

300
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.830
you know, first of all, hear them out and maybe that's good enough, right? Hey,

301
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:50.130
listen to them. And, and, and once again, I'm not saying you listen him while

302
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.780
<v 1>your brain is elsewhere and you're not thinking of,</v>

303
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:55.020
you actually listen to what they're saying. You're engaged. You really do.

304
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.230
Go for the choke. Go for it. Listen to what they're saying.

305
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.030
Maybe there's some solutions you can come up with.

306
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.700
But then if that doesn't work and even after they,

307
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.940
even after you listen to them and you explain to them why things aren't the way

308
00:18:05.941 --> 00:18:08.790
they want, they still want to complain. It complained about it. Cool.

309
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.790
That's fine. Awesome. Why don't you take lead on this then?

310
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:13.770
That way you can sort out some of these issues. So appreciate it.

311
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.170
And like Lafe said that one time,

312
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:18.780
it's kind of hard to complain about a plan when it's your plan. Yeah.

313
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.070
That is the truth. Yeah, makes sense. God, I'm so stupid.

314
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:29.120
Here's this and sucks that I came up with. But the, yeah, the um,

315
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.010
chronic complaining cause you could kind of, I mean,

316
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.420
people who complain a lot, you, you, you, it's easy to be like, oh,

317
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.450
they're chronic complaints. Right. But if there's constantly,

318
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.710
we'll say chronic problems that might induce chronic complaining.

319
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:48.330
I'm not saying that's the case, obviously,

320
00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:51.390
because I know there is such thing as chronic complaints.

321
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.170
100% but at the very least, like I say, Oh yeah,

322
00:18:55.171 --> 00:18:58.710
put him in charge of something or, or listen to them and they'll put, you know,

323
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.690
listen to what they're complaining about or whatever,

324
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.310
that you might actually get turned on to all these solvable problems. You know?

325
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:09.360
And if you, if look, if you make someone take lead in a, in a situation, right.

326
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.770
And you know how it's Kinda like,

327
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.320
that's Kinda that concept of like taking an extreme ownership.

328
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.390
And then what if they'd do like say, yeah,

329
00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:18.840
it is your fault and then you get all mad, you know, kind of thing. It's like,

330
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.490
aw, you didn't really do that. It's like,

331
00:19:20.491 --> 00:19:22.560
so if you put someone else in charge of something,

332
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.970
you're really putting them in charge.

333
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.640
Like what if they run and what if they take lead and they solve all the

334
00:19:26.641 --> 00:19:29.550
problems? Awesome. Right? Yes, exactly right.

335
00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:34.551
So you don't treat this action or this discourse as like some thing to get back

336
00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:38.930
at the complaint. It's not just, it's not just a setup. Yeah, it's a real move.

337
00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:41.220
A real deal. And you know, that's you just,

338
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:46.250
you just made this point that I made,

339
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.160
which is one of the best leadership tools that is completely overlooked by

340
00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:55.440
people all the time, is very, very simple to do.

341
00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.300
And that's just to listen to what people are saying. I know it sounds crazy,

342
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.170
but I run into all the time leaders in all kinds of levels,

343
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:05.220
all kinds of situations.

344
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.010
And the biggest problem they have is they don't even listen to anyone else.

345
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.930
They won't listen. Yeah. So when you're in a leadership position,

346
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.440
try this, be quiet and listen to what people are saying.

347
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:17.700
Listen to what they're complaining about.

348
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.170
Listen to what suggestions they have listened to, what advice they give.

349
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.560
Listen to their recommendations. Listen, just listen.

350
00:20:25.561 --> 00:20:29.250
Sometimes you're going to be in a much better spot. Yeah.

351
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.270
And even like you saying that out loud sounds real obvious. You know? But it's,

352
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.880
man, it's not, cause even a lot of times like if you don't listen,

353
00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:38.640
I'm thinking about myself, like all the many trillions,

354
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.900
trillions of times that I haven't listened when I should have.

355
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:48.460
Most of the time. Most of the time we'll say, I mean to not listen.

356
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:53.110
I don't mean to be like, it's not like I'm like hearing noise and be like, oh,

357
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:55.120
you don't know what you're talking about. You're dumb.

358
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.370
You know what you say doesn't mean anything. It's not that.

359
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:02.440
It's more that I'm like focused so hard on what I'm thinking or my way or

360
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:05.170
whatever. Like I'm just so just of course naturally to mind.

361
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:07.180
I've been thinking about it for years now, you know, kind of thing.

362
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:08.230
So I'm so dumb.

363
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:13.260
Basically dug in to myself on my own thing that I'm not and I'm just not paying

364
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:15.070
attention that much. You know?

365
00:21:15.071 --> 00:21:19.750
I'm like working so hard and down this tunnel that like I can't look out of the

366
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:23.050
tunnel kind of thing. So you don't really mean to,

367
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.010
but when you're in the situation it's like, it's not that easy. You know it's,

368
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.300
it's, and you know what it is. Also, it's detachment, right?

369
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.220
When you're talking, you're talking in a step back to tach.

370
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.920
Listen to what people are saying. I do this all the time. Do this all the time.

371
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:43.570
It's such a, it's such an easy move. Yeah. If you'd sit your remember move,

372
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:47.050
you just watch, you just listen. Even like, can you get to do this?

373
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.300
We'll be like, oh the person wants to move around a bunch of cool.

374
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.100
I'll let them move around. Let's see where they're going.

375
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.300
I'm just going to listen to their moves, you know? Yeah.

376
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.650
And that's a good way to put it, man. Just listen to their moves. Just listen.

377
00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.100
And Yeah. If you primarily focus on that listening,

378
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.310
then like you habitually be able to do it way better. Cause like again,

379
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:08.140
like back to the, it's not like you're not doing it with malicious intent,

380
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.000
you know, you're not shutting them down.

381
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.550
It's almost like you already like interrupters. Right. You know,

382
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:16.300
chronic interrupters. People interrupt you all the time. Some of the time,

383
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.720
a lot of time, whatever we'll say half of the time estimate there,

384
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.420
it doesn't feel like they're doing it because they don't want to hear what you

385
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:26.440
have to say. Sometimes it's that for sure. But sometimes they, it's almost like,

386
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.470
it's almost like they have this tone of like, Dang, I don't think I finished.

387
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:33.910
My point is good as I want it to almost explain that to them for themselves

388
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.580
because they're so committed to their message and what they've been thinking the

389
00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:40.000
whole time, and if you're not signing right onto it, it's, man,

390
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:42.520
I must not set it clear enough. You see what I'm saying?

391
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.510
I had to like tighten up my kids on just straight.

392
00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:49.540
They just wouldn't let each other talk. It's just interrupt, interrupt,

393
00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:53.170
interrupt, and I think it was, yeah, it was my son for sure,

394
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.010
and he looked at me and he goes, he's like a, he says, dad,

395
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.060
you're going to just be aggressive.

396
00:22:58.061 --> 00:23:01.000
Our whole lives are now all of a sudden you're telling us just to sit back.

397
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.530
Oh, that was funny. Did you tell him that?

398
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:08.890
That's the dichotomy I said that's the dichotomy of course.

399
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.240
All right, next question. What is,

400
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:17.140
what is the most important issue you've ever changed your mind about

401
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:24.880
this is, you know, this is one of those things where I'm,

402
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.940
I'm sure this is one of those questions where I should have like some answer

403
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.990
about some specific subject or something. You know what I mean? Like I can see,

404
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.490
I know what answer is desired. I know what type of answers desired,

405
00:23:39.491 --> 00:23:43.240
but the reality is, you know, for me,

406
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.190
taking ownership

407
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.650
<v 0>of things, right? This and this,</v>

408
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:53.651
this wasn't really like I changed my mind to where what I used to say,

409
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.150
I'm going to blame everyone and then all of a sudden I said, you know what?

410
00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:59.480
That's not the right policy to have. I need to Tart to extreme ownership.

411
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:02.300
I didn't do that, but it was just a,

412
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.440
a thing that built and developed inside my brain.

413
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.670
And I think it's the most,

414
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:13.030
the most important thing that I've ever sort of recognized or conclusion that

415
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:15.020
I've come to. That's not a change,

416
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.590
but I'm sure at some point my attitude wasn't like,

417
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.250
I'll just take ownership of that, which it is now. But at some point, you know,

418
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:24.350
I'd say, well that's not really my responsibility. You know what I mean?

419
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:25.184
Of course.

420
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.340
That's a natural thing to say and I'll tell you what the next,

421
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:34.010
and this is interesting, but the other,

422
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.460
and this one's kind of more of a more of a,

423
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:40.670
I can pin it down a little bit closer to an answer that someone would like and

424
00:24:40.671 --> 00:24:42.140
this is, once again, it's going to be a little bit

425
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.710
a little bit strange.

426
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.710
But the other thing is the dichotomy of leadership. And this is the,

427
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.850
this is the thing about the dichotomy of leadership.

428
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.530
And I actually was thinking, I actually didn't,

429
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.680
didn't really recognize this until the last muster and I was,

430
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.710
as I was thinking about the dichotomy of leadership,

431
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:03.110
maybe it was off of a question maybe. I think it was actually before. No,

432
00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:04.340
actually it was before we even started.

433
00:25:04.341 --> 00:25:08.480
I was just like reviewing notes and thinking about the dichotomy of leadership

434
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:09.470
and,

435
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:14.470
and one of the most important things about that economy of leadership is that

436
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.900
the reason, the, the reason that I came to the conclusion,

437
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:24.410
the reason that I got to the dichotomy of leadership in getting there,

438
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:28.280
let me rephrase that then getting to a point where I said there's a dichotomy of

439
00:25:28.281 --> 00:25:29.114
leadership.

440
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.120
What I had to do was I had to admit to myself that I was wrong about everything.

441
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.950
That's what I had to do in order for the,

442
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.440
for the idea of the dichotomy of leadership to, to,

443
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.920
to escape my brain, to get out, to get to,

444
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.030
to become a full thought, what I had to do,

445
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.950
I had to admit to myself that I was actually wrong about everything.

446
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.400
So I'll give you real easy examples.

447
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.900
One of my things that I used to tell guys all the time, you gotta be aggressive.

448
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.230
You gotta be aggressive.

449
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:09.380
That's how you got to be in order for the dichotomy of leadership.

450
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.460
I had to admit, you know what? Sometimes being aggressive doesn't work, right?

451
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.100
I used to say, you know what, as a leader you could have stayed up.

452
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.790
You've got gotta be loud. And then I realized, you know what,

453
00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:23.270
there's I see leaders that are two that I had to admit that I was wrong about

454
00:26:23.271 --> 00:26:24.710
that, that sometimes that was wrong.

455
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.790
I had to admit that I was wrong about keeping things simple.

456
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.020
Like you know what? This is one of the most fundamental laws of combat.

457
00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:34.130
You got to keep things simple.

458
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.970
And then I had to admit that sometimes people keep things too simple.

459
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.260
Even this fact right here, right? In order to admit that I was wrong,

460
00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:44.010
I had to be, I had

461
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.270
<v 1>to be humble and I used to preach and I still preach humility as being like the</v>

462
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:49.710
most important thing. But guess what?

463
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.520
There are people and there even me where there's p,

464
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.400
there's times and places where you can be too humble. Yeah.

465
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.470
And so this idea, this idea that there's a dichotomy to everything.

466
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.820
It's something that the original fought for me was,

467
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:14.750
it came from me having one sided opinion and then realizing that,

468
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:18.630
and I'm, I'm almost positive. I don't remember crystal clear,

469
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.070
but I'm almost positive that the original thought that I realized there was a

470
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:27.490
dichotomy to was being aggressive and,

471
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.380
and again this was,

472
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:33.380
this is all kind of coming to fruition as I'm teaching guys at trade at and leaf

473
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.310
was running the junior officer training course and I used to give them the soul

474
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.890
and I remember writing, you know, I remember if it saved myself,

475
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:45.510
you know what I got to tell guys that they can go too far with being aggressive

476
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.800
and they can go too far with barking orders and they, and I just,

477
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.330
it like that's where it came from.

478
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.210
And if I wouldn't have been able to change my mind right.

479
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.450
Cause that's what this question was changing my mind about something.

480
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.720
The biggest thing probably ever in my life was understanding that just about

481
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:10.800
every characteristic that a person can have that a leader can have can go too

482
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:13.620
far and can become a negative characteristic.

483
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:19.070
So that's probably the biggest thing that I've changed my mind on. Hmm.

484
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.200
Interesting. Yeah, that aggressive one. That makes sense. Cause like, yeah,

485
00:28:25.201 --> 00:28:28.830
aggressive being aggressive like is one of the more effective ways to straight

486
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:32.370
up quote unquote get things done. For sure. Right. Do it and it'll be done.

487
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.270
Do it. You know, don't wait. Don't hesitate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh there's a,

488
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.620
there's a problem in a building.

489
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.680
Let's sit back and wait until that problem starts. No,

490
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.510
like you've got to be aggressive. Yeah. But then if you're in digits,

491
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.300
we'll teach you all kinds of lessons like this where if you're going to spring a

492
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:52.140
trap on somebody or something, animal person, whatever,

493
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.070
what's the best type of type of person that you can catch with a trap?

494
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.890
Probably an aggressive one. You know,

495
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.920
like they can set themselves up to get trapped if they're like aggressive,

496
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:06.660
you know, like an animal who's real hungry, you know,

497
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.710
hesitating. Like if an animal is like hesitant, you know, just hesitant,

498
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:17.880
maybe sees things develop a little bit before they take a certain action or

499
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:21.630
whatever, that'd be harder to trap. Yeah. Generally, yeah.

500
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.340
And this is the thing that's,

501
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:29.060
this is what makes humility important is it's hard to come to grips with the

502
00:29:31.171 --> 00:29:35.580
dichotomy of leadership because if you don't have the humility to sometimes say,

503
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:40.110
you know what? You're right that you know what? I am wrong. Yeah.

504
00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:41.920
This the hard on this plan isn't

505
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.160
<v 0>what I thought it should be. Yeah. So hard to do that.</v>

506
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:48.700
That's why it's hard to really get a grip on the dichotomy leadership and that's

507
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:49.570
what makes it so important.

508
00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:52.150
That's what makes it the answer to so many questions.

509
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.290
And sometimes people will come like, you know, someone will come up and say,

510
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.050
they'll have their counterpoint to what I'm saying.

511
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:05.020
And I'll tell you right now, let's let me think about of a,

512
00:30:05.021 --> 00:30:08.730
of a situation where you have to provide a counterpoint. If I,

513
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.050
somebody comes to me and says, you know what?

514
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.260
Being aggressive isn't always good. Sometimes if you're aggressive,

515
00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:16.510
all you do is you, you run to your death.

516
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.870
Now an egotistical Jocko would say,

517
00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.800
negative. You're wrong. I'm right.

518
00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:31.000
And I would dig in in that position. And when you dig in in position,

519
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:33.700
you can't maneuver anymore. So I'm actually stuck.

520
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.170
So this is a classic thing to do. Also, when, when,

521
00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:41.860
when I'm arguing with somebody, if you come to me and you say,

522
00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:46.060
I think we should do this, you know, method B, I say,

523
00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.480
I don't say no cause I think we should do it meth today. That's what I think.

524
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:50.890
And you think we should do it? Method B, you're going to be,

525
00:30:50.891 --> 00:30:53.190
I think we should do this. Method B, I think you're wrong. You know,

526
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.180
you know what I say? Okay, well I think you've got some good points on method B.

527
00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.320
Oh, all of a sudden, you know,

528
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.170
all of a sudden we're in a totally different scenario.

529
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:07.090
I just totally flipped the script on you and I, you know what I'm saying?

530
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.310
As I said, you don't, there's some good points that you have.

531
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.350
If you watch people debate,

532
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.310
if it's really a little slick move,

533
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.810
but you don't see politicians do it because they're so dug in,

534
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.970
they can never think they're wrong and they can never,

535
00:31:21.971 --> 00:31:24.190
and then what they also are afraid of, they're afraid.

536
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.390
If they admit they're wrong about something, they'll look bad.

537
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.430
Whereas if they said, you know what, that's a good point.

538
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.100
That's actually a good point. I'm going to need consider that.

539
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.040
I've never really thought of that viewpoint before. You know what,

540
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.860
I'm going to assess that. But I guys I think you got, I got,

541
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.720
I think there's some validity to what you just said.

542
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:43.930
When's the last time you heard a politician say that? I don't. Yeah, I'll never,

543
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:47.860
I don't think. And then what happens is, and in this day and age, the,

544
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:52.750
the supporters of that politician, they, they don't, they don't,

545
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.570
they don't recognize the valid point either. It's just

546
00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.450
oh yeah.

547
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:03.400
So we get people that aren't thinking end to end and it's very hard to hold

548
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.790
dichotomies in your head that this can be right. And that can be right.

549
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.100
There's an aggressive approach and there's a non aggressive approach.

550
00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.130
There's a direct approach and there's an indirect approach and both of them can

551
00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:16.240
be functional. It's really hard to get, get a grip on that.

552
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:22.030
And yet it's the answer to so many questions. It's the answer to the person,

553
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:27.280
this subordinate that comes to you and says, we should not be doing it this way.

554
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.440
If your reaction isn't too diametrically opposed what they're saying.

555
00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:35.800
But instead to actually take their side and say, oh,

556
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.780
I agree with you've got some really good points.

557
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.830
Let's see how this would play out.

558
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.870
<v 1>Talk me through it. Look, you can't even know. You're like, wow. You know,</v>

559
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.320
you know, it's like, it's like an, it's like an, it's like a move.

560
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.370
It's like a Jujitsu move. Yeah. And it works. Yeah.

561
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.150
So there, there are some things I've changed, changed my mind on about

562
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.970
my mind is opened though. Yeah. I will change my mind if,

563
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.780
if new evidence presents itself, I'll change my mind in a heartbeat.

564
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:14.030
Let's do it. Present me with new evidence. What about like,

565
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:19.310
um, well I would think anyway after kind of thinking about it where, yeah,

566
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:22.940
you, I think, I think generally speaking, we do kind of respect someone who can,

567
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.590
who can change their mind and we all see it once people's digging into their

568
00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:29.420
opinion, you know, and saying all kinds of weird,

569
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:33.250
wacky stuff to try to defend yourself themselves and you're like, don't worry,

570
00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.720
we're talking about kind of thing. You see it as clear.

571
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:40.000
So like it seems obvious like, yeah, you should change your mind when,

572
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:43.130
or at least open up your mind in, in that, like how you said, um, hey,

573
00:33:43.131 --> 00:33:46.400
I'll give that some consideration. I'll look into it. And if you're right,

574
00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:49.340
shoot, I think you're right. I think that's a better way to do it or whatever,

575
00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:51.740
whatever the case is. But the,

576
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:56.030
and then I guess technically there's a dichotomy to where you can't do that too

577
00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:59.510
much because if you're always changing your mind with like, you know, like,

578
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.140
like a, I don't know, we'll say up a politician. Yeah.

579
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.570
Every time the opposing view or some other view comes in and you're like, Dang,

580
00:34:05.571 --> 00:34:08.680
I didn't look at it like that or I didn't. Maybe I'll look back in there.

581
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.690
We're looking to that more. We'll do it again and again and again. It's like,

582
00:34:11.691 --> 00:34:15.430
Brad, does this guy know anything? Cause guess what you're talking about what?

583
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.650
There's a dichotomy. Yeah. That's what Andy,

584
00:34:17.651 --> 00:34:21.200
if you go too far and you change your opinion all the time and then you become

585
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:23.990
indecisive and so that doesn't work if you're,

586
00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:27.260
so if you're the other side of the spectrum and you're completely dug in and you

587
00:34:27.261 --> 00:34:29.840
never change your mind, that doesn't work either. Where do you need to do?

588
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.940
What do you need to do? You need to balance the dichotomies,

589
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:34.550
the dichotomies between being flexible and inflexible.

590
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.140
If you become ultra flexible where you're just going with whatever at anyone

591
00:34:38.141 --> 00:34:41.750
saying that's not good. Yeah. You need to find the middle ground.

592
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.730
That's what the dichotomy of leadership is. Yeah.

593
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:46.850
But it's hard for people to comprehend that.

594
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:52.300
It's hard for people to see that where they draw that line.

595
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.370
Yes. That gives, they think, well you know, I,

596
00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:59.900
I'll never changed my opinion on this. Okay. You just told me where you stand.

597
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:01.760
Yeah. I'm not sure I liked that very much.

598
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.890
Cause new new information can come to light. Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

599
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:10.430
Yeah. That's a where the, where they stand right in that dichotomy or whatever.

600
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.820
Cause I think part of, part of it, um, and it's part of it is like yeah,

601
00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:15.440
they don't want to be wishy washy, you know,

602
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.700
but the other part or the other part of that is I'm saying if they always change

603
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.860
their mind, if they're so easily to be like, oh okay,

604
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:24.520
maybe we'll do it your way. Whatever flipper. Yeah. It,

605
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.320
I think they come off like they don't know anything for sure. Like to the soil.

606
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.480
If you don't know anything, she'd even be in that position.

607
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.390
Like I don't want you to be the congressman if you're,

608
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:36.050
if you don't know anything kind of thing. Right. That's the feeling. So,

609
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.040
and now with that,

610
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.920
<v 0>that's the feeling that people are trying to avoid when they dig in.</v>

611
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.060
They don't want to admit they're wrong.

612
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.520
Cause if I admit I'm wrong and that means for what I didn't know, you know,

613
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.500
kind of thing. So it's like no bro, you don't,

614
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.680
you don't draw the line right there. You draw, draw the line,

615
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:52.710
couple of steps down the road. Yeah. Be Open a little bit yourself.

616
00:35:52.711 --> 00:35:57.480
Some room to maneuver. Yeah. Yeah. Again, room to maneuver.

617
00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:58.973
Next question.

618
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:05.580
How does one detach when getting personally attacked and take extreme ownership

619
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:07.050
with false claims?

620
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.090
And what does one do once when a subordinate always goes above the chain of

621
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:16.200
command instead of working out issues with the coworker? Okay.

622
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.930
This isn't the clearest question that I've ever received.

623
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.660
I'm going to try and I'm not sure if I completely understand it,

624
00:36:21.661 --> 00:36:25.200
but I'm going to try and sort of answered to the best of my ability. Um,

625
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.640
I think what we're talking about here is that someone is telling me that

626
00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:34.440
something is my fault and that is a false claim. Is that,

627
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:35.340
that's the question, right?

628
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.720
I think you're making a false claim and say like this is your responsibility.

629
00:36:39.721 --> 00:36:44.070
Jocko. You were supposed to press record. Right? And it's false.

630
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.670
Cause I wasn't supposed to press record. Yeah.

631
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:52.310
Let's say or maybe like record was pressed like there's no issue,

632
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.970
you know. Well then why would, why would he,

633
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:01.020
why would that become a personal attack? Yeah. Yeah I guess so.

634
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.850
The personal attack is chocolate. You didn't press record. Yeah.

635
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.580
And now the question is what do I do them cause cause we both know who's in

636
00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:12.960
charge of pressing record here. Yeah. Who is me. Okay.

637
00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:16.460
So you're in charge of pressing record. If you all of a sudden we,

638
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.730
we are 40 minutes into,

639
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.830
into a podcast and we haven't pressed record to record has button has been

640
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:27.150
pressed and all of a sudden it comes to light and you say chocolate,

641
00:37:27.151 --> 00:37:30.990
you didn't press record right now what this person is saying,

642
00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:34.710
that's a false claim. Gotcha. That's not my responsibility.

643
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:37.650
It's truly not my responsibility and I'm not going to actually,

644
00:37:37.651 --> 00:37:40.680
I should I be doing that. Yeah. And you know what I'm going to say,

645
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:43.830
you know what I'm going to say yes sir. I do. Which is, you know what,

646
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:47.580
it is my responsibility because I'm here. It's primarily my voice.

647
00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:51.300
That's being recorded and from now on I will make sure that that gets recorded.

648
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.810
It's my fault. I will take care of it from now on. By the way. Now,

649
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:59.670
what is your job responsibilities in this whole podcast? Nothing.

650
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:04.410
You have nothing to do. If you're not pressing record, you're not nothing to do.

651
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.040
So how does that feel? Yeah, it doesn't feel good. It doesn't feel good.

652
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.770
You don't like that. But when I take away that responsibility,

653
00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:13.320
you're actually gonna come and claw it back from me. You're going to say,

654
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.220
you know what? Actually, you know it was your fault when that happened,

655
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.170
but you know what? From now on, since you screwed it up,

656
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.950
I'm going to take ownership of it. And you know what I say? I said cool.

657
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.240
That's awesome. Yeah. Good point.

658
00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:27.030
Since you are over there with the recorder and since you're a technical guy and

659
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:29.640
I'm not, that makes a lot of sense. Why don't we go with that from now on?

660
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.500
You own it. I shouldn't have dropped the ball last time. You know?

661
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.910
So that's that. There we go. I own it. I fix it. If, by the way,

662
00:38:39.911 --> 00:38:42.520
if you don't want responsibility back, if you just say, cool, yeah,

663
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:46.270
you press record from now on. Okay, cool. I will. Yeah. And then guess what?

664
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:49.220
I'll start thinking about how much I need you around here. Yeah.

665
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:54.190
Cause really what else do you bring to the table in those buildings? All right,

666
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:57.410
so that's question number one. Uh,

667
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.660
the question number two, as far as detaching, sorry, I don't get emotional.

668
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:02.913
That's

669
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.980
if someone is blaming me, if someone is blaming me,

670
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:10.300
if you start blaming me or something,

671
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.010
I actually look at that right out of the gate.

672
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.980
I see that as a psychological victory for me because?

673
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:18.400
Because you're blaming me like you're blaming, you're not taking ownership.

674
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:21.190
I already won. I already won. So there's no,

675
00:39:21.191 --> 00:39:22.450
I'm not getting emotional about that.

676
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:26.800
That's they're blaming me because they don't have the,

677
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.440
the wherewithal to actually take ownership themselves.

678
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.660
I see that as a weakness of theirs and I'm fine with it and that,

679
00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.360
that's why I don't, I'm not going to,

680
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.090
I don't need to get emotional because I'm sitting there going, wow,

681
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:38.950
this person just served me up on a silver platter.

682
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:41.710
The fact that they don't want to take all the, their going to give it to me.

683
00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.800
Are you kidding me? I'll take this all day long. Another thing is,

684
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:48.520
and I've said this before, I can't be respect.

685
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:51.560
I can't be disrespected by someone that doesn't even respect themselves. Yeah.

686
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.613
You know what I'm saying?

687
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:58.150
You can't disrespect me if you don't even respect yourself if you're just,

688
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.120
you know, like a bum in the street is where the, where the thing came from.

689
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.460
You know, someone that's just, uh, you know,

690
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:08.320
a drunk bum laying in his own vomit and wants to, you know,

691
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:12.670
look at me and see you Luke Luke dirt bag.

692
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.740
It's like, okay dude. Yeah,

693
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.980
carry on with your day that you're not going to affect me.

694
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:19.870
So how in the same vein,

695
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:24.820
if how can I be disrespected by you when you tell me you and you blame me for

696
00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:27.310
something when I realize what's happening right now is you don't even have

697
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:31.150
enough respect for yourself to take ownership of something. This is just a whim.

698
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:38.110
So that's the second part of it and I think the third part of the question is a

699
00:40:38.111 --> 00:40:42.310
subordinate that that goes up the chain of command instead of working for

700
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.250
working out the issues with the coworker. That's pretty, pretty easy.

701
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:47.170
I'm not going to solve those problems for you. Oh,

702
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.220
you've got a problem down in the chain of command with your coworker, your peer,

703
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.600
and you guys aren't working it out and you want me to solve your problem? No,

704
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.810
you go figure it out and come back to me with a solution and now I'll do that a

705
00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:00.940
couple times. If eventually they can't come up with a solution,

706
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:02.230
guess what I have, I have a problem,

707
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:06.160
I have a real problem and I will solve it and they're not going to like my

708
00:41:06.161 --> 00:41:08.710
solution because it probably involves them. Neither one of them being there,

709
00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.460
any more extreme case. But what I will do is I say, okay,

710
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:15.910
come and read me the facts. You really want me to make a decision about this.

711
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.530
Cool. I'll do it. But I always felt horrible. In fact,

712
00:41:20.531 --> 00:41:24.370
I don't even know if I ever did this going to my boss to make a decision about

713
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.980
something that I should have agreed with my peer, because you know what,

714
00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:29.440
I'd rather just, for me, I'd rather just say, Hey, you know what?

715
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.040
You want to do it your way. Eko, fun. You, let's go with it. It's close enough.

716
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.940
<v 1>You, Oh, you want to take the lead? Cool. You take the lead, I'll support you.</v>

717
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:40.070
No problem. That's what I'm here for. I want the team to win.

718
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.640
I know you're concerned about you add a note and that's fine. That's fine.

719
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.080
I'm here for the team, so let's do it your way so that it works out. Yeah.

720
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:53.750
Not going to my boss and complaining. That's just ridiculous. And then that's,

721
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:56.270
that's another one where I fit in.

722
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.210
I don't think I've ever been in a corporate scenario,

723
00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:04.211
but it seems like that that's easy to see.

724
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:07.790
And other people, you know, like where, you know how like a situation where,

725
00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.880
yeah, let me late, let my subordinate take lead.

726
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.670
It seems like that could be a solid,

727
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:18.560
almost obvious answer for people except myself. You know, like I, I don't,

728
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.200
I don't always point that in where, you know,

729
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:23.270
I'm sure there's like people out there where it's like, oh,

730
00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.130
that this will solve probably a lot of your problems.

731
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.350
Just look at it this way and do it and do that, you know, let,

732
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.800
let one of your subordinates like take lead on this stuff.

733
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:36.380
And I would predict as far as that goes,

734
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:41.690
that most people would be pretty surprised. Like, Oh yeah, I guess I should.

735
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:46.210
I should do that. Yeah. You know, at this point. So you're saying that's a,

736
00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.190
it's a pretty obvious solution once you hear it. Yeah.

737
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.920
But you're also saying that it's a difficult solution to actually execute

738
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.800
because most people put in the situation, don't remember it. Yeah.

739
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:56.450
They don't remember the pointed inwards.

740
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.510
Even like literally you could be getting this advice.

741
00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:02.970
Like right now it can be getting this advice, but hey, hey chocolate,

742
00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.950
that sounds like good advice.

743
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:07.460
And then they'll go like back to work and it applies to it for someone else.

744
00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:10.770
You know, it's like you don't realize it like, man, I should do that. You know,

745
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:14.560
kind of thing. Yeah. That's the trouble with learning flirty.

746
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.620
Less trouble with learning. Cause it's hard to apply it yourself. Yeah.

747
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:21.710
Once again, it's like Jujitsu. You can watch,

748
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:26.360
I can show you how to do it and then you can watch me do it and then I can move

749
00:43:26.361 --> 00:43:28.970
your limbs around so that you do it. And then we do a,

750
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:34.280
a drill where we drilled a move 20 times and then you get into a competition and

751
00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:39.050
the move is there and you don't execute or you don't execute correctly.

752
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:43.130
Cause you haven't done it enough. You have to do the move.

753
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:48.840
You've gotta do the Moon, you gotta do the move. Next question.

754
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:53.330
So I'm watching deadliest catch.

755
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:58.350
The fishing show weight. Crab crabs, right? Grabbing,

756
00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:03.020
grabbing show. Yeah. Alaskan crabs respect.

757
00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:08.021
So I'm watching deadliest catch and a deckhand wasn't paying attention and let

758
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:11.060
too many small crabs into the tank.

759
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.750
This is big trouble for the captain.

760
00:44:15.751 --> 00:44:20.090
So the kid admits his mistake and apologizes. Captain, you're fired.

761
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.100
I've watched you screw up for years. What's the message here? Yes sir.

762
00:44:25.101 --> 00:44:28.760
It's the captain that fires sees the mistake and says the captain says you're

763
00:44:28.761 --> 00:44:32.190
fired. Okay, Gotcha. Okay. Okay, so this

764
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.070
<v 0>is, this is just tells me a couple of things. This tells me a few things.</v>

765
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:37.680
This tells me a lot of things, right? First of all,

766
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.390
the boss watched the deck hand screw up for years.

767
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.470
[inaudible] my assumption is that he didn't say anything.

768
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.900
You watched someone screw up for years.

769
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.200
How is the deckhand going to improve if he doesn't get counseled on what his

770
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:58.530
shortfalls are? Okay, so that's one that that could've happened, right?

771
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.840
That's one assumption. Let's make the other assumption.

772
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:02.820
The other assumption is that the,

773
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.210
the captain did counsel the deck hand and watch him screwed up for years and

774
00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:07.980
told him, you better not do that. You better not do that.

775
00:45:07.981 --> 00:45:11.220
You better not do that. And he's now done it again. And guess what?

776
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.450
He's getting fired.

777
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:14.223
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

778
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.790
<v 0>so, so that, that's understandable.</v>

779
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:21.780
So I think the question is implying kind of like,

780
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.340
uh, you know, hey yo, hey boss, this was my fault.

781
00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:30.240
I shouldn't have let that happen. And now the boss can say, oh, well,

782
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.870
since you're taking ownership of that, that's no problem. We'll let it go.

783
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.920
That's doesn't happen. So, so if you have a,

784
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.370
if you have a concept in your brain that you think that when you,

785
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:45.720
when you take ownership for something that you're immune then from the

786
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:48.510
punishment of the mistake you've made, that's not true.

787
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.250
That's absolutely not true.

788
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.640
Taking ownership of a mistake does not relieve you of responsibility of that

789
00:45:57.871 --> 00:46:02.610
mistake. In fact, the opposite of true, when you take ownership of a mistake,

790
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:07.020
you're taking ownership of the mistake and you are raising your hand and saying,

791
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.340
I own the mistake. And if there's punishment to be made it out,

792
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.590
it needs to land on me.

793
00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.153
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

794
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.740
<v 0>That's what ownership is. Ownership is not a get out of jail free card. Yeah.</v>

795
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:25.640
You know what? It's my fault. You know, we joke about this is my bust. Hey,

796
00:46:25.641 --> 00:46:29.600
my bust on that one little won't happen again. So now everyone just ignores it.

797
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.660
No, this is a serious violation.

798
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:36.890
Having the wrong sized crabs is the kind of thing that gets you rolled up by the

799
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:40.340
fish and game department and all of a sudden you're getting shot down.

800
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.960
It's a serious business.

801
00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.070
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more are at

802
00:46:46.071 --> 00:46:49.250
stake here. And this kid isn't doing his job correctly.

803
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.740
So either the boss, the captain had mentored him and was fed up,

804
00:46:54.741 --> 00:46:57.350
which, which it makes him a good boss.

805
00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.350
And this was his last warning and he failed his last warning and there you go.

806
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.200
Hey, I've been watching you screw up. I told you, you screwed up.

807
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:04.730
I've written you up about screwing up.

808
00:47:04.731 --> 00:47:06.980
And I told you not to let this happen again and you just let it happen again.

809
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.843
You're fired.

810
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:13.160
Or maybe the boss wasn't that squared away and he hadn't counseled him.

811
00:47:13.161 --> 00:47:17.450
He hadn't had the hard conversations early with him to square them away and now,

812
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:17.751
yeah,

813
00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:21.650
the boss leaves something to be desired because he's just the first defense he's

814
00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:23.570
that he talks to him about is, hey, you're fired.

815
00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:30.880
When I took ownership of the blue on eight extra note in extreme ownership,

816
00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:34.720
first chapter, I could have been fired for that. Yeah, I could have been fired.

817
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.690
My boss could have said, yeah, yeah, you're right. This is your fault.

818
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:41.110
We can't have that happen out here. You're fired. And I, you know, and I said,

819
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:45.940
Roger, that it's not, hey, I own this.

820
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.680
Please let me go. Yeah, I took, now here, I will say this though,

821
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:58.000
if so, so taking extreme ownership is not a get out of jail free card.

822
00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.700
But I will tell you this, if you make excuses,

823
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:04.720
it is going to be worst in 99% of the situations.

824
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:09.760
Well, you know, the small crabs snuck in when I wasn't looking.

825
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:14.650
That's not my fault. Tactical crabs on the move. Right?

826
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.100
Then you just look like an idiot. Right.

827
00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:23.850
So then another thing that this brings up is this idea of preemptive ownership.

828
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.200
And that is taking own, if you take ownership of something, you don't,

829
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:32.680
you don't want to take ownership after the fact.

830
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:34.810
Extreme ownership,

831
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.840
the idea of extreme ownership in its purest and most effective form isn't,

832
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.090
hey, something went wrong and I'm now taking ownership with a mistake.

833
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.440
That's not the, that's not the best extreme ownership scenario.

834
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.700
The best extreme ownership scenario is when you take ownership prior to the

835
00:48:51.701 --> 00:48:54.540
mistake happening and you realize that if the,

836
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.690
if there is going to be a mistake, you are going to own it.

837
00:48:58.691 --> 00:49:02.140
So what you're gonna do is you're going to work hard to prevent that mistake

838
00:49:02.141 --> 00:49:05.080
from happening. That's preemptive ownership.

839
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.740
You're taking ownership before the mistake happens. So this kid,

840
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:11.830
this deckhand could have dumped,

841
00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:15.490
put procedures in place to make sure no small crabs got in and sorted them out

842
00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:19.260
properly. But instead he thought, oh, you don't want it to be no big deal.

843
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.270
I'll just take ownership. And then they'll say it's okay or you know,

844
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.790
I'll blame someone else or whatever. His thinking in his brain. If he says,

845
00:49:24.791 --> 00:49:27.400
look, if I let small crabs in here,

846
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:31.750
I am going to own it and I am going to get fired. Guess what?

847
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:35.920
Perhaps he would have worked a little harder to prevent these small crabs from

848
00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:39.970
being where they weren't supposed to be. But see,

849
00:49:39.971 --> 00:49:42.390
when you have that out, when you think you can just blame someone else,

850
00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:47.350
you know that allows you to be slack when you think, well,

851
00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:48.970
you know, this isn't really my responsibility.

852
00:49:48.971 --> 00:49:52.690
That's why when I work with companies and they'll have some thing that's going

853
00:49:52.691 --> 00:49:55.990
wrong, some problem, some procedure that's not working correctly,

854
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.120
some timeline that's not being met.

855
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:03.190
And one of the first questions I ask at it normally like a huge step in the

856
00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:06.970
right direction to re to resolve the problem is I go, okay,

857
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:08.530
who's in charge of that process?

858
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.940
And a bunch of people will be looking around at each other and no one's raising

859
00:50:12.941 --> 00:50:17.260
their hand. And the minute I see that, I go, hmm, interesting. This is,

860
00:50:17.261 --> 00:50:18.310
this is the answer to me.

861
00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:21.610
Now we know why the process is ineffective because no one has ownership of it

862
00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.250
and if no one has ownership of it and the thing doesn't get done when it's

863
00:50:24.251 --> 00:50:26.040
supposed to get done. Everyone just points at each other and says, yeah,

864
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:27.500
well it wasn't my fault was his fault.

865
00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:30.800
It was their fault and then no one takes ownership of known. Solves it. Yeah.

866
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:35.000
Whereas if you say, okay, echo, you are in charge of this process.

867
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.320
If it doesn't work, I'm coming after you. You know?

868
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:44.530
Now you can step up your game preemptively to prevent a mistake from occurring.

869
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.340
Prevent the little crabs from getting in the pot. Yeah,

870
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.430
so taking ownership isn't just get out of jail free card.

871
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:55.700
If you have a subordinate,

872
00:50:55.701 --> 00:51:00.020
you are actually responsible for counseling them and coaching them and mentoring

873
00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:03.770
them and explaining to them what the standards are so that they can meet the

874
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:04.221
standards.

875
00:51:04.221 --> 00:51:07.490
Explaining explicitly what the standards are so that they can meet those

876
00:51:07.491 --> 00:51:08.324
standards

877
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:14.590
and the optimal ownership takes place not only after,

878
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.980
but more importantly before something goes wrong.

879
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.673
There you go.

880
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:30.440
Not to mention you got to take responsibility for solving the problem. Yes,

881
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:35.210
you do. Which apparently this deckhand guy has not. Yeah, he didn't take,

882
00:51:35.211 --> 00:51:36.410
he took ownership for the mistake.

883
00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:38.480
He didn't take ownership for the resolving the problem.

884
00:51:38.481 --> 00:51:41.420
He also didn't implement us a solution to the problem.

885
00:51:41.421 --> 00:51:46.400
There's all kinds of problems by the way. Yeah. So there you go. Next question.

886
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:51.140
What mistakes did you make early discussed in your live podcast that could have

887
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:54.440
progressed you further? Hmm. Yeah,

888
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:58.070
I think there's just some real big obvious ones. Wasted a bunch of time.

889
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.940
You know, you wasted a bunch of time when you're young,

890
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.910
you think you got forever and you waste time.

891
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:08.720
And whether it's doing stuff that's not productive,

892
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.300
whether it's going out,

893
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.580
getting drunk or whatever dumb things you waste time doing, whether it's just,

894
00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:19.130
just wasting time and, and you know what? Look,

895
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:23.300
I'm not saying don't have fun in your life because that's wrong answer to.

896
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:25.960
That's too extreme. But what I am saying is I,

897
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.770
I sometimes I had a little too much fun.

898
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.010
Sometimes I wasn't focused on the right thing. So wasted time is number one,

899
00:52:31.011 --> 00:52:33.710
wasted money, wasted a ton of money on dumb stuff.

900
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:39.800
And I'd say that both of these are wasting time, wasting money.

901
00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:42.680
Those are like the two biggest mistakes that I've made.

902
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:49.600
But I would say that the root of those mistakes is that I didn't do a good job

903
00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:54.350
of connecting the future to the present. Right.

904
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:55.970
You just don't when you're young.

905
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.410
I shouldn't say that when I was young because I don't want to put a universal

906
00:53:00.411 --> 00:53:03.110
blanket of being dumb on everyone,

907
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:07.520
even though you're nodding your head pretty heartily over there because that's

908
00:53:07.521 --> 00:53:11.480
probably, yeah, we see a lot of people do this, right? A lot of us,

909
00:53:11.481 --> 00:53:12.350
we waste our time,

910
00:53:12.351 --> 00:53:15.890
we waste our money and we don't connect what we're doing right now with what's

911
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.800
going to happen in the future and that is not a good policy to have.

912
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:23.300
What we want to do and what I try and instill with kids, with my kids, with,

913
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:28.510
with kids that I talk on the podcast because I want to connect what decisions

914
00:53:29.011 --> 00:53:31.800
are being made right now with decisions that with the,

915
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.850
with the end state that you end up with in your future.

916
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:38.550
So if you take advantage of your time,

917
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:41.280
you're going to be in a much better place. If you, if you save your money,

918
00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:43.500
you're going to be in a much better place. If you invest your money properly,

919
00:53:43.501 --> 00:53:46.470
you're going to be a much better place. If you train and you treat people,

920
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.270
if you train hard, you're going to be in a much better place.

921
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.880
If you treat people respectfully and you build relationships,

922
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:54.930
you're going be in a much better place. If you do the opposite of those things,

923
00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:56.970
you're going to be in a worse place. If you treat people like dirt,

924
00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.730
you're going to, it'll come back to bite you. If you waste your money,

925
00:53:59.731 --> 00:54:01.980
you won't have it. If you waste your time, you'll run out.

926
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:07.970
So I think the biggest mistake really for me was that I failed to connect the

927
00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:12.240
present to the future.

928
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:16.890
The only ways that I succeeded in that early on was through luck.

929
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:23.010
Like I joined the navy and, and, and I'm very lucky that I did,

930
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.370
cause I was immediately building my future even though I had no idea.

931
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:28.320
It wasn't my intent. I was immediately,

932
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:33.560
I bought a house that was a great, what I wanted.

933
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:37.170
What did I buy it for? I wanted a place to live. What did I end up with?

934
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.920
An incredible investment, uh, enough to buy another house.

935
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.010
That one was a little bit more intentional. Oh, okay. Wait a second.

936
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.800
If I owned another house,

937
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:49.950
and I was just talking about this with a friend of mine who was like that,

938
00:54:49.951 --> 00:54:51.000
I was explaining when,

939
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:56.660
and he remembered when I got my second house and I was like,

940
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.900
in my mind, Donald J. Trump,

941
00:55:00.901 --> 00:55:05.430
the real estate landlord like master, right?

942
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.020
Someone was going to be paying me rent, you know, and,

943
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:14.460
and I had another house that I was going to live in. So that was, uh,

944
00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:18.240
that was what I started making this shift where I connected the present with the

945
00:55:18.241 --> 00:55:20.640
future. Yeah.

946
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:24.060
So what you do today is directly correlated to where you'll end up in the

947
00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:24.670
future.

948
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:29.670
That is in echo's favorite sort of thread of this entire podcast is playing the

949
00:55:31.771 --> 00:55:34.920
long war and it took me too long to start fighting the long war.

950
00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:39.440
That's what I'll say that that will say the biggest mistakes from my early

951
00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.990
<v 3>yeah. And really in a way it, I mean it could be,</v>

952
00:55:43.991 --> 00:55:46.480
it could be viewed as not even really mistakes.

953
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:51.700
I guess this is more of just sort of, that's the way things happen.

954
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Cause B most times we figured these things out later in life be when the long

955
00:55:57.611 --> 00:56:00.700
game starts to materialize. Because when you're early in your career,

956
00:56:00.701 --> 00:56:04.240
the only the short game is sorta there and then in a way,

957
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.690
and actually know at the end of the day, no, because even as a little kid,

958
00:56:07.691 --> 00:56:10.390
you know, the long game, you're familiar with it a little bit.

959
00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:14.490
Cause like you ever had an ear out to save your money for something like a

960
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.860
optimist prize toy, you know, something like that.

961
00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:21.700
And they said you gotta save your money for it and you grow,

962
00:56:21.701 --> 00:56:23.980
you save your money. You know, that's playing the long game.

963
00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.340
<v 1>Yep. As a kid, you know the kid version. So it's kind of the same thing,</v>

964
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:30.910
but maybe it's not as intuitive. You know, when you're little, when you're big,

965
00:56:30.911 --> 00:56:35.790
when you're grown. [inaudible] difference. It's the other thing,

966
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:39.340
other weird thing is like someone has to tell you,

967
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.170
but like we just talked about,

968
00:56:41.171 --> 00:56:44.520
sometimes when people tell you you still just don't listen to them. Yeah.

969
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.190
You know, people say, hey, you should really do this. And you go, yeah,

970
00:56:48.191 --> 00:56:51.790
whatever. That's for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's for you.

971
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.200
One of my,

972
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:58.950
one of my uncles friends won the lottery years ago,

973
00:56:59.621 --> 00:57:04.621
like in the 70s and he won one of those big lotteries where he got money every

974
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:11.290
year. You know, you could take the lumps on or you could take the payments,

975
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:15.340
the payments. He took the payments. Yeah. Well won the lottery. Right.

976
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:20.500
Literally won the lottery, won the lottery. And so the payments lasted 20 years.

977
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.390
Well, when you're 22 that's, that's forever. Yeah, right.

978
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.350
That's forever. Yeah.

979
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:30.850
And so my dad was talking to him,

980
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:35.500
talking to the guy that won the lottery and now he was at like the 19 year mark.

981
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.820
And guess what he had done with all this money, spent it,

982
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:42.040
and he invested in real estate. Did he buy start companies?

983
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.650
What do you think he did with this money? Spent it. Yeah,

984
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:49.540
he bought car and whatever that tends to Rosen, you know,

985
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:50.470
or whatever,

986
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:54.730
dated girls and went to bars and went out for nice dinners and did that for a

987
00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:59.260
long time. And so my, my dad says, Hey, you know,

988
00:57:59.261 --> 00:58:01.920
they're talking about it. He says, well, you know, my, you know,

989
00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:05.320
this is the last year that I'm getting my monthly payments for winning the

990
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:07.330
lottery. And my dad says,

991
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:11.590
what are you gonna what are you going to do when the payments aren't coming in

992
00:58:11.591 --> 00:58:14.530
anymore? And he says, I'm going to win again.

993
00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.690
So yeah, that's planning in a sense. We all kind of,

994
00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:28.180
and the, no, it's not tough man. That's one.

995
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:32.890
But that tends to go like that for lottery winners.

996
00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:37.630
Yeah. Apparently the lottery winning isn't a big like happiness. No,

997
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:41.860
it's bad. Yeah. Ends up being bad because life is a long,

998
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:44.440
long game and no matter how you play it,

999
00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:47.770
the long game is the one that shakes out, you know?

1000
00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:49.960
So if you're over here playing the short game, that's,

1001
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:53.200
that's why you lose in life. If you play the short game all the time.

1002
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.830
And the people who play the long game, they just, all you gotta do is play it.

1003
00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.770
You don't even have to dominate it. Although I'm not recommending,

1004
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.400
not trying to dominate, I'm not saying trying to necessarily have to,

1005
00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.860
you can come in shoot second to the last place, but if you're playing the game,

1006
00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.480
you're going to be doing good in the long. When you,

1007
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:12.310
when you come in second to last place in the long game,

1008
00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:17.140
you still just beat every single other person that's playing the short game.

1009
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.390
You beat them all. Yeah. And it's not,

1010
00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.070
and they're over there looking around like what happened? Yeah. How is

1011
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.400
<v 0>who you're so squared away. Yeah.</v>

1012
00:59:25.401 --> 00:59:29.710
But it's not that complicated, you know? I mean, it's not easy. It's not easy.

1013
00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:31.850
You're wired to play the show to go deep on this,

1014
00:59:31.851 --> 00:59:35.990
on that last warrior kid podcast. Yeah. Oh yeah. The, this death. Yes.

1015
00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:41.090
You had a need to get over the short term gratification. Yeah. And that is the,

1016
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:46.150
one of the biggest lessons a kid can learn is that my actions today will affect

1017
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:50.810
my future. Yeah. And it's hard to convince them of that.

1018
00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.970
It seems so distant.

1019
00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:56.900
Like the future seems so distant when you're young.

1020
00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:01.040
I was having another discussion with someone the other day, a parent,

1021
01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.600
and there was a level of frustration that,

1022
01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:09.560
and it's the typical level of frustration from the parent, which was, you know,

1023
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.150
the kid has a lot of potential,

1024
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.870
but they're like natal not training the way they should be and not working the

1025
01:00:14.871 --> 01:00:16.130
way you know all that, all that stuff.

1026
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:22.450
And what I tried to explain to the parent was that the potential that you're

1027
01:00:23.421 --> 01:00:26.240
telling your kid that he has,

1028
01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.640
they do not even comprehend what that means. It is not a,

1029
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:35.630
it is not a, it's not something that they can understand.

1030
01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.930
It's completely intangible. Like even when you say, Oh,

1031
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:42.470
if you keep practicing this, you could be the champion.

1032
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:47.800
This means you might as well say, if you keep practicing this ebook, Bobby's,

1033
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.500
you'd be rubbing off on me. It means nothing to them.

1034
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:54.980
So that's what potential is to a little kid. A little kid doesn't understand it.

1035
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.220
Yeah. And so yes, you try and convince them, you try and explain it to them.

1036
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:03.200
But what I recommend is instead of trying to explain to them this massive

1037
01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:05.900
concept of what their potential is,

1038
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:11.000
you try and give them some short term rewards that lead them in the right

1039
01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:15.170
direction, that are, are supportive of the long game,

1040
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.220
but they're easier mental connections for the kid. And this,

1041
01:01:19.221 --> 01:01:22.250
the same thing applies to employees as well. Right? You know,

1042
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.010
or you get a young young employee that's, you know,

1043
01:01:25.011 --> 01:01:28.940
they're not thinking they could be the the regional manager, right.

1044
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:31.900
They're just thinking they're just happy to be here. Yeah, but you're,

1045
01:01:31.901 --> 01:01:35.000
you're looking at, I'm calling this, you know, this is sharp kid could be good.

1046
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:36.740
So you might not say, look,

1047
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:41.030
one day you're going to be the regional manager in 22 years. Think about that.

1048
01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.320
When you, somebody gets hired on as whatever and you say one day you're,

1049
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:49.430
you can be the regional manager and you could make whatever this big chunk of

1050
01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:51.890
money they're looking at. You Go, who mode are going to be here? You know,

1051
01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.100
about Bumblebee, you'd have this job, particular whatever.

1052
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:57.260
So what you want to do is just tie something a little bit closer to them,

1053
01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.800
to their reality of, hey, here's where you could get,

1054
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:04.040
here's why the bonus program works here. Have you seen this?

1055
01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:05.550
You can make an extra whatever. Yeah.

1056
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.090
And it's going to move them in the right direction, the long game,

1057
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:12.980
but they can comprehend it immediately. That's my recommendation. Shoot.

1058
01:02:12.981 --> 01:02:17.030
Even just compliments and encouragement are good.

1059
01:02:17.031 --> 01:02:20.010
Little micro rewards for those short term likes.

1060
01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.600
<v 1>Phil [inaudible], my kids, once again, we can't abuse them. Yeah. Can Abuse,</v>

1061
01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:29.190
you know, friendliness with our children. We can, we can't abuse that.

1062
01:02:29.191 --> 01:02:33.660
Maybe that's not the right word. Right. We can't abuse cheerleading. Yeah,

1063
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.050
right. We can abused cheerleading with our kids in everything that they do is

1064
01:02:37.051 --> 01:02:38.760
beautiful, right? Yeah. No,

1065
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:43.620
that's this beautiful piece of art that you just created. What is it

1066
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.540
beautiful and everyone is no. Yes sir. It's like,

1067
01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:53.370
that's not good. Yeah, that's not good.

1068
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:56.100
But you're just talking about abusing. The other thing is the other thing,

1069
01:02:56.101 --> 01:02:59.250
you have to be careful with this. You know, you're telling your kid like, well,

1070
01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:03.720
you know, you're special or you're,

1071
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:08.730
you're so perfect, you know? Yeah. And so, you know, yeah.

1072
01:03:08.731 --> 01:03:12.060
So this can get better. Yeah. I get your marginal

1073
01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:18.190
Zest Nova. No, that, yeah. And what I mean, encouragement in, in,

1074
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:21.150
in compliments. It's like if they do something good,

1075
01:03:21.151 --> 01:03:23.910
you compliment that good thing. That's essentially it. And yeah,

1076
01:03:23.911 --> 01:03:27.960
like anything you can throw out too many and you can throw out too little

1077
01:03:27.961 --> 01:03:29.360
really, because the, the, the,

1078
01:03:29.361 --> 01:03:32.940
the fulfillment or satisfaction of receiving that compliment isn't big enough

1079
01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:34.620
for the work that they just do and be like, man,

1080
01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:37.170
I don't want to do those 100 privately.

1081
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:40.260
My daughter do 90 burpees the other day.

1082
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:44.430
Why 90 did you just want to withhold? No, I'm worth a century.

1083
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:49.050
She didn't get to 90 and say, Hey dad, you do whatever you want.

1084
01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:52.380
I'm getting 10 more. Watch this. We're going to do a Hundo. Well,

1085
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:55.050
here's the thing, she's done that before, but not with 90.

1086
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:57.690
So I'm working her up and I started from like, I was like, hey,

1087
01:03:57.691 --> 01:04:00.540
when she was real as her time, I didn't time it.

1088
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:02.670
How are we going to recognize improvement?

1089
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.820
Cause we're going to get to the number first, then we go for time. Got It.

1090
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.370
So I mean that's the story. I mean it's not like, you know,

1091
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.940
my life's mission of course. It's just the fun little thing that I do.

1092
01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:16.260
But if sounds fun, wonderful, sure.

1093
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.810
But so if, if I'm like, hey, um, hey, you're super strong.

1094
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.660
They liked that. Or my kids like that when you call them strong.

1095
01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:28.210
So every time they do something like exercise or something like that and they,

1096
01:04:28.211 --> 01:04:30.540
they, they do a good workout or whatever,

1097
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:33.840
I'll say how strong they are or how strong they are looking or being or

1098
01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:34.674
whatever.

1099
01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:40.160
But if that feeling isn't enough to constitute that super hard,

1100
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.980
where like if I over push him like I 90 given where we are with burpees,

1101
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:47.580
with her, um, she's not ready.

1102
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:51.240
She wasn't ready for 90 at this time. Since she did she cry.

1103
01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:55.500
She know she didn't cry thankfully cause she'll cry. No shame. She'll cry.

1104
01:04:55.860 --> 01:05:00.330
I went for a run with my youngest daughter. This is a while ago.

1105
01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.690
I don't know how she old, she was at the time, but I was like, okay,

1106
01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:07.320
we're going to start running because I wanted to improve her mile time at the

1107
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:10.740
school. I said, okay, you want them prove that mile time I know how to do it.

1108
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:12.743
Here we go.

1109
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.980
So her mile time was weak and I said we can

1110
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.090
<v 0>get a better. So the first run we went on, I'm not kidding.</v>

1111
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.860
She, by the time we got one minute deep,

1112
01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:32.530
she had tears welling up in her eyes. Yeah. And and you know, I said,

1113
01:05:32.531 --> 01:05:36.880
hey, just keep going. But the, the, the point of saying,

1114
01:05:36.881 --> 01:05:39.010
this is my,

1115
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.490
when I try and give children,

1116
01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:44.770
especially my children or any children compliments,

1117
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.070
I try and compliment their hard work. Yeah.

1118
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.310
As opposed to you're strong or you're smart.

1119
01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:55.210
What I say is you really worked hard for that and look at this great result.

1120
01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:59.680
Because what it makes them realize is that great results come from hard work.

1121
01:05:59.681 --> 01:06:00.400
And guess what?

1122
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.780
That is the truth because we all know people that were incredibly smart,

1123
01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:07.690
incredibly strong, incredibly talented and incredibly gifted,

1124
01:06:07.691 --> 01:06:10.210
and they didn't do anything with any of those things because they didn't

1125
01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:13.510
understand that they had to work hard. Even if you have all that skill,

1126
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.300
if you don't work hard, you're not going to get anywhere. Dang,

1127
01:06:16.301 --> 01:06:16.991
that's a good little.

1128
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:21.991
So additional lean towards complementing the hard work and that's what you

1129
01:06:22.961 --> 01:06:25.930
really want to see. Let's face it. Let me ask you this,

1130
01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:27.490
and this is a tough question.

1131
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:33.450
Would you rather have someone on your team that is extremely talented or

1132
01:06:33.941 --> 01:06:37.990
extremely hard worker? You know, of course it's easy. We all want to say,

1133
01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:40.540
well I take the talent cause we can make the person work hard,

1134
01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:45.070
but that's actually not true. Yes, it seems. And the real talent,

1135
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:50.100
the best talent really is you get someone that just knows how to grind and work

1136
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:55.120
hard, like that's good and that's going to be much more valuable than,

1137
01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.660
hey, this person's super smart, or hey, this person super strong.

1138
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:02.380
Occasionally you get someone like GSP. Yeah.

1139
01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:09.090
George St Pierre who was way talented in multiple modalities and was a hard

1140
01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:15.840
worker. You know, that person becomes a world champion. Yeah.

1141
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.960
Sometimes you get a world champion that that's just there because of hard work.

1142
01:07:19.961 --> 01:07:22.210
Sometimes you get a world champion that's just there because of talent.

1143
01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:26.390
Occasionally you get someone that's both and they're usually sort of a stared

1144
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.820
more dominant, like a dominant chin. Yeah, that's true. And that's good.

1145
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.540
I started to compliment the hard work. Um, I,

1146
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:39.100
I personally like both. I liked the white, especially with my son,

1147
01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:42.760
like being strong and stuff. He really likes that, you know? So he'll,

1148
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:46.170
it's to the point where like if you help him do something, he'll get mad at you.

1149
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:48.430
Kind of get mad at. Yeah. Which I kinda like,

1150
01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:51.700
I don't know where that's going to lead, you know? But I liked that currently.

1151
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.180
Um, so he, he has that sense of pride, you know,

1152
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.850
we're being strong is a good thing. I know that's a little,

1153
01:07:57.851 --> 01:07:59.710
there's nothing wrong with that. So yeah. But man,

1154
01:07:59.711 --> 01:08:01.600
if you add the hard work part of it,

1155
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.820
because being strong as this essentially a result, you know,

1156
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:06.760
and he doesn't obviously too, yeah,

1157
01:08:06.761 --> 01:08:09.850
it's really going to be easy connection for you to make because it's hey you're

1158
01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:11.940
strong and that's because you work hard, you know,

1159
01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.340
because many of you say you're strong cause you got just, yeah, cool.

1160
01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:20.780
I'll just sit over here. [inaudible] what do you got?

1161
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:22.880
Yeah, it's true Ed. And when you,

1162
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:26.270
especially if you don't recognize the hard work part of it, you know,

1163
01:08:26.271 --> 01:08:29.420
and you just think you're as a kid, you'd just rolling around and strong.

1164
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.620
You're, you're basically, you,

1165
01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:34.700
you've reveled in the results for so long where it's now when it's hard work

1166
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:35.660
time, it's kind of like, wait,

1167
01:08:35.661 --> 01:08:38.270
I'm not used to that part of this where they say that can happen too.

1168
01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:43.330
They call them gazelles in buds. These are people that are like really fast,

1169
01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:47.510
good athletes. And, but they never lost before. Yeah. And yes,

1170
01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:50.870
they start getting beat down, which you do get beat down and they lose.

1171
01:08:50.871 --> 01:08:55.200
They can't handle it mentally. Yeah. Oh yeah. So yes sir. That is, um,

1172
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:59.000
that's real. Next question. Juggle.

1173
01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:04.010
My wife told me that she sees I am much more direct and less cordial than I used

1174
01:09:05.061 --> 01:09:08.360
to be. I feel I've pushed too much into getting after it

1175
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:15.280
and it makes those around me feel like I've changed to someone else. Yeah.

1176
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.760
We have to be really careful, right, Mr.

1177
01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:23.830
Because being more direct and less cordial is definitely not getting after it.

1178
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:27.290
In fact, it's the opposite.

1179
01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.090
If you are getting after it in a correct manner,

1180
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:37.450
your wife should be completely stoked because you're going to have more time for

1181
01:09:38.361 --> 01:09:41.030
her cause you're going to be doing time management properly.

1182
01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:44.900
You're going to have, you're going to be doing better at work,

1183
01:09:44.901 --> 01:09:47.140
which means you're going to be getting promoted or whatever,

1184
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:50.180
getting paid more or you know, getting jobs, stability or whatever,

1185
01:09:50.181 --> 01:09:54.170
something like that. You're going to be healthier because you're,

1186
01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.570
you're working out, you're gonna be stronger cause you're working out,

1187
01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:59.360
you're going to be more organized with things

1188
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:03.200
and you're going to be more thoughtful about building.

1189
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.650
That's what we're getting after is like your, your relationship.

1190
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.890
It should be improving. Yes. Not this, and this is one of those,

1191
01:10:09.891 --> 01:10:14.600
this is one of Echo Charles's favorite things to talk about or sexually

1192
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:17.210
something that you've just brought up a bunch of times on the podcast,

1193
01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:20.780
which is when someone says no, that's just how I am.

1194
01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.740
Like I'm just going to tell you the truth cause that's just how I am.

1195
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:27.440
Just making an excuse for being a jerk coming out of the gate,

1196
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:31.070
which is not good. So if that's what you're doing with your wife, you know what,

1197
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:34.910
I'm just gonna get after it. Hey there's tuna casserole sucks.

1198
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:40.400
I'm just telling you what it is. That's how I roll. Like, no,

1199
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:44.780
you're actually rolling in the wrong direction when you're getting after it in a

1200
01:10:44.781 --> 01:10:47.150
good way. Your wife will be stoked.

1201
01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.500
I was getting interviewed the other day and I realized this.

1202
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:54.590
So I've written eight books.

1203
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:58.880
The eighth one comes out in January of 2020 it's a lot of writing.

1204
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:05.440
I wrote 90% of the words in those books while my family was asleep.

1205
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:13.870
Then it made almost no impact on the family.

1206
01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.440
Hmm. I'm writing these books.

1207
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.230
Editing is a little bit different cause there's a timeline on editing.

1208
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:21.810
So sometimes my, my family would be awake while I was editing and it,

1209
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.510
I had to get stuff turned back in and it's a pain.

1210
01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.300
But that's like it takes a week. Right.

1211
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:32.330
But the other 90% of getting after it was done while my family is asleep.

1212
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:41.750
If you contrarily are getting after it at the expense of your family and

1213
01:11:42.061 --> 01:11:44.790
friends, that's not, that's actually being selfish.

1214
01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.273
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1215
01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:48.370
<v 0>so that's one part. Okay.</v>

1216
01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:51.970
So maybe you need to check yourself there and make sure that you're got your

1217
01:11:51.971 --> 01:11:56.580
priorities in order. The there is a chance, however,

1218
01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.313
that

1219
01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.720
your friends don't like seeing you start to get some out to do,

1220
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.040
right. You start to be more successful, start to lead a better life.

1221
01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:14.510
There's all kinds of groups of people that will just drag you back down.

1222
01:12:14.511 --> 01:12:18.020
They don't want to see you win. Yeah. That's sort of, I don't know,

1223
01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:21.200
is that the fundamental kind of baseline human instinct?

1224
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:22.970
I don't want to see you win.

1225
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:29.440
If there is an element of it too too, I would not be surprised. Yes.

1226
01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.520
Put it that way, but I don't,

1227
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:35.800
there's at least a nontrivial part of the proper [inaudible] population that

1228
01:12:37.461 --> 01:12:42.410
does not want to see you win. Yeah. There's at least a percentage,

1229
01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.780
whatever that percentage is of the people that you know that does not want to

1230
01:12:47.781 --> 01:12:52.190
see you in, they would rather see you fail. They would rather,

1231
01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:53.360
and maybe fails not the word,

1232
01:12:53.361 --> 01:12:56.960
but they would at least rather have you stay with them. Yeah. Yeah.

1233
01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.130
That makes sense. So there's a chance that that's going on.

1234
01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.900
Is there a chance that that's going on with your wife? Hopefully not.

1235
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:09.290
That's a slim chance because if you think about it, your success,

1236
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:13.460
her success is predicated on your success. I mean, you are bound to each other.

1237
01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:18.020
Both. Each of your success is predicated on each other's success.

1238
01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:22.910
So do I want my wife to be successful? Oh yeah. Because I,

1239
01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:27.560
that's my wife and she's looking at me going, yes, go be successful.

1240
01:13:27.561 --> 01:13:31.550
The more successful I am, the more successful she is. So there's a,

1241
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:36.470
there's most likely your, your wife in my opinion,

1242
01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.730
would be supportive of your efforts unless you're just getting out of control.

1243
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:45.530
There is a chance, I guess that a wife could see, you know,

1244
01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.270
someone change and you know, that's not the person that I married. Right.

1245
01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.291
But hold on,

1246
01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:55.610
the person that you married was lazy and I'm over here getting after it.

1247
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:59.030
[inaudible] the person that you married was making x amount of money and I'm

1248
01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:00.800
making a lot more than that.

1249
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.380
The person that you married wasn't in good physical shape.

1250
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:04.700
I'm in good physical shape.

1251
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:10.130
Most of the time the wife would say, cool, yeah, I'm getting a better deal now.

1252
01:14:10.190 --> 01:14:11.890
Occasionally I think you would get a,

1253
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.270
<v 1>a, a spouse,</v>

1254
01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:17.410
I guess it could be the male or the female could happen on either side that

1255
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:20.260
goes, oh, you want to work hard and I'm going to really not looking to do that.

1256
01:14:20.261 --> 01:14:24.340
I was comfortable. I was comfortable. That's it. Yeah. I'm comfortable.

1257
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:25.660
I don't want you getting all crazy.

1258
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:30.490
I'm over here being comfortable so that could happen. I think that's unlikely.

1259
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:35.680
I think what's most likely is you are focused on yourself a little bit too much.

1260
01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:40.360
Check yourself for that. That should be the first person you look at you. Yeah,

1261
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:44.260
that's true. Huh? Cause like this is actually kind of common where

1262
01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.421
husband, wife,

1263
01:14:46.421 --> 01:14:49.690
whichever the scenario is where one let's say let's say two people,

1264
01:14:49.691 --> 01:14:51.490
they get married whatever years down the road.

1265
01:14:51.491 --> 01:14:56.491
One of the people in the couple relationship improves themselves a lot to lose a

1266
01:14:57.791 --> 01:15:01.390
bunch of weight there. They're literally by their own standard.

1267
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.090
They were not very attractive when they got married,

1268
01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.770
but now this is 10 years later, whatever.

1269
01:15:05.771 --> 01:15:09.760
They become straight up attractive now making more money.

1270
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.700
More people want to hang out with them cause they're nicer.

1271
01:15:12.701 --> 01:15:15.670
Like all this stuff straight up across the board improvement.

1272
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:20.530
Meanwhile the other person in the relationship didn't do that. Still married,

1273
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:24.310
still all good. No infidelity, nothing like that. Still married.

1274
01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:28.330
But that person who didn't improve themselves will feel like they got phased out

1275
01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.870
or Kinda like, like the person might want to upgrade or something like that,

1276
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.120
you know? So it's like, it is a possibility.

1277
01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:37.000
They try and drag the person back down. Yeah. Cause you need to be back here.

1278
01:15:37.001 --> 01:15:40.840
I need to be, feel secure now I'm this husband and now my wife's high,

1279
01:15:40.841 --> 01:15:44.140
I'm not used to hot life because when we got married, you weren't that hot.

1280
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:48.640
I loved you for you and you know all this stuff and you know what they say or

1281
01:15:48.641 --> 01:15:53.230
whatever and um, and now you're up late, you know,

1282
01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.790
I don't know if I'm thinking of Shit cliche movie thing, but anyway, the,

1283
01:15:57.190 --> 01:16:00.040
the wife's like all good looking now. People were like,

1284
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:04.390
people at the store like compliment here and all this stuff and the is not used

1285
01:16:04.391 --> 01:16:08.200
to it. And now in his mind, a little thing developed sorts. Like, oh,

1286
01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.180
like I'm not good enough now for this hot,

1287
01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.320
hot girl and I'm going to buy her some Cheetos. Yeah. Bring her back down.

1288
01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:16.230
So like at least have some mad at you. You know,

1289
01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.120
manageable amount of control person. So that's, you know,

1290
01:16:21.130 --> 01:16:24.040
that's not an uncommon thing in that specific scenario.

1291
01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:25.840
I guess that scenario is not very common though.

1292
01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.910
It's not a very common scenario.

1293
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:31.300
And then it would have to be doubly uncommon for someone to actually want to

1294
01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:33.190
drag them back down. I have to throw it out there though.

1295
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:36.400
Cause it is a possibility. Yeah. But for this particular question,

1296
01:16:36.401 --> 01:16:39.190
I don't think so. Only because this little indicator right here,

1297
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:44.700
my wife told me that she sees I am much more direct and usually much more direct

1298
01:16:46.451 --> 01:16:50.590
means insensitive in my experience. Wives don't do good.

1299
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:54.580
Generally speaking, within sensitivity, less cordial.

1300
01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:58.810
That's another one in my opinion, in my experience, cause I'm married. Yeah,

1301
01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:02.710
cordial. You learn things. Yeah. I'm going to give you an example.

1302
01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:06.740
Something I learned about my wife, if my,

1303
01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:10.160
if my wife, if it isn't on the, it's

1304
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.930
<v 0>about enough to make my wife get mad. Right. So in other words, if I said,</v>

1305
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:19.910
hey, I'm going away for one month, a month from now,

1306
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:23.330
I'm going away for six months on a work trip.

1307
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:28.070
I'll be back when I'm done with those six months and when I'm gone and you're

1308
01:17:28.071 --> 01:17:32.360
not able to hear from me at all. She'd be like, okay, got it.

1309
01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:35.300
When do you leave? And I'd say, well, I'm leaving. Whatever. Yeah,

1310
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:38.300
September 1st and she'd go, okay,

1311
01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:43.650
she wouldn't be even remotely upset. She'd be good to go. Yeah.

1312
01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:49.220
If it was Friday night and I came home and said,

1313
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:54.020
oh, I'm, I didn't tell you Saturday. I said, I didn't tell you,

1314
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:56.270
but I'm going over to echos to watch the UFC.

1315
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.240
There's a decent chance that she's mad about that because she had in her mind

1316
01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:07.850
that we were going to eat whatever we were going out for dinner or whatever,

1317
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:12.050
but I didn't, I didn't give the preplanned. Yeah. Situation.

1318
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:14.870
What if she didn't make a plan for that? It was just sort of,

1319
01:18:14.871 --> 01:18:19.520
maybe we could do that. It's, it's, no, it's not on her.

1320
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.420
It's on me. It's on me for not informing her. Of what was going on,

1321
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:24.620
cause it doesn't really matter.

1322
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:29.060
All she knew is that I was coming home and I was going to be around and that was

1323
01:18:29.061 --> 01:18:33.470
what was happening because anything that is not, you know what's really funny,

1324
01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:38.000
this is again with my wife and this is, this is where it became evident to me.

1325
01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.950
Even if it's something that is positive for my wife,

1326
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:48.260
if I don't give her pre planning cycle on, on what's gonna happen.

1327
01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:50.330
So in other words,

1328
01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.600
if I was flying home and I'd been gone for a week and I s you know,

1329
01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:59.640
got home and busted through the door and said, hey, I,

1330
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:03.050
I'm on a tail end of a 72 hour fast, I'm starving,

1331
01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:06.230
I'm taking you out and I made reservations for this really nice dinner,

1332
01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:11.270
I'm going to go get some, you know, a $200 steak right now,

1333
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:14.030
some steak, there's a chance

1334
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:20.550
that the percentage should be 100% she stoked, right?

1335
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:24.590
That should be the percentage. However, with my wife,

1336
01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:29.620
there's a a 20 to 30% chance that she says,

1337
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:34.880
you know, I was gonna take, you know, I was going to take our daughter to,

1338
01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:38.150
you know, uh, the raffle. I don't know,

1339
01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:42.860
to play Bingo and like that is enough. And, and I,

1340
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:45.470
what I don't do is I say, oh cool, you know what? We'll go tomorrow.

1341
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:47.300
What I don't do is try and impose it.

1342
01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:51.650
So what you're saying is like lack of being cordial.

1343
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.240
What I'm saying is that's not just like,

1344
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:59.030
that's one example of me not being cordial. So I don't,

1345
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:02.030
I try not to, I guess. I guess, I guess to sum it up,

1346
01:20:02.031 --> 01:20:06.140
my wife doesn't really like surprises, right? She likes to have a plan.

1347
01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:09.860
She to know what's happening and then she'll execute the plan.

1348
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:14.290
So that's what you gotta be careful of you. What you gotta be, well not,

1349
01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:15.210
not what you gotta be careful of.

1350
01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:19.860
That is one example of how these little things, they don't make sense.

1351
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:21.420
It doesn't make sense that some,

1352
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:25.570
that my wife wouldn't be super stoked to go out to a awesome steak house.

1353
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:28.860
That doesn't make sense to anyone. Well, you know,

1354
01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:34.050
then that's a superficial thing and let me tell you something else that makes it

1355
01:20:34.051 --> 01:20:39.051
a little bit tricky is I'm super insensitive to like changing plans.

1356
01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:43.170
Like people change plans with me. I'm like, whatever. It's no fun.

1357
01:20:43.290 --> 01:20:46.260
It's literally no factor. Like, Oh we, oh yeah,

1358
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:48.030
we've been planning to do this for six months. Someone's like, oh,

1359
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:50.080
I can't do it. I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah. You know what I mean?

1360
01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.180
Like it means nothing to me. When things change, it means nothing.

1361
01:20:53.690 --> 01:20:58.560
It has no impact on me. I have no emotional reaction to someone saying,

1362
01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:02.610
hey this, we can't do this now. And I'm like, okay, cool.

1363
01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:06.570
I'm going to do something else. Yeah. So I'm at the other end of the spectrum,

1364
01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:11.760
which means it took me a little while to figure out that, oh,

1365
01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:15.210
this makes you mad. Got It. Cheer

1366
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:20.080
<v 3>problem. And probably something like one level, like under the surface too.</v>

1367
01:21:20.081 --> 01:21:23.710
It's not like, Hey, I had this good, you know, the raffle was,

1368
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:27.220
was planned in my head in that raffle is important. The raffle is not important.

1369
01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:31.540
Neither is the dinner. It's like that part of it on that level is not important.

1370
01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.290
It's one level deeper. It's the fact that I had the soup, my head,

1371
01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.330
you didn't tell me this other thing.

1372
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:41.770
And now like what I had in my head really means nothing. So it's kind of that.

1373
01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.720
Here's another other

1374
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:44.910
<v 0>funny thing about my wife</v>

1375
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:51.360
is she's so into the planning thing that if I plan something,

1376
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.520
it has way more value to her. So in other words, if I say,

1377
01:21:56.521 --> 01:21:58.710
hey, when I get back this Friday,

1378
01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:02.910
I'm going to do a fast and I'm going to be super hungry.

1379
01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:06.200
I'm going to make reservations for this Friday, right?

1380
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:11.220
And we can go out and get an awesome steak Tomahawk Ribeye.

1381
01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:16.650
And like the fact that it was preplanned.

1382
01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:21.060
Like I've done this before where I've taken her in and I've gotten reservations

1383
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:25.370
and she'll be like, did you make reservations? And I'll say, yes, I,

1384
01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.470
I'll be like, yeah, I did. And I can see like a little smile.

1385
01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.400
Like I care a little bit more that I made those reservations. Like that's what,

1386
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:37.740
what the spontaneity thing. No, no, no,

1387
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:41.790
no points for spontaneity, zero, zero points responding.

1388
01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:45.390
It only points for preplanned fires, you know y,

1389
01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:50.490
y cause it's thoughtful. Yeah. I exactly, yes, yes. Yeah. That's great.

1390
01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.630
That's good. That's good. That's an interesting quality right there.

1391
01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:57.330
And I guess my point in saying this, this,

1392
01:22:57.390 --> 01:23:02.390
these things is that everyone has these little personality traits.

1393
01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:08.320
People you work with, people, your, your spouse, your children,

1394
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:12.940
they have these things. And if you figure out what those things are,

1395
01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:18.930
you can actually utilize them to your advantage and you can bypass things that

1396
01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:24.850
will be problematic. And something that you've said too is you say, oh,

1397
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.210
you do this stuff to me. Meaning Jocko does you,

1398
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:32.890
I do some like leadership trick to you and you know that I'm doing it,

1399
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:38.080
but it still like it works and it still makes you feel the way that you know

1400
01:23:38.081 --> 01:23:39.100
it's supposed to make you feel.

1401
01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:43.770
But that's my point where like my wife will listen to this. Yeah. And it's,

1402
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:46.330
and then I'll make reservations and she'll still be happy.

1403
01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:49.360
Even though that she knows that I'm doing it just because I know that it's going

1404
01:23:49.361 --> 01:23:53.950
to be something that makes her happy. Yeah, so just because you reveal like,

1405
01:23:53.951 --> 01:23:55.420
hey, I know this is what you're like,

1406
01:23:55.421 --> 01:23:57.160
or even whether you reveal it or not doesn't matter.

1407
01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.070
When someone has that characteristic,

1408
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:05.320
then you can utilize that characteristic and I know that's not the best sounding

1409
01:24:05.321 --> 01:24:10.321
word to talk about like manipulating my wife's emotions,

1410
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.000
but what I want to do is manipulate her emotions to make her feel happy about

1411
01:24:16.001 --> 01:24:19.840
something. The right, not necessarily a bad thing. It's a good thing.

1412
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:25.470
So be cognizant when you're dealing with other human beings.

1413
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:30.700
Look for these things. You see these things. If you take a step back,

1414
01:24:30.701 --> 01:24:35.470
if you don't take a step back, you'll never see them. If you can't detach,

1415
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:38.340
when you tell your wife something and you you,

1416
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:40.870
you see that it makes her mad if you can't detach.

1417
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:43.690
If you talking to an employee and you see that they're getting frustrated and

1418
01:24:43.691 --> 01:24:45.610
you can't detach to try and figure out what that is,

1419
01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:47.860
you will not going to make any real progress.

1420
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.270
So yeah, that's been direct thing.

1421
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:58.950
We like to be direct or when people are direct to us,

1422
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:03.130
it makes things easier for us, you know, but doesn't as we wait, who's the,

1423
01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:07.120
we were talking to whoever people who, because here's the deal, man.

1424
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:13.370
Direct is a very, uh,

1425
01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:18.720
a very blunt force tool and not many people wield it well,

1426
01:25:20.230 --> 01:25:22.590
and not many people receive it well. Yeah.

1427
01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:25.840
So if you're one of these people is that you're all just look to be direct,

1428
01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:30.340
right? That's not good. And very seldom

1429
01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:35.410
do you end up in situations where you can just be direct with people.

1430
01:25:35.411 --> 01:25:40.411
You have to have real strong built relationships with people where you can just

1431
01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:45.310
be that blunt and direct with them.

1432
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.170
Now there are methodologies where you can be direct without being direct.

1433
01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.870
You know, you can say things that are, hey,

1434
01:25:52.871 --> 01:25:55.540
this is what we need to get done right now. You can take an edge off of it.

1435
01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.580
You can end with the way you usually do that is by taking ownership of what it

1436
01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:03.500
is you're trying to make happen. So what I don't say is like Echo,

1437
01:26:03.501 --> 01:26:07.100
you need to get this thing edited tonight. Yeah. Great. I don't do that.

1438
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:12.590
I might say, hey is there any chance we could get this thing edited tonight?

1439
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:16.910
Cause if we don't, we're going to have a gap in releases,

1440
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.100
which by the way we haven't had, and that's kind of a thing. Yeah.

1441
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:26.480
Yes. Even you just kind of know that it's a thing. It is, isn't it? Right.

1442
01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.000
And all of a sudden you want to edit that thing,

1443
01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.740
not because I told you to boot cause you want to keep the gaps from opening up.

1444
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:38.860
Sure. So I was, I was directly telling you but I was indirect. Yeah.

1445
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:40.370
So there's ways to do it,

1446
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:45.580
but you gotta be careful with direct direct me.

1447
01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.090
It takes a long time to,

1448
01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:51.830
to hone the scalpel of direct to where it just gets,

1449
01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:55.580
where you want it to cut. And it doesn't leave any collateral damage.

1450
01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.660
Not many people are good at it. Very few people are good at it.

1451
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:05.720
Sorry. Next question Jocko.

1452
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:10.940
And you know, that makes people mad. What does the,

1453
01:27:10.941 --> 01:27:13.220
when you say, listen, you can't just be, you can't just,

1454
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.150
you can't just throw to people. PR People want to say like, there's a book,

1455
01:27:17.151 --> 01:27:20.150
there's a book called radical

1456
01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:25.370
frankness or something like that. That's not the name of the book,

1457
01:27:25.371 --> 01:27:27.080
but it's something like that. It's like, hey,

1458
01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:30.770
we just going to tell the total radical transparency or something like that.

1459
01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:35.090
And it's like, well, we're just going to tell the truth all the time and we,

1460
01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.750
we can get there, but man, it is work. Yeah.

1461
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:42.800
And it's not even work that has to be that,

1462
01:27:42.801 --> 01:27:44.270
that necessarily

1463
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:49.820
is the best use of work, you know?

1464
01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:54.620
So yeah. I just know, I just know, I hear people all the time, well, you know,

1465
01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.310
and people, that's what people want me to say. I'll go and work with a company,

1466
01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.990
look, you know what, we really need help. Let's,

1467
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.520
we just need to really learn to be direct with each other. Yeah.

1468
01:28:02.150 --> 01:28:06.050
And what they really should be saying is what we need to do is we need to learn

1469
01:28:06.051 --> 01:28:08.060
to communicate with each other,

1470
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:12.710
be open about what issues we have, how to solve those problems,

1471
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:18.350
and be more tactful in, in our discussions so that people are receptive.

1472
01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.120
Yeah. Cause think about what I just said.

1473
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:24.980
If it's not just about me being direct,

1474
01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:26.720
the more important,

1475
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:31.750
the only way that I can be direct is if I have set you up in such a way that you

1476
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:40.450
or I've built you in such a way that you're receptive to my directness because

1477
01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:45.830
me being direct without you being receptive, it doesn't work.

1478
01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.930
And so often that's what I see. I see. Hey, I'm direct, but,

1479
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:55.120
but you're not receptive. It's, it's game over, you know?

1480
01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:57.200
So even if I'm direct,

1481
01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:00.840
I'm only 50% of the solution because you have to be receptive. Yeah.

1482
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:04.230
What's easier? When I, when I go indirect,

1483
01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:10.010
I become 90% of the solution because I'm going to get it into your brain without

1484
01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:14.850
resistance. Yeah. So I, it's an easier, it's easier up front as me.

1485
01:29:14.851 --> 01:29:18.660
I'll just be direct. Yeah. That's easy upfront cause I'd just say Echo,

1486
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.800
you need to get this stuff edited now direct that's direct.

1487
01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:27.480
What are the chances of you being receptive to that? 50% yeah. You know,

1488
01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:32.490
whereas if I, well let me rephrase that. In order for this to be effective,

1489
01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:33.900
you have to be receptive to it.

1490
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:38.160
So I only have 50% of the solution.

1491
01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:43.110
You have the other 50% whereas if I say, like I said before, you know,

1492
01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:45.600
hey echo, we is there any chance we could get this done tonight?

1493
01:29:45.601 --> 01:29:49.260
Cause here's what's at stake in it. And I go indirect and I make that idea.

1494
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:53.520
I'd make your answer. You're going to give me the answer I want.

1495
01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:58.590
I mean I know it can be edited tonight. Right. I know. That makes sense.

1496
01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:00.420
And so I'm going to,

1497
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.010
you're actually going to tell me you I'm putting it into,

1498
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:05.821
I'm giving you,

1499
01:30:05.821 --> 01:30:09.420
all you have to do is just tell me and now I'm the one that's receptive. Yes,

1500
01:30:09.421 --> 01:30:13.020
we can't. Oh that's great. That's great. I'm glad.

1501
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:18.120
So that's something very important to talk about.

1502
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:21.450
If you want to talk about learning to be direct with each other,

1503
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:26.310
what you really have to learn is how to be receptive to directness. That's the,

1504
01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:31.500
that's the long pole in the tent. That's what organizations are missing out on.

1505
01:30:31.770 --> 01:30:36.750
Being direct as easy. Yeah. Being direct is the easiest thing in the world.

1506
01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.740
You're tell people what you think. That's easy. Yeah.

1507
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.350
What's hard is setting the other person up,

1508
01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:46.890
developing relationships so that they're receptive to what you're saying. Yeah.

1509
01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:52.050
Be careful. You play football back in the day and

1510
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:55.110
<v 3>[inaudible] this new quarterback came in a few. What's weird is,</v>

1511
01:30:55.111 --> 01:30:59.310
I forget his name. I'm just drawing a blank right now, but new young guy,

1512
01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:02.940
tall 10 he had a gun. If you're a quarterback and you have a gun,

1513
01:31:02.941 --> 01:31:07.260
that's impressive. You know for sure it means you throw far and fast.

1514
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:11.670
Here's the thing though, especially when you're new, you know,

1515
01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:13.950
and you have a gun, you're, you're going to show that gun.

1516
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.110
You know you're going to be like when you're playing, you know,

1517
01:31:16.111 --> 01:31:18.240
when you're warming up before practice and stuff like that,

1518
01:31:18.241 --> 01:31:19.650
you're throwing at it and they're throwing it hard.

1519
01:31:19.651 --> 01:31:23.930
So this guy was throwing it hard at me as receiver and we're just stay.

1520
01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:26.550
He was just standing and we were just standing there. I wasn't running routes.

1521
01:31:26.551 --> 01:31:30.330
So he's throwing it and it's hurting my hand to the point where I couldn't catch

1522
01:31:30.331 --> 01:31:33.900
some of them because they were coming just too fast for, you know,

1523
01:31:33.901 --> 01:31:35.040
for that distance or whatever.

1524
01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:39.060
And he sure I was impressed with this guy's gun,

1525
01:31:39.061 --> 01:31:43.410
but he, when we'd want run routes and stuff, he'd still kind of do that.

1526
01:31:43.411 --> 01:31:46.230
I guess maybe to impress the coaches, you know, he's a young guy or whatever.

1527
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:49.980
Um, and here's the thing, like people would miss his balls.

1528
01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.200
They wouldn't catch him because they're coming too hard.

1529
01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:55.380
They're hurting your hands, they're messing you up, you know?

1530
01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:59.290
So it makes it really hard. I get it. It's great practice for the receivers.

1531
01:31:59.291 --> 01:32:00.040
Totally is.

1532
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.490
<v 1>But as far as to effectively land a a pass, you know,</v>

1533
01:32:03.491 --> 01:32:06.580
to complete a pass probably doesn't work like that.

1534
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:09.340
And we had this other f Chordal Gone Echo. Let me just stop you.

1535
01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:13.390
Cause you may have just made like the best analogy you've ever made on this

1536
01:32:13.391 --> 01:32:17.980
podcast. That is it cool if that, if you can throw that thing direct,

1537
01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:21.370
but if you're throwing it too hard and the person's not ready to receive it,

1538
01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.250
right or not even, not even to mention that you might not be ready to read,

1539
01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:26.560
you might be looking in the other direction that's going to hit you in the back

1540
01:32:26.561 --> 01:32:31.150
of the head. What good is that direct comment? It's zero. Good. It's not good.

1541
01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:35.450
Hurting your hands when you've tried to receive it. It hurts you. Yeah.

1542
01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:36.550
And you don't want to hear anymore.

1543
01:32:36.670 --> 01:32:40.300
You don't want it any more to be thrown at you. Nope. Okay. Proceed.

1544
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:44.110
As opposed to this other quarterback who came in from Stanford by the,

1545
01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:47.340
your hard work is paying off. Thanks.

1546
01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:52.030
So this other quarterback came to that quarterback. Make it anywhere.

1547
01:32:52.031 --> 01:32:55.780
Did he make it be NFL? He did not make it to the NFL. So,

1548
01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:59.140
so quarterback came in, his name is Tim Carey came from like Stanford I think.

1549
01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:02.680
And he came in, he was the kind of the opposite, actually not the opposite,

1550
01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.550
cause he had a guy he could throw far and stuff or,

1551
01:33:04.551 --> 01:33:08.800
but the way he threw it was like, he was like the perfect pass.

1552
01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:11.950
Like every distance had a different velocity on it, you know,

1553
01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:16.720
it was like that kind of where the next, if he would modulated,

1554
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:21.900
there's so well he modulated so well where like the volume for those chasses

1555
01:33:22.031 --> 01:33:26.170
correctness oil, everything. And for them to get better,

1556
01:33:26.171 --> 01:33:28.720
he would have to physically walk in and put it in your hand.

1557
01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:31.980
It was like that good when he'd come, you know, um,

1558
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:37.210
and when you have them side by side, Oh man, I want that direct guy.

1559
01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:41.850
I want the finesse guy, you know. But he did have the capability, um,

1560
01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:46.180
to the NFL. Um, I maybe f I forget,

1561
01:33:46.181 --> 01:33:49.600
he left Stanford to come to your college. Um, I forget why,

1562
01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:52.210
but I think we're good. It was a whole thing.

1563
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:55.880
There was a few Stanford guys that came. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah.

1564
01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:00.340
A few guys from Stanford fruit. Ben came to your school. Uhh, yeah,

1565
01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:04.210
he was doing it. I want to say when we changed coaching staffs, Oh,

1566
01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:06.910
there might've been some scouts connections,

1567
01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:09.550
maybe like some relationships that were already there.

1568
01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:12.700
Even some of the coaches I think came from that area. I Dunno,

1569
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:16.180
I forget that was a long time ago. But nonetheless, yeah,

1570
01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:19.120
that's the way it shook out. So there you go.

1571
01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.730
Jocko 13 year street cop here.

1572
01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.580
My old man died when I was 10 it cut deep and I grew up with no one having two

1573
01:34:30.581 --> 01:34:34.210
boys on my own now and loving to get after it on the street.

1574
01:34:34.330 --> 01:34:35.860
I worry about the risk.

1575
01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:41.770
How do I balance being the spear with ensuring I stay around for them?

1576
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:47.080
So first of all,

1577
01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:50.950
we have to recognize that there's no way that you can ensure that you stay

1578
01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:55.810
around it. In fact, one day you will not be around one day.

1579
01:34:55.811 --> 01:34:57.950
None of us will be around. That's

1580
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.570
<v 0>the fact. And that actually doesn't matter what your job is.</v>

1581
01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:07.510
And there's all kinds of things regardless of your job,

1582
01:35:07.511 --> 01:35:09.220
whether you have a car accident with you have a heart attack,

1583
01:35:09.221 --> 01:35:13.600
whether you have cancer or a plane crash or random violence or some random

1584
01:35:13.601 --> 01:35:15.970
accident, there's all different kinds of ways to die.

1585
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:18.700
Now you are correct that the,

1586
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.460
the death rate of cops is higher.

1587
01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:23.080
<v 4>Okay?</v>

1588
01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.020
<v 0>It's higher than a normal civilian.</v>

1589
01:35:26.021 --> 01:35:30.820
But what w like loggers, construction workers,

1590
01:35:30.821 --> 01:35:33.940
they all have a higher rates of death than a cop.

1591
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:36.250
Roofers,

1592
01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:37.770
<v 4>okay.</v>

1593
01:35:37.770 --> 01:35:41.400
<v 0>Roofer, if you're a Roofer, you have a higher rate of death than a cop.</v>

1594
01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:44.310
Any drivers, anyone that drives for a living,

1595
01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:48.570
whether they're a trucker or whether they're literally a traveling salesman,

1596
01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:53.190
they have a higher rate of death than being being police.

1597
01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.190
So no matter what you do,

1598
01:35:57.830 --> 01:36:00.810
there's a chance that you could, that you could die.

1599
01:36:00.811 --> 01:36:04.560
And I'll tell you what I think about this sometimes in the reverse of like what

1600
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:07.170
do you, what do, what scares you about what your kids do?

1601
01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:10.710
If your kids are engaging in activity that could be dangerous,

1602
01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:14.760
whether it's parachuting, whether it's rock climbing, whatever.

1603
01:36:14.761 --> 01:36:17.550
Like there's things that your kids could do that they could die.

1604
01:36:19.210 --> 01:36:23.050
And what you could do is not allow them to do it,

1605
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:27.100
wrap them in bubble bubble wrap and not allow them to go anywhere.

1606
01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.340
And guess what, even if you do that, there's still a chance

1607
01:36:32.010 --> 01:36:35.400
and you've taken away, you know, their growth.

1608
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:38.820
So you can look at it in the reverse as well,

1609
01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.720
that there's some things that you're not gonna be able to control.

1610
01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.830
And no matter what you know, your kid could, you could say,

1611
01:36:46.831 --> 01:36:48.510
I don't want my kid to join the military.

1612
01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.670
And so they go to college and what happens in college,

1613
01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:54.000
they get hit by a drunk driver. They like,

1614
01:36:54.001 --> 01:36:57.450
there's enough bad things that can happen in either one of those situations.

1615
01:36:58.350 --> 01:37:00.300
And same thing with you and your job.

1616
01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.870
You could go get a job doing something unless you get a job that's just straight

1617
01:37:03.871 --> 01:37:05.820
up, uh, you know,

1618
01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:09.180
in an administrative situation with note,

1619
01:37:09.181 --> 01:37:11.880
with very limited commute and very limited driving,

1620
01:37:13.110 --> 01:37:17.670
then that might increase your chances a little bit. But then you, you know,

1621
01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:20.820
then are you doing something that you actually like to do?

1622
01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.300
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1623
01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:25.960
<v 0>so there's your, your dilemma. So what do you do in a situation like this?</v>

1624
01:37:25.961 --> 01:37:30.961
What you do is you train and you prepare and you vigilant and you take care of

1625
01:37:31.601 --> 01:37:32.890
your sons obviously,

1626
01:37:32.970 --> 01:37:37.240
and you would explain your job to them and you explain to them why you train

1627
01:37:37.241 --> 01:37:42.241
hard and explained to them why you're willing to make a sacrifice to keep others

1628
01:37:43.961 --> 01:37:48.640
safe, including them. You, you work every day to keep them safe as well.

1629
01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:53.520
And if you explain that to your sons,

1630
01:37:55.170 --> 01:38:00.170
they will grow up with an understanding of service and discipline and duty and

1631
01:38:03.931 --> 01:38:05.850
courage and honor.

1632
01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:13.750
And by the way, if something did happen to you,

1633
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:18.990
the model that you set for them would have massive impact,

1634
01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.580
would have massive impact

1635
01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.170
on them and how they would live their lives.

1636
01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:33.120
And I believe it would be actually a positive impact. Sure. Would they miss you?

1637
01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:35.370
Absolutely. Sure.

1638
01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:38.730
W W would they wish more than anything that you could be back? Yes.

1639
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:42.540
But would they recognize that their dad made this sacrifice?

1640
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:47.850
Yes, they would. Would they live to honor that sacrifice? Yes they would.

1641
01:38:49.530 --> 01:38:50.363
So

1642
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.660
that's one thing you can do if you want to keep that profession now,

1643
01:38:58.501 --> 01:39:03.000
if that, if you can't get around that, if that doesn't make sense,

1644
01:39:03.001 --> 01:39:05.460
which it's understandable if you look at me and say, Hey Jocko, I get it.

1645
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:07.320
I want my kids to be raised with honor,

1646
01:39:07.321 --> 01:39:10.860
but I'd want to be there and that's more important to me. And if that's where,

1647
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:13.950
if that's where you end up,

1648
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:17.310
then what you have to do is plot out what another job,

1649
01:39:17.311 --> 01:39:19.770
what another career is going to be. And like I said,

1650
01:39:19.771 --> 01:39:24.771
then you have to make it doing something that legitimately gets you into a

1651
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:30.360
better, a better survival rate.

1652
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:35.910
Which by the way, outlaws just about every outdoor job you could have. So your,

1653
01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:40.740
you know, you working construction. Nope. That's not it. Working as electrician.

1654
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:44.940
Nope. That's not working as a lineman. Nope, that's not it. All those jobs,

1655
01:39:45.090 --> 01:39:46.920
all those outdoor jobs, go look at this.

1656
01:39:46.921 --> 01:39:51.921
Statistics go Google death rates in jobs and there's all kinds of fishermen.

1657
01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:56.340
No, forget about it. You know,

1658
01:39:56.370 --> 01:40:00.810
there's so many jobs that have a high death rate where accidents happen.

1659
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:05.490
So what you're talking about going into the life you're going into would be

1660
01:40:05.491 --> 01:40:09.870
going into, would be an administrative job of some kind. And,

1661
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.930
and if you think you can do that or you think that'll be,

1662
01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:17.220
give you the satisfaction that you want, then then it's a possibility.

1663
01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:20.400
Think about it. But if you look at it and you think, you know what,

1664
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:25.380
that's not for me. Then train hard. Prepare,

1665
01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:29.370
build a great relationship with your sons. Stay vigilant.

1666
01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:33.920
Don't get complacent ever. And be aggressive.

1667
01:40:35.010 --> 01:40:38.780
I have to throw that one in there because in my opinion,

1668
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:40.423
when

1669
01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:46.900
when an individual gets scared or gets hesitant or gets over protective of

1670
01:40:48.711 --> 01:40:52.580
themselves, I believe they're in more danger, not less danger and more danger.

1671
01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:56.170
So if you think that having kids,

1672
01:40:56.230 --> 01:41:01.230
having your sons is making you less aggressive and more scared,

1673
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:04.390
I think you're at higher risk.

1674
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:10.410
So if you're going to do the job, you do the job,

1675
01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:14.670
you get aggressive when you do the job any. And if you can't,

1676
01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.210
then you got you.

1677
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:21.150
You might want to look and see if there's other alternatives that are out there.

1678
01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:24.430
The other thing I would say is this, how, how often, like you're a street cop,

1679
01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:29.010
you've been there for 13 years. Is there another department you could go to?

1680
01:41:29.670 --> 01:41:33.750
Is there some other way to serve and, and stay connected?

1681
01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:36.240
Use your experience in another, in another way,

1682
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:40.910
maybe one area that has a little less, uh,

1683
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:42.570
probability of getting killed.

1684
01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.090
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1685
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:46.280
<v 0>Again, you got to look if that's something you'd really want to do.</v>

1686
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:50.780
So ultimately, and I tell this to people a lot,

1687
01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:53.840
is there's only one person that can make this decision. And it's not me,

1688
01:41:54.110 --> 01:41:55.760
the only person that can make this decision. As you.

1689
01:41:56.210 --> 01:42:00.470
So think through it before you can even talk about it with your boys,

1690
01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:05.500
depending on how old they are. But you can talk about it with them,

1691
01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:10.120
explained to them and you know, see what they say.

1692
01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:16.300
Um, you know, obviously there's a one way that conversation go, hey,

1693
01:42:16.301 --> 01:42:21.130
would you guys be sitting w w would you guys want me to die? Right? Of course.

1694
01:42:21.131 --> 01:42:23.710
What are they going to say? Oh my gosh, quit that job immediately.

1695
01:42:23.711 --> 01:42:27.790
We don't want you to do that. Right? So you going to have to think about,

1696
01:42:27.791 --> 01:42:29.320
I don't know what the ages of your kids are,

1697
01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:32.470
but you're gonna have to think through that one whether how you address it with

1698
01:42:32.471 --> 01:42:36.080
them. But certainly, um,

1699
01:42:36.190 --> 01:42:40.240
I always look at it that there's risk in everything you do.

1700
01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:44.740
You might as well take risk doing something that you love doing and that you

1701
01:42:44.741 --> 01:42:46.390
know, is helping other people and, you know,

1702
01:42:46.391 --> 01:42:49.450
setting a good example for your boys.

1703
01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:54.490
And if that doesn't make sense, cool. Find enough, find a different job.

1704
01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:56.813
<v 3>A question.</v>

1705
01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:02.220
I was a young boy living in a foster home and was sexually assaulted by my

1706
01:43:02.221 --> 01:43:06.480
foster father and sometimes other people over a course of a couple of years,

1707
01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.570
I was eventually adopted. And what had happened to me.

1708
01:43:09.571 --> 01:43:11.610
It was never discussed and I never got help for it.

1709
01:43:11.970 --> 01:43:16.110
I was afraid of everything and eventually I played sports in high school and

1710
01:43:16.111 --> 01:43:20.340
felt less afraid, went into the army and felt completely unafraid of anything.

1711
01:43:20.670 --> 01:43:23.670
When it got out, I got into a long term relationship.

1712
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:26.940
I told my then girlfriend what had happened to me.

1713
01:43:27.210 --> 01:43:29.130
She was the first person I ever told about this.

1714
01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:33.780
She convinced me to reach out to my foster parents and I did and it was a total

1715
01:43:33.781 --> 01:43:34.614
disaster.

1716
01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:39.480
They kept my room where all this bad stuff had happened exactly the same as it

1717
01:43:39.481 --> 01:43:43.500
was 20 years ago or 20 years prior when these whores had occurred,

1718
01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:49.490
I had my moment to confront this monster that had done this to me and I failed.

1719
01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:52.520
I used a that he always said to me,

1720
01:43:52.521 --> 01:43:57.521
which was w I used a word that he always said to me when he was assaulting me.

1721
01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:00.350
He just said, sometimes people change.

1722
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:06.220
All of a sudden I was a week young boy going in and I couldn't fight back.

1723
01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:09.050
I left the house and had serious self-doubt.

1724
01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.790
Eventually I became a cop and then a detective and a faced all types of bad

1725
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:16.550
people from junkies to murders.

1726
01:44:17.110 --> 01:44:20.990
I even get full confessions out of child rapists.

1727
01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:23.750
I'm sick to my stomach afterwards. It's terrible.

1728
01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:28.610
Terrible to hear what these animals do. My question is this,

1729
01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:31.580
recently the past has come back with a vengeance.

1730
01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.380
I can't get through a short time,

1731
01:44:33.381 --> 01:44:36.980
maybe an hour or two without thinking about the past and my failure,

1732
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:41.960
the only time I have peace is when I absolutely destroyed myself working out.

1733
01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.110
I consider it punishing myself and feel better when I do it.

1734
01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:48.860
How can I stop this or at least manage it better?

1735
01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:56.220
<v 0>So this is, I mean,</v>

1736
01:44:56.221 --> 01:45:00.180
obviously horrible situation and you know, um,

1737
01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:04.500
horrible that you had to live through this and that. Any kid or any one,

1738
01:45:04.501 --> 01:45:06.270
any human would have to go through this

1739
01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:13.580
as far as how you can manage this better.

1740
01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:18.360
Um, I'm gonna go a little bit here.

1741
01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:23.480
So one of the blocks of training that we go through in a seal platoon is called

1742
01:45:27.181 --> 01:45:30.210
close quarters combat. And this is the training.

1743
01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:34.500
You're in a thing called the kill house. It's ballistic walls,

1744
01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:37.930
there's targets in there. You're moving around dynamically.

1745
01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:42.240
You're shooting live fire ammunition, there's people six inches away from you.

1746
01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.580
You're taking really close shots.

1747
01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:49.530
There's a lot of pressure in there. There's a lot of details,

1748
01:45:49.531 --> 01:45:52.680
a lot of standard operating procedures and safety procedures that you have to

1749
01:45:52.681 --> 01:45:57.300
follow. There's a lot of process. The psyche, do you need to go left or right?

1750
01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.300
Is that a good guy or a bad guy because you have to identify the targets.

1751
01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.970
Should you move or should you stay?

1752
01:46:02.971 --> 01:46:04.650
How do you communicate that you need to move,

1753
01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:07.530
should you shoot or should you not shoot at a target?

1754
01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:11.670
And so there's all these things going on. When you enter a room,

1755
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:15.570
all these things that you have to go through,

1756
01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:18.180
all these steps that you have to take,

1757
01:46:18.181 --> 01:46:19.680
all these procedures that you have to follow,

1758
01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.820
all these decisions that you have to make and it all happens in a split second.

1759
01:46:24.150 --> 01:46:25.980
And so in a kill house,

1760
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.710
the training cadre is actually above you. Above the,

1761
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:34.020
it's not a normal house. The, the,

1762
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:37.740
the rooms have what we call catwalks above them.

1763
01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:42.030
So the cadre can be up above you in the catwalks and they're walking around and

1764
01:46:42.031 --> 01:46:43.920
they're watching you very closely.

1765
01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:47.220
It's like watching a football game on TV.

1766
01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:51.780
You're seeing it from like the perfect view above the person and they're in the

1767
01:46:51.781 --> 01:46:52.171
room with you,

1768
01:46:52.171 --> 01:46:54.420
but they're not in your way at all because they're up on the catwalk.

1769
01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:57.720
So what happens is when a room entry happens,

1770
01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:00.660
there's a lot of,

1771
01:47:00.661 --> 01:47:04.560
you catch a lot of critique from the people in the catwalk

1772
01:47:06.150 --> 01:47:07.450
and they'll say, you know, you could have,

1773
01:47:07.890 --> 01:47:10.570
you could have done this or you could done that, or you could,

1774
01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:14.550
you could move left or you should have pushed forward or there's you don't, you,

1775
01:47:14.551 --> 01:47:16.220
it would have been better if you'd done this other thing, this.

1776
01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:20.160
So there's all these different things. And when my cadre was running it,

1777
01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.610
you know, that's what we do. That's what happened to me when I was cadre.

1778
01:47:23.611 --> 01:47:25.590
That's what I would do. That's what everyone does.

1779
01:47:26.970 --> 01:47:31.780
And at some point I kind of realized that all that stuff is good and I get it.

1780
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:34.630
Like you got to get people to run the procedures correctly,

1781
01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:37.090
but in a certain point

1782
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.740
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

1783
01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:42.390
<v 0>no. What I would tell guy, like after a guy was kind of beat down,</v>

1784
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.420
like he just couldn't get something right or he would upload a bunch of people

1785
01:47:45.421 --> 01:47:47.580
would jump on him about, um,

1786
01:47:47.850 --> 01:47:50.430
decision that he made or a movement that he made or whatever.

1787
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:54.080
And I'm not talking about a safety thing cause the safety thing is,

1788
01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:54.651
is different.

1789
01:47:54.651 --> 01:47:57.230
I'm talking about a tactical decision and when you walk into a room,

1790
01:47:57.231 --> 01:48:01.640
there's a bunch of tactical decisions you can make. And, and if there's 10,

1791
01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:04.820
if there's five different decisions that you could make when you walk into a

1792
01:48:04.821 --> 01:48:07.970
room, there's something that there's, you know,

1793
01:48:07.971 --> 01:48:10.490
there's one way of doing it that would be like really clean.

1794
01:48:10.491 --> 01:48:14.240
One would be a little bit less, one might be just as clean as the first one,

1795
01:48:14.241 --> 01:48:15.890
but it's a different attitude. There's this,

1796
01:48:15.891 --> 01:48:20.680
all these different decisions that you could make, you know,

1797
01:48:20.890 --> 01:48:21.723
it's like,

1798
01:48:22.730 --> 01:48:22.900
<v 4>okay,</v>

1799
01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:27.220
<v 0>just a multitude of ways that you could react cause that's what this question</v>

1800
01:48:27.221 --> 01:48:29.650
is. How you reacted in this situation.

1801
01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:33.070
And eventually as I would see this with an individual,

1802
01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:36.310
I would eventually [inaudible]

1803
01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:37.290
<v 4>okay.</v>

1804
01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:39.760
<v 0>I, what I would tell guys is listen,</v>

1805
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.880
<v 4>okay,</v>

1806
01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.440
<v 0>you did what you did.</v>

1807
01:48:44.890 --> 01:48:45.723
<v 4>Cool.</v>

1808
01:48:46.930 --> 01:48:50.290
<v 0>You did what you did. That's what you did.</v>

1809
01:48:51.130 --> 01:48:54.730
That's the decision that you made at the time. And you know what?

1810
01:48:55.630 --> 01:48:58.780
There's different ways you could've done it. You don't like the way you did it.

1811
01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:00.130
I don't like the way you did it.

1812
01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:01.430
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

1813
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:04.070
<v 0>someone at one of the other cadre members doesn't like the way you did it.</v>

1814
01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:07.160
It doesn't what I'm saying, it doesn't really matter for, first of all,

1815
01:49:07.161 --> 01:49:11.600
you can't take it back to you. You can't go back and undo it. And by the way,

1816
01:49:11.601 --> 01:49:15.650
you don't get to rehearse these things to a point where you get to do this

1817
01:49:15.651 --> 01:49:17.840
perfectly because you won't be able to do that.

1818
01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:22.550
If you rehearsed a move in a room that you had seen before and you rehearsed it

1819
01:49:22.551 --> 01:49:25.850
10 times, that's not, that's a totally different game, right?

1820
01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:29.390
If I already know what the room consists of and I'm going to rehearse and

1821
01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:32.510
choreograph the entire movement, that's a different game.

1822
01:49:32.511 --> 01:49:35.630
That's not decision making. That's just, that's just rote memorization.

1823
01:49:35.631 --> 01:49:36.830
We're not talking about that.

1824
01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:42.260
We're talking about how did you react and what you did is what you did and you

1825
01:49:42.261 --> 01:49:45.230
did it for a reason. What you saw in front of you,

1826
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:49.270
you made this decision for a reason. Maybe like, you know,

1827
01:49:49.271 --> 01:49:52.900
you saw a threat when there wasn't one there or you lost situational awareness

1828
01:49:53.110 --> 01:49:55.870
or you rushed, you went too fast,

1829
01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:59.500
you've tried to rush and all those things can kind of can kind of trip you up.

1830
01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:03.610
But that's what you did and you did what you did and you can't take it back.

1831
01:50:03.611 --> 01:50:05.530
So instead of everyone sitting there saying,

1832
01:50:05.531 --> 01:50:08.740
you should've done this and you should have done that, let's do this.

1833
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:11.680
Let's see what we can learn from it.

1834
01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:16.930
Let's see why you did what you did.

1835
01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:20.140
Let's see why you made that decision.

1836
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:24.250
Because once we know why you did something,

1837
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:26.500
now we have something that we can work with.

1838
01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:29.080
We have something that we can improve upon.

1839
01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:30.593
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1840
01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:37.650
<v 0>That is what I think you need to do in this situation.</v>

1841
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.890
And really when anyone makes a mistake or has a reaction that they don't like,

1842
01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:45.780
you can't worry.

1843
01:50:45.781 --> 01:50:49.500
You can't continue to worry about something that has already transpired.

1844
01:50:49.501 --> 01:50:51.330
What you have to do is you have to look at it and say,

1845
01:50:51.690 --> 01:50:55.020
what can I learn from it?

1846
01:50:55.830 --> 01:51:00.830
What can I take from this and and how can I take this mistake and make me

1847
01:51:01.530 --> 01:51:05.460
better? So you could look at this, why did you do that?

1848
01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:10.380
Right? Maybe you did it because you didn't want to open up these old wounds.

1849
01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:15.870
Maybe you did it because you would have you confronting this individual would

1850
01:51:15.871 --> 01:51:20.640
cause more drama and that more that drama you re you at that moment you assessed

1851
01:51:20.641 --> 01:51:23.070
and said, you know what, this drama isn't worth it.

1852
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:26.970
Maybe you protected yourself from more drama.

1853
01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:29.040
And that was your instinct.

1854
01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:34.110
And maybe if you were to started confronting this guy and going crazy that you

1855
01:51:34.111 --> 01:51:34.201
know,

1856
01:51:34.201 --> 01:51:37.170
who knows what could have happened and maybe it could have taken a turn for the

1857
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:38.700
worst. We don't know what the outcome was.

1858
01:51:39.570 --> 01:51:42.900
We know that you weren't happy with your decision. Understandable.

1859
01:51:42.930 --> 01:51:45.060
But we don't even know what the other decisions would've led to.

1860
01:51:45.330 --> 01:51:47.950
So where you're actually getting bogged down and, and,

1861
01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:50.850
and distraught about something that you don't even know if it was a good

1862
01:51:50.851 --> 01:51:54.090
decision or a bad decision. It feels like it was a bad decision.

1863
01:51:54.091 --> 01:51:56.520
But you don't know what the outcomes of the other decisions even were.

1864
01:51:58.970 --> 01:52:03.710
So you can't change the outcome of what happened in the past.

1865
01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:04.573
You can't do it.

1866
01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:10.190
But what you can do is you can grow from it. That's what you can do.

1867
01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:13.590
You can learn from it.

1868
01:52:13.591 --> 01:52:18.540
You can actually take that scenario and you can mentally replay it in your head

1869
01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:23.460
and you can figure out if possibly there would have been or could have been a

1870
01:52:23.461 --> 01:52:24.294
better outcome.

1871
01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:29.640
Or maybe that that outcome that you had wasn't that bad or maybe it leads

1872
01:52:29.641 --> 01:52:31.320
somewhere else. We don't know yet.

1873
01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:33.853
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

1874
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:38.210
<v 0>but that's, that's where you are at right now.</v>

1875
01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:43.960
You can't change the outcome of something that has occurred in the past.

1876
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:47.240
Now I'm going to,

1877
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:51.350
I'm going to throw a little dichotomy at you right now and I'm going to say

1878
01:52:51.351 --> 01:52:54.560
something that's a little bit,

1879
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:56.860
might be a little bit hard to understand.

1880
01:52:56.890 --> 01:53:01.730
I'm gonna try and talk my way through it because while you can't,

1881
01:53:02.630 --> 01:53:03.463
<v 4>okay,</v>

1882
01:53:03.690 --> 01:53:04.320
<v 0>change the past,</v>

1883
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:09.320
what you can change is you can absolutely change the way that the past is

1884
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:12.960
perceived.

1885
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:20.290
So let me give you an a detached example. Just another example.

1886
01:53:20.291 --> 01:53:24.400
If you had an individual, someone gets fired from a job,

1887
01:53:24.970 --> 01:53:28.980
they get fired from their job and when they get fired from the job it,

1888
01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:32.410
what it does is it their,

1889
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:36.070
their confidence goes down and they get depressed and they decide they're not

1890
01:53:36.071 --> 01:53:39.160
going to even apply for new job because I don't even know if I deserve it.

1891
01:53:39.161 --> 01:53:41.590
Get a new job. And they sit around and eventually they,

1892
01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:44.110
they go out and apply for kind of like a lesser job.

1893
01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:45.910
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1894
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:47.290
<v 0>And you know, who knows,</v>

1895
01:53:47.291 --> 01:53:50.950
maybe they start drinking to relieve some of their depression and now they're

1896
01:53:50.951 --> 01:53:54.520
late and now they, they end up on a downward spiral.

1897
01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:59.640
We would look at them being fired as something that destroyed them and ruin

1898
01:54:01.211 --> 01:54:04.290
their life. That's how we would perceive it. Hey, the individual got there.

1899
01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.890
They were, they weren't doing fine.

1900
01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:09.790
Then they got fired and now they lost their confidence. They got depressed,

1901
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:10.661
they started drinking,

1902
01:54:10.661 --> 01:54:13.870
they didn't apply for good jobs and now their life is totally different and it's

1903
01:54:13.871 --> 01:54:14.704
a bad place.

1904
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.030
We would perceive that them getting fired did that to them.

1905
01:54:21.490 --> 01:54:22.323
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

1906
01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.770
<v 0>but if the s if that person,</v>

1907
01:54:24.771 --> 01:54:29.630
if a person got fired from their job at any instead it was like a wakeup call

1908
01:54:29.631 --> 01:54:30.464
for them

1909
01:54:31.710 --> 01:54:36.030
and they immediately applied for a bunch of other jobs and maybe they didn't get

1910
01:54:36.031 --> 01:54:39.000
those because they'd just been fired, but maybe they took a lesser job,

1911
01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:40.680
a lower paying job.

1912
01:54:40.681 --> 01:54:43.800
But they got in there and they had realized they'd made a mistake and they

1913
01:54:43.801 --> 01:54:47.340
started getting after that. Like they'd never gotten after it before.

1914
01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:52.620
They started working as hard as they possibly could and got promoted and then

1915
01:54:52.621 --> 01:54:56.610
got promoted again and just dominated in those positions and went even harder

1916
01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:01.000
and dominated even more and eventually took over the whole company.

1917
01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:07.980
And this isn't crazy, this isn't too far fetched. This can happen. But if,

1918
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.730
if that happened, that same incident,

1919
01:55:10.731 --> 01:55:15.731
the firing of this individual would be perceived in a totally different way.

1920
01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:21.611
It would be perceived as a catalyst that changed their life for the better.

1921
01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:30.900
And there are all kinds of examples like that in the world.

1922
01:55:34.710 --> 01:55:35.543
<v 4>The past</v>

1923
01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.010
<v 0>can't be changed.</v>

1924
01:55:39.010 --> 01:55:39.560
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1925
01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:44.560
<v 0>But the past can change you for the better or it can change you for the worst.</v>

1926
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:50.610
And my question is, why not make it for the better?

1927
01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:58.820
Why not make the past change you for the better? You hear the term,

1928
01:55:59.690 --> 01:56:02.240
you heard the term narrative thrown around these days,

1929
01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:05.330
especially like in political circles,

1930
01:56:05.331 --> 01:56:10.331
you'll hear it on the news that narratives they're created in the political

1931
01:56:11.961 --> 01:56:12.794
arena.

1932
01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.840
And what the narrative does is it supports an overarching

1933
01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:23.420
aim or an overarching value or an overarching goal.

1934
01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:24.891
That's what, that's what,

1935
01:56:24.891 --> 01:56:27.860
that's the way people use the term narrative right now.

1936
01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:32.660
But I'm not talking about that type of political narrative.

1937
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:37.750
What I'm saying here is that you actually write the narrative of what happened

1938
01:56:40.731 --> 01:56:41.570
in your past.

1939
01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:48.150
I'm not talking about a fabrication of it, I'm talking you get the right,

1940
01:56:48.151 --> 01:56:51.540
the narrative of where it takes you. You get to write the narrative,

1941
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:54.660
you get to write the reality of where you end up.

1942
01:56:55.590 --> 01:56:56.423
<v 4>Okay?</v>

1943
01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:58.230
<v 0>You get to write it,</v>

1944
01:57:00.910 --> 01:57:03.460
you get to control it,

1945
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:05.183
<v 4>Huh?</v>

1946
01:57:05.950 --> 01:57:07.960
<v 0>So what I'm saying is [inaudible]</v>

1947
01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:09.100
<v 4>okay,</v>

1948
01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:09.933
<v 0>control it.</v>

1949
01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:14.230
Get control of that narrative.

1950
01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:19.290
Take control of that narrative that Si,

1951
01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:24.320
that horrible story in your past ends the way that you want it to end.

1952
01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:28.260
You control the narrative. You control that story.

1953
01:57:28.290 --> 01:57:30.810
So make that story good,

1954
01:57:31.710 --> 01:57:32.543
<v 4>Huh?</v>

1955
01:57:33.850 --> 01:57:36.340
<v 0>Make that story epic.</v>

1956
01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:41.400
Make that story and make the direction that your life goes.

1957
01:57:42.250 --> 01:57:46.290
Make it at relic.

1958
01:57:53.250 --> 01:57:58.250
And that's how I think you can get control or may be handled better.

1959
01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:03.240
Some of that horrific stuff

1960
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:05.783
that you've been through.

1961
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:12.540
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1962
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:16.200
So Echo Charles',

1963
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:20.430
speaking of being heroic. Yes.

1964
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:25.550
Speaking of controlling our own narrative of the past,

1965
01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:30.750
of the present of the future, what can we do to

1966
01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:37.110
write that heroic story for ourselves? Yes.

1967
01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:41.740
Well let's start with the path.

1968
01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:44.620
I'm gonna stay on the path we're going to get on the path.

1969
01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:49.030
We're going to be on the path. So for the path is Jujitsu, of course,

1970
01:58:49.090 --> 01:58:53.470
like we've said many times you're gonna need to get what you get.

1971
01:58:53.710 --> 01:58:54.880
I got interviewed the other day

1972
01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:00.970
and the guy kind of sets up this kind of big question. Sure.

1973
01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:05.620
He says, you know, in this day and age and I'm not going to do him justice.

1974
01:59:05.621 --> 01:59:09.190
He was a great question. It was a nice question. I get it. Yeah. And I'm not,

1975
01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:11.260
I'm not gonna do it as eloquently as he did it.

1976
01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:14.950
But the real question was about, you know,

1977
01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:18.460
in this day and age when men,

1978
01:59:18.461 --> 01:59:23.461
and it was one of those like men like type things this day and age when men are,

1979
01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:24.761
you know,

1980
01:59:24.761 --> 01:59:28.180
can be isolated and can get depressed and don't have meaning and all this stuff.

1981
01:59:28.181 --> 01:59:33.070
Right. What, what do you know, what do you recommend to men that feel that way,

1982
01:59:33.071 --> 01:59:36.250
that feel isolated and feel alone and feel depressed and feel like they don't

1983
01:59:36.251 --> 01:59:38.800
have meaning in their life and feel like they can't connect with anyone.

1984
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:40.780
And I was like, oh cool. Yeah, go to Jujitsu classes.

1985
01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:47.240
And I felt bad because they wanted me to give like the big found thing about

1986
01:59:49.151 --> 01:59:53.340
where to find meaning in your life. And what I said was, yeah,

1987
01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:56.110
start training Jujitsu. Cause cause the thing that he grabbed me with is like,

1988
01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:59.380
oh, you know, you want you, you want to have a goal, you want to have meaning.

1989
01:59:59.381 --> 02:00:01.300
You want to connect with people. You don't want to be alone,

1990
02:00:01.301 --> 02:00:04.150
loneliness and all this stuff. I'm like, yeah, yeah, go train Jujitsu.

1991
02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:06.700
All of those problems get solved right there dude. Right.

1992
02:00:06.701 --> 02:00:09.220
All of a sudden you got people to hang out with. You've got a mission,

1993
02:00:09.710 --> 02:00:12.310
you got fitness going on, you got meaning.

1994
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:14.560
There's all kinds of good stuff going on. Yeah.

1995
02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:18.670
So go train some Jujitsu is what I'm saying. Yeah. Good place to start.

1996
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:20.360
That's one of those deals too with them.

1997
02:00:20.970 --> 02:00:24.370
Like you leave Jujitsu with something,

1998
02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:29.350
not just fitness and better health and stuff. You leave with like a skill.

1999
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:34.180
It just feeds into your whole soul. Especially man, manliness thing.

2000
02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:39.150
All Man, the capability to defeat another man. Yeah.

2001
02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:40.240
We'll have to see.

2002
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.130
We'll check in with some of our females because when I talked to our female

2003
02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:46.780
Jujitsu practitioners,

2004
02:00:47.290 --> 02:00:52.290
they might even feel a little bit better cause they get to like choke men,

2005
02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:57.070
no doubt about it. So, yeah. Yeah. So,

2006
02:00:57.071 --> 02:01:00.160
so what you were saying basically is try training some Jujitsu look.

2007
02:01:00.161 --> 02:01:04.740
Is it a cure all? Yeah. Kind of, yeah, a little bit. Yeah.

2008
02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:08.800
If you're a certain people in certain situations, I think, yeah, I think so.

2009
02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:13.980
I have a feeling when I leave Jujitsu after I get done training that I feel

2010
02:01:15.011 --> 02:01:17.470
good. Yes sir. Just think about that. Just think about,

2011
02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:20.320
think if I gave you a pill that said, oh, if you just take this pill,

2012
02:01:20.321 --> 02:01:24.120
you'll feel good. You just, you'll just roundly, you'll just feel good. Yeah,

2013
02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.230
but there's no, in fact,

2014
02:01:26.231 --> 02:01:30.190
the only side effects are that you'll be a little healthier and you'll have a,

2015
02:01:30.370 --> 02:01:35.370
you'll have a quality skill that you can utilize in the real world.

2016
02:01:36.370 --> 02:01:40.250
Just take this pill. Would you take the pill? Who wouldn't? Sure.

2017
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.760
<v 1>What I'm saying is you get to go to Jujitsu. Yeah.</v>

2018
02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:46.640
Is it harder than taking a pill? Sure.

2019
02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:51.650
But is it harder to eat a steak or eat a pill? Steak? Technically,

2020
02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:54.380
technically it's an order to eat a steak. Which one would you rather do?

2021
02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:55.310
Eat a stick.

2022
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:58.370
I'd rather eat a steak and I'd rather change a Jitsu than take a pill. Me Too.

2023
02:01:58.400 --> 02:01:59.660
So get on that train.

2024
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:03.610
The jujitsu train kid Honda did use to train and you're going to do gen No-gi,

2025
02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:04.880
so what kind of gear you get?

2026
02:02:04.881 --> 02:02:09.500
You get the best ski question and I realized I liked dramatically interrupting

2027
02:02:09.501 --> 02:02:13.160
you. Sometimes I dig into some things.

2028
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:17.940
So the g origin? Yes.

2029
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:22.990
Origin main.com this is where you can get your g many different options.

2030
02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:24.890
They come out with new ones is pretty cool.

2031
02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:27.770
Pete's very creative with that stuff. Yeah.

2032
02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.480
I encouraged Pete to continue that creativity and keep it on that level as well.

2033
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:34.460
Anyway, go on. Encourage him. No, I don't.

2034
02:02:34.461 --> 02:02:39.140
I encourage all encourage and a compliment as well. So yes,

2035
02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:42.830
origin maine.com you can get your g, you can get a rash guard too if you want.

2036
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:46.620
Also some shirts on there, some joggers and whatnot.

2037
02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:50.300
Supplements as well. What about just for,

2038
02:02:50.301 --> 02:02:54.620
what if you were going to go see a movie, can you wear your g to a movie? Oh,

2039
02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:58.100
well no. Okay.

2040
02:02:58.101 --> 02:03:02.780
Can you wear your g to a dinner date with your wife? No.

2041
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:07.520
No you can't. So what do we do with the origin then go right? Yes.

2042
02:03:07.521 --> 02:03:10.640
Well the good news is we got some American denim,

2043
02:03:12.230 --> 02:03:17.120
we got genes. Genes. Yup. Origin genes. Boom. Yeah, those are good man. Those,

2044
02:03:17.121 --> 02:03:20.690
those came out really, really good. I think those are going to go go places.

2045
02:03:20.691 --> 02:03:21.524
Yeah.

2046
02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:26.740
This one I will give Pete some leeway for his creativity because he did this

2047
02:03:31.011 --> 02:03:33.990
thing with the yolk of the jeans. You don't have the focus now,

2048
02:03:34.230 --> 02:03:35.450
the little piece of,

2049
02:03:35.570 --> 02:03:38.930
it's like right below the waistband and there's two types of different yolks.

2050
02:03:38.931 --> 02:03:42.740
You can have reverse yoke or, or regular yolk, I guess it's called. Anyways,

2051
02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:46.190
it's, it makes it so that the pants fit a certain way.

2052
02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.670
And then he lined up the tops of the pockets with the reverse yolk,

2053
02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:55.530
which means that they're slanted a little bit like the old school Vietnam, uh,

2054
02:03:55.820 --> 02:04:00.440
pockets. Okay. So anyways, that's cool.

2055
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:03.650
They're legit. Yeah, they're, they're just like a little bit, you know what?

2056
02:04:03.650 --> 02:04:05.810
I was like gathering tails going on, gathering that.

2057
02:04:05.811 --> 02:04:09.780
You're starting to appreciate pizza fashion sense. That's what I'm gathering.

2058
02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:12.920
You're crazy. I'm saying occasionally. No, no, no, no. Cause here's the deal.

2059
02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:16.010
The pockets, because they're at a little angle there.

2060
02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:21.200
They're easier to get your hand in and out of which what I'm saying is there is

2061
02:04:21.891 --> 02:04:25.670
a functionality because if it didn't, if it wasn't functional,

2062
02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:27.740
I wouldn't be talking about it right now. No,

2063
02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:30.330
because we don't talk about things like that, but they look dope.

2064
02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:31.161
It's what I'm saying.

2065
02:04:31.161 --> 02:04:35.030
I think you're starting to appreciate that on I'm saying is I think,

2066
02:04:35.090 --> 02:04:37.860
I think Pete did it not for functionality.

2067
02:04:37.890 --> 02:04:42.890
I think Pete did it because it looked cool and then I commend his creativity

2068
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:46.500
because not because it looked cool,

2069
02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:51.120
but because it provides a level of functionality that does not previously exist

2070
02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:55.290
in jeans anywhere. Boom. So I agree with you.

2071
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:59.520
I agree with the whole deal. The whole Gig and man. Yeah. Cha Yeah,

2072
02:04:59.521 --> 02:05:02.880
those are good American denim by the way. All made in America. Yes.

2073
02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:06.150
Cotton is made in America grown. What about the, uh,

2074
02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:10.260
things that you put you fastened the um, with your waist. With the button? Yeah,

2075
02:05:10.261 --> 02:05:14.220
the button word Compton.

2076
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:15.750
Just look at a picture of the buttons.

2077
02:05:15.751 --> 02:05:19.350
That's enough to be like all sold to begin with. They're pretty dope.

2078
02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:20.940
They're very dope actually.

2079
02:05:20.941 --> 02:05:23.700
Plus we've got supplements as you were just about to say. Yeah. Supplements.

2080
02:05:23.701 --> 02:05:27.100
Important supplements. Not this mega mass. Fuck.

2081
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:31.970
What was that one for the old school [inaudible] number nonetheless.

2082
02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:32.820
It's not like that.

2083
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:36.900
Well I guess Kinda Cause Moke is additional print weight cleaner,

2084
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:41.360
clean protein, slow release. Braden did a really good, um,

2085
02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:46.650
but let's face it. It just tastes good. Yes, it tastes good.

2086
02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:49.770
That might be, what's that word?

2087
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:53.310
That might be the number one priority or the number one benefit.

2088
02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:57.450
The fact that it's the best protein you can actually get is awesome too. Yeah.

2089
02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:01.210
Cool. Well, you can eat a steak if you want protein as well. So there's,

2090
02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.540
there's various, you can always eat a steak. That's the problem.

2091
02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:06.780
Sometimes you're like on the go. Sometimes you got to get,

2092
02:06:06.930 --> 02:06:10.590
sometimes it's you got work to do. You have time to eat a steak.

2093
02:06:10.650 --> 02:06:13.800
Sometimes you just want a dessert too. Let's face it. Come on Bro.

2094
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:17.940
Let's face it. So boom, fully facing it. There you go. So yeah,

2095
02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:21.090
some monkeys like that, but the SA, the joint warfare, Krill oil,

2096
02:06:21.091 --> 02:06:24.270
these are for your joints. Keep your joints in the game if you're for real,

2097
02:06:24.271 --> 02:06:28.050
getting after it like especially in the gym and doing Jujitsu,

2098
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:29.860
man knows the joint warfarin.

2099
02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:33.270
The krill oil is gonna keep you in the game big times. Can help you out a lot.

2100
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:38.280
Huge time. As we say, don't forget about the warrior kid milk as well. Yeah.

2101
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:39.271
Which is,

2102
02:06:39.271 --> 02:06:44.271
which is tasty and why not feed your kids something that's actually going to be

2103
02:06:46.231 --> 02:06:50.580
good for them instead of feeding them literal poison. Yeah.

2104
02:06:50.850 --> 02:06:55.200
Gummy bears. Yeah. Sugar for sure. Crap. Unless yes,

2105
02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:56.250
and discipline as well.

2106
02:06:56.251 --> 02:07:01.080
If he wants some cognitive enhancing elements infused into your brain,

2107
02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:03.330
get some discipline. That's a good one.

2108
02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:05.370
Get yourself some Jocko white tea as well. Yeah.

2109
02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:09.600
That's if you want to have a massive dead lift in excess of 8,000 pounds.

2110
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:12.690
Check. Yeah. Also it's certified organic.

2111
02:07:12.691 --> 02:07:17.310
So that's something also we have a store, it's called Choco store.

2112
02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:21.660
You can get the tee on the store. Two, we have the t on the store. Um,

2113
02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:24.750
but also on the store dollar store.com.

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:29.310
This is where you can get a shirts if you want to represent on the path.

2115
02:07:29.311 --> 02:07:32.790
Discipline equals freedom. Even get after it. You know, simple stuff.

2116
02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:37.880
I chose quality over cheap quantity.

2117
02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:43.450
Sure. So when you get the shirt should be as it should be, right?

2118
02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:46.690
So if you get this shirt and you recognize that, Dang this,

2119
02:07:46.691 --> 02:07:51.070
this could very well be my favorite shirt just to wear just the fit in the

2120
02:07:51.071 --> 02:07:54.730
field. The shirt, I won't be surprised. In fact, I'd be surprised if it's not.

2121
02:07:55.090 --> 02:07:57.750
That's my opinion. And the last is good stuff on there.

2122
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:59.710
There's rash guards on there, some hats,

2166
02:10:39.651 --> 02:10:42.540
maybe three levels higher than the poster is like, you know,

2167
02:10:42.590 --> 02:10:47.570
can you hang on your wall in your home, in your office? Clearly you could,

2168
02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:49.430
you can put these things up. They are legit.

2169
02:10:49.460 --> 02:10:51.800
And we've got some warrior kid posters, uh,

which is called Mark's mission.

2183
02:11:40.050 --> 02:11:43.530
These books are good and these are the books I wish I had when I was a kid.

2184
02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:47.550
They would just put me on the path at a younger age. Mikey and the dragons.

2185
02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:50.370
You can order that one now as well.

2186

That is for a little bit younger age. Maybe three, four, five, six,

2190
02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:11.110
Our answer is answered in that book. The discipline equals freedom field manual.

2191
02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:15.790
How to get after it. The audio version is not on audible,

about my personal operating system. If you have questions about leadership,

2195

checkout, extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership.

2196

2198
02:12:41.771 --> 02:12:46.771
take those experiences and apply them to the leadership in your life and world.

2199
02:12:48.550 --> 02:12:51.460

2223
02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:39.960
those of you in the armed services who put your honor and duty above yourselves

2224
02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:44.160
and protect freedom around the world and to all the police officers and law

2225

secret service, and all the other first responders.

Each of you do the same.

2229
02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:05.250
You placed the welfare of others above the welfare of yourself in order to keep

2230

us safe. So thanks for what you do

2240
02:15:37.190 --> 02:15:41.270
You give yourself the role that you want. Make your

2241
02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:46.250
fonts in that story filled with discipline

2242
02:15:48.130 --> 02:15:49.300
and make your actions,

2243
02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:53.620

2244
02:15:55.880 --> 02:16:00.140
Then step out into the world and get after it

2245
