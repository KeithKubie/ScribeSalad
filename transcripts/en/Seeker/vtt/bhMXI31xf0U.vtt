00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:10.190
I hear the new iPhone’s got an amazing sexting
camera...I mean selfie cam.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.490
Hi everyone it’s Ali for D News.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.690
Sexting is super controversial and yet it
happens all the time!

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.310
Sexting = sex + texting.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.360
But this can mean a lot of things.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.450
Dirty talk over texts, risque photos, or stripping
selfies.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.350
Today I’m going to focus on sending and
receiving nudie pics.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.720
In a recent review of the research, Deakin
University psychologists discovered that 12%

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.180
of teenagers send dirty digital images and
around 12% of teens receive them.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.930
The data skyrockets when you look at young
adults - almost 49% of young adults send and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.559
57% receive sexts.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.500
That’s a lot of naughty bits getting sent
around the interwebs!

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.260
People who do this aren’t dumb, they know
bad things can happen.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.620
75% of teens and and 71% of young adults understand
the consequences.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.659
Private photos could get passed along to other
people and that might lead to bullying and

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.520
sexual abuse, your phone could be hacked and
things get leaked to the public, your ex could

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.420
blackmail you, as former congressman Anthony
Weiner taught us, you can lose your job over

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.200
a sext, and if you’re under 18 you might
get sent to jail for having “child porn”.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.819
Just think about that for a moment - in most
states two consenting 16 year olds can have

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.240
sex but if they take photos they’re breaking
the law.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.049
Some states are trying to change the laws
on sexting so if minors are caught they have

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.439
to pay a fine, do community service, and attend
a prevention program.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.670
Embarrassing yes, but better than a criminal
offense.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.500
There’s no one reason why people sext.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.450
85% do it to because they want to start sexy
time.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.490
80% want attention from their partner.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.389
65% are just flirting.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:55.389
30% send sexts because they’re pressured
to.

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:59.559
It’s not just people who are hooking up
- a lot of couples in long term relationships

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:03.039
send naked photos to stay connected when they’re
away from each other.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.630
You’ve heard the horror stories - someone,
usually a woman, is pressured into sending

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.200
a nude photo, and then that photo gets shared
all over the place.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.069
That does happen - about 17% of people who
receive a sext share it with their friends

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.250
to show off, make a joke, or do it out of
boredom.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.180
And yes, it seems like males are more likely
to pressure females by sending them texts

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.300
like, “Show me your boobs!

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.540
You’re only sending it to me.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.239
I’ll delete it after I see it!

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.930
Don’t be all stuck up”.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.090
Giving in to the pressure is risky.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.920
Social media makes it easy to share photos
and people can this without having to interact

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.349
with you in person.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.819
That removes empathy and guilt from the equation
which would normally keep people from breaking

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.000
your trust.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.549
But most sexts end up just where they’re
supposed to.

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.980
Under the right circumstances, sexy texts
can lead to a sexy relationship.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.430
Drexel University’s Emily Stasko and Pamela
Geller recently completed a study of 870 adults

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.180
between the ages of 18 and 82.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.540
Yes - senior citizens sext too, don’t be
all agist people!

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.300
What they found is not only did 88% of their
sample try sexting at least once in their

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.049
lives, but those who did had higher levels
of sexual satisfaction.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.019
This relationship was stronger for those in
committed relationships as long as the both

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.139
wanted to dabble in some smartphone sexiness.

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.379
If one person wanted to sext but the other
didn’t, it was related to lower levels of

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.379
satisfaction.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.939
If this finding continues to pan out in future
studies, then sexting might get incorporated

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.160
into couples therapy as a way of increasing
intimacy.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.620
Sexting is here to stay folks.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.989
It’s easy to do and our culture is beginning
to change its views on nude images.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.769
That’s why the Miss America CEO recently
apologized to Vanessa Williams for taking

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.750
away her crown 32 years ago after nude photos
of her were published.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.499
The real issue is consent - is this something
both individuals want to do or is something

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:03.120
you are being pressured to do?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.310
If you think about it like that, then sexting
is just another aspect of normal human sexual

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.920
behavior and part of a larger discussion we
need to have about consent.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.340
What do you think about sexting?
