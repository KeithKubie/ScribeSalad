00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.720
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.430
and your eyes are watching me,
but Their Eyes Are Watching God.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.010
I’d like to apologize to my friends and
family for that joke.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.850
Anyway today we’re discussing Zora Neale
Hurston’s brilliant novel

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.980
of a woman’s self-realization and empowerment.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.660
Or, possibly, a cautionary tale about the importance of the rabies vaccine. Your call, really.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:29.540
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.619
Great books can stand up to multiple readings.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.989
Anyway, today we’re going to be discussing
a little bit of Thurston’s biography.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.340
MFTP: Mr Green, Mr Green, no no no, you said
that authors’ biographies don’t matter,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.090
because the author is irrelevant.
Only the text matters.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.680
Oh, Me From The Past, how I haven’t missed
you.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.320
So, OK. When we’re studying literature,
we’re not just thinking about texts.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.219
We’re also thinking about how to think about
texts.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.019
Like, should we read a novel in its historical
context, or consider the life of its author?

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.960
Or only look at the book itself?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.880
In considering a book’s meaning should we privilege character, or plot, or symbols, or language?

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.680
And also how do our own experiences and biases
shape our readings?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.079
Now, I often argue against focusing too much
on the life of an author,

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.259
not least because I am one, and don’t enjoy
people peering too much into my personal history.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.979
But in this particular case we are going to
consider the life of Zora Neale Hurston,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.860
both because it’s important to take many different perspectives when trying to learn to read critically,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.600
and because her life was uncommonly important
to her masterpiece.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.280
So, Zora Neale Hurston was born in Alabama in 1891, but her family soon moved to Eatonville, Florida,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.200
the first all-black incorporated township
in the United States

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.160
and the model for the town of the same name
in Their Eyes Were Watching God.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.190
You know what? Let’s just go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.060
Hurston described Eatonville as “the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.060
300 good swimmers, plenty guavas, two schools,
and no jailhouse.”

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.600
After her mother died and her father remarried,
she was sent away to school,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.510
but her father stopped paying her tuition.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.619
As a teenager, Hurston did a bunch of odd
jobs,

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.119
and then signed on as a maid for the lead
singer for a traveling theatrical troupe.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.420
And a decade later, she surfaced in Baltimore, erased 10 years from her age and finished high school.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.500
She enrolled in Howard University, then transferred
to Barnard College.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.729
And after graduating in 1928, she began coursework
for a PhD in anthropology at Columbia University,

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:17.769
while also contributing to the the Harlem
Renaissance with our old friend Langston Hughes.

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.429
Hurston wrote short stories, plays, a few
novels, two highly regarded works of anthropology,

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:27.380
and an award-winning autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, some of which she almost certainly made up.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.060
But her books never sold that well during
her lifetime,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.659
and in later life she returned to Florida
and worked as a substitute teacher and a maid.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.510
She died of a heart attack in 1960 and was
buried in an unmarked grave.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.950
In 1973 the novelist Alice Walker found that
grave and paid for a headstone inscribed:

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.920
“Zora Neale Hurston:
A Genius of the South.”

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.340
Walker then wrote an article about it in Ms. Magazine, which helped spur renewed interest in Hurston’s work.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.860
According to her autobiography, Hurston wrote Their Eyes Were Watching God in seven weeks, quote,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.879
“under internal pressure” while on a Guggenheim
Fellowship to Haiti to study the local folklore.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.599
Oh man, seven weeks! I hope that’s one of
the lies in her autobiography.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.019
But actually Hurston didn’t think much of
the novel.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.299
She wrote,“I wish that I could write it
again...I regret all of my books.”

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.340
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So, one last biographical note:

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.830
The internal pressure she mentions probably
refers to an unhappy love affair with

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.190
a much younger Columbia student who wanted her to give up her career to become a pastor’s wife.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.760
Which wasn’t going to happen.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.000
OK, now to the book. So, Their Eyes Were Watching
God straddles at least a couple of genres.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.030
It is part bildungsroman.
But it can also be read as a romance,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.700
in which the heroine, Janie Mae Crawford finally finds perfect love with her third husband Tea Cake.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.799
Well, it’s perfect love until Tea Cake is
bitten by a rabid dog in the middle of a hurricane,

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.870
and then Janie has to shoot him.
Classic love story.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.500
The book initially received mixed reviews, including a pretty damning one from the great novelist Richard Wright,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.340
who wrote that it wasn’t political enough:

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.629
“The sensory sweep of her novel carries
no theme, no message, no thought…

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.379
Miss Hurston seems to have no desire whatsoever
to move in the direction of serious fiction…

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.269
Her characters eat and laugh and cry and work
and kill;

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:07.200
they swing like a pendulum eternally on that safe and narrow orbit in which America likes to see the Negro live:

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.560
between Laughter and tears.”
Wow.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.390
So, I think what Wright missed in the novel
is that,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.630
as a later generation of feminists would insist,
that the personal is political.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.280
Their Eyes Were Watching God has a few moments
of explicit political commentary,

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.760
like in the aftermath of the hurricane when white men order black workers to bury the white corpses in coffins

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.380
and throw the black ones in a hole with quicklime.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.240
But this book isn’t story about politics or race as much as it is about Janie’s emancipation —

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.940
or if you read the book skeptically, her inability
to emancipate herself.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.020
Which involves politics and race.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.380
As Hurston wrote in her autobiography, she didn’t really want to write about what she called the “Race Problem.”

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.100
Quote: “My interest lies in what makes a man or a woman do such-and-so, regardless of his color,”

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.640
But, of course, Thurston also understood,
that the in the America she was writing about,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.170
race was part of what made a man or a woman
do such and so.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.250
The novel was also initially criticized for its use of vernacular speech and nonstandard spelling.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.880
As you can see reading it, Hurston uses a very different authorial voice from the voice that she gives to Janie.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.800
Like, the narrator’s first words are:

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.350
“Ships at a distance have every man's wish
on board. For some they come in with the tide.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.260
For others they sail forever on the same horizon,
never out of sight,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.640
never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.980
That is the life of men.”

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.930
Whereas, Janie’s first words are,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.500
“Aw, pretty good, Ah’m tryin’ to soak some uh de tiredness and de dirt outa mah feet.”

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.760
So Hurston isn’t trying to brag about how much smarter and better educated she was than her characters.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.780
Don’t forget, her academic background was
in anthropology

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.570
and a lot of her fieldwork involved going
into communities in the South and in the Caribbean

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.650
to record local songs and stories.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.850
And she placed a value in how people expressed
themselves —

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.360
the humor, the inventiveness, the liveliness of language — and her work can be read as a tribute to that.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.320
But the different kinds of speech are also,
as the scholar Henry Louis Gates points out,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.960
a way of acknowledging that there is often a gap between what characters think and how they express themselves.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.900
As Gates writes, “[Hurston’s] is a rhetoric of division, rather than a fiction of psychological or cultural unity.”

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.260
Still, just because the words the characters
use are simple, and sometimes misunderstood,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.560
that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a great
depth of feeling behind them.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.590
And, in fact, I’d argue that Janie’s level
of sophistication matches the author’s,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.020
even if the voice is different.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:28.160
So, the story begins with a 40-year-old Janie returning to Eatonville and telling the story of her life to her best friend, Pheoby.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.800
Janie grows up as the pet of a white family
for which her grandmother worked.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.580
Her grandmother, a former slave, marries Janie
off to a much older man at 16.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.880
Both Janie and her mother were conceived in rape, so when Janie shows signs of sexual awakening,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.840
her grandmother wants to get her married immediately
to the richest man around.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.420
A lot of this sexual awakening takes place while Janie is lying dreaming under a pear tree and sees, quote:

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:58.340
“the ecstatic shiver of the tree from root to tiniest branch creaming in every blossom and frothing with delight,”

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.020
which is pretty much as sexy as botany gets.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.420
But Janie is disgusted by her first husband.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.500
And it doesn’t matter that he owns 60 acres
of land, and has an organ in his parlor.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.230
His feet smell and he’s no pear tree in
general.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.510
So when she meets another man, Joe Starks,
also somewhat older,

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.540
but more stylish and a smooth talker, she
runs away with him.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.880
Joe takes her to Eatonville where he soon becomes mayor and Janie get to enjoy the high status of “Mrs. Mayor.”

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.700
But he belittles her in front of others.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.070
He beats her at least once and this, and in
one of the book’s great metaphorical gestures,

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.870
Joe frees a mule, but he never frees Janie.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.110
And then, after Joe’s death, Janie takes
up with a much younger man called Tea Cake.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.020
Tea Cake isn’t rich and he isn’t powerful,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.480
but he offers Janie a lot of what's been missing
from her earlier marriages: fun.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.580
He makes her laugh, he plays songs for her
on the guitar,

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.110
he teaches her how to drive, he brings her
to the Everglades, because, quote:

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.430
“Folks don't do nothin' down dere but make
money and fun and foolishness.”

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.640
And they have a great time until that hurricane
and that rabid dog and Tea Cake going crazy

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.740
and Janie having to shoot him to save herself
while he’s busy biting at her arm.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.920
After being acquitted of Tea Cake's murder,
she throws him a lavish funeral,

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.660
and then heads home to Eatonville in her muddy
overalls, happy because,

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.940
as she tells Pheoby, she's been "to the horizon
and back."

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.340
Which is a fascinating phrase, because the
horizon, of course,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.220
definitionally is a place that you can’t
get to, let alone get back from.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.970
It’s one of the most discussed lines in
the book.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.310
Some take to mean she has finally achieved
her own selfhood.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.870
Others take it to mean that she’s about
to die of rabies.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.740
Once the book was rediscovered, early critics, following Alice Walker, mainly chose the empowerment reading.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.540
Walker even wrote a poem that begins, “I
love the way Janie Crawford left her husbands.”

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.020
This reading suggests that Janie eventually
comes into her own voice and her own authority,

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.060
and that it’s separate from her husbands.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.600
She doesn’t get it from her first husband’s
wealth, or from her second husband’s power,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.380
but instead, through love.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.680
And then, In recounting her life story to
Pheoby she has learned to speak for herself,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.030
to put herself at the center of her own story,

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.310
and it’s suggested that Pheoby might become
empowered in turn.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:03.140
Or at least a little. I mean, Pheoby says she’s become 10 feet higher just from listening to Janie.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.960
But in the last couple of decades, there’s been some push back against those earlier readings.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.240
Some critics note that Janie is more often
passive than active.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.560
I mean, she only leaves one husband.
The others have a way of dying.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.910
I mean I guess she had agency in her relationship
with Tea Cake,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.430
but only in the sense that she was choosing
between killing him and dying of rabies.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.490
And also, if we’re going to say that Janie establishes authority over herself by telling her own story,

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.390
then we need to acknowledge that Janie herself
discounts the power of the spoken word.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.520
I mean, in one of my favorite lines in the book, she tells Phoebe that you've gotta go there to know there.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.230
And there are also questions about Tea Cake
as a romantic hero.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.010
I mean yes, he seems like a fun guy, but he
takes Janie’s money without asking,

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.030
and uses it to throw a party that he doesn’t
invite her to.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.360
Later he beats her, out of a desire to prove
his ownership of her.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.990
So life with Tea Cake has a deeply ugly side.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.830
And it’s worth remembering that Tea Cake has to die before Janie can return to Eatonville on her own terms.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.610
I’m not going to try to argue for one reading
over another,

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.750
because I think what makes Their Eyes Were Watching God such a major American novel is its complexity.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:10.840
It doesn’t offer an easy answer for how a woman with Janie’s life can achieve complete independence, or full selfhood.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.600
I mean her last thoughts of the novel are
not, “finally, I have achieved selfhood!”

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.660
Instead, she’s thinking about Tea Cake.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:21.960
Will she go through life alone, will she find another man or will she remain wedded to Tea Cake’s memory?

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.740
Or because of his dying, rabid gesture, biting
her in the arm,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.880
there are some very skeptical critics who think it won’t be long before she Janie dies herself.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.800
And yet, Their Eyes Were Watching God is one of the very few novels of this period that is

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.820
centered around a woman speaking for herself and achieving an understanding of her own life —

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.880
complete with the feet, and the mules, and
the hurricanes, all of it.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.640
And it is that richness and complexity that
makes the novel so special.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.510
Thanks for watching, and watch out for rabid
dogs. Also sexy pear trees.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.260
