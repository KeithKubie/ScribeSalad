00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.210
Entrance to the paint
ball court costs $5,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.600
and paint balls are
paid for separately.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.830
A ticket for entrance with 5
balls, for example, costs $8.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.330
So let's define
some variables here.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.600
Let's let p equal
the price that I'm

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.570
paying for admission
and the balls.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.002
And let's let b equal the number
of balls-- number of balls.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.460
And we know that
the price is going

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.126
to be a function of
the number of balls.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.790
We could make a
little table here.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.080
So let's make a table where,
for a given number of balls,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.320
let's figure out what
the price is going to be.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.300
So let's just start at 0 balls.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.420
If we have 0 balls,
we have to pay just

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.430
to get into the paint ball
court, and that costs us $5.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.910
Now they tell us a ticket
for entrance with 5 balls--

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.300
so now we have
entrance and 5 balls--

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.340
this is going to cost $8.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.010
So let's think about what the
incremental price per ball

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.510
here.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.760
And we're going to assume
that the price per ball

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.500
is constant after you pay
for admission, after you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.610
pay this first $5.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.140
So What's.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.100
The price per ball?

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.209
Well, when our number
of balls increase by 5,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:12.060
our price increases by
$3-- by $3, so plus 3.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.380
So we could say
our change in price

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.460
over the change in the number
of balls is equal to our change

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.800
in price is $3, when our
change in the balls are 5.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.000
So this right over
here, you could

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.440
view this as your
unit price per ball--

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.030
your unit rate of change
of price per ball.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.500
This is going to be $0.60
per ball-- $0.60 per ball.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.810
So let's think about
constructing an equation that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.249
represents how much we will
pay as a function of balls.

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.540
And we could write it in
function notation, if we like.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.460
We could write price
as a function of balls

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.219
is going to be equal to.

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.010
Well, you're going to
start off just paying

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.030
$5 just for getting
into the place.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.825
So you're going to
start off getting $5,

00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:56.200
and then you're
going to pay more

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.140
depending on the number
of balls you get.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.552
And you're going to
pay $0.60 per ball.

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:01.760
You see that right over here.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.400
When you've got 5
balls, you paid $3.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.259
$3 for 5 balls is the same
thing as $0.60 per ball.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.290
So you're then going to pay
$0.60 per ball after that.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.650
So this right over here is
the equation that represents--

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.210
or that's a way of defining
price as a function of balls.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.560
And we can also try to graph it.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.940
So let's do that.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.830
So let's actually try
to graph it, as well.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.050
So that's our price
axis, our vertical axis.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.930
And let's say this is
the number of balls axis.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.010
So this is balls, and this
is price as a function--

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.760
as a function of balls.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.189
So when the balls are 0--
let me do this in a color

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:41.980
I haven't used yet.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.480
When the balls are 0, the price,
we've already seen, is $5.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.960
Let's say this is $5,
this is $10, this is $15.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.000
So when we have 0 balls,
we're going to pay $5.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.440
And then when you see when
we have 5 balls-- so let's

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.570
say that this is 5 right over
here-- when you have 5 balls,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.260
we paid $8, which gets
us right around here.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.500
And two points define a
line, so this function

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.812
is a linear function, and it
would look something like this.

00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:15.770
And if you ask, what is
the slope of this line?

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.650
Well, the slope is
the rate of change

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.640
of the vertical axis with
respect to the horizontal axis.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.680
So what is that?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.060
So in the horizontal
axis-- and frankly,

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.140
we've already calculated this.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.070
When the horizontal axis changed
by 5, when your change in b

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:39.450
is equal to 5, your vertical
axis-- so your vertical axis.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.020
So your change in
price was equal to $3.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.170
So your change in
price over your change

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.090
in the number of
balls, which would

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.150
be the change in
the vertical axis

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.030
over the change in the
horizontal axis, which

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.620
is the definition of slope.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.430
It's a way of defining the
inclination of this line.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.830
That is going to be equal
to 3 over 5-- 3 over 5,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.586
which is exactly what we
calculated right over here,

00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:07.710
just thinking about it in
a slightly different way.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.570
Now we've thought about
this in multiple ways.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.445
Let's actually try to
answer their questions.

00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:14.190
Let's figure out which
of these actually apply.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.870
So the first is that the
relationship is proportional.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.649
So if we had a proportional
relationship between the two,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.200
this function would
look like this.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.030
It would be p is equal
to some constant times

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.260
the number of balls.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.790
And by definition, in a
proportional relationship--

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.340
in a proportional relationship--
when your number of balls is 0,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.262
price would be 0.

00:04:32.262 --> 00:04:33.970
And that's not the
scenario we have here.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.030
When your balls are 0,
you're still paying $5.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.030
So this, this is
not-- this is not--

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.060
a proportional relationship.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.500
Next statement-- entrance
with 10 balls cost $16.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.860
Well, we can test that out.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.470
When b equals 10-- So the price
for 10 balls is going to be

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.070
equal to 5 plus 0.60 times 10.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.670
Well, this is 5 plus 6,
which is equal to 11, not 10.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.310
So this isn't right, either.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.930
When the number of
balls increases by 11,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.950
the price increases by $6.60.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.890
So remember, the change
in price over the change

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.110
in the number of
balls is going to be

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.311
equal to-- let we get it
right in a good color here.

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:19.310
So let me write it here.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.900
The change in price over the
change in the number of balls

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.880
is always going to
be equal to 3/5.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.880
And so, they say number
of balls increases by 11.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.730
So 3/5 is equal to what over 11?

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.820
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.570
So 3/5 is equal to-- well,
let's write it this way.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.940
3/5 is the same
thing as 0.6, so let

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.176
me write this-- 0.6 is equal
to the price change over 11.

00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:51.050
And I'll just write that
as a question mark--

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.060
as a question mark over 11.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.430
You multiply both
sides by 11, you

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.550
get 6.6 is equal
to question mark.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.860
So this is absolutely true.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.420
The price increases by $6.60
when the number of balls

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.540
increases by 11.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.240
So this one right over
here is absolutely true.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.430
And then finally, when
the x-axis represents

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.330
the number of paint
balls, the slope

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.020
of the graph of the
relationship is 5/3.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.980
Well here, we did
represent the x-axis

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.380
as the number of paint
balls-- or the horizontal axis

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.100
as the number of paint balls--
but our slope wasn't 5/3.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.600
It was 3/5.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.980
So this last statement
is absolutely not right.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.880
So this is the only one
that we can say applies.
