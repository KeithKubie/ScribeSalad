00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.667
(glitchy music)

00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:07.699
- Here he is.

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:10.216
That's Dan Morrison.

00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:12.107
- Who's that?

00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:14.630
- That's the guy Busy cheated with.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.686
(aggressive rock music)

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:19.779
- Wait, dude, okay, look,
listen, this is not a good idea.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:20.934
Okay, I know what you're doing,

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:22.629
I know I said I wanted crazy *mashback,

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:23.950
but this is the wrong way to go, dude.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.950
- [Jason] I'll be right back, Walter.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.783
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:27.927
It's a bad idea, dude!

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.178
- [Jason] Hey!

00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:30.011
- Hey, dog, funny.*

00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:31.685
- Yeah, you can tell me
how this tastes for lunch!

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:32.972
- Oh!

00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:35.813
- [Andy] Oh, my God,
dude, are you all right?

00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:37.113
- What the fuck, man?

00:00:37.113 --> 00:00:38.472
Why'd you hit me?

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.184
- Stay away from my wife, Dan.

00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:41.017
- Dan?

00:00:41.017 --> 00:00:42.028
Dan, you gotta get out of here.

00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:43.841
- I'm not Dan, I'm Bill.

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:44.837
- [Dan] I'm almost done with this--

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:45.670
- [Jason] Huh?

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.603
- [Bill] I'm not Dan, I'm Bill!

00:00:46.603 --> 00:00:50.555
- Oh my God, oh my God, what
did you do, what did you do?

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:52.569
Are you all right, Bill?
- He hit me, he hit me!

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:53.753
- Oh, my God, you got the wrong guy.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:55.367
I'm Dan, this is Bill.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:56.282
- [Bill] Oh.

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:57.225
- [Dan] You hit the wrong guy.

00:00:57.225 --> 00:00:58.561
- [Bill] What did you do this for?

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.165
- You hit a guy with cancer.

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:02.383
He's got cancer.

00:01:02.383 --> 00:01:04.195
- Really?
- Yes.

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:05.028
- But I--

00:01:06.658 --> 00:01:08.641
- We met a ton of times.

00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:10.976
You don't recognize me?
- Really?

00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:13.972
- Yeah, like 20, you came to my wedding.

00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:14.863
- [Jason] I did?

00:01:14.863 --> 00:01:15.696
- Yes!

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:16.937
You came to my wedding.

00:01:16.937 --> 00:01:18.027
- [Jason] I don't remember.

00:01:18.027 --> 00:01:21.779
- Are you that self-involved, Jason, huh?

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.531
That you don't even recognize
the guy you're beating up?

00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:28.156
- Well, listen, you guys, I
mean, you look exactly alike.

00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:29.304
- Not really, actually.

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:30.886
- No, not at all.
- We look nothing alike,

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:32.178
just 'cause we're bald?

00:01:32.178 --> 00:01:33.011
- Shut up, Walter.

00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:33.886
- Yeah, you could throw me in, am I--

00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:35.420
- Yeah, do we look alike?
- All right, that's enough.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.811
Okay, you shut it right now.

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:37.948
You fooled around with my wife.

00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:39.999
And that's unacceptable.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.582
Unacceptable to me.

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.824
I'm sorry I hit your
friend who has cancer.

00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:46.674
- It's okay, I just lost
my cool for a second.

00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:48.613
You know what, I'm in
remission five years,

00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:49.788
thank God for that.

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:50.645
- Five years?

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:53.020
I mean, you don't really
have cancer anymore, right?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.062
You're kinda--

00:01:54.062 --> 00:01:55.076
- Yes, it's cancer.

00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:56.325
- Of course it's cancer.

00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:57.857
- Just, I live a life of fear.

00:01:57.857 --> 00:01:59.080
- [Walter] You're kinda
in the clear, though.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.146
I mean, right?
- I'm not in the clear.

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:01.171
- [Walter] You're kinda
milking it a little, no?

00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:02.412
- You do kinda use it
as a crutch sometimes.

00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:06.079
- All right, that's enough, that's enough!

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.724
Okay, well, you stay away
from my wife, all right?

00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:09.390
You got that?
- Yes.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.223
- Okay?
- Of course.

00:02:10.223 --> 00:02:12.249
- Or I'll come back, I hit
your friend in the face again,

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.712
who may or may not have cancer.

00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:16.587
- He has--
- I have cancer.

00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:17.995
- Definitely, definitely has it.

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:18.936
- Not as much anymore.

00:02:18.936 --> 00:02:21.706
- Okay, you know what, you can
just calm down, Andy, okay?

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:24.289
(upbeat music)
