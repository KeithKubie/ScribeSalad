00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:05.949
These are sounds.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:07.780
Sounds are our way
of communication.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.030
Our way of understanding.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.560
Have you ever thought

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.465
that your voice
sounds much better in the bath?

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:16.111
What is the extent of teachers' rights?

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.425
What if you could become something like 
an animal? Is that possible?

00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:22.884
What separates those who primarily 
have an idea

00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:26.054
and those who want to bring it to life
is simple.

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:30.776
A society assumes that that is the story
of every black man walking the Earth.

00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:34.218
It is assumed that that is my story,
before I even begin to tell it.

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:38.044
Because everything I've just told you 
so far is a lie and I just made it all up.

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:41.114
My talk is actually about the art of lying
and convincing people

00:00:41.114 --> 00:00:42.704
that what you're saying is true.

00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:46.200
We've developed technologies to give 
ourselves more and more pleasure.

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:50.417
We're turning into a world like 
the "Brave New World" of Aldous Huxley .

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:08.891
This is Ted-ED and this is what we do.
