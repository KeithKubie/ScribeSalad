00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.840
What I want to do in
this video is resimplify

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.610
this expression, 3 times the
principal root of 500 times x

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.760
to the third, and take
into consideration

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.730
some of the comments that
we got out on YouTube

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.900
that actually give some
interesting perspective

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.230
on how you could simplify this.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.702
So just as a quick review of
what we did in the last video,

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:19.160
we said that this
is the same thing

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.254
as 3 times the
principal root of 500.

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.420
And I'm going to do it a
little bit different than I

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.334
did in the last video, just
to make it interesting.

00:00:27.334 --> 00:00:28.750
This is 3 times
the principal root

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.310
of 500 times the principal
root of x to the third.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.960
And 500-- we can
rewrite it, because 500

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.140
is not a perfect square.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.040
We can rewrite 500
as 100 times 5.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.300
Or even better, we could rewrite
that as 10 squared times 5.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.680
10 squared is the
same thing as 100.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.840
So we can rewrite this first
part over here as 3 times

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.180
the principal root
of 10 squared times

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.860
5 times the principal
root of x squared times x.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.920
That's the same thing
as x to the third.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.106
Now, the one thing I'm
going to do here-- actually,

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:07.490
I won't talk about
it just yet, of how

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.650
we're going to do it
differently than we did it

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.880
in the last video.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.990
This radical right
here can be rewritten

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.441
as-- so this is going to
be 3 times the square root,

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.940
or the principal
root, I should say,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.090
of 10 squared times
the square root of 5.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.860
If we take the square root
of the product of two things,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.401
it's the same thing as taking
the square root of each of them

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:26.662
and then taking the product.

00:01:26.662 --> 00:01:28.120
And so then this
over here is going

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.760
to be times the square root
of, or the principal root of,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.110
x squared times the
principal root of x.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.150
And the principal root
of 10 squared is 10.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.930
And then what I said
in the last video

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.290
is that the principal
root of x squared

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.990
is going to be the absolute
value of x, just in case x

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.090
itself is a negative number.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.800
And so then if you
simplify all of this,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.685
you get 3 times
10, which is 30--

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:57.560
and I'm just going to
switch the order here--

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.470
times the absolute value of x.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.250
And then you have
the square root of 5,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.800
or the principal root of 5,
times the principal root of x.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.880
And this is just going to be
equal to the principal root

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.160
of 5x.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.700
Taking the square
root of something

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.199
and multiplying that times the
square root of something else

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.910
is the same thing as just
taking the square root of 5x.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.600
So all of this simplified
down to 30 times

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.740
the absolute value of x times
the principal root of 5x.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.550
And this is what we
got in the last video.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.470
And the interesting
thing here is,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.380
if we assume we're only
dealing with real numbers,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.770
the domain of x right
over here, the x's that

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.950
will make this
expression defined

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.720
in the real numbers--
then x has to be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.262
greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:44.720
So maybe I could
write it this way.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:56.270
The domain here is that
x is any real number

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.155
greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:58.155 --> 00:02:59.530
And the reason
why I say that is,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.737
if you put a negative number
in here and you cube it,

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:05.570
you're going to get
another negative number.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.870
And then at least
in the real numbers,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.470
you won't get an actual value.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.120
You'll get a square root
of a negative number here.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.500
So if you make this-- if
you assume this right here,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.880
we're dealing with
the real numbers.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.680
We're not dealing with
any complex numbers.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.750
When you open it up
to complex numbers,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.464
then you can expand the
domain more broadly.

00:03:28.464 --> 00:03:30.130
But if you're dealing
with real numbers,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.410
you can say that x is going to
be greater than or equal to 0.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.240
And then the absolute
value of x is just

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.110
going to be x, because it's not
going to be a negative number.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.490
And so if we're assuming
that the domain of x is--

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.770
or if this expression is
going to be evaluatable,

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.970
or it's going to have
a positive number,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.960
then this can be written as 30x
times the square root of 5x.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.350
If you had the situation
where we were dealing

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.130
with complex
numbers-- and if you

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.630
don't know what a complex number
is, or an imaginary number,

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.310
don't worry too much about it.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.230
But if you were
dealing with those,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.740
then you would have to keep
the absolute value of x there.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.030
Because then this
would be defined

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.260
for numbers that
are less than 0.
