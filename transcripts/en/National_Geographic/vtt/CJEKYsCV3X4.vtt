00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.467
I think for a lot of
people the word robot

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:04.600
conjures up a humanoid robot.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.000
I think that's a
little bit different.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600
I try to disavow people of
that, because human body--

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.600
why does nothing--

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.466
why?

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:15.200
Right, we can do that stuff.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.967
We're not some model
of anything, right?

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:19.599
Do better, do a better job.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.800
And different, because when
machines do things that humans

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.266
can't do, that's when we
can do things together that

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.333
are really, really amazing.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.500
Rather than do just
what a human can do.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.066
But artificial intelligence,
as you know very well,

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.867
I think people are
very aware now,

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:36.433
it's having this resurgence
and this new wave

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:39.266
of artificial intelligence with
machine learning at its core

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.500
now.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.133
This idea that machines can
look at a million images

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.734
and start figuring
out how to label

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:48.233
them and do it
better than humans

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:49.733
because of how
they've been trained.

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:52.600
Once they beat us at chess
and then at "Jeopardy,"

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.433
we should just give up.

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:54.500
Right, and go.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.033
Well, we might give
up on those things.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.000
There are a lot of things that
they are nowhere close to.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.333
So we're good.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.734
We're really good.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:02.033
Really, because after it
beat us in "Jeopardy," I said,

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:02.934
there's nothing left.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:04.132
We're done.

00:01:04.132 --> 00:01:06.066
Let's just move to Mars.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.233
And I'm looking at my photo
sorter on my computer,

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:12.100
and you give it face
recognition, some hints,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.934
and give it a few photos to
train on, one of these photos

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:18.734
found me when I was 11.

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:19.800
Isn't that amazing?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.834
When I was 11.

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:21.667
I bet I could picture--

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:22.633
I didn't have a must--

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:23.934
I could picture
the 11-year-old you.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:25.033
Yeah, I kind of--

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.900
I resembled myself,
of course, but still.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.033
That's pretty amazing.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.500
It says, we think this
is you, please confirm.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.967
It's like, yeah it's me.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.467
It's a fuzzy photo taken
on a Kodak Instamatic.

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:36.266
Yeah.

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.667
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:41.266
So that's what this learning
era of AI is really all about.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.400
It's in everything
that we are doing.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.900
So Hod, you're
an AI roboticist.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.000
What is that?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.133
Well, robotics is
this merger of AI

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.734
and the physical
world, the mechanics,

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:55.533
the embodiment of a machine.

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.066
And so you need to
sort of understand

00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:03.133
both the mechanics and the AI to
make a physical, smart system.

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.433
So what do you
create in your lab?

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.800
I love asking that of
anybody who's got a lab.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.000
What do you create?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.133
[laughs] All right, what's
happening in your lab?

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:13.400
What's happening?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.734
So we're trying to look at
next generation robotics.

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:20.133
We're trying to look
at how can we take this

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.900
from programmed machines
to machines that can learn,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.300
that can learn fast,
that can learn things

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.834
that we haven't taught them.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:29.800
And do things that we
normally don't think robots

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.400
can do, like self-replicate,
be creative, things like that.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.467
Could-- do they
have self-awareness?

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:39.967
You know, self-awareness
is one of these holy grails,

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:42.066
let's say, of robotics.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:43.066
It's going to take a while,
but we're on that path.
