Oh my God, what a crowd.

Amazing.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.970
You are in for a big treat.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.930
Not only is this a revival,
it's a re-imagining of the show.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.570
And we are so excited
to have the cast

show here with us today.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.216

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:37.132
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.630
Before we kick off
our conversation,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.040
it's my pleasure and honor to
invite Lauren Lott, Quentin

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.030

[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:58.376
- Hi, everybody.

00:00:58.376 --> 00:00:58.917

[MUSIC - "MAMA WILL PROVIDE"]

00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:11.631
RODRICK COVINGTON: (SINGING)
Ti Moune lost all her fear.

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:14.710
She knew Asaka was near.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.530
LOREN LOTT: You never been
away from the sea, child.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.056
You going to need
a helping hand.

00:01:20.056 --> 00:01:23.880
A fish has got to
learn to swim on land.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.090
Walk with me, little girl.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.570
Don't you be afraid.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.870
Follow me, little girl.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.200
Let me be your guide.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.780
Oh, a pretty thing like you
will need a thing or two.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.432
And whatever you need,
Mama will provide.

00:01:49.432 --> 00:01:50.791
Whoa.

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:57.064
Down the road, little girl, you
may lose your way, all alone

00:01:57.064 --> 00:02:01.958
in a world that
may seem too wide.

00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:06.918
But sit on Mama's lap,
and I will draw a map.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:11.878
And whatever you need,
Mama will provide.

00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:18.660
I'll provide you moss to soften
the road, rocks to sit on.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.610
ENSEMBLE: Trees.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.730
LOREN LOTT: To sleep underneath.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.370
ENSEMBLE: Sand.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.968
LOREN LOTT: Fun for your toes.

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:24.840
ENSEMBLE: Plantain.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.580
LOREN LOTT: To
fill up your belly.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.020
To fan your face.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.948
Grass, for making your bed.

00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:34.412
ENSEMBLE: Mosquitoes.

00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:35.876
LOREN LOTT: Ha.

00:02:35.876 --> 00:02:41.690
Bugs will bite, little girl,
and the night will fall.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.135
All alone in the dark,
you'll be terrified.

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:52.085
But you will make it through,
because I am liking you.

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:57.630
And whatever you need,
Mama will provide.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.390
Uh-huh, yeah.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.792
ENSEMBLE: Mama will provide.

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:03.714
LOREN LOTT: Hey.

LOREN LOTT: Hey, yeah.

00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:14.083
ENSEMBLE: Mama will provide.

00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:17.562
LOREN LOTT: I'm gonna provide.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:25.514
Walk with me, little girl,
and I'll take you far.

00:03:25.514 --> 00:03:31.478
Round each bend, little
friend, I'll be by your side.

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:35.951
That's what a mama's worth,
to give her child the earth.

00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:40.424
And whatever you need,
Mama will-- spin your butt

00:03:40.424 --> 00:03:43.406
in a circle, just like that.

00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:45.394
Oh, Mama will provide.

start a show, people.

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:36.580
SPEAKER: OK--

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.260
LYNN AHRENS: We never
heard her do that before.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.260
SPEAKER: Miss Loren, we
are going to get to you.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.850
Don't worry.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.819
We're going to talk.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.360
Thank you all so
much for being here.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.010
A big welcome to Google.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.720
Before we get started,
if we could just

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.060
go around and quickly
introduce yourself

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.989

I play a storyteller.

KENITA R. MILLER:
You're next, baby.

00:05:15.245 --> 00:05:16.670

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.770
LOREN LOTT: I'm Loren
Lott, and I understudy

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.540
Ti Moune, Asaka, and Andrea.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.012
Oh.

00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:25.220
LYNN AHRENS: I'm Lynn Ahrens.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.928
I wrote the book and
lyrics for the show.

STEPHEN FLAHERTY: And
I'm Stephen Flaherty.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.300
I'm the composer of
"Once On This Island."

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:36.410
SPEAKER: Thank you again.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.940
Lynn and Stephen, I'd
love to start with you.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.487
You've been collaborators
since 1982, I think.

00:05:42.487 --> 00:05:43.070
Is that right?

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.120
LYNN AHRENS: I think '83.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.750
SPEAKER: '83?

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.760
STEPHEN FLAHERTY:
Who's counting?

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.960
It's been a while.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.767
SPEAKER: How did
you find each other?

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.100
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Well, we
met in a songwriting workshop

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.520
here in New York City called the
BMI Musical Theater Workshop.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.360
And I was right off the
bus from the Midwest.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.384
And I had the great good
fortune that I walked in,

00:06:03.384 --> 00:06:07.590
and in the class
was Lynn Ahrens.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.630
And I had never collaborated.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.490
I was writing music, book,
and lyrics all myself.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.070
And it was a wonderful,
just chance meeting.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.710
And we just happened
to really hit it off.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.062
And we wrote a
not-very-good song,

00:06:22.062 --> 00:06:23.520
but then followed
by a better song,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.020
and then followed
by a better song.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.760
And it's been 30-some years.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.550
SPEAKER: Oh, wow.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.100
And you wrote "Once On
This Island," I think,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.720
something like 27 years ago.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.770
LYNN AHRENS: Yeah.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.353
SPEAKER: How did
this show come about?

00:06:36.353 --> 00:06:37.650
What's the origin story?

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.350
LYNN AHRENS: Well, when
you do musical theater,

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.250
you never can count
on the results.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.490
And so our first show
had gone to Off-Broadway,

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.960
a show called "Lucky Stiff"
about a shoe salesman

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.351
who takes a dead body on
vacation in a wheelchair.

00:06:52.351 --> 00:06:52.850
It was--

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.790
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: It
was very dramatic.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.700
LYNN AHRENS: --before
"Weekend at Bernie's."

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.494
It was before that.

00:06:56.494 --> 00:06:57.910
And you know, it
was Off-Broadway.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.310
It had a limited run.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.000
And we were sort of desperate
to start a next project.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.790
And I went to a
bookstore where they--

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.980
remember bookstores?

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.270
And they had a used
book shelf, area.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.270
And I pulled a little novel off
the shelf, and I looked at it,

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.570
and it had a very colorful
title and colorful cover.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.720
And I opened it up, and
the first words were,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.360
"There is an island
where rivers run deep,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.040
where the sea
sparkling in the sun

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.780
earns it the name
Jewel of the Antilles."

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.446
The first words on
the page, and I went,

00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:31.017
[GASPS] this is a musical.

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:32.850
And I slammed the book
shut, and I ran home.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.560
I bought it for $1.50.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.850
I didn't even haggle.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.020
And I took it home, read it,
and took a cab right over

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.590
to Stephen's.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.340
And I said, I think I
found the next show.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.770
So that's how that
happened, yeah.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.353
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: I
was just listening

00:07:45.353 --> 00:07:47.790
to a lot of world music at
the time, just for pleasure.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.650
Paul Simon had come out
with his seminal record

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.670
"Graceland," which
was his voice but it's

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.520
filtered through the South
African music of Ladysmith

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.372
Black Mambazo.

00:07:57.372 --> 00:07:59.830
And I was listening to all that
kind of stuff just for fun.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.360
And I just thought, this
could be a really cool basis

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.890
for a theater score
that could have

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.570
world music elements in it.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.170
And they never said which
island it was in the book.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.270
So I borrowed a
little from here,

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.570
a little from there,
some South American

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.440
music, some American gospel.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.220
And I just made it my own.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.050
And it was a fantastic
project to work on.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.140
It was the fastest
writing we had ever done.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.820
We wrote pretty
much the first draft

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.570
of the show in six months.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.680
SPEAKER: Oh, wow.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.628
STEPHEN FLAHERTY:
And that's fast.

00:08:32.628 --> 00:08:34.919
SPEAKER: What is your process
like in the room together

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:35.789
as collaborators?

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.890
Like, do you have
different styles?

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.460
How does that work together?

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.370
LYNN AHRENS: Well, over
the years, you know,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.350
collaboration-- you're
all collaborators

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.320
in one form or another.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.150
And what we've found in all
of these 30-something years

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.270
that we've been working together
is that it keeps changing.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.810
So back then, we would sit in
the room every day at a piano,

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.732
we would work for
a couple hours,

00:08:56.732 --> 00:08:59.190
then we would have Chinese
food, then we would have coffee,

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.385
then we would get
over-caffeinated--

00:09:00.385 --> 00:09:02.370
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: And Lynn would
say, don't eat the egg roll,

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.060
because I would
immediately fall asleep.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:04.779
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:07.320
LYNN AHRENS: You know, I got to
know, don't eat the egg roll.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.420
And by the end of the
day, all the tempos

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.580
were too fast, because we were
so hyper from a lot of coffee.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.010
And that was then.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.630
And then we gradually, you know,
switched to decaf and salads.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.345
And--

00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:21.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.100
But the actual working process,
sometimes it's lyrics first.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.260
Sometimes it's music first.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
A lot of the time, it's
sort of like a ping pong

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.410
match, where he'll go,
do do do do do do do do,

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.910
you know, and I'll
say some words.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.730
And I'll get the computer, and
we'll start working together.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.650
And sometimes he'll
email me a tune.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.660
And sometimes I'll
email him lyrics.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.280
In the old days, it was faxing.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.100
Or I would do dramatic readings
on his answering machine.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.180
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Oh,
her dramatic readings

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.910
were so great.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.655
She would actually do them in
the voice of the character.

00:09:47.655 --> 00:09:48.420
LYNN AHRENS: Yes.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.660
STEPHEN FLAHERTY:
And you know, this

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.086
was before email,
and Google, before--

00:09:54.086 --> 00:09:54.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.590
LYNN AHRENS: It
was before the car.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.150
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Yeah,
but these were so great.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.350
These tapes were great.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.183
They were wonderful.

00:09:59.183 --> 00:10:00.210
SPEAKER: Oh, wow.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.330
What's it like to revisit
this show now, in 2018?

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.580
LYNN AHRENS: Oh, it's amazing.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.380
I mean, none of you, I'm quite
sure, saw the original in 1990.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.890
But this is
completely different,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.150
this incarnation of the show.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.170
It's almost like night and day.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.000
It's very contemporary.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.400
It's very edgy.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.540
There's real sand,
real fire, real water.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.260
It is set very groundedly in
Haiti after a big disaster.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.290
And it sort of relates not
only to Puerto Rico and all

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.040
the disasters in the world
that have ruined and hurt

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.950
communities, but has also
brought communities together.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.230
And the concept
of this production

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.130
is that the people who've all
been caught in the storm--

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.660
out of disaster comes beauty and
community and music and dance

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.440
and joy and storytelling.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.070
And it has taken the
show to another place

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.060
that we never ever expected.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.460
And to be honest,
at the beginning,

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.680
I could not visualize it.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.380
I would come home every night
from our technical rehearsals,

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.560
and my husband would
say, how's it going?

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.770
And I would say, I have no idea.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.350
I'm sitting in a sandpit,
and it's strewn with garbage,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.280
and there's a goat.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.080
I don't really know
what's happening.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.890
I couldn't see it.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.200
And then little by little,
I began to really, really

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.570
understand and appreciate it.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.330
And it's such a beautiful,
special production.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.765
And these guys are unbelievable.

00:11:23.765 --> 00:11:24.310
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: It's great.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.809
In the first row, they actually
have their feet in the sand.

00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:30.970
And the fact that we're doing it
in the round is so revelatory.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.640
I've only seen it in a
proscenium sort of situation,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.530
so this is great,
because it's really

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.650
about a dialogue between
the audience and the actors.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.380
And this cast, they
are spectacular.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.770
I mean, each and every one
of them have been handpicked.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.560
And together, they just are
the most joyous community

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.129
that you'd ever want to hear.

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:50.420
SPEAKER: Yeah, I mean, I agree.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.767
And I would love to talk to
you all about your involvement

00:11:54.767 --> 00:11:56.350
with this show before
this production,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.690
because I know some of
you had done this show.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.449
Kenita, this is--
what number is this?

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:02.740
KENITA R. MILLER: I think
this is maybe the sixth time.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.630
SPEAKER: The sixth time.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.667
KENITA R. MILLER: Yeah.

00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:06.250
I said, I'm going
to play Tonton next.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.620
No, but it's awesome.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.840
I mean, it is kind
of a magical show.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.340
Not kind of, it is.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.420
It's very infectious.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:21.040
And this production is
my absolute favorite

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.510
because of the people.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.470
It's very spoiling.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.678
You don't get to pick who
you work with all the time.

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:28.540
But we have a
great family, which

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.740
makes it really easy to kind of
try to recreate that community.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.050
And also, just the elements.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.250
Really, there's a
lot of difficulties

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.280
to working in sand,
but there is so much

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.690
beauty in working in it, too.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.940
I mean, I take any
opportunity to roll around

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.980
in it when I can.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.260
It's like really
playing on the beach.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.300
And as an artist, to have these
actual elements to work with,

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.820
all you have to do is
show up and be present,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.807
because it's not much
you have to imagine

00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:00.890
as far as the environment.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.392
It's right there.

00:13:02.392 --> 00:13:04.600
SPEAKER: I mean, Michael
Arden has a beautiful vision

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.490
for this show.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.650
And there are a lot
of the elements,

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.690
literally, like
earth, wind, and fire.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.180
You know, hello.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.190
Is that challenging
for you as actors,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.980
to sort of navigate
through that and interact

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.940
with those elements, and then--

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.650
KENITA R. MILLER: He's in the
water for the whole evening.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.887
He's splashing around.

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:24.970
SPEAKER: Water god, right.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.220
QUENTIN EARL DARRINGTON: I am.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.470
I'm in the water
a good 40%, 50%--

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.840
no, maybe more than that.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.290
60%, 70% of the show,
through the entire time.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.960
So since I had to stay in
the water most of the show,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.892
I decided to make the most out
of it and the best out of it.

00:13:40.892 --> 00:13:41.850
So I play in the water.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.600
I throw the water.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.420
I splash the water.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.280
You know, I and
the water are one.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.010
So it's a lot a lot of fun.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.560
You said challenging.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.210
I mean, it has some challenges.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.620
It's cold some days.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.540
It's warmer some days.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.911
But I mean, it's fun.

00:13:56.911 --> 00:13:58.660
You know, at the end
of the day, it's fun.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.990
So I don't look at it
as a challenge at all.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.010
I look for every single
day is new opportunities,

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.260
new blessings, new fun.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.020
So it's fun every single day.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.680
SPEAKER: Loren, we were
talking a little bit backstage.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.144
And you also had an earlier
experience with "Once

00:14:14.144 --> 00:14:14.810
On This Island."

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.730
Tell us about that.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.586
LOREN LOTT: Yes,
when I was 15, I

00:14:18.586 --> 00:14:19.960
was offered the
role of Ti Moune,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.459
and I turned it
down, because I just

00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:23.470
thought it was way too big.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.930
So then they had me
do Erzulie instead.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.312
And I was like a fetus Erzulie
among all of these adults.

00:14:30.312 --> 00:14:32.770
But that was when I completely
fell in love with this show.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:33.790
SPEAKER: Oh, wow.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.720
So this is fascinating,
because it's,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.920
in a way, a revisiting
and a re-imagining

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.630
for you two, but also for
many of the cast members.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.940
Rodrick, had you had--

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.550
did you know about the show?

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.200
RODRICK COVINGTON: No, I didn't
know anything about the show.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.890
I mean, I know about Stephen
and Lynn and their work,

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.564
but I hadn't seen the show or--

00:14:53.564 --> 00:14:54.730
I mean, I heard of the show.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.275
But I hadn't seen
it or anything.

00:14:56.275 --> 00:15:01.390
But when we started working
on it, in the reading--

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.270
actually, before the reading.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.960
It was when I got material and
just started working on it.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.480
I just fell in love with it.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.520
And I was like, oh my
God, if there's anything

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.490
that I want to do in the
next season, it is this.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.410
And I start praying that
I would get the show.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.910
And--

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.410
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: I think we
all felt that way, you know?

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.050
It just felt like it was
meant to be at this time.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.330
And there's something
about it being very timely.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.770
And from the minute we had
our first meeting with Michael

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.900
Arden and Ken
Davenport, our producer,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.870
and our two orchestrators
Michael Starobin and AnnMarie

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.920
Milazzo, from that time till--

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.880
we said yes.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.289
And then from the
moment of yes to we're

00:15:39.289 --> 00:15:41.080
in front of an audience,
it was only a year

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.900
and a half, which
is really fast,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.005
because we've been pushing
other shows very slowly along.

00:15:47.005 --> 00:15:48.880
But this one, I think
everybody just thought,

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.440
this is the time to do this.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.010
And there was an
urgency about it.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.970
SPEAKER: Yeah, I mean, the
show does feel very current.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.700
What was that
decision-making process like?

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.160
How did they approach
you about it?

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.570
What were the
conversations like?

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.607
And why is now a good
time for this show?

00:16:07.607 --> 00:16:09.440
LYNN AHRENS: Well, right
now is a great time

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.550
for theater, period,
because look where we are.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.407
We need community.

00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:15.740
We need to get in the same room.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.912
We need to have dialogue.

00:16:16.912 --> 00:16:17.870
That's what theater is.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.380
So you know, our show
feels very topical.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.820
But I think almost
any show feels

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.900
very topical at the moment.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.550
Michael Arden is
a genius, I think.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.430
He was an actor to begin with,
and he's an amazing actor

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.870
and an amazing singer.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.350
And who knew that he had this
directorial genius in him

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.220
as well?

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.417
He did a show on Broadway
a few seasons ago

00:16:42.417 --> 00:16:43.500
called "Spring Awakening."

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.557
It was a revival.

00:16:44.557 --> 00:16:46.640
And they did it with the
Deaf West Theatre, right?

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.870
And it was all signed,
and it was beautiful.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.480
And when he came to
us, first of all,

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.720
he wanted to do
this show a capella.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.860
And we objected to that.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.725
We said, we need a drum.

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:58.100
We need some
musical instruments.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.870
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: I just
thought it was going

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.994
to be like a doo-wop thing.

00:16:59.994 --> 00:17:02.660
I said, is this going to
be like the Pentatonix?

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.864
It felt very odd to me.

00:17:03.864 --> 00:17:05.030
And I said, you need a drum.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.200
You need this primal drum.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.190
You need a bass.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.160
And then we had
more conversations--

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.910
LYNN AHRENS: Yeah, he
brought us drawings.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.280
He started to bring
drawings and show us

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.020
visuals that were not exactly
like what we ended up with,

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.000
but they implied Haiti.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.589
They implied children.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:25.460
They implied, you know,
certain magical elements

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.430
and fantastical elements and
certain very grim elements

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:29.400
as well.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.969
And what we've
realized along the way

00:17:30.969 --> 00:17:32.510
with Michael is--
and we kept saying,

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.810
well, that's interesting.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.420
Well, why don't you
go away and bring

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.610
us the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch,

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.810
and then we'll talk again.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.143
And then he would bring it back.

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.450
And we would talk again.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.480
And finally, he won us over.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.970
We thought, this all sounds
good and interesting.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.130
And the whole point
of doing a revival

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.740
is to do something different.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.631
The show has been
established in one way,

00:17:52.631 --> 00:17:55.130
and why not try to shake it up
and do it in a different way?

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.070
So as the authors, it's a big
risk, because "Once On This

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.380
Island" gets done all over
the country in schools.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.500
And it's sort of a wonderful,
beloved show, in a way,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.160
for generations of people.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.090
And so to say, OK, you can
bring it back to Broadway,

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.040
and we don't quite
understand your concept,

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.590
but it sounds really
interesting, was a risk for us.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.730
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: The
thing that was exciting,

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.560
though, is from the
very first meeting,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.217
he wanted to be
very ritualistic.

00:18:18.217 --> 00:18:19.550
He wanted to do it in the round.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.260
He wanted to have the
audience very close

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.230
and participating in the story.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.410
And of course, there's only
one Broadway theater that

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.860
is in the round, and so there
was no Plan B. So it's like,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.640
either we had to be in Circle
In The Square or not do it.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.660
And I think we just
willed it into being.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.980
We just really imagined it.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.930
And we were fortunate
that they wanted our show,

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.850
and we wanted to be there.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.124
SPEAKER: Yeah, I'm
curious about sort

00:18:50.124 --> 00:18:52.540
of the process of growing up
with this show, like you did,

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.039
Kenita.

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:57.110
We didn't mention this, but
you actually played Ti Moune.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.090
How has your relationship
with this show--

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.220
I mean, over 6 times,
has it changed?

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.800
Has your understanding of
the characters changed?

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.960
KENITA R. MILLER:
Most definitely.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.180
I always joke, I'm
definitely not waiting

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.740
for life to begin anymore.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.936
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:10.936 --> 00:19:13.222
[INAUDIBLE] Ti
Moune with a walker.

00:19:13.222 --> 00:19:15.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.800
But I have fallen in
love with Mama Euralie.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.840
I really have.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.750
One, because I have
aspirations to be a mother,

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.870
and I think so that
really speaks to my womb.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:28.890
And--

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.510
LYNN AHRENS: Keep
saying, don't do it yet.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.020
Don't do it yet.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.360
KENITA R. MILLER: And also,
two, this character, it

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.980
reminds me of my mother.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.090
And my mom actually did some
missionary work in Haiti.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.750
And she was actually
assigned to orphaned children

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:52.400
and was kind of a part of
putting a school back together.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.650
And so I went back and looked
at a lot of the pictures

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.300
that she brought
from-- and it's crazy,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.720
because the uniform that the
little girl wears in the show

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.500
is almost identical
to what these kids had

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.010
in the photos with my mom.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.734
So I mean, this show has always
been really special to me.

00:20:07.734 --> 00:20:09.650
It was one of the first,
because I got started

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.300
in musical theater really late.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.570
It was one of the first
shows that I saw myself in.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.580
I saw people that
looked like me.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:26.660
And the music is infectious,
and the story is, I think--

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.390
you know, it has
its own magic to it.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.220
And then putting
it all together,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.320
it's something that I
think a lot of people

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.210
hold very dear to them.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.090
And I don't even know if
you, Lynn and Stephen,

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.300
if you know what you were
starting when you wrote it.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.150
It really is
something that I think

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.960
a lot of-- even if you
don't like theater per se,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.970
it's something that just
really captivates you.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.837
And it has done that to me
since the beginning, yeah.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.670
SPEAKER: I mean, this
is a real treat for me

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.340
because this is one of my
favorite Broadway scores

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.900
of all time.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.710
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: I
gave him $5 to say that.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.040
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.120
Every mention is another five.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.995
My favorite Broadway
score of all time--

00:21:09.995 --> 00:21:12.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:17.990
And it was fascinating to hear
while I was preparing for this,

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:23.510
you had had relationships with
some of these marvelous actors.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.840
Quentin and Kenita, you had
actually worked together in--

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.160
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: In "Ragtime."

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.510
They were Coalhouse and Sarah.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.757
KENITA R. MILLER: First
show ever out of school.

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:33.590
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Was
that your equity card?

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.631
KENITA R. MILLER: It was.

00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:35.631
It definitely was, yeah.

00:21:35.631 --> 00:21:37.047
STEPHEN FLAHERTY:
She was amazing.

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.230
We couldn't believe her
the first time we met her.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.260
She's so tiny, and she just
has this enormous voice

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.090
and this enormous soul.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.867
And she's incapable of
doing anything false.

00:21:47.867 --> 00:21:49.450
LYNN AHRENS: But we
do collect actors.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:49.970
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: She can't.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.380
LYNN AHRENS: We do like actors.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.190
We do.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.606
STEPHEN FLAHERTY:
You also learned

00:21:53.606 --> 00:21:54.685
to weed out some of them.

00:21:54.685 --> 00:21:57.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.170
SPEAKER: Stay tuned for
the after-show, everybody.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.074
LYNN AHRENS: We'll
tell you later.

00:22:03.074 --> 00:22:05.240
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: But we
absolutely adore this cast.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.441
And many we've worked with
before, some we haven't.

00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:09.440
LYNN AHRENS: Will again.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.315
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Yeah,
and it's so exciting.

00:22:11.315 --> 00:22:12.980
You know, you collect them.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:13.560
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.490
Quentin, what's it like to
be back on stage with Kenita?

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.730
Is it-- after so many years--

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:18.860
QUENTIN EARL DARRINGTON:
Oh, it's everything.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.526
It's everything.

00:22:19.526 --> 00:22:22.040
I actually told my
cast the first day

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.180
of one of our workshops--

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.100
I walked in the
room, and they asked,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.350
so what is the most
exciting part about today?

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.220
Michael Arden asked
us all to say what's

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.470
your most exciting part today?

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.220
And think of something
you may be the most

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.460
trepidatious about today.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.630
And I said, the most
exciting thing about today

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.660
is that I get to work
with and hear and see

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.060
my favorite singer on Broadway.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.030
And it's Kenita.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.020
From day one-- I've
known Kenita now

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.850
since 2001 when we
started "Ragtime" together

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.710
with Lynn and Stephen.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.670
So it's been a long time.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.740
And she's been my friend ever
since, and met her husband

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.080
the same tour, the
same show, back then.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.170
So I've known the both of
them this whole journey.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:04.890
So it truly is family, man.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.610
It's the coolest
thing in the world.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:08.370
It's awesome.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.369
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:23:09.369 --> 00:23:11.780
Miss Loren, can we talk?

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.850
LOREN LOTT: We can talk.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.599
SPEAKER: You know, I
feel like Joan Rivers

00:23:14.599 --> 00:23:15.584
up here or something.

00:23:15.584 --> 00:23:18.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.374
So first of all, that
performance-- just,

00:23:21.374 --> 00:23:22.790
please, another
round of applause.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:23.557
That was--

00:23:23.557 --> 00:23:26.239
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:29.210
Just blown away completely.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.540
And actually, the night
that I was seeing the show,

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.796
we saw it with you as Ti Moune.

00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:35.420
LOREN LOTT: Oh.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.790
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.081
LOREN LOTT: I didn't know that.

00:23:38.081 --> 00:23:41.030
You didn't tell me
that this whole time?

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.220
SPEAKER: I was like, oh my God.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.710
And you had never
done that song, right?

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.360
"Mama Will Provide"?

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.360
None of you had ever
seen her do it, right?

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.151
LYNN AHRENS: No, we
walked in this morning,

00:23:51.151 --> 00:23:52.131
and we said, really?

00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:52.630
OK.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.213
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: We were told
in the elevator coming up here.

00:23:55.213 --> 00:23:58.370
And I'm like, well,
that's going to be fun.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.960
LYNN AHRENS: It's live theater.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.810
You never know.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:01.500
LOREN LOTT: The struggle.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.420
SPEAKER: The struggle.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.980
So you play a lot of different
roles in the show, Ti Moune,

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.315
Asaka, and Andrea.

00:24:11.315 --> 00:24:12.940
RODRICK COVINGTON:
She plays everybody.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.860
SPEAKER: Yeah, she plays every--

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:14.390
OK.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.390
LOREN LOTT: Every woman.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.170
SPEAKER: Every woman.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.050
What is it like preparing
for those roles?

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:25.075
I mean, in any given show,
what are you thinking about?

00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:27.970
What are you working on?

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:33.520
LOREN LOTT: It's kind of hard to
prepare, because a lot of times

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.720
it's really last minute.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.010
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.500
LOREN LOTT: If I'm fortunate
enough to know ahead of time,

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.896
each character I feel
like has different needs

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.020
and wants different things.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.470
So I try to spend at
least a little bit of time

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.630
before that remembering
what they want

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.944
and remembering who they
are, because if there's

00:24:48.944 --> 00:24:50.860
times when I'm on as
several different people,

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.900
then I definitely
will get confused.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.650
But going on for Ti
Moune is probably

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.960
the easiest one to go
on for, because she

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.610
has a consistent story.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.630
And she's in it the entire time.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.350
And being in the round, you
can just walk into the world.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.810
And then I'm in
the world, so it's

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.050
easiest to be focused there.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.230
But usually, I just call my
vocal coach before the shows

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.460
and just run it with her when
I know that I'm on as Ti Moune.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.824
I've never gone on for Asaka.

00:25:20.824 --> 00:25:22.180
[SIGHS]

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.250
But I know it's coming.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:31.330
And to prepare for
that, I'll probably

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:37.180
take a really nice
shot of oregano oil,

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.290
get my voice ready.

00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:46.300
But when I prepare for Andrea, I
just look at a lot of my notes.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.239
And yeah, that's it.

00:25:49.239 --> 00:25:51.530
She's mostly ensemble, and
then she's like a character.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.130
So then I just
prepare like that.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.130
But I can't really
prepare like how

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.710
you would for a regular
show, because I'm thrown on.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.650
So I don't get to--

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.550
I get to focus, but there's
a lot going on when I'm on.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.300
And there's a lot to
remember, because I'm

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.520
working with a lot of
people behind the scenes

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.700
to help me remember certain
things, like my shoes.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.382
Like, one time I went on, and
they didn't have my shoes.

00:26:14.382 --> 00:26:16.840
So I went out barefoot-- which
is fine, we're in the sand--

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.220
but it's happened several times.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.745
So then we have to be
communicating backstage.

00:26:21.745 --> 00:26:22.990
So there's a lot going on.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:24.670
So I'm not exactly
as focused as I'd

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.530
like to be most of the time.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.797
But I do the job.

00:26:28.797 --> 00:26:30.130
LYNN AHRENS: She's unbelievable.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.040
She's like a little
rocket scientist

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.360
with all of these charts
and graphs and things.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.880
And she just, she's amazing.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.588
LOREN LOTT: Lynn.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.384
LYNN AHRENS: Pretty
rocket scientist.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.120
SPEAKER: How do you
keep these characters

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.040
sort of organized in your head?

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.840
I mean, you're memorizing
lines for all three of them.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.320
Is that hard to keep track of?

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.640
LOREN LOTT: Well, praise
God, when I was little,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.502
my hobby when I
was doing shows--

00:26:57.502 --> 00:26:58.960
because I started
when I was seven,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.470
and then my mom pulled me
out because she was like,

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.830
no, I don't want you
to grow up and, like,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.240
you're not going to be able
use the bathroom by yourself

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.020
because you're
going to be famous.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.375
And then you're not going to
be able to go to Disneyland

00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:08.200
because people are going to
follow you to the bathroom.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.020
So I was like, dang, I want
to go to the bathroom myself.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.004
So I didn't do it.

00:27:13.004 --> 00:27:14.420
So I didn't do it
for a long time.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:19.130
But when I started
at seven, I really

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.820
enjoyed memorizing plays.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.660
Like, when I was
in a show, I liked

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.770
to know everybody's lines.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.570
And I liked to
memorize everything.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:33.790
And then it came in handy
because now, doing this show,

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:37.160
I have memorized everybody's
lines and everybody's

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:37.660
everything.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.743
But I keep a lot of notes.

00:27:38.743 --> 00:27:40.260
KENITA R. MILLER: Watch out.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:40.720
LOREN LOTT: I'm
coming for you, Agwe.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.675
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: She's
coming after you, Rodrick.

00:27:42.675 --> 00:27:43.758
LOREN LOTT: Yeah, Rodrick.

00:27:43.758 --> 00:27:44.920
I'm coming for you.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.870
And I keep a lot of videos.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.340
Videos are like my Bible.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.120
I go through my videos
every other night,

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.529
and I just try to
remember who's doing what.

00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:56.320
But a lot of times,
even when I'm on stage,

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.780
I'm watching everybody and
watching everybody who I cover,

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.299
trying not to miss anything
so I can stay up to date.

00:28:03.299 --> 00:28:04.840
Like, if one character
does something

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.550
with another character and
that becomes their thing,

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.799
I try to make sure I know
it so that I can come and do

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:12.205
their little, like, thing.

00:28:12.205 --> 00:28:14.650
It's always going.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:15.532
I'm losing it.

00:28:15.532 --> 00:28:17.551
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.420
SPEAKER: You're hiding it well.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.160
How are you all preparing
for these roles?

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.670
I mean, you're on
stage for 90 minutes.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.620
You don't really leave, right?

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.190
Do you leave?

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.037
I mean, for the most
part, you're there.

00:28:34.037 --> 00:28:35.620
QUENTIN EARL DARRINGTON:
No, no, we're

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.769
all pretty much all on
stage the whole show.

00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:40.060
We leave maybe for a quick
second, then right back out,

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.290
all the time.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:44.230
SPEAKER: I heard Alex talking
about this idea of a snack

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.770
track.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:47.050
Can you tell us what
a snack track is?

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.060
And how--

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.643
QUENTIN EARL DARRINGTON:
A snack track

00:28:49.643 --> 00:28:53.140
is a track in a show where
you may have one song,

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.170
and you stay offstage
for most of the show.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.730
So you come on, you kill
it, and then you leave.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:04.690
I used to consider that to be
like Mufasa in "The Lion King."

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:08.110
Now, I played Mufasa,
and I loved the track.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:13.250
You sing one song,
and then you die.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.680
And then you stay back
the whole second act.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.730
You're in your
dressing room chilling.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.270
Oh, that's a snack track.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.260
SPEAKER: OK.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.490
And there are no snack
tracks in this show.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.259
QUENTIN EARL DARRINGTON: No.

00:29:25.259 --> 00:29:27.367
KENITA R. MILLER: Rodrick
covers Papa Ge, too.

00:29:27.367 --> 00:29:28.200
SPEAKER: Oh, really?

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:28.980
OK, tell me about that.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.470
LYNN AHRENS: He's amazing.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.040
LOREN LOTT: It's delicious.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.087
SPEAKER: Oh, I can
see that, yeah.

00:29:34.087 --> 00:29:36.420
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Can you see
him as the demon of death?

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.770
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.160
SPEAKER: You're so sweet, but I
could just see embodying that.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.600
What's that process like?

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.900
And how are you creating
that character, but also,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.750
as a storyteller, how are
you-- what's your character

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.130
development like?

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:54.420
RODRICK COVINGTON: I mean,
when I first auditioned,

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.040
everything was for Papa Ge.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.330
So everything that I was doing
in preparation was for Papa Ge.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:05.640
And so just going in it, I
just saw myself as Papa Ge.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.950
And I had to adjust more and to
get more into as a storyteller.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:16.320
And the storyteller is actually
much more work than Papa Ge,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.540
because the storyteller is
constantly on stage and moving

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.240
and changing and doing so much.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.500
As Papa Ge, there's
just this one linear--

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:36.150
and I really feel like I was
already prepared for that,

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.850
in just the root of it, of
even where Papa Ge comes from,

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.760
even just from the voodoo.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:47.877
And so doing that just honestly
just feels completely right.

00:30:47.877 --> 00:30:49.710
You know, I don't ever
get to do that often.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.699
But when I do.

00:30:51.699 --> 00:30:52.990
KENITA R. MILLER: It's amazing.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.540
LOREN LOTT: We love it.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.480
KENITA R. MILLER: We
have a woman that plays--

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.420
RODRICK COVINGTON: Yeah,
and she's incredible.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.836
LYNN AHRENS: Yeah,
we have a woman

00:30:57.836 --> 00:31:00.510
playing the god of death, which
is traditionally a man's role.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.077
And we have a man playing
Asaka, mother of the Earth,

00:31:03.077 --> 00:31:04.660
which is traditionally
a woman's role.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.650
So we've shaken up the
genders a little bit

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.280
in this production,
which also makes

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.970
it really contemporary in
a way and feel unusual.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.905
SPEAKER: Yeah, I want
to talk about that.

00:31:14.905 --> 00:31:17.160
I want to open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.430
If you want to line up at
the mics on either side,

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.175
we'll be happy to
take your questions.

00:31:23.175 --> 00:31:25.050
Let's talk about this
nontraditional casting.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.090
First of you, you
all have some really

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.454
non-traditional
castmates, live animals.

00:31:30.454 --> 00:31:31.120
LOREN LOTT: Yes.

working with goats.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.637
There are chickens in the show.

00:31:36.637 --> 00:31:38.220
And I actually heard--
we were talking

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.060
a little bit backstage--
a chicken gave birth?

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:41.850
Is this--

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.350
KENITA R. MILLER:
They lay eggs now.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.020
LYNN AHRENS: They lay eggs.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.530
RODRICK COVINGTON: Yes.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.110
KENITA R. MILLER: Which is good
It means they're comfortable.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.400
But yeah, we had one lay--

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.849
I think it was either
Lorell or Effie.

00:31:49.849 --> 00:31:51.390
We have four of
them, and they're all

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.680
named after the Dreamgirls.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.017
And I think it was one of them
actually laid an egg right

00:31:58.017 --> 00:31:59.100
there during the pre-show.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.080
So we get fresh organic eggs.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.727
We don't tell them, though.

00:32:04.727 --> 00:32:06.810
SPEAKER: Do they get their
own dressing room, or--

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.100
KENITA R. MILLER: Oh, yes,
they have their own room

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:08.600
in the back.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.064
They actually have
an animal taxi

00:32:11.064 --> 00:32:12.480
that picks them
up from their farm

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.720
and takes them to the theater.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.280
SPEAKER: Well, OK.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.570
KENITA R. MILLER:
It's kind of-- yeah.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.680
They've got the life.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.670
They have got the life.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.920
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: These
are Broadway chickens.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.537
LYNN AHRENS: They
all have contracts.

00:32:25.537 --> 00:32:26.745
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: And agents.

00:32:26.745 --> 00:32:29.340
SPEAKER: Agents, right.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.630
Take a question over here.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:31.370
AUDIENCE: Hi, everyone.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.580
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.621
I've seen the show twice.

00:32:33.621 --> 00:32:34.274
I love it.

00:32:34.274 --> 00:32:35.940
I have a question
about the instruments,

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.160
because there's a lot of
interesting instruments.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.470
And I'm curious how those have
changed for this production

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:43.567
than before.

00:32:43.567 --> 00:32:45.150
STEPHEN FLAHERTY:
Yeah, originally, we

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.374
had a little band
of five people.

00:32:47.374 --> 00:32:49.040
So they're like a
little Caribbean band.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.470
But off Michael Arden's
idea of, what if everything

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.370
was taken from you?

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:54.630
How would you create music?

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.570
How would you tell your story?

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.960
We came upon the notion
of actually inventing

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.000
some instruments that
are made out of discards,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.139
out of trash, out
of found objects.

00:33:05.139 --> 00:33:06.680
And our orchestrator
Michael Starobin

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.910
has a good friend named
John Bertles, who has

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:11.014
a group called Bash The Trash.

00:33:11.014 --> 00:33:12.430
And that's literally
what they do.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:14.760
They make instruments
out of trash.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.550
And there's something about
making music or repurposing

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:21.120
something to create a thing
of beauty which we were really

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.900
excited about.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.357
So they play all sorts of little
strange and interesting things

00:33:25.357 --> 00:33:26.190
throughout the show.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.523
LYNN AHRENS: They whirl tubes
that are actually pitched,

00:33:28.523 --> 00:33:31.790
so it's like E-flat,
or whatever it is.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:34.290
And we have a little girl in
the show-- two little girls,

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:35.940
actually, and they're
both musicians,

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.530
very, very talented musicians.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:40.110
And I love when one of
them is in the show.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.061
And she's a cellist.

00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:43.560
And she plays a little cello,
but it's made out of, I think,

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.927
a cardboard box and some
strings and wires and stuff.

00:33:46.927 --> 00:33:49.260
And it's just adorable, you
know, and it actually plays.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.480
So it's all that.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.220
Glass Coke bottles and
all sorts of good stuff.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.636
STEPHEN FLAHERTY:
So we still have

00:33:55.636 --> 00:33:58.740
our little combo,
little island band,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.450
but with the trash instruments.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.900
And also, we were experimenting
with the idea of, instead

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.570
of using synth pads
like we did originally,

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.879
creating those textures
with the human voice.

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:09.760
LYNN AHRENS: Voices.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.734
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: And so we have
a beautiful vocal arrangement

00:34:13.734 --> 00:34:15.900
that functions as part of
the orchestration, created

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.810
by AnnMarie Milazzo, who did
all the vocal work on "Spring

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:19.860
Awakening."

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.550
And she's wildly inventive.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.030
And they're amazing that
they can execute this stuff,

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.350
because it's tricky.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.830
LYNN AHRENS: And all that's
new in this production.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:28.429
STEPHEN FLAHERTY:
It's all new, yeah.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:28.820
AUDIENCE: Wonderful.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.319
Thank you.

00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:33.469
SPEAKER: What's it
like to hear the music

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:35.959
with those sort of found
objects and instruments?

00:34:35.959 --> 00:34:38.000
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Well,
you know, the whole thing

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.340
was a big process
of experimentation.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.799
I think there's something about
going into a revival where you

00:34:44.799 --> 00:34:48.230
know that the show itself works,
so it actually frees you up

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.389
to try a lot more other things.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.639
And this is one of the things.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.460
And it was sort of like a-- we
had a series of small workshops

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.740
where we had experiment
with these vocals

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.290
and then these ideas
for the instruments.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:05.360
And using the voice, it actually
makes the show more human,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.722
because actually, it's
different voices supporting

00:35:09.722 --> 00:35:10.430
the other voices.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.880
And there's something about
that that just grabs you.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.850
SPEAKER: Great Let's take
a question over here.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.010
AUDIENCE: I've loved this
score for a long time,

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:20.910
listened to the
soundtrack many times

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.790
and waited many
years for a revival.

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.350
And this one was amazing.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:29.420
But I always thought that maybe
it wasn't revived on Broadway

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.410
because it's short.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.300
It's a one-act.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.380
Was I right about that?

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.987
And if I was, did you ever
consider making it longer?

00:35:35.987 --> 00:35:38.070
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: I don't
think it was the length.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.876
LYNN AHRENS: I don't think
it was the length either.

00:35:38.876 --> 00:35:39.090
Go ahead.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.910
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: It
seems like these days,

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.590
theater pieces want
to get shorter,

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.940
and movies are just
getting longer, you know?

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.670
I mean, movies are so long now.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.890
But I don't think that
that was ever an issue.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.560
I know when we took it to
London, the London people,

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.960
they like that full night out.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.340
And they said, can't we create--

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.090
LYNN AHRENS: Can't
we go to the bar?

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.190
STEPHEN FLAHERTY:
Can't we go to the bar?

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.023
Can't we create-- and
we said, no, it really

00:35:59.023 --> 00:35:59.990
doesn't want a break.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:03.020
So what they did is they
ripped apart the theater,

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.360
and they made it into
a Caribbean village.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.340
And they had all
sorts of Caribbean--

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.360
LYNN AHRENS: Goat pies.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.010
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: --goat
pies and Caribbean bands

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.550
playing after.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.424
So they had like an
after-show kind of thing.

00:36:12.424 --> 00:36:14.400
So it was like you could
just hang and do that.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.316
LYNN AHRENS: I think
it's just taken this long

00:36:16.316 --> 00:36:19.340
because it's just taken
this long, you know?

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.830
I don't think there's any
real reason other than it just

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.020
takes somebody to fall
in love with something

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.810
and have a vision for it and
say, I want to bring this back.

00:36:28.899 --> 00:36:31.190
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: There was
always talk about revivals,

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:34.090
but I'm glad it didn't happen
until now, because I think

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.380
we needed to wait for
the right group of people

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.405
to manifest themselves and
sort of show up in time.

00:36:40.405 --> 00:36:41.030
AUDIENCE: Great

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.988
LYNN AHRENS: Thank you.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.420
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming to Google.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.890
This question is
mainly for Lynn,

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.410
because I was really
struck by how you mentioned

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:55.080
the importance of community and
the arts bringing us together.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.740
I work on YouTube, so I'm always
very curious and excited when

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:58.790
creators come in.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.850
How do you think that
YouTube specifically, maybe

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.410
Google in general,
could do a better

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.250
job of supporting the arts and
engaging those conversations

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:10.196
through our online platforms?

00:37:10.196 --> 00:37:11.100
LYNN AHRENS: Uh-oh.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.771
Well--

00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:14.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.161
I think you do a great
job to begin with.

00:37:18.161 --> 00:37:21.359
Years ago, I wrote
songs and sang

00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:23.900
for a show called "Schoolhouse
Rock," which maybe some of you

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:24.920
grew up with.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.990
And they're all on YouTube.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.717
And so I can see my life
flashing before my eyes

00:37:29.717 --> 00:37:30.550
sometimes, you know?

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:36.230
And it's extraordinary to me
how you can find so many things

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.150
on there and through Google.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.820
I mean, almost the knowledge
of the world at our fingertips.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.760
And I love that.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.750
I don't know how you
could do a better job.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.540
But maybe-- is there
a theater channel

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.850
in your future or something?

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.360
You know, live performance
is very ephemeral.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.960
You see it one night, and
Alex Newell is playing Asaka.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.720
You see it the next
night, and Loren Lott

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.780
is playing Asaka because
Alex got ill or whatever.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.364
You know, one night
an actor is on,

00:38:04.364 --> 00:38:05.780
the next night
they're not as good

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.030
because they're not feeling
as well or whatever it is.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:12.750
So to capture live theater,
I think, is very important.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:15.530
And the more we can do
that, within legal limits,

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:16.910
the better.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:18.320
There's a lot of
stuff on YouTube

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.510
that people sort of hold the
camera up and then stick it

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.760
under their coat or something.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.410
And we don't want that so much.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:26.670
But maybe there's
something in that idea.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.400
I don't know how you
would do your job better.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.400
I feel I'm in the heart
of technology right now.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.470
It's like the
belly of the beast.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.700
It's really cool.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.414
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:35.414 --> 00:38:37.580
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: There's
something really exciting,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.140
though, about the idea
of global community,

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.010
because that really didn't
exist before the advent

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.900
of the internet and all of that.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.380
LYNN AHRENS: That's right.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:46.970
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: I find that
that's potentially really

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.880
exciting, just the idea
of that interfacing.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.975
LYNN AHRENS: Yes, exactly.

00:38:49.975 --> 00:38:50.600
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.180
Thank you so much.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:51.660
LYNN AHRENS: Thank you.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.734
Thanks for asking that.

00:38:52.734 --> 00:38:54.650
SPEAKER: Quentin, we
were talking a little bit

00:38:54.650 --> 00:39:00.650
about craft and sort
of learning your craft

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.290
and honing your craft.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:07.640
What's your perspective on the
whole sort of digital landscape

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.090
as it relates to young
artists coming up?

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:14.360
Obviously, a lot of people
getting discovered on YouTube.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.170
What's your
relationship with that?

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:16.950
What's your perspective on it?

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:17.420
QUENTIN EARL DARRINGTON:
It's interesting,

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.400
because in this age
of social media,

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.790
things are so, so, so, so fast.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.110
Information moves so fast.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:28.400
We learn so fast, which,
honestly, at a lot of times

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.730
makes audience members'
attention spans shorter.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.670
And just like we said with shows
getting shorter and shorter

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:37.490
and shorter, these quick
blurbs, these quick things.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:39.590
Not too many people
are taking the time

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:42.080
to read as much anymore
or to take the time

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.860
to really sit through a three
and 1/2 hour production.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.770
I hear "Angels in
America" is back.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:51.410
And it's an event,
which I can't wait

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:54.870
to see and to be a part of.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.350
I think there's
some pros and cons

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:59.330
to the way this
push has happened

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.567
for us all moving forward.

00:40:00.567 --> 00:40:02.150
But I hope that
there's a happy medium

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.910
that we can continue to find,
artistically, creatively,

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.870
and for our human nature and
growth all across the board,

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:12.650
to keep growing and producing
great art and great people.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.927
SPEAKER: Yeah, Loren, you
were on "American Idol."

00:40:15.927 --> 00:40:17.510
You've done a lot
of film and TV work,

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:21.050
but we're talking a
lot about live theater.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:24.380
What's it like being
back in the theater?

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.830
Do you prefer one
over the other?

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.354
What are the differences?

00:40:29.354 --> 00:40:31.520
LOREN LOTT: I go back and
forth, because sometimes I

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.900
prefer theater.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.572
But I prefer theater when
I'm working on TV and film.

00:40:35.572 --> 00:40:37.280
And then when I'm
working on TV and film,

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.370
I feel like I
prefer TV and film,

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:43.010
because there is something
really nice about doing

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:45.410
one scene, and then
if I mess it up,

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.150
just doing it over
and over again,

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:50.210
and then going back to
my trailer and napping.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.530
And then crafties, which,
when you're on a set,

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.730
there's food everywhere.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.440
And it's called crafties.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.320
And they become
your best friends.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.402
Or they become my best friends.

00:41:01.402 --> 00:41:02.690
But I love that.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:04.140
I love crafties.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.840
Because in theater,
I remember during

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.380
our first few rehearsals, I
hadn't done theater in a while.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.880
And I was like, so
where's crafties?

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.370
And Alex Newell laughed at me.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.110
And then we became friends.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:25.604
But I think right now, theater
like this, in our worlds--

00:41:25.604 --> 00:41:27.020
because I feel
like we're actually

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.870
in our own little world, and
it's really, really special.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.610
And it's really different than
any other show that I've done.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:37.080
So right now I prefer the
round, prefer theater.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.310
SPEAKER: Yeah, one of the last
songs in the show, or actually

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.930
the last song, is "Why
We Tell the Story."

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:46.960
Can you talk a little bit about
why you all tell the story

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.670
and what the show means to you?

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.660
RODRICK COVINGTON: Well, I
have 18 brothers and sisters

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:56.630
in Florida.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:57.970
My parents had 19 kids.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:01.510
And I have over 150
nieces and nephews

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.210
because all of my siblings
have kids except my brother

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:05.940
and I, who are
the 18th and 17th.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.940
And then their kids have
kids and kids and kids.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.300
And so it really is a village,
and like our community

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.120
and tribe.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.410
And so every time that
we get to that part,

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:22.120
and the little girl
reminds us of the story,

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.710
my heart wells up
every time because I

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.380
think of my nieces
and my nephew,

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:35.185
particularly Tyra and Tory,
and just how my life right now

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:37.180
has to be about them.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.230
You know what I mean?

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:44.697
And no longer about me, because
it's about the next generation.

00:42:44.697 --> 00:42:46.030
And that's why I tell the story.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:50.560
And that's why I'm
so grateful that I

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.180
feel an alignment
of being a part

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.550
of this particular
production, because it's

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.480
about the next generation.

00:43:01.235 --> 00:43:03.690
KENITA R. MILLER:
I tell the story

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:09.720
because I have to, and for
similar reasons, but also

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.020
to not to forget.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.590
We say, hope is why,
faith is why, love is

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.210
why, grief is why, pain is why.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.200
And I think that they
are all emotions that

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.010
make us so beautifully human.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:27.450
And it's OK to feel
all of those things

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.400
and actually is
what connects us.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.190
And we have strength
in our emotions.

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:37.560
And we have strength
as being a human being.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.250
And so I think when I
think of all those words

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.200
and why they're
important, it always

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.770
comes down to making me
remember how resilient we

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.640
are when we come together
and when we allow ourselves

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.200
to live in our humanity.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.100
SPEAKER: What have
the fans' reactions

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.424
to the show been like?

00:43:55.424 --> 00:43:57.340
You're obviously interacting
with the audience

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.006
during the show.

00:43:58.006 --> 00:43:59.774
But have you heard from fans?

00:43:59.774 --> 00:44:00.940
Do you hear from them a lot?

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.426
I can imagine-- Loren,
do you want to--

00:44:03.426 --> 00:44:04.300
LOREN LOTT: Oh, yeah.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.160
SPEAKER: Or Lynn.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.080
LOREN LOTT: Yeah.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.480
I definitely-- I think we
all have our own experiences

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.950
with supporters.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:14.241
But me being an understudy,
I didn't really expect much.

00:44:14.241 --> 00:44:15.990
I expected to be
supporting everybody else

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:17.310
while they are being supported.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:21.780
But the younger audience,
especially on social media,

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.290
they'll draw pictures.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.876
Or every time that I'm on
as a different character,

00:44:25.876 --> 00:44:27.750
if I post it and they
haven't seen it before,

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.910
they'll draw pictures,
or they'll send letters.

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:33.170
I just received some "Once On
This Island" custom shoes that

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.940
someone--

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.810
some Nikes that someone made.

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:37.530
Yeah.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.960
And I also, I'm always
posting that I love hot sauce.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.850
So sometimes when
people come to the show,

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:43.350
they'll bring me goodie bags.

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:47.530
And it'll have candy in it or
a nice letter and hot sauce.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.280
And I have received
a lot of hot sauce.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.780
And it's filling up in my room.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.910
And everyone judges me,
but it's just like--

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.430
it makes me so happy that
people give me hot sauce.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.217
People actually hear
me and they see me

00:44:59.217 --> 00:45:00.300
and then they get excited.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.490
People are always asking
me about my Ti Moune

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.550
dates and stuff, and they
try to plan around when

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.740
to come back based off of that.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.782
And it just makes me feel
really, really special.

00:45:09.782 --> 00:45:10.989
SPEAKER: Hot sauce, everyone.

00:45:10.989 --> 00:45:11.900
Please bring some.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.476
LOREN LOTT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:13.476 --> 00:45:15.350
SPEAKER: Lynn, did you
want to say something.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:16.890
LYNN AHRENS: No,
I mean, that's--

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:19.364
they don't bring me hot sauce.

00:45:19.364 --> 00:45:20.030
LOREN LOTT: Yet.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:22.650
LYNN AHRENS: And when I
come out of the theater,

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.930
there's always this
huge line of fans

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.110
waiting for all these guys.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:27.670
And I just sneak
out the other way,

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:29.520
and nobody has a clue
who the writers are.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.840
Nobody ever does.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.460
But what we do get as writers
is people come up to us and say,

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.850
I got married to "The Human
Heart," or that sort of thing.

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:41.532
Or one woman said she gave birth
to "Waiting for Life to Begin,"

00:45:41.532 --> 00:45:42.240
which I thought--

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:42.480
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Really?

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:42.840
Are you serious?

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.780
LYNN AHRENS: I swear.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.120
Was hilarious to me.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.470
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Did she
put it on a loop tape?

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:47.210
LYNN AHRENS: I don't know.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:49.293
STEPHEN FLAHERTY: Or did
she do it in, like, three

00:45:49.293 --> 00:45:50.040
and 1/2 minutes?

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.140
LYNN AHRENS:
[WORDLESS SINGING] Push.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.170
I don't know how she did it.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:46:00.330
But we hear a lot from
people who saw the original

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:03.330
and are knocked
out by the revival.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:04.140
They had no idea.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.090
Or a lot of people who
never saw the original,

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:08.340
like probably your
age, who have grown up

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.330
with the album, the original
album, and are coming to see it

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.862
and saying, oh my God, I just
never visualized it like this.

00:46:14.862 --> 00:46:15.570
It's so stunning.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.680
So we hear from a lot of people.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.180
We do.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.200
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.075
QUENTIN EARL DARRINGTON:
You guys have, like,

00:46:21.075 --> 00:46:22.410
the best cafes and food here.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:24.530

Loren asked for hot sauce.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.646
She was on a mission to
find some over there.

00:46:28.646 --> 00:46:30.770

Google hot sauce, right?

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:31.380

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.970
Before we close-- we're going
to close with two songs--

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:41.576
I want to play a quick game with

play a version of the Proust

This is from the 1880s.

It's since been
updated for this talk.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:53.430
But we're just going to
popcorn around, ask questions.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:56.501
Feel free to answer with the
first thing that comes to mind.

00:46:56.501 --> 00:46:57.750
And just pass the mics around.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.251

as she stares down the
road in the pouring rain.

Rain on the road.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:34.150
Rain on her face.

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:38.715
Rain makes a road such
a dangerous place.

Let there be a car,
racing through the night.

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:58.283
Where the road meets
the sea, let her wait.

How it must feel to go
racing wherever you please,

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:35.970
flying as free as a bird
with its tail in the breeze.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:41.393
Even the fish in the sea
must be longing to fly,

00:52:41.393 --> 00:52:47.008
catching a glimpse of the
stranger in white racing by.

00:52:47.008 --> 00:52:52.900
Oh gods, oh gods, are you there?

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:58.301
What can I do to get you
to look down and give in?

Oh gods, oh gods,
hear my prayer.

00:53:03.733 --> 00:53:06.655
I'm here in the field

happy to have what they have
and to stay where they are.

00:53:32.348 --> 00:53:37.837
They never even look up
at the sound of a car.

00:53:37.837 --> 00:53:46.320
A stranger racing down the
beach, racing to places

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.815
I was meant to reach.

00:53:48.815 --> 00:53:54.576

Don't single me out
