1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.140
Or a second look at defenses focuses on different types of defense and what they

2
00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:07.294
cost.

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.250
The type of defense depends on the nature of the environmental hostility.

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.360
All defenses have costs that are expressed in tradeoffs defenses may allow

5
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:23.680
disease either because they fail to protect or because their costs are

6
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:24.514
excessive.

7
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.790
Costs that are acceptable to evolution may be unacceptable to patients and to

8
00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:31.624
physicians.

9
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.610
So let's look at the nature of environmental hostility.

10
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.800
Some environmental factors are universal.
That's the,

11
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:46.150
that means all species and counter them.
Food,
water,
oxygen,
temperature,

12
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.040
pathogens,
those are things that all species or have issues with.

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.110
Others are quite specific to particular organisms,
particular predators,

14
00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:59.650
particular toxins,
low oxygen at high altitude.

15
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.310
Those are things that not all species and counter natural environments are

16
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.120
actually almost never perfect.

17
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:11.950
So some environmental factors are usually suboptimal and some may actually be

18
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:12.784
life threatening.

19
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.460
So hostile factors can be present either continuously,
occasionally,

20
00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:22.480
or periodically,
either at certain times of day or in certain seasons.

21
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.830
And these hostile factors that have sufficient impact on fitness will lead to

22
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.900
the evolution of specialized defense mechanisms.

23
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.250
Some defense mechanisms are universal and others are species specific for these

24
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:39.544
reasons.

25
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.610
So here for example,
is one kind of environmental hostility.

26
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:51.200
The smallpox virus here or hookworms on intestinal new Cosi,

27
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.840
a Predator and cold.

28
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.990
So those are all different types of factors against which certain kinds of

29
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:02.360
defense have evolved.
No,

30
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:04.580
all defenses have cost the trade off.

31
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.320
They evolved to protect organisms from challenges including starvation,

32
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:13.190
infection and predators.
The hostile environment,

33
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:17.030
select maintenance programs that promote survival at the expense of growth and

34
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:18.830
reproduction up to a point,

35
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.320
specialized defenses or specific maintenance programs.

36
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.210
They trade off with growth and reproduction and in general with normal

37
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:30.590
physiological functions,

38
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.720
those defenses are always operating at some cost

39
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.080
because defense is essential for reproductive success.

40
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.760
They have large benefits.

41
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.600
The acceptable cost of defense can be very large because large benefits permit

42
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.110
large costs.

43
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.510
So if we diagram these ideas,

44
00:02:55.511 --> 00:03:00.511
the fitness cost of defense is the cost of the insult plus the cost of the

45
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:03.130
defense.

46
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.600
The environmental insult is causing a cost of the insole.

47
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.070
Then defense ramps up against the insole to try to reduce the cost.

48
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.180
It has a cost and that produces a total fitness cost and because the fences are

49
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:20.500
constrained by their costs,

50
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.310
the optimal defense is not the maximal defense.

51
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.430
In fact,
because of this equation,
fitness cost equals cost of insult clothes,

52
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:31.540
cost of defense,

53
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.960
the total cost of the defense can be minimized even when the cost of defense is

54
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.340
greater than the cost of the insole.

55
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.080
We all this insight to Randy Nessie we have here on the x axis is some level of

56
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:48.880
defense.
On the y axis we have a cost.

57
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.180
The cost of the insole is shown.

58
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:55.330
Declining here in red is the level of defense goes up.

59
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.350
The cost of defense is seen ramping up linearly here and we add together the red

60
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:03.970
and the blue lines.

61
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We get the Green Line which dips down and it has a minimum right here and at

62
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:14.110
that point the cost of the defense is actually more than twice the cost of the

63
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:14.944
insole.

64
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.120
So cost of defense are significant and the optimal defense is not the maximal

65
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:23.824
defense.

66
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.500
Cost of defense have a certain structure.

67
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.660
Different defenses have several types of cost.

68
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.910
The evolutionary costs or measured is negative genetic covariances with

69
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.200
non-defensive functions,

70
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.470
so that's the usual negative genetic correlation definition of a trade off

71
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.490
the maintenance costs include defensive organs and tissues.
For example,
skin,

72
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.550
the skull,
the rib cage,
the lymphatic system.

73
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.090
Those are basic capital investments.

74
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.320
The deployment costs of induced responses involve both energetic and

75
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:10.860
physiological cost,
so they,
the energetic costs are straight forward.

76
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:14.040
You need a certain number of calories to ramp something.
Oh,
what?

77
00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:17.610
The physiological cost is an interference with some other function.

78
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.240
Some defense mechanisms,
for example,

79
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:25.170
immune responses have additional costs such as collateral,
tissue damage,

80
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.260
particularly in the case of inflammation.
Inflammation.

81
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.813
<v 1>Okay,</v>

82
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.080
<v 0>so how can the fences then lead to disease?</v>

83
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

84
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.170
<v 0>They can do it in two ways.</v>

85
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.570
They can either fail to protect or their costs can be excessive from the point

86
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:43.310
of view of the patient and the physician,

87
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.560
not necessarily from the point of view of evolution.

88
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.320
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.420
<v 0>Whether a defense cost is excessive,</v>

90
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.720
depends on the priorities of defense that is protecting from infection versus

91
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:57.950
the functions where the cost of defense are paid.
For example,

92
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:01.730
respiration or digestion in particular,

93
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:06.731
a very strong defensive reaction that could protect well against infection might

94
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:10.670
disrupt respiration or digestion.

95
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

96
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.630
<v 0>Costs that are acceptable in one environment can be excessive or they can be</v>

97
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:19.150
purely detrimental in other environments.

98
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.840
That means that environmental change can shift the cost benefit ratio and make

99
00:06:24.841 --> 00:06:27.880
costs that were acceptable earlier or elsewhere,

100
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.960
excessive here and now.

101
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.170
This is a mismatch issue,

102
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.690
so when do costs become unacceptable?

103
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.660
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.360
<v 0>Costs that are acceptable.
From an evolutionary perspective,</v>

105
00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:49.800
we're priority is given to reproductive success are often excessive and

106
00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:52.680
unacceptable to patients and physicians.

107
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.970
Another way of saying this is that evolution did not design us to be comfortable

108
00:06:56.971 --> 00:07:00.030
and happy.
It designed us to get genes into the next generation.

109
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.023
<v 0>In other words,</v>

111
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.770
cost that were historically evolutionarily acceptable at the population level

112
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.630
can now be detrimental or excessive on an individual level.

113
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.380
<v 0>These sorts of costs illustrate the striking conflicts between the interests of</v>

115
00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:24.040
conscious individuals in the interests of unconscious jeans.

116
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.860
<v 0>Examples include all cases of late life disease whose risk is increased by the</v>

118
00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:36.021
anti antagonistic pleiotropic trophic effects of genes that benefit early life

119
00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:37.380
survival and reproduction.

120
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.650
So the images elicit the early life survival and reproduction and the late life

121
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:45.884
costs.

122
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.540
<v 0>So when do defenses cause disease?</v>

124
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.190
The cost of defense can be the main cause of disease symptoms that's

125
00:07:58.741 --> 00:08:01.410
particularly obvious with infectious disease.

126
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:03.850
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.660
<v 0>Immunopathology is damaged,
which is caused by the immune response,</v>

128
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:11.140
and it's the most common cause of symptoms during infections.

129
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:12.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.410
<v 0>Most symptoms of infectious diseases,
fever,
Anorexia,
coughing,
diarrhea,</v>

131
00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:22.000
or either expressions of defenses or reflect the costs of defense.

132
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:23.840
<v 1>Okay,</v>

133
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.840
<v 0>so fever and these are color of feces as examples of symptoms of infection.</v>

134
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.920
So when is it safe to treat a symptom that is a defense?

135
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.450
If you block a symptom,

136
00:08:42.451 --> 00:08:45.570
that is a defense that can temporarily alleviate suffering,

137
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.520
but it can also interfere with the defense.

138
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.950
Such symptoms include fever,
Anorexia,
coughing and diarrhea.

139
00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.200
All of these are reactions that are helping the body to handle the infection.

140
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.150
If the cost of defense or excessive than blocking the symptoms can relieve

141
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:08.700
suffering without negative consequences,

142
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.440
that would be the case if the costs are excessive.

143
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:16.921
However,

144
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:21.090
the big question is when is it safe to interfere with symptoms that are defenses

145
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:22.590
that are involved in trade offs?

146
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.050
And that question can only be properly answered by discovering the functions

147
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:32.040
with which the defense is trading off and they may be obscure.

148
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.870
So we do not always know the consequences of interfering with fever,

149
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:39.120
anorexia,
coughing and diarrhea.

150
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.880
The summarize environmental hostility is heterogeneous and space and variable in

151
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:46.944
time.

152
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.840
Defenses have costs because they participate in tradeoffs.

153
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.760
Tweaking them has consequences.

154
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.940
Defenses allowed disease either through failure to protect or through excessive

155
00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:00.774
costs.

156
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.880
Costs may be evolutionarily acceptable or the population level,

157
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:09.510
but unacceptable to patients and physicians at the individual level.

158
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.800
That's a conflict.

159
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.620
Some costs of defense can be the main cause of disease symptoms.
