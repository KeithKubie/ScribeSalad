00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.610
I want to do a quick
primer on refraction.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.490
And our focus here is going
to be on the seismic waves,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.560
but the principles,
how things refract

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.380
when they go from a
fast to a slow medium

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.240
or a slow to a fast
medium, It's actually

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.710
the same as you would see when
you're studying light waves

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.610
or actually any type of wave.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.430
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.810
So let's say I have a slow
medium right over here.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.130
And let's say I have a fast
medium right over here.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.269
And let's say, just
so we can travel

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.060
through both solid and
liquids, let's think

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.920
about maybe P-waves.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.620
And a slow medium could be
maybe some type of liquid,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.280
and our fast medium could
be some type of solid.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.330
So let me draw the
boundary right over here.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.306
So if I have a P-wave.

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:49.930
Let's say it's going
through the water,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.100
and it's going right
perpendicular to the boundary.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.150
It will then just continue
to travel in the faster

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.740
medium in the same
direction if it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.980
going right at the boundary.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.449
And it'll just travel
faster in the faster medium.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.990
And that's because
that faster medium

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.030
is going to be more
dense, and the molecules

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.980
are going to bump into
each other faster.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.800
In the same amount of time
kind of the chain reaction

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.660
is going to be
able travel further

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.240
because they are
more closely packed

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.550
and they rebound faster than
it would in the slow medium.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.030
So that's obviously no
refraction is going on.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.350
It has not been deflected.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.070
And just as a bit of reminder,
in general, refraction

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.500
is when a wave gets deflected.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.257
Reflection is when
it bounces back.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.340
Refraction is when it gets
deflected a little bit.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.180
Let me just make that clear.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.270
So if I have some
type of boundary here,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.180
and I have a wave that bounces
off, that's reflection.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.370
But if the wave goes
through the boundary

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.870
and just gets bent a little
bit, its direction changes,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.100
that is refraction.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.440
That's what we're talking about.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.830
So clearly so far this P-wave
has not been refracted.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.060
But if this P-wave comes in
at an angle-- so let's make

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.560
this P-wave wave come in at an
angle-- what's going to happen

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.490
is, and the way you
should think about it--

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.610
and it's the easiest way to
think about which direction

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.943
will be refracted, or at least
the way I think about it,

00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:10.560
is literally I imagine some type
of vehicle with wheels on it.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.700
So this is the top
view of my vehicle.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.660
So if I have some type of
vehicle, and the wheels

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.520
will be able to move
slowly in this medium.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.860
You could kind of view
it as it's kind of on mud

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.220
so it doesn't get good
traction, and then

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.678
the fast medium maybe it's a
road so it gets good traction,

00:02:23.678 --> 00:02:25.230
it could move faster.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.640
So what's going to happen
when the vehicle gets

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.320
to the boundary?

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.450
Well, this bottom right wheel is
going to go on the fast medium

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.470
before any of the
other wheels do.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.320
So it's going to get
the traction first.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.235
These wheels on the left side
of the vehicle, these wheels

00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:41.610
right here, these are still
going to be stuck in the mud.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.010
So what's going to happen is
this wheel right over here

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.650
is moving faster,
so it's essentially

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.560
going to be able to
turn the vehicle.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.590
These guys are still
stuck in the mud.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.260
And so you fast
forward a little bit,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.740
the direction of the
vehicle will change.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.220
And so the vehicle will now
move in a direction something

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.370
like this.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.580
The same thing would
happen in a wave.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.780
If the P-wave is approaching
the boundary like this,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.280
and something
analogous to this is

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.710
happening at the
molecular level.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.155
You can kind of view it
as even billiard balls,

00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:10.030
and maybe they're kind
of hitting each other.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.570
Well, I won't go into that,
because that can kind of get

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.550
confusing depending
on the different cases

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.034
and the different boundaries.

00:03:16.034 --> 00:03:17.950
But this is the easiest
way to think about it,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.449
and which direction
it will refract.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.450
And hopefully it makes a
little bit of intuitive sense.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.990
And so when you go from a slow
to a fast medium our P-wave

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.520
its angle would accentuate
in that direction.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.030
If you went from the fast medium
to the slow medium, once again,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.630
you can just go through the
same thought experiment.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.400
So let's say you have our
wave coming in like that.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.540
Draw the car.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.910
Visualize the car here.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.887
Visualize the car right here.

00:03:43.887 --> 00:03:45.470
And you'd say, well,
look, this tire's

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.540
going to get stuck in the mud,
because it was on the road.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.470
Now, this top tire right over
here is get stuck in the mud

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.150
first.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.640
So it's going to
be moving slower.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.000
So these tires are going
to be able to move faster.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.610
So the vehicle is going to turn.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.110
So you'll be refracted in a
direction like that when you're

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.400
going from the fast
to the slow medium.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.015
So that's just a primer
on refraction generally.

00:04:07.015 --> 00:04:08.390
Now, let's think
about what would

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.810
happen when sound waves are
traveling through the Earth.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.420
And this will help inform
us of, essentially,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.910
how do we figure out what the
actual structure of the Earth

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.500
is.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.190
So if the Earth was just made
up of some uniform material

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.990
and you had an earthquake right
here on Earth, maybe a little

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.090
bit below the surface.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.600
So it's happening in the
crust, but a little bit

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.080
below the surface of the Earth.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.110
If Earth was of
uniform density, if it

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.050
was all the same material, let's
just think about the P-waves.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.750
Because P-waves can
travel in anything.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.600
Let's think about how
those P-waves would travel.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.391
Well, they would just
go in straight lines.

00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:47.710
There's nothing that
would refract the P-waves.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.180
They would just go in straight
lines radially outward

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.855
from where the
earthquake occurred.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.480
Now, at a first
approximation, we

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.880
know that as we go deeper
and deeper into Earth

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.510
there's more and
more rock above that.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.730
The weight of that rock is
kind of compressing the rock

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.240
below it.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.220
So you get higher
and higher pressures

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.280
and higher and higher densities.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.110
So this is a uniform Earth.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.530
But let's imagine
an Earth that's

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.690
made up of uniform material,
that's all solid, a completely

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.160
solid Earth, but one where
the density is constantly

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.290
increasing as you go down.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.240
So let's just think
about it before we

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.576
go into the continuous case.

00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:32.950
Because we're talking about
the density as you go deeper,

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.010
it's just getting
continuously more dense,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.600
let's think about
the discrete case,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.214
where we have the
least dense layer.

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:41.630
So let me draw it
right over here.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.546
So let's say this is the
surface of the Earth.

00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:44.680
This is least dense.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.980
Then let's say you have
another layer over here that

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.330
is more dense.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.915
So this is more dense.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.080
Let's say you have another
layer that's even more dense.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.660
So you have another layer over
here that's even more dense.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.180
And then let's do
one more layer.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.350
Let's do this layer here,
this is the densest layer.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.860
So in general, your
P-wave, your seismic wave,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.072
is going to travel faster
in denser material.

00:06:21.072 --> 00:06:22.780
So it's going to travel
the fastest here,

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.655
then here, then here.

00:06:23.655 --> 00:06:26.280
It's going to travel the slowest
in this least dense material.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.320
So if you're coming
in at an angle

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.140
let's think about
what's going to happen.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.710
So let's say you have
your P-wave coming

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.300
in at an angle like this.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.110
So it's going straight through
the least dense material.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.790
Let me do a slightly
shallower angle.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.430
So let's say it's like that.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.888
What's going to
happen when it goes

00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:46.240
into the more dense material?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.160
So once again, let's
imagine our little car.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.250
So this tire's going
to be able to go faster

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.250
before the tires
on the other side.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.310
So the car is going to
be deflected to the left,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.480
to the down left.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.810
So now it's going
to travel like this.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.296
So it's now going to
travel something like this.

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:04.170
Now, what's going to
happen at this boundary?

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.796
Once again, imagine the car.

00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:08.170
This tire right here is going
to be able to travel faster

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.430
before the other tire, so
it'll be deflected even more

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.594
in that direction.

00:07:11.594 --> 00:07:13.510
Then we go, and we go
to the densest material.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.252
Once again, the tires on
kind of the bottom side when

00:07:16.252 --> 00:07:17.710
we look at this
way are going to be

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.420
able to move faster
before the other tire.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.009
So we're going to get
deflected even more.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.300
So you see, as you go from
least dense material to more

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.650
dense material you're
kind of curving outward.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.640
So if this was
continuous, if you

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.360
had a kind of a continuous
structure, where as you go down

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.370
it just gets more and
more dense as you go.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.590
So this is less dense, and
then it just continuously

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:44.580
gets more dense.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.650
So this is the most
dense down here.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.132
How would the refraction look?

00:07:49.132 --> 00:07:51.090
Well, then it would just
be a continuous curve.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.130
It would look like this.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.770
Your P-wave would constantly
be refracted out like that.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.630
It would curve outwards.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.280
So this was the simplest
example where Earth is uniform.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.030
And that's pretty
easy to dismiss,

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.880
that obviously things will get
denser because of more pressure

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.380
down.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.921
So let's say we
assume another thing.

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:11.470
We have a uniform Earth
in terms of composition,

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.610
but let's say it gets denser.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.540
So denser at the center.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.170
Then how would the
P-waves travel,

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.600
or how would any
seismic waves travel?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.009
Well, then if you have your
earthquake right over here,

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:28.550
the ones that are
going straight down

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.759
still would go straight down.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.133
Because we know
that we won't get

00:08:31.133 --> 00:08:33.070
refracted if we're kind
of going perpendicular

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.440
to the change in medium, or
the change in boundaries.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.746
But things that are
coming at a slight angle,

00:08:39.746 --> 00:08:42.370
as they get deeper they're going
to get deflected more and more

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.161
and more, and they're
going to be refracted

00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:46.078
outward just like we saw
in this example here.

00:08:46.078 --> 00:08:47.660
If they go on this
angle they're going

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.140
to be refracted
outward like that.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.806
If they go here they're going to
be refracted outward like that.

00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:54.237
They're going to be
refracted outward like that.

00:08:54.237 --> 00:08:56.820
If you're here you're going to
be refracted outward like that.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.527
If you're here you're going to
be refracted outward like this.

00:08:59.527 --> 00:09:01.610
Now, what we're going to
do in the next few videos

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.350
is use what we just
learned about refraction

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.890
in the case of seismic waves--
and hopefully we learned it

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.030
in this video-- and
how it would refract

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.790
as we're going through ever
increasing denser material.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.520
We're going to use
that information

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.650
to essentially try to figure
out the composition of the Earth

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.259
based on what we've
actually observed.
