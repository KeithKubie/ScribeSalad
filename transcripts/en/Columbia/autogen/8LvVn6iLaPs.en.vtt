I'm a microbial oceanographer and that

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390
I'm a microbial oceanographer and that
 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.799
I'm a microbial oceanographer and that
means i study microbes in the sea they

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809
means i study microbes in the sea they
 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.880
means i study microbes in the sea they
are super powerful engines that

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:12.890
are super powerful engines that
 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.339
are super powerful engines that
basically drive how our planet works I'm

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349
basically drive how our planet works I'm
 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.929
basically drive how our planet works I'm
interested in how microbes in the ocean

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939
interested in how microbes in the ocean
 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.390
interested in how microbes in the ocean
interact with biogeochemical cycles so

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400
interact with biogeochemical cycles so
 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.159
interact with biogeochemical cycles so
both how they're influenced by the

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169
both how they're influenced by the
 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.319
both how they're influenced by the
chemistry around them so how much carbon

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329
chemistry around them so how much carbon
 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.569
chemistry around them so how much carbon
are they getting how much oxygen are

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579
are they getting how much oxygen are
 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.700
are they getting how much oxygen are
they getting that sort of thing and both

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710
they getting that sort of thing and both
 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.589
they getting that sort of thing and both
also sort of the other side of that coin

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599
also sort of the other side of that coin
 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.770
also sort of the other side of that coin
so how are microbes influencing how

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780
so how are microbes influencing how
 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.500
so how are microbes influencing how
carbon which we know is very important

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510
carbon which we know is very important
 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.139
carbon which we know is very important
for climate is cycled on our planet one

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149
for climate is cycled on our planet one
 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.990
for climate is cycled on our planet one
of the really exciting things and my

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000
of the really exciting things and my
 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.970
of the really exciting things and my
coat microbial oceanography that's

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980
coat microbial oceanography that's
 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.040
coat microbial oceanography that's
happened recently is that we just

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050
happened recently is that we just
 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.069
happened recently is that we just
finished the analysis and sequencing of

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079
finished the analysis and sequencing of
 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.299
finished the analysis and sequencing of
the emiliana Huxley I genome and that's

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309
the emiliana Huxley I genome and that's
 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.819
the emiliana Huxley I genome and that's
quite a mouthful so we call it a hawk's

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829
quite a mouthful so we call it a hawk's
 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.759
quite a mouthful so we call it a hawk's
for short we were interested in a hawk's

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769
for short we were interested in a hawk's
 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.720
for short we were interested in a hawk's
because it is a very unique kind of

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730
because it is a very unique kind of
 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.510
because it is a very unique kind of
microbe in the sea out of a group called

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520
microbe in the sea out of a group called
 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.460
microbe in the sea out of a group called
the cockle Litha force which is also

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470
the cockle Litha force which is also
 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.250
the cockle Litha force which is also
another mouthful so these qaakil otha

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260
another mouthful so these qaakil otha
 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.560
another mouthful so these qaakil otha
pores or eat hawks are super important

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570
pores or eat hawks are super important
 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.020
pores or eat hawks are super important
because they use carbon in these two

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030
because they use carbon in these two
 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.690
because they use carbon in these two
different ways they're photosynthetic so

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700
different ways they're photosynthetic so
 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.510
different ways they're photosynthetic so
just like plants or trees they can take

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520
just like plants or trees they can take
 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.940
just like plants or trees they can take
carbon out of the atmosphere and involve

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950
carbon out of the atmosphere and involve
 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.390
carbon out of the atmosphere and involve
oxygen and they also take carbon up out

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400
oxygen and they also take carbon up out
 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.600
oxygen and they also take carbon up out
of the water to build these chalk plates

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610
of the water to build these chalk plates
 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.160
of the water to build these chalk plates
but one of the reasons we're studying

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170
but one of the reasons we're studying
 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.230
but one of the reasons we're studying
this organism and we wanted to sequence

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240
this organism and we wanted to sequence
 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.940
this organism and we wanted to sequence
its genome in the context of

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950
its genome in the context of
 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.220
its genome in the context of
understanding climate is that we're not

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230
understanding climate is that we're not
 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.010
understanding climate is that we're not
sure how well these organisms are going

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020
sure how well these organisms are going
 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.260
sure how well these organisms are going
to do moving forward and they're very

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
to do moving forward and they're very
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.950
to do moving forward and they're very
important for how carbon is cycled in

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960
important for how carbon is cycled in
 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.880
important for how carbon is cycled in
the ocean one of the ways that we study

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890
the ocean one of the ways that we study
 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.270

emiliana Huxley I or you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
emiliana Huxley I or you
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.820
emiliana Huxley I or you
talks for short in my laboratory and in

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830
talks for short in my laboratory and in
 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.340
talks for short in my laboratory and in
fact how we study other microbes in my

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
fact how we study other microbes in my
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.330
fact how we study other microbes in my
laboratory is we grow different isolates

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
laboratory is we grow different isolates
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.840
laboratory is we grow different isolates
or cultures and special incubators we

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
or cultures and special incubators we
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.789
or cultures and special incubators we
give them all the light and temperature

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
give them all the light and temperature
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.070
give them all the light and temperature
control that they need and really try to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
control that they need and really try to
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.809
control that they need and really try to
mimic the ocean conditions that they

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
mimic the ocean conditions that they
 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.420
mimic the ocean conditions that they
came from and then we do different

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430
came from and then we do different
 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.370
came from and then we do different
experiments in the laboratory for

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
experiments in the laboratory for
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.500
experiments in the laboratory for
example one of the ones that we're

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
example one of the ones that we're
 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.900
example one of the ones that we're
starting right now that's really

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
starting right now that's really
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.979
starting right now that's really
exciting is we're putting our Hux

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989
exciting is we're putting our Hux
 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.479
exciting is we're putting our Hux
isolates or strains under different co2

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489
isolates or strains under different co2
 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.180
isolates or strains under different co2
conditions so we're basically mimicking

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190
conditions so we're basically mimicking
 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.170
conditions so we're basically mimicking
a 2100 year level co2 in the atmosphere

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
a 2100 year level co2 in the atmosphere
 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.009
a 2100 year level co2 in the atmosphere
which causes a shift in ocean pH and it

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019
which causes a shift in ocean pH and it
 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.920
which causes a shift in ocean pH and it
causes a shift and the ph of the the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
causes a shift and the ph of the the
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.110
causes a shift and the ph of the the
water that we're growing these microbes

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
water that we're growing these microbes
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.050
water that we're growing these microbes
in and we're going to do that for the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
in and we're going to do that for the
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.320
in and we're going to do that for the
next four years straight and part of the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330
next four years straight and part of the
 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.150
next four years straight and part of the
reason we're going long term with this

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
reason we're going long term with this
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.790
reason we're going long term with this
is we want to get as many generations of

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800
is we want to get as many generations of
 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.400
is we want to get as many generations of
hawks as possible and we're basically

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410
hawks as possible and we're basically
 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.560
hawks as possible and we're basically
going to look at how they mutate or

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570
going to look at how they mutate or
 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.670
going to look at how they mutate or
adapt to that sort of change over the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
adapt to that sort of change over the
 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.160
adapt to that sort of change over the
long term and once we understand those

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
long term and once we understand those
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.090
long term and once we understand those
mutations and those adaptations then we

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
mutations and those adaptations then we
 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.280
mutations and those adaptations then we
will be able to better predict where

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
will be able to better predict where
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.740
will be able to better predict where
this microbe might be in the future

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
this microbe might be in the future
 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.930
this microbe might be in the future
ocean and what its activities will be

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
ocean and what its activities will be
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.360
ocean and what its activities will be
and part of the way we look at those

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370
and part of the way we look at those
 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.050
and part of the way we look at those
mutations and we look at its activities

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060
mutations and we look at its activities
 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.780
mutations and we look at its activities
as we do special tests in the laboratory

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
as we do special tests in the laboratory
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.340
as we do special tests in the laboratory
so for example we can extract the DNA or

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350
so for example we can extract the DNA or
 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.680
so for example we can extract the DNA or
the RNA from these organisms and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690
the RNA from these organisms and
 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.009
the RNA from these organisms and
actually sequence it and look at how it

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019
actually sequence it and look at how it
 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.340
actually sequence it and look at how it
changes or mutates under this higher co2

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350
changes or mutates under this higher co2
 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.090
changes or mutates under this higher co2
condition we can also look at its

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100
condition we can also look at its
 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.940
condition we can also look at its
activities so we can add special tracers

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950
activities so we can add special tracers
 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.830
activities so we can add special tracers
and see how much carbon and my

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840
and see how much carbon and my
 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.440
and see how much carbon and my
be taking out through photosynthesis and

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450
be taking out through photosynthesis and
 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.410
be taking out through photosynthesis and
how much carbon it might be taking in

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420
how much carbon it might be taking in
 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.420
how much carbon it might be taking in
through the calcification process that

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430
through the calcification process that
 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.360
through the calcification process that
makes those small choc plates that it

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370
makes those small choc plates that it
 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.360
makes those small choc plates that it
covers it cell with
