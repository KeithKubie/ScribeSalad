00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.710
how were the people fed and and that I

seems fine that you say okay you

introduce potatoes or some other
 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.720
introduce potatoes or some other
high-calorie crop and now you can have

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730
high-calorie crop and now you can have
 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.720
high-calorie crop and now you can have
more people or for that matter you

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730
more people or for that matter you
 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.240

to be more people I don't think that

draft horses and war horses so you're

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:46.650
draft horses and war horses so you're
 

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.650

that horizontal mills were common in the

that horizontal mills were common in the

the vertical mills appear to have been

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:53.430
the vertical mills appear to have been
 

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:54.850
the vertical mills appear to have been
more in the Western Empire

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:54.860

you have to have a a gear that will

you have to have a a gear that will
 

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:04.420
you have to have a a gear that will
change the rotation from vertical to a

complicated gearing assembly it is one
that gives you a little more control

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:17.570
that gives you a little more control
 

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:20.380
that gives you a little more control
over the power because the gear ratio

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:20.390
over the power because the gear ratio
 

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:25.510
over the power because the gear ratio
becomes them.they a variable whereas the

horizontal mill tends to simply depend

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:27.410
horizontal mill tends to simply depend
 

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.010

about will have a trough

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:42.770
about will have a trough
 

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:46.450

above them water will flow through the

above them water will flow through the
 

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:50.980
above them water will flow through the
trough and come down and push the mill

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:50.990
trough and come down and push the mill
 

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:54.730
trough and come down and push the mill
around from the top so this is what you

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:54.740
around from the top so this is what you
 

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.560

had in Roman times called an under shot

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:56.570
had in Roman times called an under shot
 

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:58.870

pounding on on on a balloon then once

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760
pounding on on on a balloon then once

you've got an ingot out of that then you

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:00.300
you've got an ingot out of that then you
 

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.870
you've got an ingot out of that then you
could remelt that and make something out

01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880
could remelt that and make something out
 

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.790
could remelt that and make something out
of it but the pounding was a very

01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800
of it but the pounding was a very
 

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.100
of it but the pounding was a very
important part of metalworking so you

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:07.110
important part of metalworking so you
 

01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:11.450
important part of metalworking so you
could have the crushing of ore or the

power instead of having to go up and
 

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.200
power instead of having to go up and
down you have to go back and forth with
