Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Let's just start it from the top. Okay. You Ready? All right. So for reporter Sheri Fink who works at the New York Times and is author of the book five days at Memorial, you could say it all began with two tents. So this was back in 1999

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:19       the u s and other, I think NATO allies were involved in a bombing campaign in Serbia. This is basically like last gasps of [inaudible] war in the former Yugoslavia. You had Serbia attacking ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. NATO was trying to protect them, bombing Serbia, which was creating a huge exodus of refugees. Now, Sherry at the time was not yet fully or reporters. She was fresh out of med school, volunteering at a human rights organization working on a book about a war hospital in Bosnia. And since she knew the landscape, she was able to convince this organization to let her go to Macedonia to document what was happening to document potential war crimes. So I remember I went to the border of Kosovo and Macedonia and like 100,000 refugees had shown up.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       They were trying to cross the border into Macedonia. But the Macedonian government had closed its border with Kosovo, so people who were fleeing got trapped. They got stuck in this muddy no man's land between the two borders. She said police and Rike your were basically lining the Macedonian side. So you had all of these people crammed into this muddy channel and the Macedonian Red Cross and this one charity had gotten permission to set up a makeshift medical station in that border area. Between these two countries, there's a sort of frumpy brown medical tent. Now Sheri was there to conduct interviews, nothing to do with medicine. I was there to collect information, but when I got there, I literally remember walking up to this border and a doctor who I had interviewed previously, this really tall Albanian Kosovo Albanian doctor looked out and he told the Macedonian border guard, let her in. We need her. She's a doctor. They just grabbed you and pulled you into this tent? Yes. What? So you're just out of med school? When this happened, I had just finished med school. Yeah. Suddenly she says she was tossed in with all these war doctors and here's the key. Eventually she gets posted at the door of the tent. And what I ended up doing, or what they put me in charge of was triage.

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       No [inaudible]. It's a, it's a French word. Nice. Excellent. Yes, thank you. Ah, it means to sort or to sort for quality. Originally it was a reference to sorting coffee beans, actually sorting different kinds of coffee.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       But a few hundred years ago, the word started being applied to people to actually sorting different kinds of casualties on the battlefield. And that suddenly was her job.

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       Literally, I stood outside of this makeshift medical station and every minute, every couple of minutes there would be another patient brought to the door of our medical tent. And so my job was to stand outside that door and decide who gets in and who doesn't. Like how did you do that? How did you make that choice? Well, I don't remember having guidelines. I remember just having to wing it. She says she just went on instinct. And so the people who seemed like they might be having a heart attack or a seizure, those were the ones who went into that tent. But you know, people with physical disabilities, no people who have chronic conditions, no psychiatric issues, nope. Everybody else. I had to direct to this other tent and someone ended up calling it the tent of the damned

Speaker 2:          00:04:08       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       I remember appealing for help from the Macedonian Health Ministry saying, you know, take these people into Macedonia. They're not a threat. Um, open your board or take them in. They need care. And the health ministry kept refusing. And so they stayed in this tent day after day.

Speaker 2:          00:04:27       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       sometimes for four, five, six days. And several of the people in this tent, they died. Cherry says this experience haunted her. And years later when she was a full blown reporter and traveling all around the world, looking at triage and different scenarios, she would return to this memory again and again. And wonder, how do people in that situation make that decision? How should they

Speaker 3:          00:04:59       today a collaboration with the New York Times? We're gonna follow reporter Sherry think through the INS and outs of triaged in three different situations, three different places in the world as she tries to understand what it means to play God. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab. Stay with us.

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       are we rolling? Yeah. Okay, thank you. It's going to get, oh, he's gonna get some water. Okay. By the way, we know we're going to start with Kosovo. When did you as a writer become obsessed with all of this? Well, well this, this, this obsession of about triage came about when I was working on my last book [inaudible] five days at Memorial, which was about triage in a, an emergency in Hurricane Katrina. This is the scenario that people in New Orleans had been fearing for a long time. A category five hurricane headed right toward the city. Okay, so this is going to be a first stop. We all in New Orleans have heard the story of Katrina told and retold. Um, certainly it's hard not to think about now with what's happening in baton rouge, but in this story, the hurricane is really just a backdrop really. We're going to focus in on one building. This Hospital Memorial Medical Center built in 1926 in one of the lowest parts of that city, which is really like a bowl. It was a sturdy brick building, eight stories tall, stretching over two city blocks that had served in every storm until that point. It was really seen as somewhere safe.

Speaker 4:          00:06:57       [inaudible] I don't want to leave. Merriam

Speaker 3:          00:06:59       and this hospital became for Sherry, a kind of portal into these questions about triage. She ended up spending six and a half years interviewing doctors at the hospital, patients, nurses, family members, government officials, ethicists, hospital administrators in all. She conducted over 500 interviews to reconstruct moment for moment what happened at the hospital during Hurricane Katrina

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       get ready. This is the most intense part of the storm is getting ready to come across

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       day one, Monday, August 29th, 2005 around 6:00 AM

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       Katrina Harris. I've never seen anything in my life like this and all that. They get it

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       through the storm. Okay, the city power's gone, but they've got their backup power. But this hospital, it had a vulnerability a lot of American hospitals have, which is that they had moved the generators to the second floor so that they would be higher up in case of flooding. But electricity is all about circuits. And they had elements of that backup power system that were below flood level, things like switches and other electrical material, but they got through the first day. Okay. And it seemed at that point that the worst was over. And then

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       you have heard about that water coming over that no. When did the song rise up? Actually, after the coal made it clear though the levies

Speaker 5:          00:08:34       water surrounds this hospital, it fills New Orleans, and as the water started to rise around the hospital, that is the moment that the people in charge knew they were in big, big trouble.

Speaker 1:          00:08:50       They knew what their vulnerability was. How many patients were in the hospital at this point? There 250 patients. There are about 2000 people because you had so many wow staff and then all the visitors who had come with the staff members and with the patients. So Sherry says mid morning on that second day, this is Tuesday, August 30th just as the waters were starting to rise, a group of doctors got together and they did come up with a system which evolved a little bit over the crisis, but they decided first get the babies out, get the critical care patients out, and they knew that they had two high water trucks from the national guard and the water wasn't so, so high yet. At that point it was only partway up the sloping emergency room ramp and they decided to put patients who could walk on those trucks. So

Speaker 2:          00:09:43       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:09:43       helicopter start to arrive. A medical staff start to bundle tiny babies in incubators, ICU patients in wheelchairs onto the elevator and up to the hell a pet. How many patients can a single helicopter take? Yeah, like the ones that were landing, how many can they do? One or two. Wow. So this is slow going. Yeah, it was late evening before they got all the intensive care unit patients out and they get all the babies and they get all the babies. All in, all in that second day, they evacuated about 60 people that are 60 of the most critical patients.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       Although we should also say that if a patient had signed a DNR, a do not resuscitate order, the doctors decided those patients should not go first and they were held back. And we'll sort of explain their thinking on that in just a second. Okay. So darkness falls on day two. The doctors and nurses are exhausted. They'd been working really, really hard carrying patients in the heat. Many of them lay down on cots and vacant beds to rest for the night.

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       And then

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       before the sunrises, few hours before about 2:00 AM the buzz of the generators suddenly just stopped. It's quiet. The water had reached those electrical switches in the basement. Dr Dr. Cook, Ewing Cook, a longtime ICU doctor. He was lying not far from where those generators were. And he said to me, it was quote, the sickest sound of his life found absence. Yeah. And that is when it became an absolute emergency. In this hospital.

Speaker 7:          00:11:25       It's pitch blackness. Some of the medical equipment, if they have backup batteries, they started beeping to warn that the electrical power had stopped. You still had nine patients who relied on ventilators to breathe. It became a hive of activity, I think gotta get everyone out. Everybody was running around with flashlights. These beams in the blackness trying desperately to move those patients down the stairs. Now there's elevators. That's the other big thing. Fortunately somebody found a hole in the machine room wall on the second floor that led directly to a parking garage, and so they figured out they can pass patients through this roughly three by three foot hole onto the back of a pickup truck, drive them up to the eighth story of that parking garage and then carry them up. Three rickety flights of steps to this formerly unused helipad

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       and five of the nine patients on ventilators died just right. Then.

Speaker 8:          00:12:30       It's just like I said, I've been trying to put it away. Yeah, but I want to make this as accurate as I can for you.

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       This is tape of an interview that Sherry did back in 2008 when she was doing research for this story.

Speaker 8:          00:12:44       Okay, good. Introduce yourself. My name is gene is bell is bell. Okay. Just like it's spelled.

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       Gina was a nursing director working on the seventh floor of the hospital that day. She'd actually been attending to those nine patients that didn't make the first helicopter run. And she described to Sherry that right after the power went out and after the ventilators shut down, one of her patients flatlined.

Speaker 8:          00:13:06       And um, we brought him back. We had run out of oxygen. Oh, hospital. That's what she'd been told. And he needed oxygen. And so we brought him down the stairs to the second floor.

Speaker 3:          00:13:22       They brought him down in the dark and then got in line to wait for their turn to go through the hole in the wall up to the heliport window. And she says that since his ventilator wasn't working anymore, the whole time they were standing there, they had the hand squeeze this ventilator bag to keep air going into his lungs.

Speaker 8:          00:13:39       You know, he kept twitching and I knew he needed oxygen. And so I was in line and it was my turn at the window. I kept bagging him and bagging him. One of the physicians came over and said, you do know that he needs the oxygen? I said, yes sir. He said, we don't have any oxygen can, we can't get any and you have to let him go. And at that point, you know, I'm standing there and I'm like, how do you do this? Heidi did just let him go. But he was right. I mean, I knew what were neurological and that he needed oxygen and he wasn't gonna make it without it. So I just hugged him and his hair and I waited and just kinda held him and he died in my arms. And, um, you know, you're not prepared for that. I had to take out of the bar, the room

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:14:55       so I rolled them out and the morgue was full and the chaplain came over to me and he says, come on with me. And we took the body into the chapel and I just did the, and I just bust out crying and he just held me and we prayed. And um, why did he laugh? I just sat the chapel for a few minutes

Speaker 2:          00:15:24       and uh,

Speaker 8:          00:15:26       try to compose myself a little bit, be prepared to help people and to save people. You know, it's just not enough. Everything you've done is just not enough.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       Day three, Wednesday, August 31st, 2005 sunrises and that's when they're expecting all the helicopters come back and they wait and they wait and they wait and an occasional helicopter comes. But this concerted rescue effort that had taken place the evening before has stopped. Now we know now looking back

Speaker 9:          00:16:20       on that Wednesday, the helicopters were doing their own triage coast coastguard, rescuing people and looking at people on rooftops waving rags. It's higher family is on that roof, right? [inaudible] but the people inside the hospital,

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       most of them had no idea. All they knew was we're in this horrific situation. Where are the helicopters at this point? There's still nearly 200 patients at the hospital. And some of the staff, they're panicked because it takes them so long to move the patients to the top of the parking garage just below that hell a pad, so she says on that third day at about seven in the morning, a bunch of doctors and hospital administrators, maybe a dozen, dozen and a half. They got together and they decided that they needed a system, a way of organizing their patients so that when those helicopters started to show up again, they wouldn't waste any time at all. They'd know exactly who to evacuate in what order. In other words, who are we going to get out first? That was the question and that's the moment where they come up with the ones, twos and threes. This is triage. There are limited number of resources in this case, helicopters and a few boats and we have to decide which people get access to those resources. There are a couple of ways to look at this. Sherry says, if you go back to the very beginning of triage, the first conception of it, 1790s Napoleon's

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       chief surgeon baron, Larry, I think you made a rule on the battlefield that you'd take the people who are in the acute need first. So the sickest are going to be treated first and with the most resources, and this is the way it works in most emergency rooms, there's a long waiting line of fevers and cuts, but if you got a heart attack, you get right to the front of the line. Another way to look at it is the utilitarian concept. It's got to start with some philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries. The core of this idea seems simple, try to do the greatest good. You want to maximize some sort of good outcome amongst a population. So rather than think about what one individual needs, you think, how can I save the most number of lives or the most number of years of life? If we want to maximize years of life, we might want to pick people who are, have a better chance of surviving or younger people. And this method of triage is what you often see in a war zone where say there's a bombing and you have more injured victims than there are ambulances or medics. So one, two, three.

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       Imagine a lobby area in a hospital waiting area. Sherri says, in this case, what the doctors did. They ask the staff to get everyone out of their rooms, bring them down to that second floor lobby, and then some doctors, including one whose name might be relevant for later, Dr Anna Poe, she was a head and neck surgeon, she and another doctor, they stationed themselves on the landing where the patients were brought down to on that second floor. And as the nurses would bring them, they would look quickly at the patient's chart, look at the patient and decide on a number. And the nurses would take a magic marker and a piece of paper and write either one, two or three on that paper. And then she says they would tape that number onto the patient's gown. So the ones where you're relatively healthy, patients, patient maybe who had an appendicitis and their appendix out, but they're looking good.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       They could even be discharged. The ones would be rescued by boat. Presumably among the first the twos were your more typical hospital patients. Patient may be who had a heart attack, who wasn't fully recovered, who would need ongoing care. They would go by helicopter, presumably second, and then the threes were those super sick patients or anyone with a do not resuscitate order. Those patients would go last one of the doctors when I said, why did you choose the sickest patients to go last? One of them said, well, I figured anyone with the do not resuscitate order would have a terminal or irreversible condition, which by the way isn't always the case. And he said, I thought that that patient would have quote the least to lose. So it sounds like in some way they went to more of a utilitarian way of thinking. Yeah. And you could see everything that follows as flowing from that utilitarian decision. And actually they it a few different points to prioritize the healthiest people first. And the sickest people last, his choices ultimately did become, um, very consequential. In any case, all three groups were placed in different parts of the hospital and the threes were kept in the lobby. The second floor lobby [inaudible] just

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       way too [inaudible].

Speaker 10:         00:21:20       So as the day goes on the area started to get really full patient next to patient on these cots in one corner she says you had about 18 people lined up side by side and these were people with heart conditions, symptoms of pneumonia, stroke. There were nurses standing around fanning people. It just, it was so, so hot. Some people guessed that the temperature inside the building must have been a hundred degrees. I don't know if there's any way for me to describe to you how intense the heat was. This is Dr Anna [inaudible] in an interview with 60 minutes. She was one of the doctors who did the numbering. It was relentless. It was suffocating and made it extremely difficult to breathe and with the heat came the terrible smell. It's just started to smell really good,

Speaker 8:          00:22:07       bad enough. The bathrooms were so bad.

Speaker 10:         00:22:10       That's Gina Isbell again, she said sewage was sort of backing up in the toilet.

Speaker 8:          00:22:14       I mean they just had to word everywhere on the ground everywhere. You just personally, I didn't want to eat or drink anything cause I didn't want to have to use the bathroom.

Speaker 11:         00:22:25       As the day went on, some people started really feeling abandoned.

Speaker 11:         00:22:33       Why aren't they here? Why aren't they helping us? We're in a war zone here. It looks like a war zone. On the seventh floor there was this radio that was playing in the corridors past six o'clock here on welcome to the local talk station and the radio was this radio station. One of the only ways they were getting information from the outside, the mindset, the needs, the hunger, the anger, the rage is growing among some of the nurses have carts that they would roll around and they'd have the little radio on the cart and they'd be listening. Basic jungle. Human instincts are beginning to creep in and there were tales on the radio that were alarming. The staff, someone is breaking into businesses and alluding merchandise and these people should be shot. Things that turned out not to be true, like you know, run a martial law here that they had declared martial law. There was literally a deputy sheriff who got on air and told people that we even both commented said out, it looked like a shark's fin. He saw a shark swimming around a hotel. They're walking like zombies, like nights of the living dead. That'll just imagine, oh, that would feel if you were in this hospital and that was the only word you were having about what going on outside.

Speaker 8:          00:23:46       One of our employees was like having a breakdown freaking out in the garage.

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       By the afternoon of that third day, that Wednesday, some of the staff are having nervous breakdowns. Morale is really, really low because all these patients are still there. Basically

Speaker 8:          00:24:01       patients was so hot, you know, they would just kind of drift off to sleep and you have to wake them up and make them take sips of water, sips of 'em, whatever. We had, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:24:11       city of New Orleans one day I'm Amanda's Bay, Hello Guy. One of the nurses told me she was worried that there could be brain or lasting effects of this severe overheating

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       so there's this level of, of panic. What happened? Well, so there is also the situation of the pets, and this may make no sense to most people, but they would offer staff members, they could bring their pets if they were coming in to work a storm and they turned medical records over into a Kennel and people start to worry about their pets. Apparently on that Wednesday, one of the larger dogs in Newfoundland started having seizures from the heat. So some of the staff chose to have doctors euthanize their pets and then just

Speaker 6:          00:25:07       try to imagine if you can, looters are running free. It's trying to shatter windows and climate in the stores. It's hot. People are dying. You're hearing gunshots in the neighborhood, you're afraid. Just total chaos. You don't know if there's real violence breaking out in the city. There are bodies floating in the water there. You don't know how many rescue resources are going to come. It's nighttime.

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       And your colleague walks up to you and says, you know, we're euthanizing the pets to put them out of their misery. What about these suffering patients? Shouldn't we put some of them out of their misery and I interviewed all these people and trying to figure out like where did this idea come from and tracing it back and there were all these little informal conversations

Speaker 2:          00:25:59       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:25:59       and this starts just going around the hospital. This, this sort of idea of putting patients out of their misery.

Speaker 8:          00:26:08       I don't know who told me that, but that's what I heard. And you know, in those circumstances, what do you do if you're at war and you have someone that's not going to be picked up and you can't carry them to safety and they're bleeding to death, what did he do? Yell at himself off to yell at him. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       Jerry says that as this idea spread around the hospital, people fell into different camps. Some people thought this was the most humane thing they could do. It would be criminal to let people suffer more. Other people when they heard about it were outraged. For example, Dr. Bryant King, whose colleague, Dr Fournier, she walks up to him and says, there's this discussion going on and you know, what do you think? And he says,

Speaker 12:         00:27:03       dude, you gotta be kidding me to to actually think that that's a good idea.

Speaker 13:         00:27:06       This is Dr. King in an interview on CNN, how could you possibly think that that's a good idea?

Speaker 2:          00:27:14       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       day four, Thursday, September 1st, here's what ends up happening. And accounts here are a bit vague and in dispute, but according to Dr. King who spoke about this on CNN, he says, and other people say they saw this as well. He says, he saw one of the doctors we talked about earlier, Dr Anna Poe, who is still there that Thursday morning caring for patients. These patients on the second floor who were chosen to go last. He says he saw her talking to patients while holding a handful of syringes.

Speaker 12:         00:27:48       Anna standing over there with a handful of syringes talking to a patient and the words that I heard her say, where I'm going to give you something to make you feel better. Nice. He had a handful of syringes, I don't, and nobody, nobody walks around with a handful of the ranges and goes and gives the same thing, these patients that that's just not how we do it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       Did you afford for a beat? After this whole ordeal was over and the rescue teams in the mortuary teams arrived, many bodies were found in this hospital, about 45 bodies found. And so there was an investigation launched. They found these bodies, they tested these bodies for drugs. And what they found was that nearly two dozen patients had received either morphine or verse, said a powerful sedative or a combination of the two in a very short time period on that Thursday, September 1st, 2005. So again, how many it was I think 21 in the end. But it's complicated in medicine. What is comfort and what is murder depend to a large degree on the intentions of the doctor. It's called the principle of the double effect. It's sometimes credited to St Thomas Aquinas and it's this idea that, uh, an act that that can cause harm. But if your intention is to do good, then that's ethical.

Speaker 13:         00:29:11       And Dr. Anna Pope, did you murder those patients? As the attorney general alleges? No, I did not murder those patients and I want everybody to know that I am not a murderer, that we are not murderers.

Speaker 1:          00:29:27       In that 60 minutes interview, Dr Poe flatly denies euthanizing anybody and at various points in the interview, she is clearly distraught at the accusation.

Speaker 13:         00:29:35       It completely ripped my heart out because my entire life I have tried to do good and my entire adult life I have given everything that I have within me to take care of my patients.

Speaker 1:          00:29:52       But Sherry did talk to one doctor, Dr. Ewing Cook. We mentioned him earlier when we were talking about the generators. He's a doctor who deals a lot with end of life care and he was very open with her about the decisions he made. He had gone upstairs, visited Mrs. Burgess cancer patient to see how she was doing and he was just thinking to himself, she's so sick. She's got advanced cancer. I can't imagine she would have more than maybe a week to live. At the best of circumstances. She is weighted down with fluid, which can happen toward the end of life. So she weighs a lot. She's on the eighth floor, so we'd have to carry her downstairs. And plus there's four nurses up here taking care of her. Couldn't we use them somewhere else? So he literally turned to one of the nurses and said, can you give her enough morphine till she goes

Speaker 2:          00:30:44       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:30:44       and that nurse charted huge increase in morphine for her and she died. And that was his thought. So he made this decision and to this day, or at least the last time we spoke, he felt he did the right thing. He said to me, he thought it was desperate. He saw only two choices, quicken their deaths or abandoned them. And I mean if that was the real situation, there's some ethicists would say either of those choices would be, you know, not justified but excusable. But one of the arguments you could make is that when you give up on one person, it then becomes a little bit easier to give up on the next person and then the next person. And then suddenly you're on a slippery slope. And Sherry did tell us about this one case. His case was very haunting and at Everett, 61 year old doting grandfather, very, very heavy.

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       He weighed 380 pounds and he was up on the seventh floor of the hospital. He was conscious, alert, fed himself breakfast, asked his nurses, are we ready to rock and roll? He said to one nurse who never forgot it, Cindy, don't let them leave me behind. Don't let them leave me behind. But he had had a spinal cord stroke. He couldn't walk. He was on the seventh floor of the hospital with no working elevators. And the staff told me they couldn't imagine how they would carry him down those flights of stairs, let alone would a helicopter take a man of his size. And he was one of the patients who was found with this drug combination in his body. And he was, and he died. He died, found his body was found. And by the way, the other tragedy was just as those injections took place was when the helicopters finally were focused on this hospital.

Speaker 2:          00:32:27       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:32:28       did a judge or a jury find anyone guilty of manslaughter or murder or second degree murder or no? Nobody. No. Nobody ended up getting convicted. And again, just to remind

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       you how quickly a hospital can go from a normal American well-regarded functioning hospital to a place where this was even considered and discussed was so short. A Monday morning, the storm hits Tuesday morning, the water rises early Wednesday morning all power goes out and this is Thursday. Wow. That's kind of chilling to think

Speaker 2:          00:33:18       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:33:18       got it. If all of that began with a triage decision about which patient should go first, I'm trying to put myself in the position of the people at that hospital and I'm thinking to myself, God, it'd be really nice to have like a checklist, like a checklist on a wall that says here's how you do this so that I can just check the boxes cause God I wouldn't be able to think my way through that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:33:38       That's where I go next. I wonder whether this story you've just told us leads us anywhere. The first place it would lead me would be to ask is there a system that people could set up, people who are reasonable and who have the expectation that something like this is going to happen again somehow somewhere maybe in my town, my hospital, my place. So what could we do

Speaker 1:          00:34:00       to make this not happen? Well it's interesting you asked because of course after Katrina, there have been efforts since then to come up with a protocol and according to Sherry, the experience in Katrina was basically a wake up call for doctors and hospitals and state governments to think about triage. Like how should we ration medical resources? Like if something bad happens again, which patients do we prioritize first? Which patients don't we prioritize, how do we do this? And one of the interesting things was that the state of Maryland decided we're going to throw this open to our population and have what they call deliberative democracy. So pull people together in a room from all walks of life and have them grapple with this. And I was there. Oh you went to the very first one. I did. I'm imagining like a town hall meeting. Was it like that or no? Yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:34:53       to get started. So just imagine a church basement in inner city Baltimore or a conference room meeting while the Howard County. Thank you for coming, for giving up this gorgeous Saturday to have what we think is a really, really important conversation. There's refreshments at about 1215 we'll take a break for you all to get lunch, bring it back to your table. People have been recruited to be a part of this. And when I say people, it's just regular folks. So the researchers, let's call them that, they get people together and we're gonna get started. Good morning. The, the sort of scenario is laid out. So my name is Lee Doherty. I am an intensive care doctor just down the road at Johns Hopkins. And what we're going to be about today is how we make decisions about who gets life saving resources in the, in a situation when we literally cannot take care of everyone. Today. The scenario we'll talk about is pandemic influenza.

Speaker 6:          00:35:51       They basically tell people, okay, imagine a flu is sweeping the country. Millions of people are sick, coughing, some are dying. The only way that folks are going to get better or they say is if they have a ventilator to help them breathe. But the problem is

Speaker 9:          00:36:06       there just aren't enough. This is horrible stuff. This is a terrible situation we're talking about

Speaker 6:          00:36:12       here. You have too many patients, too few resources. How do we choose who gets those phenols?

Speaker 9:          00:36:18       What are the acceptable options? What might be the right answers? What the researchers then essentially lay out three different kinds of options. Number one, try to save the most lives or years of life by picking people with the best chance of [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:36:31       driving the pandemic, such as giving the ventilators to young people or healthier people. Number two, picking people who will be the most helpful during the pandemic. So first responders, healthcare providers, vaccine workers, et cetera. Or number three, leave it up to fate. Something like first come, first serve or a lottery.

Speaker 14:         00:36:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:36:53       seeing people nod. Does that make sense? Okay, and then they say, we're here to answer your questions. Talk amongst yourselves. Right? Go ahead. [inaudible] ever seen any situation in life where some things are black [inaudible] well, my immediate reaction to the lottery was it's a leveler. It's all the same scientifically responsible way to go. I think ultimately it's fair if somebody is going to live but be very sick. Is that, should that go into the decision? If we've set up guidelines then yes, it's every kind of doctor, you know what I mean? Going to be essential. So don't say that. Now the good news is you're a ventilator and four year old order and I just think that would be the saddest thing. Who are willing to engage in this question, and this was right at the time, you guys remember all the death panel discussions.

Speaker 9:          00:38:02       Sarah Pailin in black and white, of course her death pounds in there. This started at that time and there weren't any fist fights. No, but as you can also hear, I'm all for the first come first serve and nobody has to put that in their context at first because you there and I got there half a second and that is, there wasn't a lot of agreement. I respect your opinion but I'm just dealing with you downs. I think that a time of crisis, there's no room for emotions if you're trying to say, oh we to judge it by person, the person. There's exceptions to the rule. That's emotion talking and there was no gain. So if you're looking at everything that's going on and that's why I have those set up providing all of this, some people are going to have to go.

Speaker 1:          00:38:49       The big findings was that there are certain ways in which we will not make these decisions. There were things that the researchers wanted to be off the table, like not even come into the discussion.

Speaker 9:          00:38:59       We're not going to make decisions based on gender, race, socioeconomic status,

Speaker 1:          00:39:04       people's jobs and incomes and citizenship status and you know, whether they had a criminal history or where they upstanding members of society.

Speaker 9:          00:39:13       Those things are out of bounds. I just want to say up front, that's not, that's not up progress, but those things kept popping up. You have to have it like a young pastor and you might have reprehensible, alcoholic, criminal type person and he might have more years to live. All the years of the pastor are going to be more beneficial to society and the years of this a criminal, reprehensible, Alcoholic Dad, Whoa, you are straying into iffy territory there. That is a personal,

Speaker 1:          00:39:54       there were people who thought that undocumented immigrants shouldn't get ventilators, alcoholics, smokers,

Speaker 9:          00:40:00       curse and the worlds will be a better place in the most brutal terms possible. They're saying, do you deserve to survive? Not Can I save you, but should I try and save you?

Speaker 6:          00:40:12       What's interesting is that, um, people were really comfortable making utilitarian choices, like saying, yeah, that person should get the ventilator because they're going to benefit the greater good in some way. But if that ever got formulated in a slightly different way, which is to say that person should get the ventilator because they deserve it more than another because their life has more value than another person will, then people like we're not cool with that. And yet you would hear people say it that way again and again and then immediately be repulsed when they heard someone else say it that way.

Speaker 9:          00:40:43       I don't think you can determine who has done what in their life and how that's valuable. I might think my hairdressers want to board their appointment, right? I want to look good during my panic situations, and this was particularly acute when participants were asked the second, can we move to an even more controversial topic?

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       Really hard question, would it be acceptable to you? Do you think it's acceptable to ever remove a ventilator from one patient to give it to somebody else?

Speaker 9:          00:41:14       Just this one. I definitely don't have a clear answer by style. Some people said, well, of course if it doesn't seem like someone who's going to make it through the treatments, then it we need to cut it, cut their treatment short and passed out. Then later on to someone else but

Speaker 1:          00:41:31       murder my father. There were other people who said,

Speaker 9:          00:41:34       no, you take my father off center tunnel later and I'm still going to be shoot the rest of your life. It's like never going to sign off. It's a terrible thing to think about, but it's necessary. So complicated.

Speaker 1:          00:41:52       Did they come to a conclusion? Did you, Chad, did you hear a conclusion like, I listen to this, I, here's what I heard. I heard thoughtful people struggling with a problem that is so hard to struggle with that what they end up doing is going, I don't know how I don't want to do this. I'm paying more attention to your guidelines cause I can't deal with this. What I loved about it, the number one response was to try to get out of the situation and find ways to avoid having to ration. That's the most important part of this. Let's not, just before we prejudge this, what is it the researchers are going to take away from all of this? Well, a couple of things that they got out of it. A number one, remember we talked about the different ways of deciding that they put out for people to discuss?

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       Well, it turns out they wanted to combine some of those different perspectives and then Sherry, a lot of people thought, sure, let's start out. Utilitarian. Let's try and save the most lives by picking the people who are most likely to survive if they're likely to survive and they need it. But chances are there's gonna be a lot of people who fit in that category. So if everybody's just about the same and we can't really, we don't have like great science that allows us to know which patient is going to survive and which ones not going to. So for that second tier, let's do it randomly, let's just be really, really fair and give everyone an equal chance. So it's like you introduce a little bit of fate to keep things honest. Exactly. And the, and the research said, do you know what? This is a good idea.

Speaker 1:          00:43:18       Let's see if we could maybe put this concept into the protocol. Am I right in thinking that these guidelines, whatever they end up being, are designed to avoid that sort of like sorting based on who deserves it and who doesn't. Yeah. I mean there's some fairness in having guidelines and especially guidelines that were developed with the input of lots of people. Yeah. So even if we don't like the choices that are made, we don't end up getting the ventilator or our loved one doesn't. Overall, if you know that there's a protocol out there and this is the rule, here's why we had to adopt this rule. It's being applied to everybody and you're not going to be advantaged or disadvantaged over money or over these other things. It sort of helps you accept it. In theory that sounds plausible, but when you put theory to practice, which we're going to do right after the break, things get very hard. That's coming up.

Speaker 1:          00:45:39       Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and returning now to our collaboration with the New York Times and reporters, Sherry Fink. Uh, this is our final stop. Many ways are hard, hardest stop because it's the closest we're going to come to sort of the heart of the issues we've been talking about. And you realize that when you get up close as Sherry's about to, uh, sometimes what's a success and what's a failure or kind of hard to measure

Speaker 16:         00:46:08       test. We can, we can even do the tip VIPs and we want to value.

Speaker 11:         00:46:13       I remember being in Haiti after the Haiti earthquake back in 2010.

Speaker 16:         00:46:18       I'm sorry, I got a 40 year old male. I don't know what's going to happen here.

Speaker 11:         00:46:24       Embedded with a group of us disaster responders, the international medical and surgical response team insert. What's your name again? Sherry, you were in this tent hospital and at this point, maybe about a week and a half after the earthquake, there were so, so many casualties, more than a hundred thousand people could be dead. It was patient after patient kind of lined up in a row.

Speaker 16:         00:46:47       Most of the things we had are dehydration, sepsis, festering wounds, open fractures. Yeah,

Speaker 11:         00:46:54       they didn't have enough resources and they were running out of oxygen tanks and then they were also trying to use these oxygen concentrators, which pull oxygen from the environment, but they rely on power and they were running out of diesel for the generators.

Speaker 16:         00:47:09       Logistics. We're at a critical level with our diesel supply and oxygen for the are so freaking today. I mean I am freaking Frey for us and logistics.

Speaker 11:         00:47:23       The trade of major for this was a hospital that had set up to do surgery. They needed oxygen, they didn't have enough. So the question became who were they going to give it to and who were they not? And at one point, senior sharpness lead you in ICU. I was following a couple of the doctors. We walked into this tent [inaudible] and we met this woman, hi. She had braided hair, a white nightgown on and this tube running into her notes.

Speaker 16:         00:47:54       Okay. [inaudible] and how old are you guys? 38 30 years ago. Oh, okay. Tell her we're almost the same age, which gave him that Guy Betty, how are you feeling today? [inaudible] yeah, she's very bad. [inaudible] did you run out of medicine? And she was doing all right. That's good. [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:48:21       in speaking to her, I found out that she was from Puerto Prince, the capitol, and that during the earthquake her house had collapsed and everyone inside it, she said, which was most of her extended family. They, they died

Speaker 16:         00:48:37       [inaudible] you will all stay together like you know Macy's nephew cause there's an everyday so sorry. [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:48:44       she told me that amazingly she had survived because she wasn't at home when the earthquake hit. Yes, it does. Ending that she checked into this hospital [inaudible] hospital downtown very shortly before the earthquake happened because she had had chronic lung problems. So she was there to get treatment and after the earthquake she was transferred to this American hospital.

Speaker 16:         00:49:06       Cool. How do you feel about the treatment that you got here? Oh, did the big new, was it the good, oh, they treat me well way, way better than anywhere that she's been [inaudible] them, send them Golfer. Everyone's a fanfare. She'd been gone for the American people could do the one that's in charge right now because God is really using them and put them in charge of all the thing that is going on and I love about love about marriage. God bless Obama. I'm happy to see a smile on your face. [inaudible] I see.

Speaker 11:         00:49:42       I started to speak with the staff about

Speaker 16:         00:49:44       alright, you've been taking care of her. Yeah. Basically

Speaker 11:         00:49:49       I found out that Natalie had just won the hearts of the surgical staff there. People loved her. She was so thankful.

Speaker 16:         00:49:57       But she has a chronic illness, which is severe heart failure and hypertension and it's very hard for us to see her leave. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:50:08       told me they had plans to take her off oxygen. They were going to turn down the oxygen slowly to try to make it more comfortable and then they were going to send her off to a Haitian facility that didn't have oxygen, but where she would presumably die. And if you're thinking in terms of hard triage theory, you know, this makes sense because they were trying to save oxygen. She has a chronic problem that probably won't get better. So that's like the theory of it. But the practice of it was quite different. She had absolutely no idea that they were about to do this. She had all this hope for her future

Speaker 16:         00:50:48       should get well. She prayed to God that she would have an opportunity to earn a living, but I'm [inaudible] seven wants to go there to the dog. She wants to go. When she did the Astrodome, is there any way possible then the people would give her like somewhere to stay that some kind of shelter? One that I am, I mean I'm a journalist and I don't know the answer to that, but I, I don't know what to say. It's such a hard situation right now. How did your mind start with that?

Speaker 6:          00:51:15       Where the nurse who was doing the triage, who'd made that decision to cut off her oxygen?

Speaker 17:         00:51:21       I'm Patrick Cadillac. I'm the commander for the insert team. Had never met her. No, I never met the patient, but that's the role pattern that we're running out of oxygen. The country itself doesn't have oxygen, so I have to make the decision. No, she can't cut the oxygen, turn it off. I have to look at the greater good that we can provide with the limited resources. We have Jack Right now.

Speaker 6:          00:51:49       Oh, I see. Okay. And so then I followed that woman.

Speaker 11:         00:51:55       I wanted to see this on a human level as well as on the abstract level. The transporters came a few hours later, look around, go ahead and get him up there. He was the 82nd airborne actually, who were providing that service. They were amazing and they came to pick her up. She traveled, they saw she was on oxygen. They said, okay, we're going to put her on their portable oxygen tanks, and the representative from the hospital said, oh no, no.

Speaker 6:          00:52:28       She doesn't get oxygen

Speaker 11:         00:52:29       ready to go, so they yanked the oxygen Durbar all right, ready to strapped her onto a stretcher. [inaudible] lifted her up, stuck her in the back of this Humvee ambulance Fletcher head by going with, okay, we're going to hop in your car. Go home. I rode with her coming up. Okay, mom, I'm fine.

Speaker 2:          00:52:58       Well,

Speaker 11:         00:53:00       she started getting short of breath.

Speaker 2:          00:53:02       Oh, so you hadn't [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:53:15       put this asthma inhaler in her mouth. She kept hitting it over and over again. She thought it was oxygen. It was horrific to watch her start. Sorry

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       to suffer. I felt complicit. I was doing a story and I knew very well that they had chosen for her to to die and just watching didn't feel it didn't feel right and so,

Speaker 11:         00:53:44       hello. You guys see, Whoa, whoa. Watch that movie. It stopped at this hospital and I nodded over toward her and some of the medical staff went to to look at her, how they go in glaze. No one could see she was in distress. They brought her inside. She was really struggling to breathe, but then she's definitely big time CHF. I saw one of my medical school professors, an emergency doctor and I told them about her.

Speaker 2:          00:54:14       Is it, whose is this? Sorry, is that hers? Yes. Here honey, this mama going, you sit up. Okay Mama. Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:54:24       It's like no, it's like back a little bit and she improvised [inaudible] write it out. She used like all these diuretics to get fluid off her lungs, nitrates or anything. And he found one tank of oxygen that had a teeny bit last minute

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       breathe, breathe better. Okay.

Speaker 11:         00:54:58       And

Speaker 1:          00:55:02       he was able to extend her life.

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       All right, well I'll see you tomorrow. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       ultimately I actually felt a responsibility for her that outlasted the story that I did. Um, and so after that came out, I, I did attempt to help her. Really? Yeah. Well, I, uh, found a charitable group that was willing to bring her to the u s under a certain type of visa program that allowed for humanitarian, uh, like a medical treatment. And the, the cardiologists who had examined her and Haiti had thought she had, uh, a rheumatic heart disease that was causing her lung problems and that it could be surgically corrected. But when she came to the u s in fact, it was found that she had a much more serious condition and she really needed a transplant and she didn't, didn't make it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       Does this make you wonder? So here you've got a rule and maybe in some broad way it's helping, but in that vehicle, looking at this, you wanted to break the rules for very moral and decent reasons in these extreme circumstances where life and death are wrestling with each other. Can you make rules? I mean, I, yeah, because it's like you can't fault the people for taking her off the oxygen and you can't fault you for trying to get her on the oxygen. So, uh, what's the conclusion to draw? Well, let's not give up. You know, the conclusion is let's not give up. Like it turns out there was, there were options for this woman. It turns out that somebody was able to extend her life. Now you could very well argue that she should have died in that moment because look at all the resources that were spent. But I just feel like, like there was some value in her existence. There was so much value. She came to the u s and my God, she took up a collection for all the patients back in the Haitian hospital who she was friends with. She contributed til the day she died and she, she changed my life too. So I don't know how to do the math on this one. Uh, this is the problem.

Speaker 18:         00:57:30       No, well [inaudible] real quickly guidelines is required, like a lack of compassion, the cold hard rigidness of it and everything you're talking about has to do with compassion. This is Simon Adler by the way, our producer and how do you make compassion work on that large of a scale without caring about people and then you care about some people more than other people and then, oh shit, now, now we're hurting.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       That's a very good point. If you don't systematize it, you, you risk choosing people based on factors that are really not fair. Exactly. Because part of me does wonder like what if Natalie weren't such a nice person? Would her, would that have changed things? Well, you know, if Natalie was a mean person that I don't think I would have felt any better or watching her suffer. It's just about the person in front of you. And I think that the more unbearable it is, so the more you have to look someone in the eyes, the more it makes us try to figure out creative ways to avoid doing it. Okay. But I do feel you, I'm somehow refusing to acknowledge the subject point. It really, really gets tough. You say, let's, let's avoid that toughness over and over again. Let's know I'm facing the real problem, which is that it's a problem to have to ration, but we're not gonna figure out the best way to ration because there is no one best way because everyone in society will have a different view on that. I think that that's in some way unimpeachable I think you're absolutely right. We should always strive to not have to make the choice, but with we do have to make the choice. How do we do it? Well, that's a very tough question. Let me tell you that I think what you've hit upon here is an impossible piece of human business, rationing, triage, whatever you call it, is an inhuman act, which humans are trying to do, but the of their humanity

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       makes it impossible. So what we've got here is we've kind of, you know, a real deep problem the other than God role and nobody fits it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:53       [inaudible] [inaudible]
