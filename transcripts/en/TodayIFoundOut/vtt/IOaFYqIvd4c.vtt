00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.640
Buried in a Pringles Can

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.020
Upon his death in 2008, just 20 days shy of
his 90th birthday, the inventor of the Pringles

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.680
can, Fredric J. Baur, was cremated.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.020
In keeping with his wishes, his family placed
some of his ashes in a Pringles can (not all

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.320
of the ashes fit).

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.080
This can was then buried with most of the
rest of his remains placed in a traditional

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.080
urn.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.550
A second urn also contained a small portion
of his remains which were given to one of

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.100
Baur’s grandchildren, rather than buried.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.030
Baur had first made this odd burial request
to his kids back in the 1980s.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.060
After his death, his kids decided to honor
his earlier request that they weren’t originally

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.860
quite sure if he was joking about.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.100
So on the way to the funeral home to collect
the ashes, the family stopped off at Walgreens

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.730
and purchased a can of Pringles.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.760
“My siblings and I briefly debated what
flavor to use,” said the son of Fredric

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.210
Baur, Larry, “but I said, ‘Look, we need
to use the original.'”

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.640
Dr. Fredric Baur was also the one that originally
came up with the “saddle” shape (hyperbolic

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.820
paraboloid) of the fried dough that is Pringles
(note: not baked, as many seem to think).

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.709
While employed by Proctor &amp; Gamble as chemist,
he was assigned the task of finding a way

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:22.340
to get around the problem of stale and broken
chips in bags and thus worked on finding an

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.319
alternative “chip” and container.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.759
However, he was not the one to ultimately
bring Pringles out as a commercial product.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.509
The “chip” he came up with just didn’t
taste very good and he was eventually assigned

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.039
a different task.

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.720
Several years later, Alexander Liepa picked
up where Baur left off and managed to improve

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.990
on the flavor of the fried dough.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.550
Thus, he is generally considered the inventor
of Pringles, even though he borrowed heavily

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.150
from Baur’s work.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.100
It should be noted, though, that the product
the two came up with is not actually a potato

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.260
“chip” (or “crisp” for those of us
from the U.K.), despite the original name:

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.440
“Pringles Newfangled Potato Chips”.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.459
You see, Pringles contain only about 42% potato
based content, with most of the rest being

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.770
from wheat starch and various types of flour,
including from corn and rice.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.599
Thus, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
made them change the name.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.370
If they wanted to continue to use “chip”,
they were only allowed to say “Pringles

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.790
Potato Chips Made From Dried Potatoes”.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.299
Not being too fond of this requirement, the
company changed the name slightly, using “potato

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.000
crisps”, rather than “potato chips”.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.540
Today, of course, most people just know them
as “Pringles”.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.959
While Proctor &amp; Gamble initially argued that
Pringles were in fact “chips” in the U.S.,

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.069
they took a different tact in the U.K.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.269
In order to avoid a 17.5% Value Added Tax
(VAT) in the U.K., Proctor &amp; Gamble stated

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.129
that Pringles should be considered a cake,
rather than a “crisp”.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.340
Their argument was that since only 42% of
the product was made from potato and the fact

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.579
that it is fashioned from dough, that it should
be considered a cake and not be subject to

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.129
the tax put on chips.

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.900
After all, that’s why the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration had previously made them

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.959
change from being a chip to a “crisp”.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.830
The company initially won in High Court and
Pringles were briefly considered a cake in

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.830
the U.K.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.739
However, Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs
appealed the decision and, in 2009, the ruling

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.769
was reversed and the company had to start
paying the VAT.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.019
Bonus Fact:
• Dr. Baur’s Pringles can has many more

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.180
impressive uses than he could have realized.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.760
One such use is known as a “canntena”.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.939
Constructed properly, which is surprisingly
easy, the Pringles can combined with some

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.130
wire and a proper connector can be used to
increase WiFi or bluetooth range significantly.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.099
For extreme range, this setup can also be
combined with a satellite dish.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.760
For the starving photography student, Pringles
cans can also be fashioned into thrifty diffusers

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:53.579
for macro photography.
