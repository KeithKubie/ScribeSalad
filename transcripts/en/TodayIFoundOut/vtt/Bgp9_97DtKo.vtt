00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:14.620
“As an online discussion grows longer, the
probability of a comparison involving Nazis

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.360
or Hitler approaches one.”

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.480
– Mike Godwin

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.560
Coined in 1990 by author and attorney Mike
Godwin, Godwin’s Law was originally, to

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.660
quote Godwin “a project in memetic engineering”,
partially inspired by a 1980s article he read

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.360
in Whole Earth Review in which they discuss
the power of memes to spread ideas.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.300
(And if you’re wondering, the word meme
was originally coined in 1976 by biologist

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.739
Richard Dawkins to describe the way ideas
and values propagate in a similar manner to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.520
genes and, in some cases, viruses.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.520
For more on this see: Where the Word Meme
Comes From)

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.559
Godwin noted that “Through most of the 1980s,
I’d been a hobbyist using computer ‘bulletin-board

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.260
systems’ that connected small local communities
by telephone lines.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.400
I couldn’t help but notice how often comparisons
to Hitler or Nazis came up in heated exchanges,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.240
usually as a kind of rhetorical hammer to
express rage or contempt for one’s opponent.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.180
Once I was back in school to study law, I
leveraged my student status to get a free

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.139
Internet-based computer account.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:19.060
With access to the global Internet came still
more hyperbolic Hitler and Nazi comparisons.”

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.310
These sorts of flippant comparisons to Hitler,
Nazism and the Holocaust troubled Godwin,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.939
particularly after reading Surviving in Auschwitz,
by Primo Levi.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.820
He noted of the work, “I had… seen many
of the photos of the death camps, with their

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.869
emaciated bodies stacked like cordwood and
the haunted, piercing eyes of the skeletal

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.039
inmates who survived.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.189
But Levi’s writings brought the experience
home to me—they helped me understand better

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.090
what the experience must have been like for
prisoners.”

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.810
Thus, he “half-seriously and half-whimsically”
decided to create a counter meme to combat

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.679
the Hitler-meme tendency.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.419
Essentially, he “wanted to hint that most
people who brought Nazis into a debate about,

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:02.359
say, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s views
on gun control weren’t being thoughtful

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.359
and independent.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:09.429
Instead, they were acting just as predictably,
and unconsciously, as a log rolling down a

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.429
hill.”

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.891
The solution to the problem, he thought, was
“to build a counter-meme designed to make

00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:19.450
discussion participants see how they are acting
as vectors to a particularly silly and offensive

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.879
meme…and perhaps to curtail the glib Nazi
comparisons.”

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.159
The result of all this contemplation was the
following “law”:

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.230
As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability
of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.569
approaches one.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.360
To give his new meme that all important air
of authority, Godwin dubbed it Godwin’s

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.430
Law of Nazi Analogies, before posting it in
any online discussions he came across that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.359
invoked Hitler or the Nazis.

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.660
It wasn’t long before other users were citing
his law as well, and the meme spread from

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.660
there.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.909
So the idea spread, but did it actually change
anything?

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.549
While hard data is not available one way or
the other on the frequency of Hitler citing

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.359
in early online discussions pre and post Godwin’s
Law, in a 1994 article about his experiment,

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.689
Godwin noted that, at least in his opinion,
following the introduction of his law instances

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.989
of Hitler comparisons seemed to have noticeably
dropped on the discussion boards he frequented.

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.020
Thus, he considered it a success.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.709
All this said, while today Godwin’s law
is often invoked in support of the notion

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.319
that as soon as one makes such a Nazi comparison
in a debate, said individual has officially

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.769
lost the argument, Godwin himself doesn’t
hold to this.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.370
He notes that, in his opinion, it’s perfectly
fine to compare some viewpoint to Hitler and

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.180
the Nazis, particularly when discussing political
ideologies, provided it’s done in a thoughtful,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.760
intelligent manner, unlike the flippant, irrational
comparisons that are far more common.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.099
He stated of this, “The best way to prevent
future holocausts, I believe, is not to forbear

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.819
from Holocaust comparisons; instead, it’s
to make sure that those comparisons are meaningful

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.279
and substantive.”

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:01.160
It should also be noted here that Godwin was
not the first to lament Hitler and the Nazis

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.900
being invoked in attempts to disprove someone’s
viewpoint or position.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.769
In 1951, a mere six years after Hitler’s
death, the phenomenon of “Reductio ad Hitlerum”

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.159
was given a name by German philosopher Leo
Strauss.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.310
He described this in Natural Right and History,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.989
In following this movement towards its end
we shall inevitably reach a point beyond which

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.599
the scene is darkened by the shadow of Hitler.

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.210
Unfortunately, it does not go without saying
that in our examination we must avoid the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.370
fallacy that in the last decades has frequently
been used as a substitute for the reductio

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.980
ad absurdum: the reductio ad Hitlerum.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.710
A view is not refuted by the fact that it
happens to have been shared by Hitler.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.130
Another popular eponymous law frequently evoked
online that we’ve talked about before is,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.819
Cunningham’s Law, states: “The best way
to get the right answer on the Internet is

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.480
not to ask a question, but to post the wrong
answer.”

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.860
Along with coining this famous rule of the
internet, the man behind the law, Ward Cunnigham

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.360
invented the Wiki, paving the way for sites
like Wikipedia.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.009
The word “wiki” itself is Hawaiian for
“quick”.

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.460
(Incidentally, it’s also technically pronounced
we-key, not wick-ey, though given that pretty

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.759
much everyone mispronounces it, Cunningham
and others have long stopped correcting people,

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.960
ironically enough.)
