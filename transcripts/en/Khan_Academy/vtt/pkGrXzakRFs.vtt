00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.650
We're asked to simplify
log base 3 of 27x.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.400
And frankly, this is
already quite simple.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.620
But I'm assuming they want us
to use some logarithm properties

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.830
and manipulate this in
some way, maybe to actually

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.550
make it a little bit
more complicated.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.260
But let's give our
best shot at it.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.740
So the logarithm property
that jumps out at me--

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.440
because this right over here--
we're saying what power do we

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.050
have to raise 3 to to get 27x?

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.350
27x is the same
thing as 27 times x.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.210
And so the logarithm property it
seems like they want us to use

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.670
is log base-- let me write
it-- log base b of a times

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.280
c-- I'll write it this way--
log base b of a times c.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.850
This is equal to the
logarithm base b of a plus

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.430
the logarithm base b of c.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.090
And this comes straight out
of the exponent properties

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.757
that if you have two exponents,
two with the same base,

00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:55.840
you can add the exponents.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.620
So let me make that a
little bit clearer to you.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.850
And if this part is
a little confusing,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.120
the important part
for this example

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.750
is that you know
how to apply this.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.269
But it's even better if
you know the intuition.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.430
So let's say that log base b
of a times c is equal to x.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.680
So this thing right over
here evaluates to x.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.340
Let's say that this thing
right over here evaluates to y.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.070
So log base b of
a is equal to y.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.580
And let's say that this thing
over here evaluates to z.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.820
So log base b of
c is equal to z.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.860
Now, what we know is, this thing
right over here or this thing

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.290
right over here tells
us that b to the x power

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.950
is equal to a times c.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.550
Now, this right over
here is telling us

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.743
that b to the y
power is equal to a.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.240
And this over here is telling
us that b to the z power

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.670
is equal to c.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.610
Let me do that in
that same green.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.840
So I'm just writing
the same truth.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810
I'm writing it as an
exponential function

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.210
or exponential equation, instead
of a logarithmic equation.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.800
So b to the zth
power is equal to c.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.370
This is the same statement
or the same truth

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.860
said in a different way.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.190
And this is the same truth
said in a different way.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.590
Well, if we know that
a is equal to this,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.030
is equal to b to the y,
and c is equal to bz,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.400
then we can write
b to the x power

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.540
is equal to b to the y
power-- that's what a is.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.275
We know that already--
times b to the z power.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.830
And we know from our
exponent properties

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.650
that if we take b to
the y times b to the z,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.340
this is the same thing
as b to the-- I'll

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.260
do it in a neutral color--
b to the y plus z power.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.770
This comes straight out of
our exponent properties.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.764
And so if b to
the y plus z power

00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:10.930
is the same thing as b to
the x power, that tells us

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.650
that x must be
equal to y plus z.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.370
If this is confusing to you,
don't worry about it too much.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.490
The important thing, or at
least the first important thing,

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.920
is that you know
how to apply it.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.560
And then you can think about
this a little bit more,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.476
and you can even try it
out with some numbers.

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:30.610
You just have to realize
that logarithms are really

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.510
just exponents.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.560
I know when people first would
tell me that, I was like, well,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.393
what does that mean?

00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:36.782
But when you
evaluate a logarithm,

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:38.240
you're getting an
exponent that you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.370
would have to raise b
to to get to a times c.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.350
But let's just apply this
property right over here.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.870
So if we apply it
to this one, we

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.670
know that log base
3 of 27 times x--

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.460
I'll write it that way-- is
equal to log base 3 of 27

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.660
plus log base 3 of x.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.510
And then this right over
here, we can evaluate.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.690
This tells us, what
power do I have

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.420
to raise 3 to to get to 27?

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.710
You could view it as this way.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.060
3 to the ?

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.500
is equal to 27.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.350
Well, 3 to the third
power is equal to 27.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.870
3 times 3 is 9 times 3 is 27.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.367
So this right over
here evaluates to 3.

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:24.950
So if we were to
simplify-- or I guess

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.320
I wouldn't even call
it simplifying it.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.861
I would just call it expanding
it out or using this property,

00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:31.150
because we now have two
terms where we started off

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.734
with one term.

00:04:31.734 --> 00:04:33.150
Actually, if we
started with this,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.530
I'd say that this is the
more simple version of it.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.590
But when we rewrite it,
this first term becomes 3.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.060
And then we're left with
plus log base 3 of x.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.480
So this is just an
alternate way of writing

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.220
this original statement,
log base 3 of 27x.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.830
So once again, not
clear that this

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.240
is simpler than this
right over here.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.798
It's just another way of writing
it using logarithm properties.
