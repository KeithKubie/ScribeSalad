00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.807
- [Instructor] In the graph
below, for what values

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:07.696
of theta does cosine of theta equal one,

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:09.995
and for what values of theta does cosine

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:11.705
of theta equal negative one?

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:14.178
And they've very nicely graphed it for us,

00:00:14.178 --> 00:00:16.986
the horizontal axis is the theta axis,

00:00:16.986 --> 00:00:19.256
and the vertical axis is the y-axis,

00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:23.395
and so this is the graph of y
is equal to cosine of theta.

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:25.788
And it makes sense with
a unit circle definition,

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:28.436
and I'll just make sure that
we're comfortable with that,

00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:31.348
because with our unit circle definition,

00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:34.789
so let me draw ourselves a unit circle,

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.122
and I'm just going to
draw it very roughly,

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:37.478
just so that we get the general idea

00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:39.048
of what's going on here.

00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:41.625
When theta is equal to
zero, we're at this point

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:43.660
right over here on the unit circle.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.097
Well what's the
x-coordinate of that point?

00:00:46.097 --> 00:00:49.955
Well it's one, and you see
when theta's equal to zero,

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:53.872
on this graph, cosine of
theta is equal to one.

00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.178
When theta is equal to pi over two,

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.522
we're at this point on the unit circle,

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:04.089
and the x-coordinate is what?

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.647
Well, the x-coordinate there is zero.

00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:09.108
And you see once again,
when we're at pi over two,

00:01:09.108 --> 00:01:11.767
the x-coordinate is zero, so
this is completely consistent

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.277
with our unit circle definition.

00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:15.673
As we move in the rightward direction,

00:01:15.673 --> 00:01:18.919
we're moving counterclockwise
around the unit circle,

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:21.310
and as we move in the leftward direction,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.249
we're moving counter, sorry.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.605
If we move in the rightward direction,

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:26.095
we're moving counterclockwise,

00:01:26.095 --> 00:01:27.719
and as we're moving in
the leftward direction

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.567
along the axis in the negative angles,

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:32.086
we're moving in the
clockwise, we're moving

00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:35.061
in the clockwise direction
around our unit circle.

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.712
So let's answer their question.

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:40.879
For what values of theta does
cosine of theta equal one?

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:44.669
Well we can just read the
graph right over here.

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:48.371
It equals one, so cosine
of theta equals one,

00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:50.871
cosine of theta equals one at,

00:01:51.884 --> 00:01:54.972
at theta is equal to, well,
we see it right over here.

00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:58.472
Theta is equal to zero, theta is equal to,

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.730
well we've gotta go all
the way again to two pi,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.042
two pi, but then it just keeps going

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:06.868
on and on, and it makes sense.

00:02:06.868 --> 00:02:08.943
Theta equaled, or sorry, cosine of theta,

00:02:08.943 --> 00:02:10.831
the x-coordinate on this
unit circle equaled one

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:12.123
right when we were at zero angle,

00:02:12.123 --> 00:02:13.467
and we had to go all the
way around the circle

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.684
to get back to that point, two pi radians.

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:18.467
But then it'll be again when
we get to four pi radians,

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:22.634
and then six pi radians,
so two pi, four pi, six pi,

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.945
and I guess you could
see the pattern here.

00:02:27.945 --> 00:02:30.879
We're gonna keep hitting
cosine of theta equals one

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.977
every two pi, so you could
really kind of view this

00:02:33.977 --> 00:02:36.283
as every multiple of two pi.

00:02:36.283 --> 00:02:40.283
Two pi n, where n is an
integer, n is integer...

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.018
is an integer.

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:46.486
And that applies also for negative values.

00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:48.606
If you're going the other way around,

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:49.774
if we're going the other way around,

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:53.120
we don't get back until
we get to negative two pi.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.119
Notice we were at zero,
and then the next time

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.681
we're at one again is at negative two pi,

00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:59.349
and then negative four pi, and then over

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.883
and over and over again.

00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:02.727
But this applies, if n
is an integer, n can be

00:03:02.727 --> 00:03:04.468
a negative number, and so we get

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:06.885
to all of the negative values

00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:10.825
of theta where cosine of
theta is equal to one.

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:12.193
Now let's think about when cosine

00:03:12.193 --> 00:03:14.608
of theta is equal to negative one.

00:03:14.608 --> 00:03:18.235
So cosine of theta is
equal to negative one

00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:21.326
at theta is equal to,
well we can just look

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.476
at this graph right over here.

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:26.136
Well when theta is equal to pi,

00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:29.747
when theta is equal to pi, and let's see,

00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:31.407
well, it kinda goes off this graph,

00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:34.455
but this graph would keep going like this,

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:35.573
would keep going like this, and you'd see

00:03:35.573 --> 00:03:37.192
it would also be at three pi.

00:03:37.192 --> 00:03:39.562
And you can visualize it over here.

00:03:39.562 --> 00:03:41.517
Theta, cosine of theta
is equal to negative one

00:03:41.517 --> 00:03:45.362
when we're at this point
on the unit circle.

00:03:45.362 --> 00:03:48.146
So that happens when we get to pi radians,

00:03:48.146 --> 00:03:49.333
and then it won't happen again

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:54.311
until we get to two pi, three
pi radians, three pi radians.

00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:57.135
And it won't happen again
until we go to two pi,

00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:59.277
until we add another two pi,

00:03:59.277 --> 00:04:01.280
until we make one entire revolution,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.767
so then that's going to
be five, five pi radians.

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.431
And you can keep going on and on and on,

00:04:08.431 --> 00:04:10.349
and that's also true in
the negative direction,

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.951
so if we take two pi away from this,

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:15.353
so if we were here, and if
we go all the way around

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:17.812
back to negative pi, it
should also be the case,

00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:20.413
and you actually see it
right over here on the graph.

00:04:20.413 --> 00:04:24.122
So you could think about this as two pi,

00:04:24.122 --> 00:04:25.539
two pi n plus pi,

00:04:27.863 --> 00:04:30.522
or you could view it as two n plus one,

00:04:30.522 --> 00:04:32.772
or two n plus one times pi,

00:04:34.356 --> 00:04:37.856
where pi is, sorry, where n is an integer.

00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:45.973
Let me right that a little
bit neater, n is integer.

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:48.189
At every one of those points, cosine,

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.895
or for every one of these
thetas, cosine of theta is going

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:53.672
to keep hitting negative
one over and over again.

00:04:53.672 --> 00:04:56.875
And you see it, it goes
it goes from one bottom,

00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:58.914
where you can kind of
valley to the next valley,

00:04:58.914 --> 00:05:02.215
it takes two pi to get to the next valley,

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:04.500
two pi to get to the next valley.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.168
And that was also the
same thing for the peaks.

00:05:07.168 --> 00:05:10.010
It took two pi to go
from the top of one hill

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.460
to the top of the next,
and then two pi again

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.293
to the top of the hill after that.
