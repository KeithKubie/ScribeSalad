00:00:01.154 --> 00:00:02.820
DR. MAHADEVAN: Hi,
this is Dr. Mahadevan

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.990
of Stanford University
School of Medicine.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.657
I'm here with my good friend--

00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:07.240
SAL KHAN: Sal.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.290
DR. MAHADEVAN: --Sal Khan.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.570
And we're following up to
our earlier discussions

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.014
about cervical spine
injuries, or neck injuries.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.430
And we're going
to talk about some

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.522
of things you might do to
manage a patient who might have

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:21.980
a cervical spine
injury in the case

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.685
that you had to do
something invasive,

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:25.134
like manage their airway.

00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:25.800
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.565
When you say manage
their airway,

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:27.885
there might be something
stuck in their airway,

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:29.047
or blocking their airway.

00:00:29.047 --> 00:00:30.880
DR. MAHADEVAN: Usually
the tongue falls back

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.500
and blocks the airway.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.110
But you're right.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.500
If your airways blocked, you
can't get air to your lungs.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.250
And if you can't get air
to your lungs, you die.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.470
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.270
And when you said, usually
your tongue falls back,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.540
that's normal-- wait, what
are you talking about?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.180
DR. MAHADEVAN: When
you're unconscious,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.220
the musculature, or the muscles
that control your tongue,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.470
relax.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.630
Because you're unconscious,
your tongue falls back exactly.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.030
And it falls back into
your pharynx, which

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.900
is a posterior part
of your throat, there,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.750
and that blocks the air
from either going either

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.970
through your mouth or your
nose into your trachea,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.770
and then into your lungs.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.250
SAL KHAN: Really?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.710
So if someone's
just unconscious,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.582
and they fall back
like that, that

00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:07.040
might cause them
to stop breathing?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.040
DR. MAHADEVAN: That would
obstruct their ability

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.331
to breathe, and so even if
they were trying to breathe,

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:14.110
they wouldn't be able to move
as much air into their lungs.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.960
SAL KHAN: OK.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.530
So it could be
literally something

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.920
as simple as moving the
tongue out of the way.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.878
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:22.100
And that's really what these
first two diagrams show.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.120
The one with the
young boy, there,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.107
is showing a technique called
the head tilt-chin lift.

00:01:28.107 --> 00:01:28.940
SAL KHAN: Head tilt.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.980
OK, so he's laying down,
they're pushing on his-- OK,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.510
they're pushing on that hand,
down on the top of his head,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.732
and then lifting up there.

00:01:36.732 --> 00:01:37.690
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.300
And in doing so, in
sort of tilting the head

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.630
and pulling the chin up,
what you're effectively doing

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.120
is pulling that
tongue out of the way,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.900
and opening the airway so
air can get into your lungs.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.620
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.410
And this is a little
off topic, but where

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.730
did you get these pictures?

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.650
DR. MAHADEVAN:
These are actually

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.665
pictures of my children.

00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:55.210
SAL KHAN: Yeah, I
thought he was joking,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.550
because they're
clearly drawings.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.520
I thought he lived in some
type of animated reality.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.730
But no, apparently
they are your children.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.410
DR. MAHADEVAN: That's my son,
[? Auditya, ?] on the left,

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.740
and my daughter,
[? Lavinya, ?] on the right.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.950
SAL KHAN: OK, so someone
traced them afterwards.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.105
They aren't--

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.585
DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely,
a very excellent

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:12.200
medical illustrator
changed them from pictures

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.250
into illustrations.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.083
SAL KHAN: Very cool.

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:15.370
So sorry, that was off topic.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.286
DR. MAHADEVAN: And so
the head tilt-chin lift.

00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:21.290
But as we talked about earlier,
if you had a spine injury,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.400
moving the neck, or
tilting the head,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.360
could potentially
cause an injury.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.250
And so in trauma
victims, we tend

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.570
to avoid using this
particular technique.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.540
And we use the one
there on the right.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.590
SAL KHAN: I see, I see.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.642
Because something
might have happened

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:37.850
to their spine or their neck.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.940
DR. MAHADEVAN: And the
last thing you want to do

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.320
is turn their neck, or
flex or extend their neck.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.610
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.170
Right, because this is going
to put a little pressure

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.792
on the neck around that area.

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:45.750
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.290
Exactly.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.357
And the bones can move,
and if the bones move,

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:49.690
they can injure the spinal cord.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.309
SAL KHAN: This is, whoever this
person who's hands these are--

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.600
DR. MAHADEVAN: My wife's hands.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.866
SAL KHAN: Oh, these
are your wife's hands?

00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:56.450
Really?

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.480
It's a family affair.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.239
And so what is it
she doing exactly?

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.030
DR. MAHADEVAN: She's
doing a maneuver which

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.113
we would use in someone
who potentially could have

00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:06.080
an injury to the neck,
called the jaw thrust.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.190
And essentially
what she's doing is,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.680
she's grasping the angle of the
mandible, exactly right there,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.990
kind of like a little 90
degree angle that we have,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.790
and pulling that
mandible forward.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.860
And in doing that,
what she's doing is,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.880
she's doing the same thing
as the head tilt-chin lift,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.350
just she's not flexing the
neck or extending the neck.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.974
SAL KHAN: So you're just kind of
just moving the jaw as opposed

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:28.790
to everything else.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.720
DR. MAHADEVAN: And
in moving the jaw,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.178
you're pulling that
tongue forward,

00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:32.352
and opening the airway.

00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:34.310
SAL KHAN: I see, because
the tongue's in there.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.030
OK.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.130
That makes sense.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.921
DR. MAHADEVAN: And so
this is the technique

00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:39.890
that we use for trauma victims.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.830
And the reason that
this is important

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.460
is really shown in the x-rays.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.865
And what you see
is, the same person.

00:03:48.865 --> 00:03:51.850
And in the first
x-ray, you can see,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.530
as we talked about earlier,
their spine is well aligned.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.140
So if you were to
check their alignment,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.470
anterior vertebral body line--

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.360
SAL KHAN: Yeah, I'm an
expert at this, now.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.318
DR. MAHADEVAN: --posterior
vertebral body line,

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:05.850
spinolaminar line, and
spinous process line

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.370
all look fine in this
particular circumstance.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.590
But what you can see, is
if you remove the lines,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.616
you can see that there
is a small fracture--

00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:17.490
SAL KHAN: Right here.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.698
DR. MAHADEVAN: --right there.

00:04:18.698 --> 00:04:19.850
Exactly.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.850
And right in front
of that fracture,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.160
there's a bunch of swelling.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.210
All that stuff right there
is your soft tissues,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.710
and so they're swollen.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.770
And what you can't see is
that your whole cervical spine

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.650
is held together by ligaments.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.730
And sometimes they can
be torn, and you may not

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.444
be able to see
them on the x-ray.

00:04:40.444 --> 00:04:41.110
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.230
How did you know there
was swelling here?

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.155
DR. MAHADEVAN: If you
look at the x-ray,

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:49.320
you can see that the distance
between the front of the spine,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.399
and the front of the
soft tissues, is widened.

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:53.190
SAL KHAN: Than what
you would normally see.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.610
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.900
SAL KHAN: I see

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.858
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:04:54.858 --> 00:04:56.960
It's usually very
small, very narrow

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.565
in that part of
the cervical spine.

00:04:58.565 --> 00:04:59.231
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.210
It makes sense.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.750
DR. MAHADEVAN: And
what you realize

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.770
is, if a person were to come
and try to open the airway,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.632
what happens on the next
radiograph could occur.

00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:09.340
So if I were to--

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.890
SAL KHAN: So if they used this
technique right over here.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.431
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly if they
were to use the head tilt-chin

00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:15.200
lift, and were to
tilt that head back--

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.890
SAL KHAN: Oh, yeah, put
that pressure right there.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.848
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:05:17.848 --> 00:05:20.110
What could happen,
the next x-ray shows--

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.099
SAL KHAN: They push the--
I wanted to use magenta,

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:23.890
It's easier to see.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.140
So they push that back--

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.390
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.010
SAL KHAN: And then
[? wow. ?] OK.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.960
DR. MAHADEVAN: And now if you
were to draw your lines again,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.905
specifically, the anterior
you might get away with--

00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:34.780
SAL KHAN: Yeah, but
this one right--

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.613
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:35.613 --> 00:05:38.510
DR. MAHADEVAN: Definitley the
posterior line is abnormal.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.470
And again, the key fact
here is that, right

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.040
behind that line that you
drew is your spinal cord.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.880
SAL KHAN: Yes,
which is important.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.890
Right.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.990
DR. MAHADEVAN: And so one of the
tenets of Emergency Medicine,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.150
and medicine in
general, is do no harm.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.480
And here, in an attempt to
open the air way, by this head

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.795
tilt-chin lift
maneuver, we potentially

00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:00.107
could do harm to the patient.

00:06:00.107 --> 00:06:00.690
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.490
Wow, wow.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.240
Do no harm.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.400
It's a good first rule of thumb.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.400
Right, right.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.400
DR. MAHADEVAN: The next
step that we would take,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.760
if just simply
opening the airway

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.400
wasn't adequate to get
someone breathing again,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.950
potentially would be to actually
intubate them, or insert

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.210
a plastic breathing
tube into their trachea,

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.090
and allow them to breathe.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.500
What you can see there
is the act of intubation.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.030
SAL KHAN: So yeah, I've heard
this word intubate a lot.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.530
My wife is a
physician, and I always

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.140
hear-- so this is
literally you're

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.397
inserting a tube
to clear things?

00:06:33.397 --> 00:06:34.980
DR. MAHADEVAN: You're
inserting a tube

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.680
to create a passageway from
the oxygen-rich atmosphere,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.530
and directly into your lungs.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.520
And again, if your
tongue has fallen back,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.760
and you can't keep it out
of the way, or you vomited

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.710
and you're
unconscious, this would

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.740
be something that
would help you breathe.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.240
SAL KHAN: How far
does this tube go?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.180
DR. MAHADEVAN: It starts
right at your mouth,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.850
and it goes all the way down--

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.160
SAL KHAN: It's a flexible
tube, I'm assuming.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.659
DR. MAHADEVAN: It's
a flexible tube,

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:03.570
and it would go right in between
this cartilage right here.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.885
So it would kind of go
right there, exactly.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.410
Right through the larynx,
and right there where

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.030
you've got the pointer, there,
is where your vocal cords are.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.140
And it would go just
beyond the vocal cords,

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.420
right into your trachea.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.200
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.050
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly, exactly.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.508
SAL KHAN: And that's
because that's

00:07:20.508 --> 00:07:22.610
where you normally have
something blocking.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.040
DR. MAHADEVAN: That is
the connection between

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.220
the oxygen-rich environment--

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.580
SAL KHAN: Oh, yeah.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.750
After that, then
the oxygen can get

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.030
to you, at least some
part of your lungs.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.571
DR. MAHADEVAN: You've
got a tube now.

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.519
You've got an airway, and
you can give, deliver oxygen

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:33.810
to a patient through that tube.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.470
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:34.770
I see.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.978
And what are they doing here?

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:36.960
What are they pinching?

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.050
DR. MAHADEVAN: In this
particular diagram,

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.900
what they're doing
is a couple things.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.680
There's actually
three people there.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.260
One person who looks
like they're pinching

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.430
is actually putting
pressure on your cartilage,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.440
your cricoid cartilage.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.975
And they're doing that
to push back and occlude

00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:54.077
your esophagus.

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:55.410
SAL KHAN: Occlude the esophagus.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.670
What is occlude?

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.950
DR. MAHADEVAN: They want
to close off the esophagus

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.460
because the esophagus
connects to the stomach.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.827
The stomach is full of
whatever you had to eat.

00:08:03.827 --> 00:08:04.660
SAL KHAN: Oh, I see.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.140
So you might be continuing
to-- fluid could be coming out

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.651
and all of that.

00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:09.150
I see.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.502
So there could be stuff
coming out from the stomach.

00:08:11.502 --> 00:08:12.960
DR. MAHADEVAN:
Right and that tube.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.164
The esophagus runs right back
here, and it could come up.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:18.830
SAL KHAN: Sorry.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.496
Shows how much I know
about [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.465
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:26.710
Running right behind
your airway, right there,

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.700
and by pushing back, you
collapse the esophagus

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.836
and prevent any of what we
call passive regurgitation or--

00:08:32.836 --> 00:08:33.502
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:08:33.502 --> 00:08:36.320
So they're pushing this--
and let me do this in another

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.470
color-- they're
actually pushing back,

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.092
and the esophagus is likely
to get closed, then--

00:08:41.092 --> 00:08:42.050
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.140
SAL KHAN: So something
can't come from the stomach.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.310
That doesn't close-- the
trachea's more rigid?

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.309
DR. MAHADEVAN: The trachea
is a rigid structure.

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:49.844
And this is actually, the
first ring of the trachea

00:08:49.844 --> 00:08:51.260
is a cricoid
cartilage, and that's

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.190
what they're pushing
on right there.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.550
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.260
So this is rigid there,
so when you push,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.480
it closes the esophagus,
trachea can still stay open.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:56.850
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.220
SAL KHAN: That makes sense.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.280
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.280
So there's three people.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.930
One person that we talked about
is giving cricoid pressure,

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.450
and that would be that gentleman
right there, or a young lady.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.740
The second person is
actually holding the head,

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.027
as you can see.

00:09:10.027 --> 00:09:11.610
And the reason that
they're doing that

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.860
is for what we showed earlier.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.490
They don't want that
head to extend or flex.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.680
So they're actually holding the
person in the neutral position

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.220
to prevent those bones,
potentially, from moving.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:22.935
SAL KHAN: Right,
because they're going

00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:24.495
to be jiggling
this thing through,

00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:26.562
and if there wasn't
someone holding it,

00:09:26.562 --> 00:09:27.770
it could do that same damage.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:28.070
DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.370
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.990
DR. MAHADEVAN: And when you're
that guy at the top who's

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.394
trying to see the vocal
cords, and pass the tube,

00:09:33.394 --> 00:09:34.810
you don't care
about anything else

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.226
except for seeing
the vocal cords.

00:09:36.226 --> 00:09:39.155
So you might inadvertently flex
the neck or extend the neck.

00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:39.825
SAL KHAN: Right,
that makes sense.

00:09:39.825 --> 00:09:40.560
It makes sense.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.459
Is that also why they
say at an accident,

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:44.500
no, don't move the person
and that type of thing?

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.030
DR. MAHADEVAN:
That's exactly why.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.460
Again, do no harm.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.100
In trying to help the
person by lifting them up,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.260
or tilting their head,
or flexing their neck,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.960
you potentially could cause a--

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.810
SAL KHAN: And that's why wait
for the EMTs, or whoever,

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.570
and then they'll--

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.030
DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.290
SAL KHAN: --do it right.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.500
I see.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.350
DR. MAHADEVAN: And if you
really had to open their airway,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.934
you could use the
jaw thrust maneuver.

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:01.599
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:03.040
Just pull their jaw forward.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.320
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:03.930
SAL KHAN: And hold on to the--

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:04.888
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:08.220
SAL KHAN: We touched
on right before this,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.595
there's other ways
of doing this?

00:10:09.595 --> 00:10:12.590
Or there's other methods
that people talk about?

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.090
DR. MAHADEVAN: This
cricoid pressure

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.350
is quite controversial,
because one of the things

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.090
is it's supposed to help
you with this procedure,

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.630
and some people feel that it
may not be proven to help you.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.590
Or it potentially
can cause injury.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.530
But for those of
us that are older,

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.160
have used this technique for a
long time, still stand by it.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.100
SAL KHAN: OK, this is what y'all
teach it at the med school.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:31.600
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:31.850
SAL KHAN: OK.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.680
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.763
SAL KHAN: Well, thank you.

00:10:33.763 --> 00:10:34.970
This is very, very useful.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.650
DR. MAHADEVAN: You bet.
