My professor is the president...

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.267
of the Society for the Study of Evolution...

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.400
and the American Genetic Association.

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:17.167
He’s respected for employing genetic tools
for the study of evolutionary biology.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.567
He believes that close social bonds help
the group to work better together in the lab.

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:29.500
We work side-by-side to analyze the data
from my field research in Australia...

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.433
and to study the evolution of a pathogen.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:38.733
We’re doing the kind of science
that the world expects from Harvard.

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:43.100
I just never expected to do it
over breakfast.
