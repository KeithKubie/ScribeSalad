glowing green rock and it's explained in
a cutscene it like forces the main

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
a cutscene it like forces the main
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330
a cutscene it like forces the main
characters to see a cutscene that you

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
characters to see a cutscene that you
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.280

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
exposition filled backstory and you just
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.830
exposition filled backstory and you just
