00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 Rulers are often close, power moves from one person to another to form a smooth rule 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.719
 Not only with kings or dictators, but also with representatives in democracy. 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.960
 Families transfer power, or compete with other families for a role in power, much more than an opportunity. 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 The ruling dynasties seem normal, they may not be paying attention 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.380
 But you should consider them if you want to understand and take power for as long as possible. 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.720
 Even if you follow the rules of the rulers we discussed: 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.879
 ... transfer power switches, secure the treasury, control the elimination: no man governs forever. 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.980
 The dictators with abundant resources and undisputed power still Fannie. 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.120
 Representatives (Democrats) have to deal with death both literal and political. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.480
 But no matter what kind of ruler you are, your keys (Moedink), care about their wealth. 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.459
 They keep you in your position, not your love in particular, but for the rewards they offer, in general. 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 But dead rulers can not distribute wealth. 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.440
 So as your death approaches. Your supporters will feel nervous. 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.860
 Your inevitable death will force your keys (moyedic) to plan to replace you, ... 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.500
 ... not only to preserve their wealth, but also because the sudden death of the ruler without planning will result ... 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.140
 ... to scramble for power at best, and a bath of blood at worst, ... 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.740
 ... leaving many keys (moyedon) inside now, then abroad. 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.460
 That is why, if you are sick, keep your illness secret: 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.119
 If your keys (Mooi) think you might die, they should start planning for the next ruler to avoid this. 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.260
 Which makes even rumors about the ruler's health ... scary. 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:57.140
 Whispers about your health are poison to destabilize the minds of your supporters, and it is almost impossible to remove it. 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.260
 For keys, your replacement is inevitable anyway, so why not start planning sooner. Only for warranty. 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.640
 Thus after a rumor, the keys may seem on your side in their business, ... 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.360
 ... but you are already dead in their minds. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.280
 You've lost control and will lose your throne, sooner than you want. 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.360
 But while you can not defend against the King of Death or the extraction of poison from the minds of your supporters: 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.400
 Is there a way to defend your authority in this world of rumors of your death to the other. 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.340
 Mohammed. Muhammad is the answer. 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.900
 Dictatorships and democracies have a lot of family rule, because the main supporters want it. 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.860
 As your limit or your death is approaching, your family is there, willing to keep running the power conversion mechanism: 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.500
 ... continue to raise the treasury, keep the keys quiet and free of plots. 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.200
 Surely the affectionate ruler may want to give advantages to their families, ... 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.600
 ... and being a regent comes with so many ... 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.520
 ... but the main supporters also want a ruling family in positions of power because ... 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.340
 The family that conspires together, govern together. 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 The power of generations: Beyond the limits of death and time. 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.520
 And so the chieftains will worry less about the power shifts, and you will worry less about their plans to replace you. 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.500
 While the main supporters will not trust you or your family simply, 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.140
 ... Keychain can consider the motivational interests of all of you: 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.920
 Account that staying with your family during a transition period gives them better opportunities to stay indoors ... 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.280
 ... because they know you and your relatives. 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.260
 Also you will calculate, staying with the keys during a transition period will give you the best odds of staying on the throne. 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.540
 It's an effective loop. Formed by accounts that are like confidence, but better. 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.859
 The ruler gets a longer sentence, the keys will worry less, ... 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.120
 ... and everything is smooth because when the king died, the king lived. 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.600
 Therefore, place the family in a high place in the military, trade, or political. 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.560
 Not to mention the "qualifications" because for your family being qualified. 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.320
 They must work with your sights, so they know where the money comes from and how it is distributed. 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.140
 Family relations with the keys keep everyone calm not only during the transition, ... 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.899
 ... But more importantly for you and the length of your rule: than before. 

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:26.159
 So even if you do not have any interest in marriage and you do not have love for children, however: get them. 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.560
 Of course, the risk of family they too will overthrow you. 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.200
 Many princes challenged their kings, if they were sure they did not mind the keys. 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:44.799
 But nothing sure, you can only play luck, the ruler without a family more susceptible to competitors and rumors. 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.180
 Remember, the keys are concerned with treasury security in general, not you in particular. 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.280
 For them, a family of rulers is a safe investment. 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.340
 Thus, your overthrow is the price you pay to buy a longer and safer family rule. 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.280
 That is why: Families are very popular among the rulers and their main supporters. 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.719
 The family is a tool to stay in power, just like any other country.
