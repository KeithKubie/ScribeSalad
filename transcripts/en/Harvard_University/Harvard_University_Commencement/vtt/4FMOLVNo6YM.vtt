00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.390
Thank you, Susan, for those generous words,
and thank you graduates, alumni and friends

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.900
for that generous welcome.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.240
Heartfelt congratulations to you, our graduates,
and to your families for the hard work and

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.030
many accomplishments that have brought you
to this day.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.220
I am especially grateful to John Lewis for
sharing his inspiring words and presence with

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.610
us.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:37.819
There can be no finer example of how to live
a life than that of John Lewis, whose courage,

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:46.800
dedication, selflessness, and moral clarity
have for more than a half century challenged

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.230
this country to realize its promise of liberty
and justice for all.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:01.920
It is an inexpressible honor and privilege
to stand on this stage beside him.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.200
Almost eleven years ago I stood on this platform
to deliver my inaugural address as Harvard’s

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.170
28th president.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.890
Today’s remarks represent something of a
bookend—a kind of valedictory—vale-dictory,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.540
literally, farewell words.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:32.030
When I spoke in 2007, I observed that inaugural
speeches are “by definition pronouncements

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.460
by individuals who don’t yet know what they
are talking about.”

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.700
By now I can no longer invoke that excuse.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.810
I am close to knowing all I ever will about
being Harvard’s president.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:58.980
I then went on to say something else about
the peculiar genre of inaugural addresses:

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:06.870
that we might dub them, as I put it then,
“expressions of hope unchastened by the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.390
rod of experience.”

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.250
By now I should know that rod.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.620
In my mind I hear the Jimi Hendrix of my youth
asking: “Are you experienced?”

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.010
I would have to answer affirmatively.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.810
Perhaps not as experienced as Charles William
Eliot who made it through 40 years as Harvard

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.310
president.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.190
But 11 years is a long time.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:48.940
Think about it: the iPhone and I were launched
within 48 hours of each other in the summer

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.480
of 2007.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.211
We are now so attached to our devices that
it seems almost unimaginable that they were

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.660
not always there.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.650
The smartphone initiated a revolution in how
we communicate, how we interact, how we organize

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.740
our lives.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.930
We are only beginning to understand the impact
of this digital transformation on our disrupted

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.420
society, economy, politics—and even our
brains.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.660
2008 brought the financial crisis and the
loss of close to a third of our endowment—prompting

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.640
us in the ensuing years to overturn a system
of governance that had been in place since

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.950
1650, and to transform our financial—and
ultimately our investment—processes and

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.599
policies.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.209
Five years ago, we lived through the marathon
bombings and the arrival of terror in our

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.280
very midst—and came together as Boston Strong.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.760
We have experienced wild weather from hurricanes
to snowmageddon to bombogenesis, and doubled

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.620
down on our commitment to combat climate change.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.629
We have confronted a cheating crisis, an email
crisis, a primate crisis, and sexual assault

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:25.460
and sexual harassment crises—and made significant
and lasting changes in response to each.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:34.560
We have faced down H1N1, Ebola, Zika, and
even the mumps.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:42.660
We have been challenged—as well as often
inspired and enlightened—by renewed and

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:53.600
passionate student activism: Occupy; Black
Lives Matter; Divest Harvard; I, Too, Am Harvard;

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.650
Undocumented at Harvard and hashtag Me Too.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:06.620
We have faced a political and policy environment
increasingly hostile to expertise and skeptical

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:14.380
about higher education: the unprecedented
endowment tax passed last December will, we

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:23.020
estimate, impose on us a levy next year equivalent
to $2,000 per student.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.479
There has indeed been a good measure of chastening.

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:36.080
But today I want to focus not on that “rod
of experience,” but on what I then defined

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.199
as the essence of an inaugural message: the
expression of hope.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:53.240
Now, as then, that is what fills both my mind
and my heart as I think about Harvard, its

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.520
present and its future.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:05.270
These past eleven years have only strengthened
my faith in higher education and its possibilities.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:14.759
Hope, I have learned, derives not just from
the innocence of inexperience, but from the

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:24.570
everyday realities, the day-to-day work of
leading and loving this university.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:34.270
At a time of growing distrust of institutions
and constant attacks on colleges and universities,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:43.370
I want to affirm my belief that they are beacons
of hope—I think our best hope—for the

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.930
future to which we aspire.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:54.259
In their very essence universities are about
hope and about the future, and that is at

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:59.169
the heart of what we celebrate today.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.240
Hope is the foundation of learning.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:13.199
The 6,989 graduates we honor today arrived
here with aspirations about what education

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:20.291
could make possible, with dreams about how
their lives would be changed because of the

00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:23.120
time they would spend here.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:33.210
Dean Rakesh Khurana regularly speaks to students
in the College about the transformations—intellectual,

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:40.229
social, personal—they should seek from their
undergraduate experience, urging them to articulate

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:45.569
their hopes and define a path toward realizing
them.

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:52.889
And we do have such very high aspirations
for them: that they find lives of meaning

00:07:52.889 --> 00:08:00.800
and purpose, that they discover a passion
that animates them, that they strive toward

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:08.630
veritas, that they use their education to
do good in the world.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:16.650
Never has the world needed these graduates
more, and I think they understand that.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:23.380
I had lunch with a dozen or so seniors a month
ago, and I asked them to characterize their

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.820
four years here.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:32.270
They spoke of the ways they had changed and
grown, but, more pointedly, they spoke of

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:37.539
how the world seemed to have changed around
them.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:44.120
They worried about the health and sustainability
of the earth; they worried about the health

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.310
of our democracy and of civil society.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:56.410
And they described how their attitudes and
plans had altered because of these changed

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.440
circumstances.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:05.151
They no longer took their world for granted;
the future of our society, our country, our

00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:11.870
planet could not be guaranteed; it was up
to them.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:20.140
Their careers and life goals had shifted to
embrace a much broader sense of responsibility

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:27.360
extending beyond themselves to encompass an
obligation to a common good they had come

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.510
to recognize might not survive without them.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:40.520
I thought of these students as something akin
to alchemists—confronting dark realities

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:49.570
and forging a golden path that offered hope—to
themselves about their own lives, but to all

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:59.000
of us as we imagine what these extraordinary
graduates will do with and for the damaged

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.100
world we offer them as their inheritance.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:09.250
It would be impossible to be surrounded by
these students as they move through their

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:17.680
time at Harvard without being filled with
hope about the future they will create.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:26.700
To paraphrase the Ed School’s Campaign slogan,
they are here learning to change the world.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:33.630
Building a more enlightened world is of course
the fundamental work of the faculty as well,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:39.130
and at the core of Harvard’s identity as
a research university.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:46.180
The fundamental question we ask as we consider
appointing a professor is “What has this

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:53.940
person done to alter and enhance our understanding
of the world?”

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.649
Perhaps they have revealed how the microbiome
works, or how international trade agreements

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:09.110
affect economic prosperity, or how undocumented
students confront educational challenges.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:16.290
Perhaps they’ve unlocked ways to identify
the actual location of genes that cause schizophrenia,

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:24.100
or have discovered how to engineer an exo-suit
to enable a person to walk.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:31.240
Harvard scholars explore history and literature
to help us understand tyranny; art to illuminate

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:38.610
the foundations of justice; law and technology
to address assaults on fundamental assumptions

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.440
about privacy.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:49.970
With its eye cast on creating a different
future, all of this work is founded in hope—of

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:57.000
seeing something more clearly, of influencing
others to change their understanding and perhaps

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.860
even their actions.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:07.529
We are by definition a community of idealists,
thinking beyond the present and the status

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:16.460
quo to imagine how and when things could be
different, could be otherwise.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:23.209
The privilege of interacting with Harvard’s
remarkable students and faculty, and the dedicated

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:30.730
staff who support their work has uplifted
me every day for the past eleven years.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:36.779
It would be next to impossible not to believe
in the future they are so intent to build.

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:44.660
But there is another way that Harvard fills
me with hope, and that is the way we as a

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:51.050
community—living and working together within
these walls—are endeavoring ourselves to

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:57.610
grapple with the challenging forces dividing
and threatening the world—forces like climate

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:05.149
change, or the divisiveness that poisons our
society and polity, the undermining of facts

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:10.730
and rational discourse, the chilling of free
speech.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:17.200
We might in some ways see the work we have
undertaken together on sustainability as emblematic

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.810
of these wider efforts.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.860
We have come to consider ourselves a living
laboratory.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.100
Our research and engagement on environmental
issues of course stretches well beyond our

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:35.680
walls: our faculty, for example, have played
critical roles in forging international climate

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:42.950
agreements, have engineered innovative ways
to create and store renewable energy, have

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:49.649
influenced regulatory frameworks from Washington
to Beijing, have explored the searing impact

00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:52.860
of climate change on health.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:59.660
But at the same time we have endeavored to
make our own community a model for what might

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:06.640
be possible—what we might hope for as we
imagine the future.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:15.110
We have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions
by 30%, our trash by 44%; we produce 1.5 megawatts

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.649
of solar energy—enough to fuel 300 homes.

00:14:19.649 --> 00:14:24.860
We have programs experimenting with healthy
building materials, green cleaning, and food

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:32.130
waste, and we have constructed HouseZero,
an energy neutral structure that is essentially

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:39.500
an enormous computer generating data about
every aspect of its operation and design,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:45.100
making information available to others as
they build for the future.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.779
We seek to be a living experiment in other
ways as well.

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:58.490
We gather here in Cambridge, face to face
in a residential educational setting because

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:04.860
we regard this very community as an educational
machine.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:10.490
I have often observed that Harvard is likely
the most diverse environment in which most

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.830
of our students have ever lived.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:20.080
We endeavor to attract talented individuals
from the widest possible range of backgrounds,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:28.630
experiences and interests, the broadest diversity
of geographic origins, socio-economic circumstances,

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:36.730
ethnicities, races, religions, gender identities,
sexual orientations, political perspectives.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:44.380
And we ask students to learn from these differences,
to teach one another—and to teach us as

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.640
well—with the variety of who they are and
what they bring.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.550
This isn’t easy.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:58.600
It requires individuals to question long-held
assumptions, to open their minds and their

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:06.010
hearts to ideas and arguments that may seem
not just unfamiliar, but even disturbing and

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.240
disorienting.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.240
And it is an experiment that becomes ever
more difficult in an increasingly polarized

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:22.209
social and political environment in which
expressions of hatred, bigotry, and divisiveness

00:16:22.209 --> 00:16:26.920
seem not just permitted but encouraged.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:34.829
But in spite of these challenges all around
us, we at Harvard strive to be enriched, not

00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:39.100
divided by our differences.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:46.269
To sustain this vision of an educational community,
we must be a living laboratory in another

00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:49.020
sense as well.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:17:07.709
We must be a place where facts matter, where
reasoned 

00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:13.979
and respectful discourse and debate serve
as arbiters of truth.

00:17:13.979 --> 00:17:20.100
There has been much recent criticism of universities
for not being sufficiently open to differing

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.829
viewpoints.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:27.899
Protecting and nourishing free speech is for
us a fundamental commitment, and one that

00:17:27.899 --> 00:17:34.830
demands constant attention and vigilance,
especially in a time of sharp political and

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.770
social polarization.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:49.100
The uncontrolled—and uncontrollable—cacophony
that defines a university means we will inevitably

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:55.950
sometimes fall short; we cannot always guarantee
that every member of this community listens

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.360
generously to every other.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.200
But that must simply motivate us to redouble
our efforts.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:10.769
Silencing ideas or basking in comfortable
intellectual orthodoxy independent of facts

00:18:10.769 --> 00:18:24.090
and evidence blocks our access to new and
better ideas.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:30.509
We must be dedicated to the belief that truth
cannot simply be asserted or claimed but must

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:39.149
be established with evidence and tested with
argument.

00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:46.919
Truth serves as inspiration and aspiration
in all we do; it pulls us toward the future

00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:53.479
and its possibilities for seeing more clearly,
understanding more fully, and improving ourselves

00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:55.370
and the world.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.799
Its pursuit is fueled by hope.

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:06.110
Hope joins with truth as the as the very essence
of a university.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:15.590
And so I come back to hope—the hope implicit
in our efforts to model a different way for

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:23.289
humans to live and work together, the hope
in the ideas and discoveries that are the

00:19:23.289 --> 00:19:32.970
currency we trade in, the hope in the bright
futures of those who graduate today.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:39.450
Yet as I step down from my responsibilities
as Harvard president, I am keenly aware of

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:44.299
another of hope’s fundamental attributes.

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:53.789
It implies work still unfinished, aspirations
not yet matched by achievement, possibilities

00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:57.389
yet to be seized and realized.

00:19:57.389 --> 00:20:00.789
Hope is a challenge.

00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:07.350
I think of the words the beloved late crew
coach Harry Parker once spoke to a rower—words

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:16.109
I quoted often during the campaign: “This
is what you can be.

00:20:16.109 --> 00:20:20.109
Do you want to be that?”

00:20:20.109 --> 00:20:26.330
These are the words and the message I would
like to leave with Harvard.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.879
The work is unfinished.

00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:37.779
The job remains still to be done in times
that make it perhaps more difficult than ever.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:46.270
May we continue to challenge ourselves with
the hope of all we can be and with the unwavering

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.529
determination to be that.

00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:59.849
May Harvard be as wise as it is smart
As restless as it is proud

00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:07.139
As bold as it is thoughtful
As new as it is old

00:21:07.139 --> 00:21:21.189
As good as it is great.
