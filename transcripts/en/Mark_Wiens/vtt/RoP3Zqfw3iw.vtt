00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.357
- I hope you're having
an amazing day today.

00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:04.603
It's Mark Weins here in Bangkok, Thailand

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:06.020
and I'm going to share with you

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.520
an authentic Thai recipe for a chili curry

00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:12.066
made with pork ribs

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.573
that has some massive flavor.

00:00:14.573 --> 00:00:17.156
(upbeat music)

00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:22.926
In Thai, this dish is called
gaeng khua prik seekong moo

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:24.542
and it's a southern Thai dish.

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:26.878
It is a dried chili curry.

00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:28.767
We're gonna first pound up the curry paste

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.782
then we're gonna cook it
together with pork ribs.

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:34.398
You can use pork ribs
or you can use chicken,

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:36.203
you can use any other meat of choice.

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.986
But this is an amazing dish,

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:39.137
it has so much flavor,

00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:41.933
and it's a dish my
mother-in-law loves to make.

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.784
So I am excited to share the
recipe with you here today.

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:49.701
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:53.552
So the first step is gonna be to pound up

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:57.275
all of the ingredients
for the curry paste.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.653
These are Thai bird's eye chilies dried.

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:03.319
(speaks in foreign language)

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.198
first, the thing you gotta
do with dried chilies,

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.086
take a big handful

00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:09.246
and just soak them in water.

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:12.839
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:16.577
Oh, okay, until they get kinda soft.

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:19.645
Kinda like rehydrating them.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.999
You wanna soak those dried
chilies for about five minutes

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.795
until they get nice and soft

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:26.313
and that way they'll be easier to pound.

00:01:26.313 --> 00:01:29.149
And now just to prepare the
garlic and some shallots.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.503
And so you just peel off the skin

00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:33.183
and then we're gonna
pound that all together.

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:35.359
And next step, this is
fresh turmeric root.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.841
And she's just very
roughly peeling the skin

00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:39.346
of the turmeric and you can see

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:41.397
just that beautiful
orange color below there,

00:01:41.397 --> 00:01:42.944
oh I love turmeric.

00:01:42.944 --> 00:01:44.091
For southern Thai food,

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:46.248
there's turmeric in almost every dish.

00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:48.415
Next step for lemon grass.

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:52.073
She's just slicing it thinly
so that we can pound it easier

00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:55.175
when we're making the curry paste.

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:58.008
This in Thai is called rak phakchi

00:01:58.854 --> 00:02:00.968
and this is coriander roots.

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:03.315
Again just slice them up.

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:05.065
This is old galangal.

00:02:06.444 --> 00:02:10.284
So you can see how it's
even tough to cut it,

00:02:10.284 --> 00:02:11.596
it's so hard.

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:13.416
But that's gonna provide
some awesome flavor

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:15.166
for this curry paste.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:23.092
Okay next up, we just
have some black pepper.

00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:24.190
And we have two more dry spices,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.357
coriander seeds and cumin.

00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:31.490
And she's just gonna
quickly head over to the wok

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.203
and give them a dry fry
for about 30 seconds

00:02:34.203 --> 00:02:36.085
just to make them nice and fragrant.

00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:38.752
So in goes the cumin and in goes

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.576
about a teaspoon or so of coriander seeds.

00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:54.028
Oh, that aroma of spice

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:55.521
is a beautiful thing.

00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:58.002
The next thing you've gotta
do is the really fun part,

00:02:58.002 --> 00:02:59.513
to pound up the curry paste.

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.569
She said that the chilies
are nice and soft.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.575
They've been sitting in the
water for about five minutes

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:06.155
while we prepared all
the other ingredients.

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:08.134
And then you can set them
on the plate as well.

00:03:08.134 --> 00:03:12.275
That's like breathing fresh
new life into chilies.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.247
We're just gonna pound up everything,

00:03:13.247 --> 00:03:15.140
but she said to first

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.042
add like kind of half of the ingredients.

00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:20.100
I think the mortar is not quite big enough

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.144
to fit everything.

00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:24.311
So then sprinkle with a spoon of salt.

00:03:29.445 --> 00:03:30.900
And at this stage,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.914
it's time to ground and pound.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:35.098
Take the mortar to the ground.

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:37.679
You've gotta take it on the ground or

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.494
yeah you gotta be on a non-bouncy surface.

00:03:40.494 --> 00:03:43.691
This bamboo table chair is way too bouncy.

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:46.024
Alright, let's get pounding.

00:03:48.944 --> 00:03:50.013
You're gonna have to pound this up

00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:51.548
for probably about an hour,

00:03:51.548 --> 00:03:54.056
maybe 45 minutes if you're really good.

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:56.938
But you will definitely get a workout

00:03:56.938 --> 00:03:59.182
and break a sweat when
you're pounding this.

00:03:59.182 --> 00:04:01.765
(upbeat music)

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.701
Okay now we can go ahead and toss in

00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:10.872
the rest of those dry chilies.

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:14.122
There's a little bit of spice left too.

00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:16.792
Alright.

00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:18.727
And then just keep on pounding.

00:04:18.727 --> 00:04:21.310
(upbeat music)

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.138
I have been pounding for about 30 minutes.

00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:27.869
We've got a really nice paste,

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:30.475
look at the consistency and color of that.

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:32.059
And I got the okay from my mother-in-law

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:34.660
to make the last step in
this curry paste recipe.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.776
And that is to add the shrimp paste.

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:39.944
Oh, that's sticky shrimp paste.

00:04:39.944 --> 00:04:44.209
Alright, there we go and then
you can just sort of mash

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:47.841
and push the shrimp paste to distribute it

00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:51.040
all throughout that curry paste.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.129
Oh, it's like sticky like mud.

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:54.304
And we are done.

00:04:54.304 --> 00:04:55.981
You can grab a spoon

00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:59.648
and just look at this
beautiful curry paste.

00:05:02.354 --> 00:05:04.939
There are few things in this world

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.054
that make you feel as accomplished

00:05:07.054 --> 00:05:10.720
and as successful as finishing
pounding a curry paste.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.894
It's right up there with
winning a gold medal.

00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:16.577
Put this mortar up here

00:05:16.577 --> 00:05:20.175
and I'm gonna scoop the
curry paste onto a plate.

00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:24.342
Oh, that's just a mound of
sticky herbs and spices.

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:26.769
We're not gonna use all that curry paste,

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:27.777
it's a little too much.

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:30.202
So she's gonna use about a half of it.

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:32.607
She says it will be really
really spicy if we use it all.

00:05:32.607 --> 00:05:35.024
So first put that into a pot.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.613
And then add water.

00:05:37.613 --> 00:05:38.601
And as you add that water,

00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:40.338
just sort of mix it.

00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:42.167
Mix it into that curry paste.

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:46.033
Make sure that curry paste
dissolves into the water.

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.690
Oh that aroma is just ridiculous.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.729
Now we're gonna move over
to the street food cart

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.749
to the street food recipe cart.

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.618
And that's just the curry paste with water

00:05:57.618 --> 00:06:00.868
and then put that on the stove to boil.

00:06:03.626 --> 00:06:06.037
Like many Thai dishes, we've
already done all the work

00:06:06.037 --> 00:06:07.630
of pounding the curry paste.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.945
So really it's a matter of
bringing that to a boil.

00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:12.914
Bringing the curry paste
and water to a boil,

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.693
then we're gonna add the pork ribs

00:06:15.693 --> 00:06:18.325
and cook that down for a while.

00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:21.228
And then that's really all
there is to this recipe.

00:06:21.228 --> 00:06:25.590
Maya is gonna get started
chopping up these ribs.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.757
And you just wanna cut them
into bite sized pieces.

00:06:31.402 --> 00:06:33.881
And again you could really
use whatever meat you like.

00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:35.439
She also makes it with chicken sometimes,

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:38.272
which is also really, really good.

00:06:40.696 --> 00:06:42.894
We're gonna be using
some kaffir lime leaves,

00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:44.828
about 10 leaves or so.

00:06:44.828 --> 00:06:48.493
It doesn't really matter,
just add a nice little handful

00:06:48.493 --> 00:06:49.639
of kaffir lime leaves

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.076
and you can immediately
smell that citrusy aroma.

00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:53.226
These are gonna go into the curry

00:06:53.226 --> 00:06:55.091
to provide a nice fragrance

00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:58.174
and also to take away the meaty aroma

00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:00.421
of the pork.

00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:09.522
Oh that dry chili foam.

00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:11.164
Oh I wish you could smell that,

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.747
it is unbelievable.

00:07:15.512 --> 00:07:17.623
When the curry paste
and water start to boil

00:07:17.623 --> 00:07:20.778
then you can add in all of the pork.

00:07:20.778 --> 00:07:24.445
Maya says that it needs
to boil now for one hour.

00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:26.700
So we've got one hour to spare

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.615
of smelling this delicious aroma

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:29.894
and after that, you're gonna have

00:07:29.894 --> 00:07:32.383
just an amazing dried chili Thai curry.

00:07:32.383 --> 00:07:34.334
Forgot one thing, she's
grabbing for right now

00:07:34.334 --> 00:07:37.002
is the kaffir lime leaves.

00:07:37.002 --> 00:07:39.015
And you just sprinkle those in.

00:07:39.015 --> 00:07:42.563
That's just gonna give it
an extra wonderful fragrance

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:45.563
and you can kinda just mix those in.

00:07:46.887 --> 00:07:49.186
Oh, look at that color.

00:07:49.186 --> 00:07:51.160
You can see a little bit of
yellowness from the turmeric.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.424
You can see that redness
from all those dried chilies.

00:07:54.424 --> 00:07:56.228
There's some browns,

00:07:56.228 --> 00:08:00.462
oh that's just a wonderful
dark red orange color.

00:08:00.462 --> 00:08:04.379
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.441
At this stage, you're just gonna boil

00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:17.460
for about 45 minutes to one hour

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.956
and it's mostly just to make
that pork really nice and soft

00:08:20.956 --> 00:08:24.118
and Maya said that you just
gotta keep taste testing.

00:08:24.118 --> 00:08:25.368
Some people add

00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:30.061
(speaks in foreign language)

00:08:30.061 --> 00:08:31.996
She says it's really spicy.

00:08:31.996 --> 00:08:34.179
But some people add, she
said, a little bit of sugar

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.628
to balance the taste.

00:08:35.628 --> 00:08:37.041
If you want it a little bit sweeter,

00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:39.682
you can add a spoon or so of sugar

00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:41.815
and then also we've already added the salt

00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:43.913
from the curry paste as
well as the shrimp paste

00:08:43.913 --> 00:08:45.037
which contains salt.

00:08:45.037 --> 00:08:47.427
So it should be pretty salty, but

00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:50.424
oh she taste tested, and she's
adding a little more salt.

00:08:50.424 --> 00:08:51.257
You can taste test,

00:08:51.257 --> 00:08:53.322
and if you need to add a
little more salt, you can.

00:08:53.322 --> 00:08:55.589
(speaks in foreign language)

00:08:55.589 --> 00:08:56.639
As this boils,

00:08:56.639 --> 00:09:00.598
it's gonna go from a
liquidy, watery consistency

00:09:00.598 --> 00:09:02.778
to being a nice, thick, rich

00:09:02.778 --> 00:09:05.901
full of dry spice and chilies curry.

00:09:05.901 --> 00:09:08.234
(simmering)

00:09:13.905 --> 00:09:16.203
At this stage, if it hasn't
cooked for long enough,

00:09:16.203 --> 00:09:18.814
and if the water is starting to dry out,

00:09:18.814 --> 00:09:20.089
you can add a little more water

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:21.654
so that it can boil longer

00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:25.154
and so that the meat will get more tender.

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:29.719
Oh, that steam.

00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:33.723
Oh, and you can see how
it's starting to reduce

00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:36.223
to a really think, rich curry.

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:47.118
It is coming along very nicely now.

00:09:47.118 --> 00:09:48.455
It's starting to get drier.

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:50.802
You can see that curry paste thickening

00:09:50.802 --> 00:09:52.387
around the pork ribs.

00:09:52.387 --> 00:09:54.131
You can see all those
little bits of dry chili.

00:09:54.131 --> 00:09:57.098
And it is just smelling insane.

00:09:57.098 --> 00:10:00.625
And so she just is testing, press testing

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:02.317
the softness of the meat

00:10:02.317 --> 00:10:03.646
and as soon as that meat is nice

00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:05.287
and fall-off-the-bone tender,

00:10:05.287 --> 00:10:07.704
we're gonna get ready to eat.

00:10:08.979 --> 00:10:12.148
Just got the okay from Maya
that the curry is ready.

00:10:12.148 --> 00:10:14.565
She said to turn off the gas.

00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:17.172
As soon as you turn off the fire

00:10:17.172 --> 00:10:18.615
and stop the boiling,

00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:22.190
it looks like it's like melted
lava down there in that curry

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.070
oh, that looks amazing.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.671
You wanna just keep on boiling your curry

00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:26.994
until the meat it soft.

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:28.740
That took about an hour of boiling.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.524
And then we added a little bit of water

00:10:30.524 --> 00:10:32.004
so that it wouldn't get too dry.

00:10:32.004 --> 00:10:36.171
But you do want a very curry
thick, rich consistency.

00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:40.210
So balance that out, boil out the water

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.088
and then you can turn off the gas

00:10:42.088 --> 00:10:46.255
and you just have one of the
most beautiful red, fiery,

00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:49.894
dried chili looking curry

00:10:49.894 --> 00:10:51.894
that you'll ever come across.

00:10:51.894 --> 00:10:53.242
You just have to admire.

00:10:53.242 --> 00:10:55.418
Okay, it's a little bit
oily from all that pork.

00:10:55.418 --> 00:10:58.086
But I think there's some
dried chili oil in there too,

00:10:58.086 --> 00:11:01.390
but look at that gravy curry sauce.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.784
It's so thick, it's
almost like peanut butter.

00:11:03.784 --> 00:11:07.634
I think that is about as
much flavor as possible

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:10.391
condensed into a thick liquid.

00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:13.973
I'm gonna take a few
pieces of these riblets,

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:15.692
stick it onto my rice.

00:11:15.692 --> 00:11:17.437
Oh, look at that.

00:11:17.437 --> 00:11:21.604
Okay and add a little bit
more of that curry sauce.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.380
I will try to just slide
that meat off the bone.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.530
Oh, it's so tender, look.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.001
The bone just slides right out.

00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:32.072
Okay, so now I have theoretically,

00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:35.340
what is a boneless piece of rib

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.923
just mixed with all of
that curry goodness.

00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:43.044
Oh, that's unbelievable.

00:11:43.044 --> 00:11:45.043
Oh, that is massive flavor.

00:11:45.043 --> 00:11:47.608
The meat is so incredibly tender.

00:11:47.608 --> 00:11:50.441
And then the flavor of that curry,

00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:54.505
you can taste the hint of
the cumin and coriander seed

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:57.524
and then it really just has a,

00:11:57.524 --> 00:12:00.441
yeah that dry roasted chili flavor.

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:05.597
That will just annihilate your taste buds.

00:12:05.597 --> 00:12:07.625
Oh, this is a recipe that my mother-in-law

00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:09.186
really loves to make

00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:12.603
and it will literally just blow your mind

00:12:13.908 --> 00:12:15.177
