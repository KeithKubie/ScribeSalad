00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.162
The first standardized tests 
that we know of

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:16.342
were administered in China 
over 2,000 years ago

00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:18.223
during the Han dynasty.

00:00:18.223 --> 00:00:23.483
Chinese officials used them to determine
aptitude for various government posts.

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:25.572
The subject matter included philosophy,

00:00:25.572 --> 00:00:26.637
farming,

00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:28.963
and even military tactics.

00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:33.790
Standardized tests continued to be used
around the world for the next two millennia,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.882
and today, they're used for everything

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:39.838
from evaluating stair climbs
for firefighters in France

00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:43.323
to language examinations 
for diplomats in Canada

00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:45.914
to students in schools.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:48.024
Some standardized tests measure scores

00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:51.784
only in relation to the results 
of other test takers.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:57.455
Others measure performances on how well
test takers meet predetermined criteria.

00:00:57.455 --> 00:00:59.713
So the stair climb for the firefighter

00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:02.594
could be measured by comparing 
the time of the climb

00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:05.604
to that of all other firefighters.

00:01:05.604 --> 00:01:09.443
This might be expressed in what 
many call a bell curve.

00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:13.414
Or it could be evaluated with reference
to set criteria,

00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:17.004
such as carrying a certain amount 
of weight a certain distance

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.924
up a certain number of stairs.

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:24.702
Similarly, the diplomat might be measured
against other test-taking diplomats,

00:01:24.702 --> 00:01:27.145
or against a set of fixed criteria,

00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:31.054
which demonstrate different levels
of language proficiency.

00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:35.785
And all of these results can be expressed
using something called a percentile.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:41.774
If a diplomat is in the 70th percentile,
70% of test takers scored below her.

00:01:41.774 --> 00:01:47.335
If she scored in the 30th percentile,
70% of test takers scored above her.

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:50.746
Although standardized tests 
are sometimes controversial,

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:52.525
they're simply a tool.

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:56.696
As a thought experiment, 
think of a standardized test as a ruler.

00:01:56.696 --> 00:01:59.395
A ruler's usefulness 
depends on two things.

00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:02.157
First, the job we ask it to do.

00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:04.986
Our ruler can't measure 
the temperature outside

00:02:04.986 --> 00:02:07.446
or how loud someone is singing.

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:10.865
Second, the ruler's usefulness depends
on its design.

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:14.146
Say you need to measure the circumference
of an orange.

00:02:14.146 --> 00:02:17.397
Our ruler measures length,
which is the right quantity,

00:02:17.397 --> 00:02:22.238
but it hasn't been designed with the 
flexibility required for the task at hand.

00:02:22.238 --> 00:02:25.366
So, if standardized tests are given
the wrong job,

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.237
or aren't designed properly,

00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:31.627
they may end up measuring
the wrong things.

00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:32.907
In the case of schools,

00:02:32.907 --> 00:02:36.678
students with test anxiety may have 
trouble performing their best

00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:38.408
on a standardized test,

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.116
not because they don't know the answers,

00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:43.735
but because they're feeling too nervous
to share what they've learned.

00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:45.418
Students with reading challenges

00:02:45.418 --> 00:02:48.078
may struggle with the wording 
of a math problem,

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:50.878
so their test results may better reflect
their literacy

00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:53.518
rather than numeracy skills.

00:02:53.518 --> 00:02:55.578
And students who were confused by examples

00:02:55.578 --> 00:02:59.168
on tests that contain 
unfamiliar cultural references

00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:00.617
may do poorly,

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:03.409
telling us more about the test taker's
cultural familiarity

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.698
than their academic learning.

00:03:05.698 --> 00:03:11.090
In these cases, the tests may need
to be designed differently.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.419
Standardized tests can also 
have a hard time

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.638
measuring abstract 
characteristics or skills,

00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:20.658
such as creativity, critical thinking,
and collaboration.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.378
If we design a test poorly,

00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:24.300
or ask it to do the wrong job,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.553
or a job it's not very good at,

00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:29.849
the results may not be reliable or valid.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.939
Reliability and validity 
are two critical ideas

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.619
for understanding standardized tests.

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.300
To understand the difference between them,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.389
we can use the metaphor 
of two broken thermometers.

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.289
An unreliable thermometer

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.542
gives you a different reading 
each time you take your temperature,

00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:51.191
and the reliable but invalid thermometer
is consistently ten degrees too hot.

00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:55.460
Validity also depends on accurate
interpretations of results.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.771
If people say results of a test
mean something they don't,

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.934
that test may have a validity problem.

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:06.442
Just as we wouldn't expect a ruler
to tell us how much an elephant weighs,

00:04:06.442 --> 00:04:08.302
or what it had for breakfast,

00:04:08.302 --> 00:04:14.181
we can't expect standardized tests alone
to reliably tell us how smart someone is,

00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:16.323
how diplomats will handle
a tough situation,

00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:20.622
or how brave a firefighter 
might turn out to be.

00:04:20.622 --> 00:04:25.412
So standardized tests may help us learn
a little about a lot of people

00:04:25.412 --> 00:04:26.562
in a short time,

00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:31.013
but they usually can't tell us a lot
about a single person.

00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:35.732
Many social scientists worry about
test scores resulting in sweeping

00:04:35.732 --> 00:04:38.846
and often negative changes
for test takers,

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:42.388
sometimes with long-term 
life consequences.

00:04:42.388 --> 00:04:44.389
We can't blame the tests, though.

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.179
It's up to us to use the right tests
for the right jobs,

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:51.063
and to interpret results appropriately.
