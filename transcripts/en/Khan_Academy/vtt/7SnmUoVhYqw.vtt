00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.650
- [Voiceover] Which of the
following expressions is

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.350
equivalent to 7k,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.590
7k minus, minus,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.930
the product of k plus one

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.610
and 2k plus two.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.550
All right, so this is
going to be 7k minus,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.200
7k minus the product of

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.240
k plus one

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.140
and 2k plus two?

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.620
And so let's see to kind
of expand it all out

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.450
we will want to multiply
these two expressions,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.290
so let's do that first, so

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.880
this is going to be 7k minus,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.820
and then let's just multiply this out.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.020
You're going to have k times 2k,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.682
which is 2k squared,

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:58.350
k times two which is going to be plus 2k.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.730
Then one times 2k,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.990
which is going to give us another 2k.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.310
And then one times two, which
is going to give us plus two.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.690
And we want to be careful.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.130
We want to put a parenthesis out front

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.750
'cause we're going to
subtract all of this stuff

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.050
right over here.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.450
So this is going to be the same thing as

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.120
7k minus, and then in
parentheses we have 2k squared.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.910
We can add 2k plus 2k to get 4k plus

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.900
4k plus two.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.120
One way to think about it
is we can distribute this

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.980
negative sign or you could even do this as

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.050
minus one times all of this.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.610
And so this is going
to be the same thing as

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.560
7k minus 2k squared,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.720
so minus 2k squared,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.620
2k squared minus 4k,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.950
minus 4k,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.450
and then minus two,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.390
minus two.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.320
And let's see so if we write
the highest degree term first,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.450
if we write this term, do
this in a different color.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.650
If we were to write
this term first, you get

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.190
negative 2k squared, that's
our highest degree term.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.850
And actually immediately
when you look at the choices

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.050
only one of these start
with negative 2k squared

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.920
has negative two as a coefficient
on the k squared term,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.830
so we already know that that
one's going to be the choice

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.990
but let's just confirm it.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.280
So it's negative 2k squared,
and then we could add,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.390
we could add 7k and negative 4k.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.720
Those we're going to add seven minus four,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.990
sum then is going to be three of that.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.920
So it's going to be plus
3k which is what we see

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.040
right over there.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.490
And then finally you have this minus two.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.050
Minus two which is exactly
what we see in this

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.840
first choice up here.
