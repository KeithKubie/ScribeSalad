00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, if you'll permit me to doodle over our grammar,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
one way to get started with this is to think about what's in chart[0]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
These two are in chart[0]:

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
(T --&gt; dot p Q r)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and (T --&gt; dot p Q s), and we have seen anything yet.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So if we start from that, in chart[0],

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the only operation we can do is to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
shift to get to chart position [1].

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Shift over the input &lt;p&gt; if that's actually the first character of the input.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, it totally is--that's super convenient.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So we're going to move these dots over here and get:

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
(T --&gt; p dot Q r) and (T --&gt; p dot Q s)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
from zero, in chart state[1].

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Oh--so both of the first two are correct.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now we're going to have dots in front of the (Q).

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we're going to bring in (Q --&gt; dot q)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
from 1, in chart position 1.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now we're going to look at the input again

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and see that the next token is actually (q).

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So we're going to shift over this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and put the result in chart[2].

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So in fact, this one's correct as well--wow, we're on a roll!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now the last 2 involve doing reductions.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We see: (Q --&gt; q) and we've seen all the input we need

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
by the time we're in chart state [2].

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Zero, 1, 2. We've seen 2 characters for the input.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So we're going to go back

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to states that had a dot in front of a big (Q)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and say: we have found your big (Q) and we're done with it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So chart[1] had a dot in front of a big (Q).

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We'll conceptually shift over it

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and chart[2] will now have the dot after the big (Q).

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And another way to interpret this is:

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
after seeing 2 characters in the input, we could be here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Well the first character is (p)--great.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And the second character is little (q),

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
which we reduce up to big (Q) so, yeah--

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
this is totally where we are; my finger is right there,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
starting from zero, with no more hidden tokens on the left.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, in fact, both of these are also right.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We will do the reduction

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and do this sort of pretend shifting,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
for this first rule,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and also for the second rule.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
In general, we do all the shifting,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
all the reductions, all the closures possible.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Boy, it's a good thing we're going to have a computer program do this for us

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because doing it, by hand, is starting to get long.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
This was a particularly tricky quiz,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so don't feel bad if you missed a few of these.

00:02:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
In the end, though, all of them were right.
