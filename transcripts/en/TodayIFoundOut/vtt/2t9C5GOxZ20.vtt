00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.060
The Param Vir Chakra (roughly, the “Wheel
of the Ultimate Brave”) is India’s highest

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.670
military decoration for gallantry during battle
and is “awarded for rarest of the rare gallantry

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.050
which is beyond the call of duty and which
in normal life is considered impossible to

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.050
do”.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.480
The medal is known for having one of the most
stringent selection process of any military

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.440
award in the world and 14 of the 24 total
recipients were killed during the action that

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440
earned it.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.089
One such posthumous recipient was Yogendra
Singh Yadav…

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.420
The problem was that Yadav was very much alive
and heard about his own heroic death while

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.879
recovering in the hospital.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.480
Born in 1980 in the village of Aurangabad
Ahir, Yadav was the son of former soldier

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.100
who’d fought in the Indo-Pakistan wars as
part of the Kumaon Regiment.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.100
Yadav, along with his brothers, would frequently
spend evenings listening to their father’s

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.369
war stories and tales of famous Indian military
heroes.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.530
This instilled a deep sense of patriotism
and duty in Yadav from a young age, so it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.750
was no surprise to his family when he decided
to join the military at just 16 years old,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.260
joining the Grenadier Regiment.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.439
Yadav subsequently proved to be a formidable
asset to the military, quickly rising through

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.710
the ranks and eventually coming to serve with
an elite commando unit of the 18 Grenadiers

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.729
called the Ghatak’s- basically, elite shock
troops tasked with being the first boots on

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.310
the ground in any conflict.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.090
On May 3, 1999, Kashmiri and Pakistani militants
managed to storm and take control of several

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.630
strategic forts and bunkers along the border
that had been left abandoned since the end

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.630
of the war.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.249
This action prompted the start of what became
known as the Kargil Conflict- a series of

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:55.770
bloody confrontations between the two countries
that lasted just over 3 months.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.969
One of the most strategically valuable points
captured was a group of fortified hardpoints

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:08.441
atop a 17,411 foot (5,307 m) tall mountain
known colloquially as “Tiger Hill”, or

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:11.170
officially as Point 4660.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.860
As the tallest peak in the Kargil region,
Tiger Hill allowed the enemy soldiers to look

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.610
down on the 56 Brigade’s headquarters, as
well as watch the Srinagar-Leh highway for

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.000
troop and supply movements.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.940
Unsurprisingly, the top Indian military brass
demanded its immediate recapture at any cost-

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.590
enter Yadav’s commando platoon, the 18 Grenadiers.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.080
The mission of the 18 Grenadiers (which has
been called one of the most brazen ever attempted

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.480
in open combat) was to scale an icy, 1000
foot near vertical section of the mountain

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.340
and assault the 3 fortified bunkers atop it,
while artillery bombardments distracted the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.860
combined Pakistani Kashmiri forces stationed
in them.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.950
Yadav (who was just 19 years old at this point)
wasted no time volunteering to climb the snow-covered

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.310
peak unassisted and lead the assault.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.670
Yadav’s mission was to affix ropes to specific
areas so that the rest of the near couple

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.090
dozen 18 Grenadiers squad could follow him
more quickly.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.290
Trained in both mountaineering and alpine
warfare, Yadav was an exceptional climber

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.630
and was reportedly able to scale half that
section of the mountain in mere minutes- a

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.370
feat that becomes all the more impressive
when you realise this assault began at night

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.710
(roughly 11pm local time) and the elevation
in that area is approximately 17,000 feet

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.310
(5,100 meters), meaning light and oxygen levels
wouldn’t exactly have been ideal for such

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.710
fast climbing.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.630
Unfortunately for Yadav, as he was closing
on the top of the mountain, with his platoon

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.090
now following closely behind, he was spotted
and the enemy opened fire with machine-guns

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.430
and rocket launchers.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.520
The initial volley killed Yadav’s commanding
officer along with a few others of his squad,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.900
all of whom were either killed outright or
who fell to their deaths.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.940
Clinging both metaphorically and quite literally
to life, Yadav sustained three significant

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.080
injuries while pushing himself to climb the
rest of the way, taking two bullets to the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.800
shoulder and one to his groin in the process.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.710
Despite the injuries and being under heavy
fire with little cover, he managed to make

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.240
it to the first bunker, hurling a grenade
into it and killing everyone inside, silencing

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.450
the enemy fire from that position, allowing
his squad to continue their ascent.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.430
Unfortunately for Yadav, the attention of
the second enemy position was now directly

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.590
on him and they opened fire on the young man,
who was soon joined by two of his companions.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.759
Yadav then led this trio of death in charging
into the storm of bullets and rockets being

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.320
aimed at them, with Yadav ultimately managing
to reach the enemy bunker.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.540
In the ensuing hand-to-hand melee in which
he used his climbing ice axe as his primary

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.930
weapon, he killed the four Pakistani soldiers
manning the position.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.270
At this point, the surviving members of the
18 Grenadiers reached Yadav and were greeted

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.530
to the sight of an extremely bloodied and
injured young man surrounded by dead enemy

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.630
soldiers.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.360
Remarkably, during his two headlong charges,
Yadav had sustained a further 12 bullet wounds

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.719
two “hand grenade wounds” and had his
arm broken and nearly ripped from its socket

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.210
by an explosion, leaving it hanging limply
at his side.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.800
Yadav shrugged off these injuries (presumably
metaphorically as literally shrugging would

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.710
have been a tough act given the two bullet
wounds to his shoulder) and used his belt

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.130
to make a sling for his arm.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.419
Next, he pulled out his pistol and charged
the third and final position.

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.629
Rallied by Yadav’s bravery once again in
the face of heavy, near point-blank fire,

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.740
the rest of his squad followed and captured
the final point.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.819
News of Yadav’s valor and total disregard
for his own safety in the face of overwhelming

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.110
opposition soon reached the military brass
and he was immediately recommended for the

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.789
prestigious Param Vir Chakra at the tender
age of just 19 years old.

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.180
Now, the Param Vir Chakra has one of the most
robust selection process of any medal for

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.850
heroism in the world, which is a particular
point of pride for the Indian military.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.199
The medal isn’t just awarded for “everyday”
gallantry- it is awarded for the “Most conspicuous

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.280
bravery or some daring or pre-eminent act
of valour or self-sacrifice, in the presence

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.000
of the enemy, whether on land, at sea, or
in the air”.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.780
As such, those eligible for the award are
scrutinised at length by no less than six

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.650
different facets of the Indian military hierarchy.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.810
To quote:

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.219
Recommendation for any gallantry award for
a soldier is initiated by the commanding officer

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.710
of a battalion to the brigade headquarters.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.509
From the brigade headquarters it is passed
on after scrutiny to the divisional headquarters

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.090
and from there to the corps headquarters.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.349
From the corps, after detailed discussion
and correlation of the claims, it is the send

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.020
to the command headquarters, where from it
is forwarded to the army headquarters in New

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.020
Delhi.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.029
At the army headquarters it is finally scrutinised
by the Honours and Awards committee headed

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.139
by the army chief, which has principal staff
officers such as military secretary and adjutant

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.600
general as its members.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.699
The decision of this committee is forwarded
to the ministry of defence for its final approval.

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.759
Needless to say, it was a curious, and embarrassing
thing, that they subsequently awarded Yadav

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.319
the Param Vir Chakra posthumously, despite
the fact that he was lying in a hospital bed

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:53.319
at the time.

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:57.520
Yes, not only had he sustained a body’s
full of serious injuries, but he made it back

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.789
down the mountain and to the base hospital.

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:04.120
In fact, after the award announcement went
out, it was Yadav’s young wife who subsequently

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.020
notified the military brass at the base hospital
that her husband was indeed alive and reasonably

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.800
well all things considered.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.659
It is often claimed that the number of serious
injuries Yadav sustained combined with his

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:19.460
unbelievable actions were such that it was
simply assumed he’d died before making it

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.599
back to medical aid.

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:24.979
However, the selection process for that award
is far too rigorous to let such a thing slip

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:25.979
normally.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:30.240
What actually happened is that in Yadav’s
squad there was another soldier with the exact

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.590
same name- Yogendra Singh Yadav – who did
die during the battle.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.900
As a result, when the living Yadav was recommended
for the Param Vir Chakra, officials attributed

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.589
the remarkable actions of Yadav to that guy
instead- whether because they simply assumed

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:48.490
the Yadav who died must be the one who sustained
all those injures and performed the unbelievable

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.770
acts, or simply because nobody noticed there
were two Yogendra Singh Yadav’s on the squad,

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.770
isn’t clear.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.559
To further confuse things, it’s also noteworthy
that the other Yadav was among the first to

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:03.330
scale the cliff after the surviving Yadav,
and that both men engaged the enemy in ferocious

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.189
hand-to-hand combat.

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:09.650
During an interview from his hospital bed,
Yadav was asked to comment on rumors he was

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.090
planning on taking an exam to become an officer.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.850
Yadav responded that he would like to, but
had to pass his high-school exams first…

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:38.419
Once again, he was 
just 19 years old.
