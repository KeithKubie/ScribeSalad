00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, here is the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The second substring is actually being handled exactly like the first substring.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If its test fails, then we go into simplify this substring instead.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If neither substring fails, then we return the original string.
