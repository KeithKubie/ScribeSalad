1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.610
Well.

2
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.610
Another major consideration and the evolution of pathogen very lens is host

3
00:00:06.251 --> 00:00:11.251
range or how many different hosts that pathogen can infect.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.230
There is also the issue of spillover virulence that happens with what we call

5
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.730
facultative opportunists.

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.330
That is a case where the virulence is not been evolutionarily adjusted to the

7
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:29.550
human population for example.

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.100
And then another issue is that of imperfect vaccines and the evolution of

9
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.063
virulence.

10
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
So first is is the pathogen infecting one or is it infecting many host species?

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.940
The principle here is that a jack of all trades,
the master of none,

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.420
the more host species that are regularly infected,

13
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.650
the less well adapted the pathogen will be to any one of them.

14
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.580
The pathogen that evolves to be good at exploiting one host loses efficacy in

15
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:07.311
the other hosts and that is how attenuated live vaccines in fact are produced.

16
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.750
<v 0>Serial passage,</v>

18
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.610
which is the process used in making attenuated live vaccines is actually an

19
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:17.170
evolutionary technology.

20
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.200
Microbiologists use serial passage to study pathogen virulence and they also use

21
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:25.570
it to produce live attenuated vaccines.

22
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.660
It works because pathogens evolve rapidly to specialize on new hosts.

23
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.820
When that is the only option that they are given.

24
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.420
The experimental host is therefore chosen to be genetically uniform and it is

25
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:41.830
not allowed to co evolve.

26
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.020
The results of these processes demonstrate widespread trade offs and performance

27
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.560
on different hosts and these trade offs in nature limit host ranges and

28
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:56.300
constrain the emergence of new diseases.

29
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.820
So this is what a serial transfer experiment might look like.

30
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.030
You have a group of genetically homogeneous mice,

31
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:08.180
which you've never seen this particular pathogen before.

32
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.220
One of them is infected,
the parasite grows exponentially and is then extracted.

33
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.640
It is then used to infect the next host.

34
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.670
This process continues each time the parasite is encountering a naive host that

35
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:26.360
is genetically uniform and growing exponentially.

36
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.020
So essentially from the parasites point of view,

37
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.080
a serial transfer experiment is exposure to a unlimited environment that is not

38
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:42.800
changing and therefore to which you can adapt very precisely.

39
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.800
<v 0>The pathogens are growing exponentially all the time because the interval</v>

41
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.130
between infections is kept fairly short and they're always going into

42
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:59.010
immunologically naive hosts.
So in essence,

43
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.610
life is simple and good.

44
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.960
They're very lens on the new host.

45
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.370
Then increases and they're very once on their original hosts.

46
00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:12.740
For the one that they came from that's not involved in this process decreases.

47
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.040
Here's an example.
Here's cell Salmonella typhimurium.

48
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.070
It's a bacterium is being passaged in mice and here are the number of mice that

49
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.200
the percentage of mice,
not not the number,

50
00:03:27.201 --> 00:03:32.201
the percentage of mice that die when infected after passages going two,

51
00:03:33.321 --> 00:03:34.370
four,
six,
eight,

52
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.750
10 so 10 passages was enough to get salmonella.

53
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.180
Very good at killing noise.

54
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.360
Here is what went on with the ability of polio virus to kill monkeys where it is

55
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:54.010
being passaged in cell culture.
Okay,

56
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.720
so cell culture is genetically uniform.
The monkey is the test host.

57
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.880
The longer it's passaged in cell culture,
the less able it is to kill monkeys.

58
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.320
After 50 passages,

59
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:10.321
it was judged to be attenuated and safe for use and that in fact is how the CBN

60
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.320
life polio vaccine was originally produced.

61
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.710
These are the data from the production of that vaccine.

62
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.940
Another interesting piece of virulence biology has to do with spillovers and a

63
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:35.731
spillover occurs when a pathogen which is in a natural reservoir and is well

64
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.140
adapted to its natural host encounters.

65
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:44.500
A new host and spills over into it,

66
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.750
and the issue is what is then?
It's very,

67
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:50.080
once it is in that new host,

68
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:53.710
a facultative opportunist.
An example is Ebola.

69
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.250
Some of the most virulent human diseases are caused by pathogens that actually

70
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:02.290
spend most of their time in other hosts.

71
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.020
Their impact on humans is mostly irrelevant to their evolution in their natural

72
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:11.440
hosts,
which are often bats or rodents.

73
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.760
Many of them kill humans too rapidly to transmit effectively and other zone

74
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.630
audit confections have little impact in pass unnoticed.
In fact,

75
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:26.680
we probably are infected many,
many more times than we know.

76
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.220
Let's take a look at an ecological way of classifying pathogens.

77
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.930
Some are obligate parasites and there are specialists on humans,

78
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:40.300
for example,
that would be plasmodium falciparum,

79
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.960
HIV flu,
TB.

80
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.390
There are non specialists such as Lyme disease,
Borrelia Burgdorferi,
Ui,

81
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.970
the rabies virus,
Salmonella Bartonella.

82
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.030
<v 0>There are also facultative parasites,</v>

84
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.090
things that can be free living or parasitic.

85
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.810
The specialists on humans are commensal opportunists such as staff and

86
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:09.890
Enterococcus,
Faecalis,
hemophilus,
influenzae and strip.

87
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.450
And then there are non specialists that are facultative and some of these are

88
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:20.570
environmental opportunists.
For example,
pseudomonas Aeruginosa,

89
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.600
Burke hold area also wrote a caucus and mycobacterium marina.

90
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.230
So a principle here is that a response to a source as much stronger than a

91
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:34.070
response to a sink.

92
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.530
So an obligate parasite is living in a source and respond strongly to it.

93
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.250
Where as a facultative parasite might experience a human host as a sink.

94
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.633
In other words,

95
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.260
it is not a place where it is going to reproduce well or perhaps disperse well

96
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:53.270
from an over evolutionary time.

97
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.010
That means that its interactions with the human are not going to be as finely

98
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:01.460
honed as it would would be with an obligate parasite.

99
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.390
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

100
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.860
<v 0>so there were really two principles of pathogen adaptation in Nevada rotation in</v>

101
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:09.694
general.

102
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.420
One is that the significance of effects depends on how frequently a condition is

103
00:07:15.731 --> 00:07:19.690
encountered.
And the other is the one I've just mentioned,

104
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:24.520
which is the responses to sources are then much stronger than responses to
sinks.

105
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.450
So there's an analogy here to the evolution of aging.

106
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.380
Genes are transmitted more by the young than by the old pathogens adapt more to

107
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:38.710
the things that they encounter frequently in and are accustomed to living in

108
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.980
then to the things that they spill over into and experiences sinks.

109
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.670
Another issue with variance in a very important one is raised by imperfect

110
00:07:54.131 --> 00:07:54.964
vaccines.

111
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.150
<v 0>Vaccines are a major human intervention in pathogen evolution.</v>

113
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.610
They are one of the biggest,

114
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:07.340
most challenging new developments that pathogens have ever seen.

115
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.580
Childhood vaccines,

116
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.790
which are a major component of the reduction in infant mortality over the last

117
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.200
hundred years.

118
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.200
Our sterilizing and they protect nearly perfectly once vaccinated and once a

119
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:26.540
response to vaccination is produced,

120
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.730
then the person vaccinated is going to be disease resistant probably for the

121
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:34.340
entire life.
Boosters are needed in some cases,

122
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.710
but most of these protect nearly perfectly

123
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.190
imperfect vaccines are different.

124
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.850
They are a threat because they allow transmission.

125
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.750
Not everyone who is vaccinated clears the pathogen from their system and can

126
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:53.990
therefore,
in some cases transmitted to another person.

127
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.780
The cause increased very variance for two reasons.

128
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.131
First,

129
00:09:01.131 --> 00:09:06.131
the extent host survival time that allows more virulent strains to transmit.

130
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.610
And second,
by reducing the cost of various islands,

131
00:09:10.611 --> 00:09:13.520
they shift the balance in the virulence transmission tradeoff.

132
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.900
So by reducing the cost of virulence,

133
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.910
what we mean is that the vaccine is allowing strains to survive and continue to

134
00:09:24.741 --> 00:09:25.574
transmit.

135
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.630
Did in an unvaccinated person would have killed that person too quickly.

136
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:31.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.980
<v 0>Unvaccinated hosts in this scenario will then experience a nastier disease once</v>

138
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:42.261
the pathogen has evolved in response to a vaccine campaign with an imperfect

139
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:43.974
vaccine.

140
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:46.640
<v 1>Now,</v>

141
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.200
<v 0>that doesn't mean we shouldn't vaccinate.</v>

142
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:53.290
It is still wise to vaccinate because even an imperfect vaccine will save

143
00:09:53.841 --> 00:09:56.240
millions of lives.
However,

144
00:09:56.241 --> 00:10:01.241
it is useful to know about in the plan for the evolutionary consequences of

145
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.780
imperfect backseats.
We need contingency plans,

146
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.620
contingency contingency plans for increased variance if imperfect vaccines are

147
00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:16.160
used.
So to summarize,

148
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.850
when pathogens are forced to specialize on a new single host,

149
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:25.310
their very once in that host increases and they're very balanced in their old

150
00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:26.510
host decreases.

151
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.460
That's the evolutionary basis for producing attenuated live vaccines.

152
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.370
Spillover events can have any very Ellen's level at all,
higher,
low.

153
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.930
Some are extremely,

154
00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:42.380
very Olin because the pathogens are not yet adapted to humans.

155
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:47.030
That is the case with Ebola,
Mers,
SARS,
rabies,

156
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.073
things like that.
