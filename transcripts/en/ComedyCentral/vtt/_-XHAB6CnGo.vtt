Ugh. All right.
Tig, the first quote...

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.139 line:0%
It sounds like
a Christian male.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:41.607 line:0%
That is incorrect!

GORBURGER: It was
Christian Bale as Moses

 in<i> Exodus of the Gods
 and Kings. </i>

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.849 align:start size:66% position:34%
And it didn't do well
internationally
or domestically.

Next quote!

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.790 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
Christian Bale

Sounds like
a Christian male.

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.195 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%

I-- it has to be
Christian Bale.

That's right!
Oh, Tig, you're

Okay, last one.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:36.062 line:0%

But you got three
out of four,

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:49.709 align:start size:63% position:38%
which means you win!

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.678 align:start position:0% line:0%
I did! What do I--
what do I win?

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.678 align:start size:19% position:81% line:21%
Yes!
