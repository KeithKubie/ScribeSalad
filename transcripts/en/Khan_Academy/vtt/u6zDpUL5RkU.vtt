00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.880
Let's do some equations that
deal with absolute values.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.260
And just as a bit of a review,
when you take the absolute

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.650
value of a number.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.680
Let's say I take the absolute
value of negative 1.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.700
What you're really doing is
you're saying, how far is that

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.090
number from 0?

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.620
And in the case of negative 1,
if we draw a number line right

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.310
there-- that's a very badly
drawn number line.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.230
If we draw a number line
right there, that's 0.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.470
You have a negative
1 right there.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.230
Well, it's 1 away from 0.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.250
So the absolute value
of negative 1 is 1.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.850
And the absolute value of
1 is also 1 away from 0.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.610
It's also equal to 1.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.500
So on some level, absolute value
is the distance from 0.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.190
But another, I guess simpler way
to think of it, it always

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.600
results in the positive
version of the number.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:59.360
The absolute value of negative
7,346 is equal to 7,346.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.240
So with that in mind, let's try
to solve some equations

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.050
with absolute values in them.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.640
So let's say I have the equation
the absolute value of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.500
x minus 5 is equal to 10.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.560
And one way you can interpret
this, and I want you to think

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.840
about this, this is actually
saying that the distance

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.120
between x and 5 is
equal to 10.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.750
So how many numbers that are
exactly 10 away from 5?

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.430
And you can already think of the
solution to this equation,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.960
but I'll show you how to solve
it systematically.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.510
Now this is going to be true
in two situations.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.800
Either x minus 5 is equal
to positive 10.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.630
If this evaluates out to
positive 10, then when you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.610
take the absolute value
of it, you're going to

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.380
get positive 10.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.130
Or x minus 5 might evaluate
to negative 10.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.900
If x minus 5 evaluated to
negative 10, when you take the

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.950
absolute value of it, you
would get 10 again.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.280
So x minus 5 could also be
equal to negative 10.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.730
Both of these would satisfy
this equation.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.100
Now, to solve this one,
add 5 to both

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.500
sides of this equation.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.160
You get x is equal to 15.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.830
To solve this one, add 5 to both
sides of this equation.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.900
x is equal to negative 5.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.050
So our solution, there's
two x's that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.910
satisfy this equation.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.890
x could be 15.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.502
15 minus 5 is 10, take the
absolute value, you're going

00:02:29.502 --> 00:02:32.690
to get 10, or x could
be negative 5.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.060
Negative 5 minus 5
is negative 10.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.020
Take the absolute value,
you get 10.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.380
And notice, both of these
numbers are exactly 10 away

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.750
from the number 5.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.050
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.130
Let's do another one.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.880
Let's say we have the absolute
value of x plus

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.580
2 is equal to 6.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.610
So what does that tell us?

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.890
That tells us that either x plus
2, that the thing inside

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.030
the absolute value sign,
is equal to 6.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.380
Or the thing inside of the
absolute value sign, the x

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.050
plus 2, could also
be negative 6.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.910
If this whole thing evaluated
to negative 6, you take the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.210
absolute value, you'd get 6.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.340
So, or x plus 2 could
equal negative 6.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.880
And then if you subtract 2
from both sides of this

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.850
equation, you get x could
be equal to 4.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.780
If you subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation, you

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.690
get x could be equal
to negative 8.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.240
So these are the two solutions
to the equation.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.740
And just to kind of have it
gel in your mind, that

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.500
absolute value, you can kind of
view it as a distance, you

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.960
could rewrite this problem as
the absolute value of x minus

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.410
negative 2 is equal to 6.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.140
And so this is asking me, what
are the x's that are exactly 6

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.590
away from negative 2?

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.220
Remember, up here we said,
what are the x's that are

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.560
exactly 10 away from
positive 5?

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.990
Whatever number you're
subtracting from positive 5,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.560
these are both 10 away
from positive 5.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.060
This is asking, what
is exactly 6 away

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.080
from negative 2?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.510
And it's going to be
4, or negative 8.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.959
You could try those numbers
out for yourself.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.459
Let's do another one of these.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.330
Let's do another one, and
we'll do it in purple.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.190
Let's say we have the absolute
value of 4x-- I'm going to

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.430
change this problem
up a little bit.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.390
4x minus 1.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.583
The absolute value of 4x minus
1, is equal to-- actually,

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:40.200
I'll just keep it--
is equal to 19.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.160
So, just like the last few
problems, 4x minus 1 could be

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.640
equal to 19.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.670
Or 4x minus 1 might evaluate
to negative 19.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.130
Because then when you take the
absolute value, you're going

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.800
to get 19 again.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.100
Or 4x minus 1 could be
equal to negative 19.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.970
Then you just solve these
two equations.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.130
Add 1 to both sides of this
equation-- we could do them

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.890
simultaneous, even.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.510
Add 1 to both sides of this,
you get 4x is equal to 20.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.430
Add 1 to both sides of this
equation, you get 4x is equal

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.340
to negative 18.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.210
Divide both sides of this by
4, you get x is equal to 5.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.920
Divide both sides of this by
4, you get x is equal to

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:31.770
negative 18/4, which is
equal to negative 9/2.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.730
So both of these x values
satisfy the equation.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.280
Try it out.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.580
Negative 9/2 times 4.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.570
This will become
a negative 18.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.200
Negative 18 minus 1
is negative 19.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.740
Take the absolute value,
you get 19.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.920
You put a 5 here,
4 times 5 is 20.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.960
Minus 1 is positive 19.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.260
So you take the absolute
value.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.920
Once again, you'll get a 19.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.580
Let's try to graph one of
these, just for fun.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.630
So let's say I have y is
equal to the absolute

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.990
value of x plus 3.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.840
So this is a function,
or a graph, with an

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.410
absolute value in it.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.820
So let's think about
two scenarios.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.630
There's one scenario where the
thing inside of the absolute

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.430
value is positive.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.740
So you have the scenario where
x plus 3-- I'll write it over

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.420
here-- x plus 3 is
greater than 0.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.370
And then you have the scenario
where x plus 3 is less than 0.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.100
When x plus 3 is greater than 0,
this graph, or this line--

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.680
or I guess we can't call it a
line-- this function, is the

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.690
same thing as y is equal
to x plus 3.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.370
If this thing over here is
greater than 0, then the

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.750
absolute value sign
is irrelevant.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.780
So then this thing is the
same thing as y is

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.280
equal to x plus 3.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.590
But when is x plus
3 greater than 0?

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.940
Well, if you subtract 3 from
both sides, you get x is

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.910
greater than negative 3.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.090
So when x is greater than
negative 3, this graph is

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.460
going to look just like y
is equal to x plus 3.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.500
Now, when x plus 3
is less than 0.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.130
When the situation where this--
the inside of our

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.910
absolute value sign-- is
negative, in that situation

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.030
this equation is going to
be y is equal to the

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.250
negative of x plus 3.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.540
How can I say that?

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.520
Well, look, if this is going to
be a negative number, if x

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.060
plus 3 is going to be a negative
number-- that's what

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.010
we're assuming here-- if it's
going to be a negative number,

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.090
then when you take the absolute
value of a negative

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.050
number, you're going to
make it positive.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.280
That's just like multiplying
it by negative 1.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.870
If you know you're taking the
absolute value of a negative

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.890
number, it's just like
multiplying it by negative 1,

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.010
because you're going to
make it positive.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.870
And this is going to
be the situation.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.840
x plus 3 is less than 0.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.850
If we subtract 3 from both
sides, when x is less than

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.280
negative 3.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.920
So when x is less than negative
3, the graph will

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.040
look like this.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.280
When x is greater than negative
3, the graph will

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.600
look like that.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.300
So let's see what that
would make the

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.670
entire graph look like.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:21.520
Let me draw my axes.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.070
That's my x-axis, that's
my y-axis.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.090
So just let me multiply this
out, just so we have it in mx

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.870
plus b form.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:36.070
So this is equal to negative
x minus 3.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.409
So let's just figure out
what this graph would

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.620
look like in general.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.020
Negative x minus 3.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.380
The y-intercept is negative
3, so 1, 2, 3.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.060
And negative x means it
slopes downward, has a

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.290
downward slope of 1.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.540
So it would look like this.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.830
The x-intercept would be
at x is equal to--.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:07.740
So if you say y is equal to 0,
that would happen when x is

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.575
equal to negative 3.

00:09:08.575 --> 00:09:10.380
So it's going to go
through that line,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.920
that point right there.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.190
And the graph, if we didn't
have this constraint right

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.600
here, would look something
like this.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.760
That's if we didn't constrain
it to a certain interval on

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.880
the x-axis.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.080
Now this graph, what
does it look like?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.480
Let's see.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.810
It has its y-intercept
at positive 3.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.230
Just like that.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.260
And where's its x-intecept?

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.970
When y is equal to 0,
x is negative 3.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.760
So it also goes through that
point right there, and it has

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.620
a slope of 1.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.710
So it would look something
like this.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.330
That's what this graph
looks like.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.100
Now, what we figured out is
that this absolute value

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.030
function, it looks like this
purple graph when x is less

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.830
than negative 3.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.070
So when x is less than negative
3-- that's x is equal

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.593
to negative 3 right there-- when
x is less than negative

00:09:59.593 --> 00:10:03.170
3, it looks like this
purple graph.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.570
Right there.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.390
So that's when x is less
than negative 3.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.830
But when x is greater than
negative 3, it looks like the

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.160
green graph.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.640
It looks like that.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.480
So this graph looks like
this strange v.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.430
When x is greater than negative
3, this is positive.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.950
So we have the graph of-- we
have a positive slope.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.270
But then when x is less than
negative 3, we're essentially

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.550
taking the negative of the
function, if you want to view

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.280
it that way, and so we have
this negative slope.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.060
So you kind of have this
v-shaped function, this

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.250
v-shaped graph, which is
indicative of an absolute

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.950
value function.
