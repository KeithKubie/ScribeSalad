Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh, so going back to this asteroid impact, oh, sorry. There is a layer somewhere around 66 million years ago that indicates that the Earth got hit by an asteroid. That's what I mean. That's why I say that. Yeah. I think it's, the layer is high in uranium. I think an iridium has a, it's very rare on earth, but very common in space and uh, there's a bunch of other indications that that's the time that it hit. But what they're saying on the radio lab one is that the current state of understanding is that the dinosaurs and basically most things died within the first couple of hours. Like all the dinosaurs, they were all apparently there. Their bones or their fossils are in that iridium layer a lot of times. Right. I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. They found a lot of, they find him before too. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:46          They don't just don't find any after these things. Yeah. They think that their blood boiled in their body. They think it got so hot that during the few hours he got to like 700, a thousand degrees, 1200 degrees. It just got insanely hot. It was trying to get better at stand up and stand shape. Now I gotta worry about fucking that's a fulltime job. Raise my kids. That's what we really should be thinking about. Not just how bad were fucking the earth up, but how bad something could fuck the earth up from the sky. Yeah. That's what we really should be paying attention to. Instead of paying attention to so many nonsensical things that people concentrate on, there's a real chance that we could get hit in our lifetime with something that ends civilization like that. Yeah. 100% can happen. Yep. Yeah. I had Graham Hancock on last week and we were going over his new book.

Speaker 1:          01:31          This book. Where is it? Isn't it right here, Jamie? It's right there. It's fucking up. It's excellent. And Graham was talking about to call the America before. It's the evidence of civilizations in the Americas, in North Americans, particularly in the Amazon, that they think that there was millions of people live in the Amazon. But when the European explorers came over here, the game smallpox and wiped out everyone. Yeah. And they came back hundreds of years later. And there was nothing. Yup. Like the, the entire civilization way down. I think. I feel like in 1492 or whatever there was that, I think when the Spanish came up through the Mississippi Delta, the same thing. Yeah, same thing. Yeah. They wiped out 90 but like a lot of people think that the genocide of the native Americans was just European soldiers and, and people and settlers, killing native Americans, which did happen, but it was also influential.

Speaker 1:          02:24          90% of them were killed by disease. 90% like the entire population. While they even had, they even had certain government policies where they're like, do you missionaries are going out there and trying to convert them to Christianity. You're giving them your diseases. They knew that back then they knew that they were like, you're, you're there. They're getting sick and they're dying of, you know, there were all of a sudden they were like, we're getting these colds and people are dying. They didn't have any resistance to that crazy at those dirty Europeans with their shit. Water shoots outside their house and fucking vermin running around. That was war of the worlds. I remember war of the worlds, that movie, how did they die? They weren't ready for pathogens. That's my whole philosophy on we all try to be tough. One of the things about all of us as men or anybody is we hate to be who phone.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Horrible. So you know, I trained and I, I stay in shape, I eat well and I'm going to live forever. I don't think there's anything such thing as, I don't think you can be really ready for a situation, you know, in a bar I guess. And then you get bit by a tick or you get a flesh eating disease. Yeah. And you'd die. Sure. So I don't know if there's any way to get mercy to yourself. Well, I mean you can protect yourself, but you are ultimately very vulnerable. But then this radio lab was freaking me out about was that there's so many of those things floating around in the sky. I mean this is what Graham talked about in not just this book, but an in previous books that they think that something slammed into the earth somewhere in the past that ended the ice age.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Probably wiped out at a giant chunk of the large megafauna on North America, led to almost instantaneous extinction of so many different animals. And so it goes, yeah, and so it goes, and it can happen again. There could be a super volcano. There's all kinds of stuff like that. All these fucking things, and it makes you, what if announced toward was going to hit Denver? NASA was practicing that this week. Dan. Dan had done this before. They've had like a practice run using a bunch of the different, here's the practice, run, get in the boat, go to Australia.
