00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.620
- [Teacher] A candy machine
creates small chocolate wafers

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.130
in the shape of circular discs.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.130
The diameter, the diameter of
each wafer is 16 millimeters.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.660
What is the area of each candy?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.570
So, the candy, they say it's
the shape of circular discs.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.250
And they tell us that the diameter

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.890
of each wafer is 16 millimeters.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.330
So if I draw a line across the circle

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.830
that goes through the center,
the length of that line

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.230
all the way across the circle

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.800
through the center is 16 millimeters.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.130
So let me write that, so
diameter, the diameter

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.130
here is 16 millimeters and
they want us to figure out

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.770
the area, the area of the
surface of this candy.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.990
Or essentially the area of this circle.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.700
And so when we think about area,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.170
we know that the area of a
circle, the area of a circle

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.730
is equal to pi times the
radius of the circle squared.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.700
Times the radius of the circle squared,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.690
and you say, well they
gave us the diameter,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.240
what is the radius?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.120
Well, you might remember the radius

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.440
is half of diameter, so
distance from the center

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.270
of the circle to the outside,
to the boundary of the circle.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.750
So it would be this
distance right over here,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.920
which is exactly half of the diameter.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.730
So, it would be eight millimeters.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.690
So, where we see the radius,
we could put eight millimeters.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.200
So the area is going to be equal

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.650
to pi times eight millimeters squared,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.650
which would be 64, 64 square,
64 square millimeters.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.070
And typically, this is
written with pi after the 64,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.510
so you might often see it as this is equal

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.510
to 64 pi, 64 pi millimeters squared,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.480
millimeters squared, millimeters squared.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.920
Now, this is the answer,
64 pi millimeters squared,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.730
but sometimes it's not so satisfying

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.947
to just leave this pi, you might say,

00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:01.837
"Well, I wanna get a
estimate of what number

00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:05.750
"this is close to, I wanna
decimal representation of this."

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.300
And so we can start to use
approximate values of pi.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.937
So, the most rough
approximate value that tends

00:02:11.937 --> 00:02:14.540
to be used is saying that pi,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.073
a very rough approximation
is equal to 3.14.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.720
So in that case, we could
say that this is going

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.720
to be equal to 64, 64
times 3.14 millimeters,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.220
millimeters squared and
we can get our calculator

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.423
to figure out what this
will be in decimal form.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.530
So we have 64 times 3.14 gives us 200.96.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.680
So we could say that the area
is approximately equal to,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.680
approximately equal to
200.96 square millimeters.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.690
Now, if we wanna get a more
accurate representation

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.470
of this, pi actually just keeps going on

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.600
and on and on forever, we
could use the calculator's

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.880
internal representation of pi.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.040
In which case we'll say 64 times

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.200
and then we have to look for
the pi in the calculator,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.730
it's up here in this yellow so I'll do

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.250
this little second
function, get the pi there,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.570
every calculator will
be a little different.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.350
But 64 times pi, now we're going to use

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.420
the calculator's internal
approximation of pi,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.450
which is going to be
more precise than what

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.090
I had in the last one and you get

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.890
201, so let me put it over
here so I can write it down,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.791
so a more precise is 201,
and I'll round, I'll round

00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:40.000
to the nearest, I'll round
to the nearest hundredth

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
so you get 201.06, so 201, so more precise

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.240
is 201.06 square millimeters.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.410
So this is closer to the actual answer

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.180
'cause a calculator's
representation is more precise

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.893
than this very rough
approximation of what pi is.
