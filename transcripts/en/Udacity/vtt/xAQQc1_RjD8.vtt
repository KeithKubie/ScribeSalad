00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
So finally, what about non determinism?

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.130
What if we're using the if-better function at a certain line in the code?

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.370
Well, then the rules here are actually much simpler

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.200
than for a normal line of code,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.590
because any time we use the if-better,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.040
our rule is going to be

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.950
that the program either goes to 1 line of code

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.380
or another one,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.010
because that's all the if-better does.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.450
The if-better does not modify any variables, it doesn't depend on any variables.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.210
It just goes to either one line of code or the other one.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.230
So this is a very simple rule that we can use to say

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.110
what will happen if the program at time point t

00:00:38.110 --> 99:59:59.000
point to an if-better.
