1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,520
Yeah, there's nowhere to hide. That's
why I love the store so much. Yeah,

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,430
there's so many places to hide, but the
store has that little problem with the,

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,580
or like when you,
right before you're about to go on stage,

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,510
you're in the hallway and he had only
the hallway but I liked the seats on

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,110
against the back that just for comics do
you kind of sit there and go over your

6
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:20,640
notes and I believe you learn. I love that
Backbar, that backbone is my favorite.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,310
The back bars, the shit,
the secret comedians bar.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,570
I mean that's just what
they've done in the new,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,600
this new generation of managers and the
people that run the place now David sort

10
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:34,910
of like really paid
attention to like what,

11
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,950
what's going to make these guys happier?
What's going to make this better?

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,960
Like you got to give them a
place where they can hide.

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,740
So giving that back bar and you go to
the back bar any day it's filled with

14
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:48,180
people just hanging out, talking shit
and like it's fun. It's like a fun play.

15
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,840
I go there, I gravitate and I get
into the back end. I'm like, oh look,

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,710
all these cool people. Yeah, this is a
great spot to hang out it. Yeah, yeah.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,520
They did that. They added
security. They did it. So it's,

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,910
it's night and day two the way it used
to be. Oh, I never used to go there.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,020
I didn't like hanging out there. I didn't
like any part of it. And then once, uh,

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,780
once the new management took
over, I was like, oh great.

21
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:13,350
Like I once did a show there, I did a
benefit. There was like a kid who died,

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,510
I forget his name, he was a comic, uh,

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,860
died in a car accident and they had
like a benefit for his family. Oh yeah,

24
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:24,710
that's job shout Myers friend
Angelo. Yeah, Angelo about it.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,430
I did not know him. I didn't
know him either, but a bike's,

26
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:29,310
he was like a fan of mine and I was like,

27
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,150
I was like his favorite comic they
could get. And I'm like on the,

28
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:35,220
I'm on the marquis,
it's a sold out show.

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,950
I have a great set of walk off and
Tommy comes up and he's like, ah.

30
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,070
The old manager was like, aunt,
that was great when we got,

31
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:42,330
we've got to get you around. You
got to start hanging out, you know,

32
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,750
you got to start hanging out and doing,
you know, doing the open mic and stuff.

33
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,810
And I'm like, dude, tell me open my,
my name is on the marquee right now.

34
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:52,440
You just watched me headline this
show. Like, what are you talking about?

35
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,380
And I then,
I don't think I ever saw him again.

36
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,240
Next thing I knew he was
fired and they were like,

37
00:01:57,241 --> 00:02:01,200
what can we do to get you back here?
But I love it. Well that's Adam, right?

38
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,850
Adam did the same thing to me.

39
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,880
He told me that Tommy got fired
and came to visit me. The improv.

40
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,130
So you were gone seven years,

41
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,250
seven years from the store and then when
Tommy left they brought you back in?

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,460
Yeah, well there's two reasons. One,

43
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,820
I had to go physically to the store
because Ari was filming his comedy central

44
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:25,530
special and is like that.
He's a,

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,140
you know,

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,140
Ari's just one of my best friends and I
knew him from the time he was a doorman

47
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,380
and I knew that him filming his special
there was so important and there's no

48
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,330
way I was going to miss it. I
was like, I have to be here,

49
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,700
like I have to see this at the store.
So I was like, oh fuck. All right,

50
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,960
I've got to go back.
And so I decided to go back.

51
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,880
I think he was filming on a Wednesday.
What night is a gross battles on Tuesday,

52
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,800
right? So I went down
there on a Tuesday. I said,

53
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,720
let me go down on Tuesday
just to see what's up.

54
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,310
And I went to roast battle and I was
like, Holy Shit, this place is electric.

55
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,890
This is crazy. Like the environment is
so much different. It's so creative.

56
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,760
And the, the night that I was at
roast battle was fucking fantastic.

57
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:11,620
It was so good. There was so many funny
roasters and I remember thinking, wow,

58
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,430
this place is just different, man.
It just feels so much different.

59
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,790
And it wasn't like it is now.
Like now,

60
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:23,380
like you'll go on a Saturday night,
they'll have six sold out shows.

61
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,260
They have two shows in the belly room too,
in the or two in the main room.

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,230
Everything's sold out and packed
with headliners and it's chaos.

63
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,050
It wasn't like that.
It was still sort of Shitty,

64
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,610
like in terms of like the numbers,

65
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:36,580
but the vibe and the
creativity was way different.

66
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,970
And the new guys and
girls that were coming up,

67
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,170
they were fucking good man. I was
like, wow, this is a different vibe.

68
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,330
I had been gone for almost a decade. Yeah.
So that brought me in and like I said,

69
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:52,000
I had to be there for Ari.
There's no way.

70
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,110
There's no way I could miss it. I had
to be there. So I'm like, all right,

71
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,590
I just got to swallow it. And that was
probably what Adam for sure helped,

72
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:04,120
but I might've stayed away forever if
it wasn't for Ari. I just had to see it.
