00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.420
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.460
[ Laughter ]

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.760
Mic works.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.180
[ Laughter ]

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.480
I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.590
I'm Director for the Center for
the Book here at the Library

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.190
of Congress, and we're
part of the new national

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.760
and international outreach unit.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.980
And we welcome you to
this afternoon's program.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.970
A part of our vision here at
the Library of Congress is

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.240 position:56%
that we are the chief steward of the
record of knowledge of America and,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.620
thus, the world, creating a
springboard to the future.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.570 position:56%
And it's a future that I just create
in my mind that's one of compassion

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.670
and courage and industry and
achievement and accomplishment

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.430
and honor and peace and harmony.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.060
And I believe there's nothing more
wonderful than the art of poetry

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.070
to be both a healing, soothing balm

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.600
and a vibrant source
of self-expression.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.010
Sometimes it's an equalizer.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.940
Sometimes it's a neutralizer.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.270
A part of the Library's
central mission is

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.460
to provide the American people
with a very rich, enduring source

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.400
of knowledge that can be
relied upon to inform,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.110
engage, and inspire societies.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.630
And today's program's a
part of that endeavor.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.430
Here at the Center for the
Book, which includes the Poetry

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.770
and Literature Center and the Young
Readers Center, we promote books

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.600
and library, literacy and
reading, poetry and literature,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.080
knowing that they're best tools
for engaged, informed societies,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.130
for the protection and
preservation of democracy,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.700
and they're the best weapons
against ignorance and intolerance.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.770
Today, we have the opportunity
to explore ways in which poetry

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.100
and poetry publishing push us to
understand our national dialogue

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.770
on race and to do so
in empowering ways.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.440
And to start us off on our
discussion, we have Rob Casper,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.510
who's the Head of the
Library of Congress Poetry

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.480
and Literature Center, who will
introduce our four poet publishers.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.950
I'd like to bring Rob to the
microphone and just acknowledge him

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.680
for being a very remarkable
and inspiring,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.360
bright and talented human being
who's a very big contributor

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.670
to the Library and
the poetry community.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.470
Welcome, Rob.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.540
[ Applause ]

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.920
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Thank you, Pam.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.250
I'm excited to introduce
today's panel,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.080
which I have a personal
connection to.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.310
Not so long ago before starting
this job as the Head of the Poetry

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.790
and Literature Center, I published
the literary magazine jubilat,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.480 position:56%
and Cathy Park Hong and Evie
Shockley were the last two editors I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.020
had the privilege of working with.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.460
In a sense, this panel
represents both a continuation

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.810
and an expansion of
our conversations.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.250
I also owe a debt to my program
specialist, Anya Creightney,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.640
who helped develop the
panel from the beginning.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.920
Thank you, Anya.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.130
Before I begin, let me ask you
to turn off your cell phones

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.960 position:56%
and any electronic devices you have
that might interfere with our event.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.870
Second, please note that this
program is being recorded,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.710
and by participating,
you give us permission

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.060 position:56%
for any future use of the recording.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.950 position:56%
Finally, let me tell you a little
bit about the Poetry and Literature.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.210
We are home to the Poet
Laureate Consultant on Poetry,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.200
and we put on 30 to 40 public
programs like this one per year.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.300
In two days' time, for instance,
we're featuring poet Monica Youn

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.070
in our first ever Law
and Literature Program.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.800 position:56%
To find out more about the Season of
Literature Programs at the Library,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.110
you can go check out the table
in the back in the foyer,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.210
or you can visit our
website, www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.370
Here's how today's event will work.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.970
First, I've asked each panelist
to come up to the podium

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.300
and read a poem they've published,
which they feel speaks to issues

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.560
about race in ways that
prose or other forms

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.360
of artistic expression cannot.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.560
Afterwards, I will lead a moderated
discussion, and we'll have plenty

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.630
of time at the end of the
program for your questions.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.540
We also have books for sale by all

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.870
of our poet panelists,
poet/editor panelists.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.720
And I know they'll be happy to
have -- to sign them for you.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.980
You can read more about
our panelists

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.240
in the program you should all have,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.970
if not on your chair,
next to your chair.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.520
But let me say how proud I
am to have them all here,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.110
traveling from around the country.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.600
Each of them are dynamic, open,
insightful, and deeply engaged,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.190
both as poets and editors,
and together,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.760
I know we'll explore how
poems enrich and challenge,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.650
as well as the Royal Literal
Magazines and Presses play

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.520
in getting poetry to
its eager readers.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.480
Please join me in welcoming Carmen
GimÃ©nez Smith, Cathy Park Hong,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.510
Don Share, and Evie Shockley.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:24.010
[ Applause ]

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.440
[ Laughter ]

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carmen Gimenez Smith: I go first?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.040
[ Laughter ]

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.210
And I just read the poem, and then
I talk about how I feel about it?

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.510
Okay.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.970
[ Laughter ]

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.280
Hi. I'm so glad to be here.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.720
I'm going to read a poem by
Vanessa Villarreal, who is a poet.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.020
I'm a publisher.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.700
I have a small press
called Noemi Press.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.370
It's a press that's celebrating
its 15th year next year.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.850
It started as a Chapbook Press,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.600
and we've been publishing
full-length collections

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.150
for about eight years now.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.950
This book is from a series that
we published called "Acrylica".

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.980
The Acrylica Series is named

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.670
after our Poet Laureate Juan
Felipe Herreras [sic - Herrera],

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.220
groundbreaking multi
-- bilingual collection

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.180
of poetry called "Acrylica".

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.750
And the series, which
has published four books

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.090 position:56%
and has really exciting books coming
out, is interested in the work

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.630
of innovative Latino writers.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.860
This book, "Beast Meridian"
by Vanessa Villarreal,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.940
will be published in
March of next year.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.750
"Girl Body Gift".

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.350 position:56%
First dress as a boy, an earlied 11.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.920
Iron Papi's khakis, a Dickies
crease with white T-shirt,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.690
gel comb black, slick
back como linda.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.300
Me and my girls look
hard, get caught.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.350
Papi's hands crush my neck.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.690
No te compones tue matadas
aqui no quiero jotas.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.850
First kiss, 12, Chancey,
Saturn 9, Centaur,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.170
trembling to Jodesi
[assumed spelling].

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.040
First boyfriend Tyrone, MJ smile.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.480
You want to go with me.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.130
Spiral perm and boys to men to
sleep in his Rockets jersey.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.430
Papi's backhand.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.230
No quiero queandes
colos pinches negros.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.860
First against light-eyed Cedric,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.050
dream prince of pines
appears at a sleepover.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.350
The moon is a pill in my can.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.850
Dazed, I kneel, dick a dark poppy.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.400
No, a muffled petal in my throat.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.190
Not all my yet tells his boys.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.260
First white boy, summer night,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.590
a stolen sapphire justing
[assumed spelling].

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.460
Shooting stars on slide.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.240
Three AM, taut orchid drum.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.980
Mami pregnant due to work at
seven, searching the milky fog,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.300
caught in Chevy headlights.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.030
Slut to his boys, bifurcate
my head, shave bottom half.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.700
Rocks pelt my back on
tracks, and with my new names,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.720
I can now fathom my father.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.530
Hospital roommate Nicole, lily-firm
breasts on sterile white sheets.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.070
Hillary, pink vodka mattress.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.140
Tina and Li, a yearning
of triangles.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.980
Seventeen, Dr. Wright's, hymen
intact, a knot hot and sharp

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.240
as wood salt on the
cord in my star heart.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.660
I'm interested in this
poem for many reasons.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.020
I love the compression
in the language,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.890
but I also really appreciate
how it inscribes a couple

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.560
of different things.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.770
One of them is the racial issues
that emerge among people of color,

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.980
which I think is a question
or a problem or an issue

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.560
that not too many people
engage with,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.250 position:56%
but I think is really important as a
person of color to consider the ways

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.870
in which we all participate in
the horizontal oppression of race.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.250
I also think that one
of the challenges

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:03.130
of being a Latina is the ways
in which our sexuality is used

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.170
as a kind of currency
and Latina sexuality

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:16.730
and I guess affect is
stereotyped or made precious.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:21.410
And I appreciate that this poem
does a really beautiful job

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:26.290
of complicating what
Latina sexuality is.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.590
So thank you.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.340
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong: Hi.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.840
Hi. I'm the -- I'm the Poetry
Editor for the New Republic,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.170 position:56%
which used to be solely based in DC,

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.750
and now it also has an
office in New York City.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.270
And I'm relatively new.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:07.540
I became editor I think in
2014, in the winter of 2014.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:13.110
And it was actually a
very contentious time

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.450 position:56%
for that magazine because, you know,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.770
there was a whole walkout,
a whole staff walkout.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:25.150
And this was all over the news,
and there was a big uproar,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.460
and a lot of journalists were
saying, the New York Times

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.970
and so forth, that the
magazine was destroyed.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.840
And then the editor in chief,
Gabriel Snyder, at the Times,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.620
who is actually a friend of
mine, called me up and asked me

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:47.130
if I wanted to be the poetry
editor, which was shock --

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.940
which was very much a surprise
to me because it's a perch

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.160
that I haven't been
in for a long time --

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.250
on for a long time except I used
to edit jubilat with Rob and Evie.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.180
So it was definitely -- I
was ambivalent about it,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.660
but then I grew to love it.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.400
And, you know, one, I thought
I would read the inaugural poem

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.110
that I actually commissioned from a
young poet named Rickey Laurentiis.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.350
And, you know, though there was
this huge uproar about the mag --

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.040
how the magazine was
destroyed, there were, you know,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.580
a few people who were
saying, you know,

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.710
maybe the magazine
needs some revamping,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:35.030
including Ta-Nehisi Coates,
who in The Atlantic said

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.600
that -- what was he saying?

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.910
Let's see.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.920
How the family rose at
TNR's virtual funeral looks

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.100
like a whites-only section of
a Jim Crow era movie house.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.560
For most of the modern history,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.530
TNR has been an entirely
white publication.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:59.880
So I thought as my part as the
poetry editor, it would be --

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.670
I wanted to kind of
revise that legacy.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.890
And this is a poem by -- called
"Continuance" by Rickey Laurentiis.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:11.400
And it was a few months
past Ferguson.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:17.970
So it's actually in memoriam to
-- for Ferguson and Mike Brown.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.590
Ferguson, Missouri,
2014, In Memoriam.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.960 position:56%
Forever here, Mister Dark, and
tricking me, Steaming from a manhole

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.800
in Missouri Or else you're damp
between the motions of the trees,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.390
Revealing the breezy discourse
of those trees, black Sound.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.260
I can see now how everything
I've learned of you is wrong.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:50.310 position:56%
How an air Of dumb assumption
lounged on my brow, A liar, winking,

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.470
claiming a shadow is as
empty As my childhood vision

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.740
of the falling sun meant emptiness.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.990
But every child knows what
moves the wind at night,

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.850
Knows what leads some birds
to develop their unrest

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:07.220
In the high green of
some trees or, lower,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.110
What leans against that
tree's bark: a man?

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.500
Or is it The
just-barely-intelligible idea

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.800
of one?

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.400
Head back, Maybe eyes
closed, moaning,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.950
working to hysteria
The erection rising

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.420
like a haunted chain away from him.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.330
If I move closer, carrying
a glass cup?

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.280
If my mouth Is that cup?

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.970
Though I've known fear move
as bravely In this world,

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.870
move like a physical man, it
can shoot a boy -- So shoot me.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.170
Who said that?

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.340
Was it really The black
of my tongue?

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.750 position:56%
But how could any breed Of blackness
ever wish to be penetrated?

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.210
I could tell you How a foot creaks
even falling dead In the night,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:58.760
could tell the red a mother cries
Once she feels that absence drop,

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.630
like pity, inside her, But I
cannot say what a bullet says

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.250
as it enters a child's skin.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.550
But come in.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.520
You can enter me, Mister Dark.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.730
Let Tonight be the first night
I deeper see the pregnant

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.720
Possibilities of your design.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.190
How your fingers move To build
such attitudes, turning a moaning

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.930
of the wind Into a man, making what
is a tease of grass at the heel

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.230
Into terror, now pleasure,
then back to grass again.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.220
Aren't you the mirror in
which all lights balance?

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.150
Aren't you the line on
which all lines cross?

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:38.440
Anything lives in you, so that that
dark over there Can be the dark

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.940
of Mike Brown, full of breath; that
the dark Right here can be the dark

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.700
of my own bastard mind,
That this dark come closest

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.630
to my lips Is a shadow's
knowledge, full, not ever empty,

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:57.730
Charitable as is wicked, risky as
is good, fascination, Perversion,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.930
and I move to it, to
you, a shadow-chaser,

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.130
Hearing the birds make
restlessness in the trees,

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.550
Watching the man stroke velvet
from his body, Head still back,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.830
maybe eyes parted, singing now --

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.960
He's at that point when I must
surrender My knees to gravity,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.520
and, mouth ready, get gone.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.470
I'll choose what ground I lie on.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.340
&gt;&gt; Don Share: I'll read a poem

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.400
from the March 2014
issue of Poetry Magazine.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:49.000
Since this poem appeared, it's
gotten about 12,000 hits a day

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.130 position:56%
on the PoetryFoundation.org website.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.330
Also in this issue were poems
from Claudia Rankine's Citizen,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.890
although the book hadn't
come out yet.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.600
And the best thing to do is to look

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.880
for the poet reading
this poem on YouTube.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.800
It's Danez Smith, "alternate
names for black boys".

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.450
1. smoke above the burning bush 2.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:19.330
archnemesis of summer night 3.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.370
first son of soil 4.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.830
coal awaiting spark &amp; wind 5.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.990
guilty until proven dead 6.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.160
oil heavy starlight 7.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.330
monster until proven ghost 8.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:46.850
gone 9. phoenix who
forgets to un-ash 10.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.240
going, going, gone 11.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.340
gods of shovels &amp; black veils 12.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.920
what once passed for kindling 13.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.630
fireworks at dawn 14.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:07.270
brilliant, shadow hued coral 15.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.940
(I thought to leave this blank
but who am I to name us nothing?)

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:19.180
16. prayer who learned
to bite &amp; sprint 17.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.960
a mother's joy &amp; clutched breath.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.140
This issue of Poetry Magazine
was produced in collaboration

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.420
with the Split this
Rock Poetry Festival.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.580
It was co-edited with Sarah
Browning, who's in the room.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.610 position:56%
And both Sarah Browning and Split
this Rock are institutions y'all can

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.320
support locally and should.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.790
And when we published these
poems, this was before Ferguson,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.970
before so much that we're used
to waking up to and hearing

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.860
in the news relentlessly
was starting to become known

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.540
to the general and wider world.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.350
And sometimes poems and poets
become fixed in the time

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.310
and place of our imaginations.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.700
And Danez is one.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.640
Claudia Rankine is another.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.810
The issue also had Tim
Seibles and Nikky Finney.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.970
When we put that issue together,
we read, as we always do

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:16.290
at the magazine and with our
co-editor, in this case Sarah.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.230
We look for the best poems.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.940
We were looking for poems
that meant something to us

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.760
as people, as readers, you know?

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.970
Sometimes a word, we'll talk about
this gatekeeper gets tossed around.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.220
But we weren't -- we had no gates
and weren't keeping anything.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.650
We were putting poems in front
of eyeballs, and we believed

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.950
in the poets and the poems,

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.340
and we knew their significance
and vitality.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.510
But what we didn't understand
yet was how these poems,

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.990
like the best poems, sort of know
things before everyone else does.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.470
Poems know what's going to happen
before things happen in a way

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.040
because poets are people.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.890
I'm stealing from Henry James,

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.560
but they're people on
whom nothing is lost.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.060
And so, sadly, these poems came
to a kind of moment sometime

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.980
after the publication
in these pages occurred.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:11.660
And although I'm sorry that the
occasion for the poetry recurs,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.670
I'm glad that the poets were
there, not just for readers now

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:20.740 position:56%
with whom they resonate, but I think
when people look back on our time

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.160
and want to know what
was going on here,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.570
they'll have the history books.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.870
And they'll say certain things.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.430
And there'll be sort of
journalism available to people.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:33.650 position:56%
But if they want to know what it
was like, they'll turn to the poets.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.340
If they want to know
what were these --

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.490
what were people doing when
all this stuff happened,

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.200
they'll turn to the
poets and the poems.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:45.550
And so, there are many other
poems I think all of us could read

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.510
that have come to occupy a place
that I think will never be --

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.410
just, you know, that these poems
will never become dislodged,

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.010
though you never know.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:59.700
But I think that's something we had
gotten complacent about as editors,

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.490
as readers, that we thought poems
and poetry was a kind of process

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.040
that was always unfolding
and always kind of there.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.480
What we didn't I think realize
and we do now is the urgency

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.210
and necessity for this
work to help us under --

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:20.910
not only understand what's
going on, but to fight things

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.830
that need fighting
and to empower people

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.740
who didn't have the power to fight.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.660
&gt;&gt; Evie Shockley: Hi.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.400
I'm Evie Shockley, and I currently
am the Creative Writing Editor

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.300
for Feminist Studies, which is
primarily an academic journal

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.940
in the field of women's and
genders' sexuality studies,

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:59.490
but from its inception, Feminist
Studies has always published

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.370
creative writing.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:08.640
And I was very delighted when I
was asked to come on, come on board

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.980
and serve on the editorial
board in that --

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.880
the role of particular sort of
shepherd of creative writing.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.050
My work there, though,
involves a much smaller volume

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.350
because there are only, you know,
a certain number of pages per issue

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.020
in a journal that only publishes
a couple to three times a year.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:35.850
A small volume of creative
work, and because I work

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.610
with creative nonfiction,
fiction, and poetry,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.680
an even smaller volume of poetry.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.400
So I'm going to be reading
and talking about a poem

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:51.820
that I published when I was working
on jubilat with Rob and Cathy.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:57.090
And so, this poem is one that we
published in jubilat 18 in 2010.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.340
It's by a poet named Marcus Wicker,

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.730
and the title is "Love
Letter to Justin Timberlake".

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:14.760
When I think of you it is
always of a small, locked room.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.850
A principal's dark, full lips
pressed together in a smirk.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:26.360
A glare from his fat, gold
herringbone chain burning tears

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:33.390
in my eyes, my face red as
yours in direct sunlight.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:39.090
And even as my voice shut
down that day, I knew ditching

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:45.880
to buy NSYNC's CD was worth more
than Prescriptive Speech class.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.940
What I heard -- four voices
harmonized in a plastic bottle.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.780
Your falsetto, blowing the top off.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:02.120
Michael Jackson with no abusive
boxer father or snatched childhood.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:07.830
Sam Cooke sans German shepherds
stalking through his songs.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.610
I've been watching James Brown

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:14.610
and Jackie Wilson make
pelvic fixation public domain

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.830
since I was old enough
to work a remote.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.060
And I have yet to elude
starched lines.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.600
How did you learn to dance
your way out of boxes?

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.870
Or did you find it
easy as breathing,

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.090
like whistling the national anthem?

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.450
Do you remember the Super Bowl?

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.410
How you tore Janet
Jackson's breast from her top?

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.900
I love you that way.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.750
Her earth-brown bounty of flesh --

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:49.850
large, black nipple pierced,
wind chapped, hardened.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.850
And you saying, Go ahead.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.410
Look.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.400
I chose this poem out of
the many I could have gone

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.690
with because it takes up a
subject that has been back

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.590
in the news somewhat spectacularly

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:08.030
in the last few weeks,
cultural appropriation.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:13.050
I'm thinking of the novelist Lionel
Shriver's highly publicized remarks

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:18.390
in defense of what she described
as a writer's right to imagination,

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:22.310
to create characters whose identity
is different in some respects

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.980
or in many from the writer's own.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.100
In the wake of her talk, which she
delivered wearing a sombrero just

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.390
to be clear, there has been
a widespread conversation

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:41.060
about the difference between the
necessary and often vital work

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:46.330
of a writer depicting lives
outside of their own experience

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.560
and the problematic
all too common instance

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.110
of a societally privileged
writer exploiting the cultures

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:58.940
and identities of disenfranchised,
socially marginalized others.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.260
Wicker's poem locates the issue
in the realm of music rather

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.020
than literature, of course, but
it gives us a space for thinking

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.970
about the same questions raised by
Shriver's expression of entitlement

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:17.420 position:56%
to instrumentalize and commodify
the experience of the less powerful.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.730
The form of the poem allows
Wicker to initiate our thinking

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.610
about these things without
ever using the phrase

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.930
cultural appropriation.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.120
It begins with a scene of memory
in which the speaker is in trouble

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.810
for not being where he was
supposed to be, in class,

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:40.570 position:56%
and as a result has been
re-confined in a small, locked room.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:45.310 position:56%
His adoration of NSYNC, the boy band
in which Timberlake got his start,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.710
has made the punishment
worth it to the speaker.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:55.590 position:56%
The poem sets the speaker's love
and trouble in the context of a list

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.850
of African American musician
performers whom both he

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:04.820
and Timberlake apparently love,
Michael Jackson and Sam Cooke,

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.930
James Brown and Jackie Wilson.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.230
A deep --

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.200
A deep appreciation for
the genius of these men

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.960
as entertainers is what the speaker
and Timberlake have in common.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.750
But while the speaker also shares
with them an experience of trouble,

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:30.200 position:56%
his tears and shut-down voice
shadows Michael Jackson's experience

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.580
of abuse and Cooke's of being
stalked by German shepherds,

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.010
Timberlake's done taken
their blues and gone.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.060
How did you learn to dance
your way out of boxes?

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.490
The speaker apostrophizes
his one-time hero.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.720
The subsequent lines of the poem
suggest that the answer has much

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.270
to do with Timberlake's
easy sense of belonging

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.330
in a white supremacist nation.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:01.260
Wicker ends with a fascinating
and disquieting image

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:06.430
of Timberlake enacting his
access or right to black culture,

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.440
which is embodied in not Michael,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.900
but Janet Jackson's
earth-brown bounty of flesh.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.010
This Jackson, who also
bears the marks of trouble,

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:22.450
her exposed breast is pierced,
wind-chapped, hardened, lays bare,

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:29.490 position:56%
so to speak, the currency Timberlake
has traded in for his success.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.320
And in a move that
Shriver could learn from,

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.880
Wicker problematizes his
own participation in this

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.600
between men triangle that in turn
instrumentalizes black women's

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.070
bodies with the productively
ambiguous admission,

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.300
"I love you that way."

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.780
Bought and paid for.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.820
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Wow.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:08.260
What a great group of
presentations [inaudible] to be

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:13.570
in this conversation with.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.070
So very -- and as the presentations
were very [inaudible] all asserting

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.600
the essential power of
[unintelligible] poem.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.460
I want to begin by sort of
riffing off of what Don said

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:28.510
about this particular moment
and ask you all to weigh

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.150
in on how you feel that's happening

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.750
in poetry right now
[inaudible] the poems

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.960
that you've been [inaudible]
publish, especially poems

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.160
that relate to issues of race.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.970
It's part of a larger tradition.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.290
I mean there's something to be said
about how these poems may be sort

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.360
of working within our culture,
but there's also something

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.610
to be said about, you know,
the lineage they come from

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.940
and the lineage that we
are championing as editors.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.240
So maybe you could talk about that?

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:08.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong: I'll begin I
mean I think that I am a poet and --

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:12.740
who's always been interested in
race because of who I am and just,

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.780
you know, and because
of my politics.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:19.240
And it's something that I, you
know, have always confronted.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:24.170
And that was something I wanted
to bring in as an editor.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:29.580
And even though when I first
turned down that editing job,

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:35.040
I was a little bit nervous and
skeptical about the position.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.240
I realize that it was a great
opportunity to publish poets

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.890
who wouldn't normally be
published in a glossy magazine.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.810
And so, that was --
and it's been really --

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.650
I mean basically I've
been able to --

00:29:51.650 --> 00:30:00.820
poets who I tend to love are
poets [inaudible] pull in politics

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.260
into their setting,
into their language.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.360
And it's not just that
they're writing about race

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.660
or they're writing about this.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.000 position:56%
And I think one -- this is something
that I get a little bit worried

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.210 position:56%
about now because right now
there's been this national discourse

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:19.510
on race.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.040
It's a real hot button
issue right now.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.680
It's been like that
for the last few years.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.980
But this is also the
history of America.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:35.920 position:56%
But I think our tendencies, our
historical literary tendency is kind

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.240
of sort of decide when to turn
the camera on race and when

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.940
to turn it away from race.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.720
And what I'm afraid is that,
you know, I think our interest

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.480
in race right now especially
as poets or [inaudible]

00:30:51.480 --> 00:31:00.130
between the poem about race as an
occasional poem, you know, only.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:05.770
Oh, now since we're talking about
Islamophobia, why don't we bring

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.430
up this poem by this non-Muslim
poet and pay attention to her?

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.830 position:56%
And then, you know, so it becomes --

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:17.910 position:56%
so the identity of the poet of color
is usually so much more attached

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.590
to what's going on politically.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:26.070
And, you know, for me as a poet
and as an editor it's really more

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:30.240
about that [inaudible] this
conversation is sustained

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.040
and continued.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.780
And I do think that actually our
literary landscape is changing,

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.080
you know?

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.970
I do think that, you know, even
though I have that concern,

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.460
that worry, I also think
that we're having a bit

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:50.790
of a renaissance right now in terms
of the amazing number of poets

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.970
of color who have been
getting published [inaudible].

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.270
Yeah.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.340
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Anybody else
want to jump in on that?

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:05.200
Really it's a question about what
may have preceded this moment,

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.300
both in terms of what publishers
have done, but also in terms

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.710
of what poets were doing, writing
about issues related to race.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:17.720
That may be changing now in
terms of, as you said, Cathy,

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:23.180
how it fits into what this sort
of larger national conversation.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.780
But still, I mean my
feeling as an editor is

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.210
that there were poems
there, you know.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.940
There have been poems throughout
our history that have been there

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:39.330
that at times, as you said, Cathy,
the cultural lens has turned

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.790
to maybe for different
reasons or in different ways.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.880
But I definitely felt like
in the editing that we did,

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.780
we were more of a larger
and older tradition.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.620
Yeah, go ahead.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.530
&gt;&gt; Don Share: Well, I don't
think I can improve upon anything

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.000
that either of you have
said, but I point out,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.400
and I think I can point it out
because I'm older than you guys.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.700
I'm looking around.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.030
I remember, you know, when I was
coming up what poetry was like.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.360
And it's not like it is now.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.800
It will never be that again,
which I think is fantastic.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.150
But the point that we're
all sort of getting at is

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.800
that institutions have
been transformed.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.790
I mean Cathy touched on this
talking about the New Republic,

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.930
which has been around
for a substantial portion

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.230
of American history.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.200
It's been around since
the 19th century.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.310
The nation has been
around that long.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:32.450
Poetry's been around for over
a hundred years, and so on.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:37.590
And so what you're seeing is that
poetry and literature as it sort

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.800
of lived in places such
as literary magazines

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.760
or magazines was not
reflecting reality

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.840
for a very long period of time.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.880
All that's happening now
is that it's doing that.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.450
And in the process of reflecting
what we all know, whatever we think

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:58.320
and feel about issues of the day
to be reality, those magazines

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.480
in our culture have
become transformed.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.700
And so, I don't think
it will ever go back

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.480
to something that it was before.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.520
And what it was before
is not -- we're not --

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.860
I don't think any of us would
sort of put down, you know,

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.030
a kind of poem or poetry.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:21.630 position:56%
I mean, you know, history has
moments that arise out of necessity.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:24.090
And we're in one of
those moments now.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.890
In a sense, we always were.

00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:28.590
But again, the magazines
didn't reflect it.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:31.260
The literary history
wasn't open to it.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.700
Our culture wasn't aware of it.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:37.850
All that's happening now is because
people are aware of the poems

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.860
and poets we're talking
about, it means something

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.030
that poetry hadn't
meant for a long time.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:47.200
So I think it's very
healthy and promising

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.820
that these transformations
are happening.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.430
And I don't think that
can be undone.

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:52.730
I mean who knows, you know?

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.030
I just don't believe it.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.520
I just don't believe what is
happening now will be undone.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:02.140
I mean I think the strength of
poetry has found itself thanks

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.300
to new writer -- not new writers,

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.680
but writers who didn't
have the audiences

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.110
that other writers had before.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:10.740
There's been tectonic shifts,

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.470
and I don't think you put
those plates back flat.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong: Can I just maybe
add something, just add to that

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.640
about -- and I think part of
that is also just technology

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.040
and the way that's changed.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.120
As you mentioned, Don, you
[inaudible], and he's like,

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.000
you know, he's -- his
poetry's gone viral.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.360
&gt;&gt; Don Share: Yeah.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.660
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong: You
know, which is great.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.960
I mean there are a lot of
problems I have with technology,

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.220
but it's also very able to
democratize any process in that,

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.440
you know, people can
access poems so much easier.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.280
And I think that's also made
it much more [inaudible].

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.740
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: And I also just want
to briefly talk about institutions.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:49.610
We have a sort of range of
institutions and a range

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:53.680
of publishers represented here,
both publishing, you know --

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.490
New Republic Magazine, but also
Carmen started Noemi Press.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:02.260
Maybe you could talk about what
you're sort of entering into,

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.640
this sort of dialogue as
a publisher of your --

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.490
of your own press meant for you?

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:11.540
&gt;&gt; Carmen Gimenez Smith:
I started Noemi Press

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:15.770
with the intention always of
publishing writers of color

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:20.950 position:56%
and endorsing the work of writers of
color, but also recognizing that --

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.610
and, you know, I started
it in 2002, which was --

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.910
it's like a different -- it's

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:28.130
like a different world
that I'm talking about.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:33.390
And I think culturally coming
from a Latino background,

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.810
a South American -- my parents
are both from South America --

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:40.700
that the role of the poet and the
political body aren't separate,

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.340
that those two things are always
sort of part of the canonical -

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.000
of the canonical work of
Latin American poets on the --

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.850
how politics are always shaping
poetics and/or aesthetics,

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:54.440
and that conversation is ongoing.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:00.050
And my awareness of that was
a big part of my approach.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:06.510 position:56%
But I think when I started Noemi
Press, I also recognized the history

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.510
of publishing and especially the
publishing of the work of people

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.720
of color and realized that
I had a battle to fight

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.110
against being marginalized
as a press who only --

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.750
who only published people of
color, as if that's problematic

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.170
or that ghettoizes the press.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:29.750 position:56%
And so, it's been really interesting
going through the process

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.730
of building a press and publishing
lots of different kinds of books

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.880
and slowing building
I guess a brand,

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:42.110
while watching also the evolution
of what I think the groundwork

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:45.230
that was laid in the '80s
and the early '90s of -

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:50.180
I remember my teachers -- the first
time that I read, for example,

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.480
Glorion's [assumed spelling]
"I'll Deal" [assumed spelling],

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.460
which I think for many women
of color, many people of couple

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.740
such a -- such an enormously
important moment of recognizing

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:07.080
that my sort of complex identity
is completely normal and relevant.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:11.490
So watching subjectivity,
that kind of neutral,

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:15.440
uncontested subjectivity
get contested, the poetics,

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.600
the maybe particularly lyric
subjectivity being contested

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.010
as being this kind of
neutral space in which I'm --

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:27.010
you know, I can have these
kinds of experiences that tend

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:31.360 position:56%
to be inscripted white because of
-- because of the canon, only not --

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.660
there's nothing specifically.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:37.260
It just happens to be that this
enormous body of work that comes

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.030
to represent American poetry just
happened to be when I was coming

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.850
up as a young poet very white.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:48.940
And so -- and so, first of all,
seeing how those early in those --

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:54.900
in the '90s and the early '00s
seeing that groundwork turning

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.350
into legitimate outrage, which I
didn't -- I hoped would happen.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:03.680
I never imagined it would
happen at this scale.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:10.470
And then just also adapting to
the shifting model of publishing,

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.870
and there -- and I think

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.160
that digital printing
also has a big part.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.260 position:56%
I think the technology and the shift

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.270
to digital printing made starting
a small press much easier.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.180
And I think that equalized
the playing field in a way.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.440
You didn't need $5,000 to
print a book of poetry.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.180
You needed $500, $1,000 to print
out a couple -- and people --

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.250
and that gave -- that democratized
I think the industry in a way

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.880
that ended up helping
people of color a lot.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.910 position:56%
So I think what we're seeing now are
just the gains that are built off

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:47.090
of many generations of writers
of color contesting and --

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:52.690 position:56%
contesting the terms of subjectivity
and slowly gaining ground.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:58.100 position:56%
And I think the nomination of Barack
Obama was kind of a tipping point

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:03.400
for all of us because it forced
all of us to confront racism,

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.990 position:56%
some of us in not so wonderful ways.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.290
But I think that it made --

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:12.760
it made us have to deal
with this untouched subject.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.140
And there's no -- I'm going to
echo what everyone's saying.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.350
There's no turning back.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:21.210
And so, I feel like the work
that Noemi is publishing is more

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:26.030
and more engaged critically with
that conversation and also engaged

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.660
with the conversation of -- I
know that there's a conversation

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.180
about gatekeepers that's
really important.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.210
But I think the other
more nuanced part

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:37.570
of the conversation is the
people who are building

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:40.340
and generating aesthetic ideals,

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:44.480 position:56%
that that conversation is also
changing, that there's a wider range

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.320
of participation by different
kinds of people forming aesthetics,

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.590
creating, generating ideas
of what poetry is and can be.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:54.340
And as a publisher, of course
I'm thrilled about that.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.610
And I -- and I -- and I hope
that we are doing a good job

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:58.910
of representing that work.

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:03.550
But I'm just -- I feel like
the millennial generation

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:08.240
of poets are terrifyingly exciting
and are visionary and are the ones

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.550
who are going to change the world.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:16.330
And I guess I feel like the years
that I put in building Noemi Press,

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:19.160
I'm glad that I did that so
that I can provide a forum

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.640
for these very exciting
young writers.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.940
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:29.180 position:56%
I want to just push a little further
on this idea of how poetry fits

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:36.370
into the larger culture, what
it does especially when it comes

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:41.930
to talking about issues when
we're talking about race

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.310
that other forms [inaudible].

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:50.010
I thought it was really
interesting, Evie, when you talking

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.710
about problematizing participation.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.010
And I was struck -- I
was struck too with --

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.650 position:56%
in many of the poems that you read
that all of you the sort of violence

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.950
and beauty and how
they were intertwined

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:57.250
in a way that [inaudible].

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:58.550
I felt you brought the
notion of argument.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:01.480
I mean we're awash
right now as a county

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.020
in these very divisive arguments.

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:10.680
And poetry I think has a way
of both clarifying an argument

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.590
and complicating an
argument at the same time.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:16.580
I was hoping maybe you could talk
about what function poetry serves,

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.360
especially in talking about
issues related to race

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.090 position:56%
that can be so fraught and divisive.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.510
&gt;&gt; Evie Shockley: Well --

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:27.070
[ Laughter ]

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.370
[Inaudible] very important.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.670
I want to hear it.

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:36.680
You know, I appreciate that
question because one of the things

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:44.000 position:56%
that I think that we do when we make
spaces for all of the various kinds

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.480
of voices who are indeed
writing is we sort

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.010
of feed into a larger network.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:57.230
You know, I'm wearing several
hats at this point, a poet,

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:01.230
publisher of poets,
teacher of poets.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:07.820
And when I'm teaching
a class and I have --

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:13.920
even if it's not a poetry of color,
a black poetry class, for example,

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.380
I'm just teaching creative
writing classes.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.680
And I have a wide range
of books that I can go to,

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.280
genres that I can use,
just pull off.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:27.230
And they don't teach my
students something false

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:34.240
about the way American poetry
is being created right now

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.650
and in the past.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:39.870
Then that makes my job as
teacher that much easier.

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:45.030
The kinds of classroom
conversations we can have expands,

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:50.380
and it helps me normalize
for them the --

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.850
this way things are now, right?

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:59.730
And it help -- it enables me to
help bring a generation of people

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:04.850
into writing for whom all
these traditions that make

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:10.730
up American poetry and beyond
are like already theirs

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:15.770
and that they will sort of
be the body of those lessons,

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:21.030
those aesthetics, those
conversations

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:24.470
as they begin their
careers as creators.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.440
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong: I thought Evie
[inaudible] cultural appropriation.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:37.720
You know, I think it's -- I
agree with everyone, but it's --

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.670
you know, it's -- you know,
it's [inaudible] culture

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:44.420
of peoples happening right
now, a lot really great.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.290
But then there's also some
[inaudible] things too,

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.990
as we're seeing in the
national political stage.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:55.640
We're seeing echoes of that also in
the literary stage as well where,

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:01.580
you know, there are, you know, more
voices from different racial groups

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:06.300
and sexualities, gender,
politics, and so forth,

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.490
but that there are also people
like Lionel Shriver, who --

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:17.040
you know, I think there's now
grievances on both sides, right?

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.310
And there are also white writers

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:22.910
who also feel these grievances
[inaudible] cultural appropriation

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:26.900
seems to be keep -- seems
to keep popping up now.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.220
I can also cite the
example of [inaudible].

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:38.050
I don't even remember what his
name was, a guy who pretended

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:39.530
to be a Chinese [inaudible] poetry.

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:45.990
And he seemed to think that
he was now underrepresented,

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.900
or he felt like he was -- you know,

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.800
his identity as a white
man was actually not --

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:56.780
was preventing him from being
published with his work.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:01.610 position:56%
So, you know, so there's identity
politics happening from the white --

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:02.910
you know, not [inaudible] too.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.210 position:56%
And one thing I want to say about
cultural appropriation is that like,

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.580 position:56%
you know, is that if it -- and I
think people have already said this,

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:14.310
is that you can write about
anything you want, you know?

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:18.420
But you also -- it's not
-- it's not like freedom --

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.850
not a question of freedom
of speech or something.

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:23.150
But if someone's criticizing
you, you know,

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:24.450
you're still saying what you want.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.750
You also have to be open
to criticism as well.

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.200
That's all -- you're
getting criticized, you know?

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:31.200 position:56%
People are getting attack -- you
know, people are going to talk back,

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.180
whereas before there wasn't
that talking back, you know?

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.740
And I think a lot of that has
to do with, again, social media

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:40.550
and the Internet, where now,
you know, Twitter is great.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:41.850
You know, people can talk back.

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.100
People of color can talk
back [inaudible] do that.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.770
But that's not suppressing
your rights.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:50.050
You know? One thing that I
will say is that, you know,

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:54.450
it's not just when -- I think it's
important for writers to write

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.130
about their cultures actually.

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:00.890
But I think like with
anything else, it takes --

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:02.660
it's not like can I do it?

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.410
It's how you do it.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:07.960
You know, it's about -- it's
about like having empathy

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.200
and doing the research and having
the patience and really kind

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.500
of really trying to understand.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.670
And that's something that Lionel
Shriver did not seem to get.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.610
And a lot of these
writers don't seem

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.790
to get [inaudible] again
and again and again.

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.060
So.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.190
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: I'm thinking we
should take that issue a bit closer

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:32.330
to home and talk about the role
that white editors and editors

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:36.310
of color face when trying
to develop [inaudible].

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.800
We're addressing race.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.460
I mean I -- we're [inaudible]
my experience with other editors

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.010
in my days at jubilat and
our failure effectively

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:48.670
to publish writers and poets.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.700
In fact, the biggest
change for us, I think,

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:55.500
was not only having Evie and Cathy
as editors but Evie being able

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.120
to access the list of [inaudible].

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.200
But I think there's larger sort
of or deeper issues that writers

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.770
of color and what editors of color
and white editors face in trying

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.450
to do the best possible job

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:11.530
of representing the widest
possible community of poets.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:15.970
I think you can talk about that.

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.290
&gt;&gt; Evie Shockley: I'll say
quickly that I mean one

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:27.490
of the things I think is implied
in your question but that I'd

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:31.660
like to sort of say out
loud is that we're talking

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.350
about publishing poems about race.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:42.300
Part of what is just as important
as publishing poets of color,

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.260
whether they're talking
about race or not, right?

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.560
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong: Yes.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.860
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yes.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:50.750
&gt;&gt; Evie Shockley: And it's -- I
think in some ways it's that moment

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:57.040
that you're able to create enough
of a space in a particular journal

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.640
or publishing a, you know, poetry
series or whatever it might be.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.800
You create enough of a space
where poets don't feel either

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:12.380
like they're -- maybe a politicized
aesthetic around race is unwelcome,

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:17.560
nor that that's the only way that
they can, you know, get in, is by,

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.410
you know, sort of proclaiming
something that's identity-based

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.030
or critique or protest-based.

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.240
That's part of the work that, you
know, that we were trying to do

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.940
and that I know that everyone
up here is trying to do.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.840
And that's what -- that's
what makes the sea change,

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.970
is that you got people
feeling called

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:43.670
by what they are in
the sea [inaudible].

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.740
So the hard part is getting
over that initial tipping point.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:52.420
And that is where you have
to go door to door I think.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:54.850
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: And I'll just
say I think that's true,

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:59.280
the point you raised for editors
of color, that you shouldn't be --

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:05.000
there wasn't -- there wasn't I
think [inaudible] editor previous.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.770
You know, this sense [inaudible]
not promote this as, okay,

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:10.330
now you're an editor of color.

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:12.000
You must only publish
writers of color.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.300
That's why you're here.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.720
That's -- there are those
assumptions of all sides in terms

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.620
of how you have to
negotiate expectations

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.920
for cultural assumptions.

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.200
Don, you want to talk a
little bit about what it's

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.550
like to [inaudible] poetry
and the challenges of that?

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:30.190
&gt;&gt; Don Share: Yeah.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:31.490
Well, I don't know.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:32.790
I don't think about how I feel.

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:34.880
I often think about
how the world is.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.630
I mean going back to what I
think we've all been saying

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:44.240
in not the same ways, but
related ways, if you look around

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.640 position:56%
and your literature, your art, your
music isn't reflecting what you know

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:52.270
to be true, whatever you might --
whoever you might want to vote for,

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:56.110
there's something wrong
with your culture.

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:59.770
And so, I think a lot
of poets that I talk

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:03.070
to about these things actually
didn't set out to write

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:06.230
about terrible things
happening in the news.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.940
But when they happen,
they are called upon.

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.940
And they will say something.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:17.660 position:56%
I think, you know, you know, there's
really no other way to respond

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:26.320 position:56%
to it, other than to sort of measure
poetry against what we know to be,

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:31.150
you know, the feelings and
atmospheres that we all live

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:34.940
and breathe and eat
and walk around in.

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:37.570
I mean -- I mean everybody knows
things, but they don't want to --

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:39.070
you know, there are things that
are hard for people to admit.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:42.500
There are things that are
hard for people to concede.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.990
There are problems
that are hard to --

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:47.360
you know, and failures
that are hard to own up to.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.500
And the poets aren't breaking
the [inaudible] so much.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.270
If they have been called
upon to say things

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:57.530
that maybe haven't been said
before or hadn't been put in front

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:00.400
of an audience before, maybe
they have their own way of saying

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.200
about all these things together.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:08.640 position:56%
But there's a sort of startling
reality about conversations relating

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:15.480
to race that's interesting
to me because my grandparents

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.580
on one side -- great-grandparents
on the other were stateless people

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.960
who came here as immigrants
and didn't speak English,

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:26.110
and I'm the first person in my
family to be called a white person.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:30.870 position:56%
My brother couldn't get into an Ivy
League school because of the quotas.

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:34.300
My father couldn't be a
doctor for the same reason.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.040
And I grew up in a bilingual
household, I mean the whole thing.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:42.120
And my family now has black people,
white people, trans people in it.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.140
I'm an American, about
as ordinary as can be.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:48.100
And when I look around or even
when I hear what's going on,

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.750
it's astounding to me how
much in denial people are

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:54.000
because what is a white person?

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.320
Who are the people who are here,
and where did they come from?

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.620
How did they get here?

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.120
And what did their ancestors do?

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:04.700
So for me, you're just seeing
the shift that say 100,

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.690
125 years ago people assimilated

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:10.790
because it was a dream,
the American dream.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:14.390
You know, now we know more about
this dream and what it means,

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:19.020
day to day, minute to minute
for people who can't access it.

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:21.900
So now we have to think
about our dreams differently.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.040
And that's what we need to
count on the poets to do.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.390
And they're doing it, you know?

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:28.730
So it's not just like
there's a group

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:30.110
and then there's another group.

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:32.210 position:56%
I mean, you know, you run into this.

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:35.810
How do you, you know, want
to start classifying anybody,

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:37.750
whatever the terminology is?

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:40.340
It's very tricky because
in the end it can't be done

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:44.610
without dehumanizing people
or corralling sort of a group

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:47.900
of what are in the end
prejudices or stereotypes

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.970
or sort of group thinking.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:51.710
And I think poetry has figured out.

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:53.830
Like, they have sorted
out a lot of this stuff.

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:57.750
And what we look around the
nation and the world and see is

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:01.230
that our politicians and people
out there haven't got it yet.

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:04.920
They haven't figured out how to
cope with different things yet.

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:09.370
They haven't been able to describe
what it's like to have conflict,

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:12.840
not only to be in conflict and
experience conflict, but to be made

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.550
up of conflictive kinds of
things in your background.

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:20.040
And I think again my belief in
poetry, which I've come by sort

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:23.470 position:56%
of empirically not because I have
some ideology about it or, you know,

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:26.570
fantasy about it, but I think
the reality is, is you can --

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:29.190
these poets that we're
talking about are so good,

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.220
and the world is looking
to us for this.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.980
What we need is for a lot
of people to sort of come

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.830
on board too and figure out how -

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:38.940
you know, what is a
national discussion

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:43.390
or international discussion of
conflict and pain and violence

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:44.870
and equality going to be like?

00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:48.430
And the poets have got
-- are getting at it.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:51.470
But the rest of the culture has
other things operating in it

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:55.000
that make it harder to value
the kind of work that we do.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.340
But I do think that's changing
because I think it's hard

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:03.140
if you're an editor to really see
this, but like Poetry Magazine,

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.030
most of the people who
read it are not poets.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.330
They're not other poets.

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:08.030
You often hear that poetry
is written for other poets.

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:10.730
Most of my readers
are general readers.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:12.430
And they may hate or love

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:15.300
or whatever what they
see, but they get it.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.600
They understand it.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.770
And they're -- there is
resistance, and resistance is good

00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:23.890
because it lays out for us the
work that needs to be done.

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.540
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong: I
think it's [inaudible].

00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:32.890
Like, it's not just a question of
diversity and having more poets.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:34.620
I mean it's not just like, okay,

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:39.030
let's have more poems
that address race.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:42.480
It's also kind of changing
our assumptions

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.920
about what a race poem is or what
a poet of color should write.

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:50.350
And I think that Noemi
Press is really doing it.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:53.220
And I mean that's what we
were trying to do at jubilat.

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:58.340
jubilat is amazing how open
[inaudible] has been transformed.

00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:01.910
But I do think that, you know,

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:05.590
poetry is still very
much an institution

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:07.600
where -- not Poetry Magazine --

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.900
&gt;&gt; Don Share: Right, right, right.

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.200
[ Laughter ]

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.610
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong:
It's [inaudible].

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:12.910
&gt;&gt; Don Share: Yeah.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:16.220
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong: But I think
that it's also important, you know,

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:19.170
to be aware that I still
feel like a gatekeeper,

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:22.270
even though I'm someone of color.

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:23.570 position:56%
I'm still -- I'm still a gatekeeper.

00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:26.020
And that's something
that I acknowledge.

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:29.180
I do think that, you
know, we're thinking

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:31.720
about say prizes and so forth.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.370
And there's still an
expectation on the kind

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:38.200
of race poem that's accepted
versus the kind of race poem

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.970
that either baffles you
or you're just like --

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:44.860
you don't understand it, or it's
a poem that has nothing to do

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.630
with race, but it's
written by a poet of color.

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:51.710
And I think a lot of the problem
is not just having more race poems

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:54.470
in there, but it's also
the fact that a lot

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:57.790
of times you have a
single frame of reference

00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:00.620
for what a race poem should be.

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:06.170
And it's really important to
broaden that frame of reference.

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:09.420
You know, I think [inaudible]
an article where there was like,

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:12.470
you know, I think a lot of
marginalized groups get plagued

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:15.980
by this, where there's always
a simple story, you know,

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.240
which is like the single
immigrant story,

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.490
the single black story,
the single Asian story.

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:24.040
And everyone wants you to
kind of fit in that template.

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:29.610
And I see that happening a lot of
times, where the kind of attention

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:32.540
that the books get is that
they fit that template.

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.760
So it's really important.

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:38.760
So it's not just a -- I think
it's just also just, you know,

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:42.070
broaden not just the
voices, not this --

00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:46.130
the kind of [inaudible] diversity,
but also changing the way we think

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:47.490
about what our assumptions as well.

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:50.390
&gt;&gt; Carmen Gimenez Smith: I
would add too that I think

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:55.280 position:56%
that this historical moment has been
anticipated for many years in terms

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.480
of how we navigate rhetoric.

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.980
And we've become -- as a culture,
we've become so dichotomized

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:04.360
and so convinced of
our own infallibility.

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.850
But poetry demands that
we engage with nuance

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:12.750
and we engage with paradox.

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:15.430
And I think that's just
another really interesting way

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:19.130
in which poetry is
poised to be a place

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:20.710
where these conversations
are inevitable

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:22.660
because we're not writing.

00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:24.120
We're not writing a list of goals,

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:28.280
and we're not writing op ed
positions, which again, you know,

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.080
I remember Deborah Tannen many,
many -- that book -- I don't --

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.510
I don't remember what it's called.

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:34.960
"You Just" -- not "You
Just Don't Understand",

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.020
but I think it was called "The
Argument Culture" I think.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.650 position:56%
And she talked about the experience.

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:42.180
And I'll never forget this
because when I was reading it,

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.530
this was like 15 years ago.

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:46.180
I thought, well, this seems a
little alarmist, where she talked

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:49.910
about how she was invited
to a talk show, and what --

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:52.660
as a linguist, you know, as a
scholar, she expected it to be,

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.080
you know, a conversation.

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:57.370
But it ended up them saying, "We
want you to have this position,

00:58:57.370 --> 00:58:58.880
and then we're going
to bring in this person

00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.970
to have this opposite
reaction to your position."

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:06.530
And that's not -- that's
not a productive way

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:09.750
to approach the world, and it
ends up being a very dangerous way

00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:14.690
to approach the world because most
of us don't live on these ends.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:16.650
Most of us live in the middle.

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:21.010
And so, I think that's
part of the reason

00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:23.820
that poetry is having
this moment right now,

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:26.430
is that there aren't too
many places in the world

00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:31.510
where we can have engaged, complex
conversations about these subjects.

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:35.250
And so, my hope is
-- and I'm, you know,

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:37.380
hearing that your sense
of general audience.

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:41.830
My hope is that poetry
infects all discourses,

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:46.690
and we start having more robust and
complex conversations because I --

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:52.150
these dichotomies terrify me
because they leave most people out,

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:55.900
except people who are shouting
the loudest at either end.

00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:59.800
And that silences a lot of people.

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: I'm going
to open it up to questions.

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.200
Let me just bring the mic to you

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.040
so that we can make sure
[inaudible] question.

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.180
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: Well, the
question that first comes

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:18.960
to my mind is that is
there any time in which any

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:25.420
of us express ourselves either
verbally or with physical movement

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:30.100
or anything else in which
race is not being expressed?

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.320
&gt;&gt; Evie Shockley: I
understand the sort

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.130
of the spirit behind your
question, and I think you're right

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:47.800
that because we live in a society
that's grounded in racial ideology,

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:54.830
was founded on it, could not exist
as we know it without the history

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:59.040 position:56%
that it's based in, in race, racism.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.190
At any point, we are all speaking
from a racialized position

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:08.570
and that it's going
to have an impact.

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:10.450
It's going to inform what
we saw or what we do.

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:18.390
And it's going to inform how people
hear us on the other side, right?

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:24.040
So I think I would point to what
Carmen was saying about a spectrum.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:30.530
I mean there are times
when race is not the thing

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:34.730
that a person is trying to express,
even if they're expressing it

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:40.700
from a position that is located
on a racialized landscape.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:46.980
Maybe the part of what we're
thinking about together then is how

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:54.950
to -- how to ensure that the way
that landscape gets represented

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:59.660
in the journals, in the poetry
that's published, how to make sure

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.870
that landscape is represented
in its fullest.

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:07.080
So I hope that gets
at your question.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.800
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: I will also
say too that to sort of follow

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.570
up on what Cathy was talking about,
I do feel like there are a lot

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:15.250
of poets of color writing poems
that aren't -- that aren't, quote,

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:20.310
unquote, race poems, that
there's a place for that

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.160
in the sort of poetry landscape.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.090
And I think that has
much to do with the --

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:26.670
not only the writers
writing that work,

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:29.040
but the publishers
championing that work.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.340
That's really important.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:38.810 position:56%
It sort of goes to that question
because if we assume that, you know,

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:42.980
an African American writer can
only write about one kind of way

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.760
of seeing true race, it's
a very [inaudible] sort

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.160 position:56%
of [inaudible] thinking and poems
we've discussed kind of problematize

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.840
that in all sorts of wonderful
ways and all sorts of positions.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.140
But they do operate from
an eye that can be kind

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.440
of an empathetic eye too
[inaudible] trained to.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.850
&gt;&gt; Carmen Gimenez Smith: I
think that the other piece

01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:00.820
of that question, which
I think is so important,

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:06.210
is that even when race
doesn't feel --

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:10.460
feels neutral, it's still activated
in any -- in any engagement,

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:14.410
in any conversation, in
any exchange we have.

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:16.260
And it's so pervasive.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.080
It's so pervasive that
we have trained ourselves

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.380
to take it for granted.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:26.490
And as a -- as a poet
and thinking about how --

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:29.270
when let's I -- I'm also a teacher.

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:34.290 position:56%
I teach a person of color, and I get
a sense of a student saying, "Well,

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:38.790
I have no use for this
because this is not my race.

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:40.100
So thank you."

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:44.570
But the reality is that
the same factors that,

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:46.590
even though let's say this
student is saying I'm --

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:50.560
this is a book by a black poet,
and I understand and I sympathize

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.950
and I feel the pain and suffering,

01:03:54.950 --> 01:04:01.740
that in fact this same exact system
that's oppressing the black writer

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:05.460
writing about their question is
also oppressing this white person.

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.470
They just aren't aware of it.

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:11.920
They're just not aware that this
is a very huge system designed

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.440
to occlude the class
discrepancies that are growing

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.950
in the United States and the
ways in which our participation

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:23.880 position:56%
and horizontal oppression keep those

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.160
with really the most
money in control.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:34.400
And so, I think that race
that we participate in,

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.190
race's role as a straw
man discussion,

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:42.160
when really it's economic and
equities that's keeping us --

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.710
that's keeping us in many of
these problematic positions.

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:51.700
And so, I think that reading
all texts and through the lens

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:56.340
of race is useful now,
regardless of who's writing them,

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:01.290
because race is this huge
edifice that's -- I don't know.

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:02.970 position:56%
I think that it's -- I think it's --

01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:06.080
I think we're looking
at the wrong thing,

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.960
even though race is really
relevant and important, and it's --

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.060
and it's sort of inexcusable
not to be thinking about it.

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:15.840
I also think that there are many
layers to how we navigate it.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:19.260
And class is a much bigger,
much more potent one.

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.440
And we're working against
each other.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.070
We're really fighting against each
other when there's a much larger,

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:28.440
more ominous and dangerous force
that's working to oppress us.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.340
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I was
teaching [inaudible].

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:43.310 position:56%
There's a quote from [inaudible]
and I wanted to [inaudible] response

01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:55.300
about the evolution
of the race poem.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.780
The quote is, "The
universal is a fantasy.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.540
But we are captive,
still, to a sensibility

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:05.030
that champions the universal
while simultaneously defining the

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:07.160
universal, still, as white.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.180
We are captive, still, to a
style of championing literature

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:13.020
that says work by writers
of color succeeds

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:16.490
when a white person can
nevertheless relate to it --

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:19.600
that it 'transcends' its category."

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:25.410
And thinking about the race is
[inaudible] we are changing appears

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:27.810
how it's viewed [inaudible].

01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:35.790
The sensibility of leaders
is just not [inaudible].

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:42.350
&gt;&gt; Cathy Park Hong: Well,

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:44.200
I think the white reader's
sensibility will evolve.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.410
It's just through his
culture, you know?

01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:49.650
And this is something that
we as editors are doing

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:52.920
and what I'm trying to do and
what everyone else is doing.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:58.930 position:56%
And I think that before there
wasn't -- there was, as we all said,

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:05.540
just a lot -- a lot less poets of
color, you know, being published.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.840
Now there are more.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:09.550
And so, it becomes that.

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:15.640 position:56%
I think in terms of the evolution
of the race poem, what I am starting

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.960
to see I think, you know,

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.500
part of the growing pains that's
happening now is that, you know,

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.160
with the taking also
of the US Census

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.370
and the American demographic
changing,

01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:30.250
the white American is slowly
realizing that they are --

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:34.400
white is not the universal
category, racial category,

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.160 position:56%
which is very obvious that it's not.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.140
We're only now really
becoming aware of that.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:45.700
And it's also the way the
race poem can also evolve,

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.940
is how a poem by a white
poet is acknowledged

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.580
as a race poem, you know?

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:53.080
And I am also interested
in that as well.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:59.760
Like, for instance, a
lot of the criticism

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.750
about the way we teach
[inaudible], you know,

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:09.350
writer or even an American
writer or, you know,

01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:10.980
black writers [inaudible].

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:14.450
What is this poem about?

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:17.330
What does this poem say
about this demographic

01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:19.880
or this short story
rather than [inaudible]?

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.290
And it's -- of course, we
have to expand and look

01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:25.840
at that poem [inaudible].

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.990
But I'm also interested
actually in turning the table.

01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:32.840
I mean like, okay, here is
a poem by say, for instance,

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.140
Tori Graham [assumed spelling].

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.440
How is this a white poem?

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.700
What does this say sociologically
about white people, you know?

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.590
And I think that's also in certain
ways we're going to acknowledge

01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:45.280
that whiteness is actually
a category rather

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.110
than the universal is to
also kind of look at --

01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:52.130
is to also look at what -- which is
what I think [inaudible] is doing.

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:58.210
And her textbook is a book
on whiteness, you know?

01:08:58.210 --> 01:08:59.510
So, yeah.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.810
&gt;&gt; Don Share: Something
in the first part

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:02.530
of what you're quoting goes back

01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:04.890
to what William Empson
said many decades ago,

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:09.640
which is that the purpose in a
way of imaginative literature is

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.510
to put people in touch with
people whose values are different

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:14.810
from ours.

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:16.110
In other words, this idea

01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:19.600
of the universal is just really
dangerous along the lines

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.650
that you've all described so well.

01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:23.720
But in terms of teaching,
it's important too

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.430
because I think we see this a lot,

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:27.900
this thing that poetry's
good for you.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:31.770
It's -- we see every day hot
takes in the media about how

01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:33.510
if you read you get
empathy and all this stuff.

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:35.790
But I think we sort of
know it's not really true,

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:39.120
or we wouldn't be living in
the world that we're living in.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.630
But on the other hand, this fear
of difference, whatever it is

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:49.400
or constitutes or however it can be
described, is something that seems

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:53.150
to make people very touchy,
and they do terrible things.

01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:56.410
But I think what poetry is
going to do in a way, again,

01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:59.240
that's been described already
is put the different ways

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.150 position:56%
of describing this out there so that
people start to have a handle on it,

01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:08.350
how they imagine what it's like
to be somebody who's in this kind

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:11.270
of constellation of circumstances.

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:12.840
But they didn't know that before.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.770
So you can see poetry doing that.

01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:16.140
The audiences are change --

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:19.510
the audience for poetry is
changing, which is really great.

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:24.120
And I think more importantly our
way of teaching not just poetry

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.360
but many things has
to somehow change.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.330
And our civic culture,
which has to educate people,

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:31.280
and our politics has to change too.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.870
It's kind of a tall
order, but it can be done.

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:39.870
And I mean whether or not it
can be done, it has to be done.

01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:43.160
&gt;&gt; Evie Shockley: Oh, just really
quickly, I think I'm agreeing

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.280
with something you were saying,
but I really wanted to bring

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:51.100
out the aspect of audience
because there's a way that parts

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:56.770
of this discussion have
unfolded with a sort

01:10:56.770 --> 01:11:01.720
of de facto white audience
I think in mind.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.530
And the audience for poetry
had always been as diverse

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:11.440
as the audience for writers
of poetry and as America.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:17.650
And it's the prefaces of
Noemi, you know, publishers,

01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:23.700
independent from within different
groups who've been the conduits

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:29.450
for writers of color to write
to audiences of color for many,

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:34.250
many years, decades, a century.

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:39.700
It's the kind of finding a way
to bring not just the writers

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:43.990
but also the audiences together
that I think opens up a lot.

01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:46.920
And that's what I think
we're all involved.

01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:52.310
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: [Inaudible].

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:59.100
Do you as a publisher think and
explore about the difference

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.310
of the [inaudible] between
Latinos and Latin Americans?

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carmen Gimenez Smith: Absolutely.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.690
And I mean we also
publish translation,

01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:12.850
a lot of Spanish-speaking poetries.

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:18.210
And my -- and my culture, my
background is -- I can't escape it.

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:20.570 position:56%
I can't sort of exist outside of it.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:23.320
And so, it absolutely
informs my ethos

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.330
and my politics as
a -- as a publisher.

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:31.870
And -- but with that in
mind, I love the new.

01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:36.050
I love the transgressive.

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:39.940
And again, I would say that I
feel like this new generation

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:43.530
of poets are writing
the most exciting stuff

01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:45.350
about race and identity.

01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:50.600
And so, while I like -- I do --

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.180
I guess it's complicated because
I'm -- right now, I'm editing --

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.910 position:56%
I'm doing some translation of the --

01:12:55.910 --> 01:13:00.910 position:56%
of a countercultural movement in
Peru called Globaca, which was borne

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:05.950
of the '80s of the kind of
martial law that was instituted

01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:11.720
by President Fujimori at the
time, and I just see so much --

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:17.390
I also just see so much
similarity between some of the kind

01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:20.410
of political turmoil
that's taking place

01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:23.260
in late 20th century
Latin America and then --

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:27.110
and then contemporary
American politics

01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:30.760
that the increasing
disparity between classes

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:36.250
that the horizontal
oppression, the dissatisfaction

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:39.970
with politics and the government.

01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:44.720
So, you know, I feel like
we're moving into this chapter

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.130
in which we're becoming more
like the rest of the Americas.

01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:51.290
And as a -- as a Latina, as a
woman of South American descent,

01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:53.280
that's really, really
interesting to me.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.990
And I'm paying attention
to what I know

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:59.980
about South American
political and literary history.

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.740
I'm just paying attention to
see what things kind of crop

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:05.260
up that seem similar as well.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.560
And it's kind of surprising.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.740
You probably a similar
experience being a translator.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.040
&gt;&gt; Don Share: Yeah.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.340
Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.640
I mean it's funny, isn't it?

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.380
It's like American culture
is finally sort of kicking

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.670
and screaming, being brought
into its world citizenship,

01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:22.210
something to which our
history has sort of --

01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:23.510
&gt;&gt; Carmen Gimenez Smith: Yes.

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:24.810
&gt;&gt; Don Share: You know?

01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:26.110
Sort of stuck us there,
and what we do

01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:27.850
with it is something you
read about in the news.

01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:33.270
But it's almost like our -- you
know, our existence as a group

01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:38.000
of people coming from all kinds of
different places at every moment.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.140
It's the movements and migrations
of people in the world that are

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.200
at its peak in recorded history.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.340
Never before have so many
people been forced to move all

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:53.080
over the place that in a
way now it's like we're --

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.980
even just that we're
able to have or need

01:14:54.980 --> 01:15:00.380
to have this discussion shows
you that change is happening

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.260
and that it's a -- that
it's a healthy thing.

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.000
But there's a lot of -- you pointed

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.160
out specifically danger
in it and invidiousness.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:14.070
And, you know, I think that that
is just the price you pay for kind

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:18.020
of awakening people with language.

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:19.680
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Well, and
thankfully, poetry is there

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.060
to help us navigate,
as you discussed.

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.340
Thanks to all four
of our poet editors,

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.280
and thanks to all of
you for coming out.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.100
There are books in the back
by all of our presenters.

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.520
So please buy some books.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.820
Get them signed.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:39.640
Also, you should see a
survey form near you.

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.980
Please do fill it out.

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.120
We use these surveys to
determine how we do our programs

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.420
going forward.

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.720
So we'd love to get your input.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.020
You can give it to me.

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:49.790
You can leave it on the table.

01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:54.580
And we hope to see you Thursday
at 6:30 for Law of Literature

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:59.670 position:56%
with Monica Youn here at the Library
or for events coming forward --

01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:01.900
coming -- happening in
the future this season.

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.700
So thanks again for coming up.

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.070
[ Applause ]

01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:10.730
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
