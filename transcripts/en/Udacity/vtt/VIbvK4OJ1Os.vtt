[Dave] Welcome back for Unit 2!

00:00:02.012 --> 00:00:04.379
I hope everyone is getting confidence in the things you learned in unit 1.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.429
We're going to continue to build on those in this unit as well as in rest of the course.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.845
Our main goal for this unit is to make the web crawler, instead of just finding one link in the page,

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.878
to find all the links on a page,

00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:18.163
so that we can follow these links and collect more and more pages on the web.

00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:21.111
To do that we need two big new concepts in computer science.

00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:26.313
The first is procedures. Procedures are a way to package code so that we can reuse it more easily.

00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:32.929
The second is control. We need a way to be able to make decisions, and to do repetition, to find all those links on a page.

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:38.896
What we saw at the end of Unit 1 was a way to extract the first URL from a web page--

00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:42.063
that's great--we could find the first target.

00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:43.829
But if we want to build a good crawler,

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.313
we don't just care about the first one,

00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:47.762
we care about all of the links on the page.

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:49.662
We need to extract all of those links--

00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:51.945
figure out where all of those links point to--

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:55.147
so we'll find many more pages to crawl than just the first one.

00:00:55.147 --> 00:00:58.095
So, that's the goal for this class as far as building a web browser.

00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:01.480
To do that, we're going to learn two really big ideas in computer science.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.695
The first is about procedures,

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:06.579
and that's a way to package up code so we can use it

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.445
in a much more useful way than we could before.

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:11.345
The second is about control.

00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:14.445
Control structures will give us a way to keep going

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:16.612
to find all the links on a page.

00:01:16.612 --> 00:01:20.394
So, let's remember the code we had at the end of Unit 1.

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:24.112
We solved this problem of extracting the first URL from the page--

00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:28.512
we assumed the page was initialized to the contents of some web page.

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:31.112
We initialized the variable "start_link"

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:34.612
to the result of invoking "find" on "page,"

00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:37.796
passing in the start of the link tag.

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:40.362
Then, we initialized the variable "start_quote"

00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:43.545
to the result of finding, in the page,

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:47.211
the first quote following that link tag.

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.946
Then, we initialized the variable "end_quote"

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:53.112
to the result of invoking "find" on "page,"

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.762
to find the first quote following the start quote.

00:01:56.762 --> 00:01:58.929
And, then, we assigned to the variable "url"--

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.045
extracting from the page--

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:03.396
from the character after the "start_quote,"

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:06.112
to the character just before the "end_quote,"

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:08.961
we could print out that URL.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.161
This worked to find the first URL on the page.

00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:15.029
If we wanted to find the second one,

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.529
we could do it all again.

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.262
We could say, now we want to advance

00:02:20.262 --> 00:02:23.629
so we're only looking at the rest of the page.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.578
We could do that by updating the variable "page,"

00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:33.329
assigning to it the result of the rest of the page, starting from "end_quote"--

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.146
and, remember, when there's a blank after the colon

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:40.046
that means select from this position, to the very end--

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:41.778
and then we can do all the same stuff.

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:45.731
We'll do "start_link" again; ...

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:55.444
we'll do "start_quote" again; ...

00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:58.063
Now we've got code that's going to print out the first URL--

00:02:58.063 --> 00:03:00.579
keep going, updating the variable "page"--

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.094
and then doing the exact same thing--

00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:03.879
printing out the second URL.

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.612
If we wanted to print out the first three,

00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:27.563
we could do it again...

00:03:27.563 --> 00:03:31.746
So now, we've got code to print out the first three

00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:32.995
URL's on the page--

00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:35.029
let's scroll all the way up--so you've got--

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:39.829
print out the first one--keep going--

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.445
print out the second one--keep going--

00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:46.879
so this can go on forever.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.744
The reason we have computers

00:03:49.744 --> 00:03:52.730
is to save humans from doing lots of tedious work.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.812
We don't want to make humans do lots of tedious work--

00:03:54.812 --> 00:03:57.829
certainly, typing this out, over and over again,

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.594
would be really tedious,

00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:01.646
and it wouldn't really even work that well.

00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:03.695
We have pages with hundreds of links,

00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:07.045
but there are other pages with only one or two links.

00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:09.711
So, it wouldn't make sense to copy this hundreds of times.

00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:12.045
There's always going to be some web page that has more links

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:13.813
than we have copies of it--

00:04:13.813 --> 00:04:16.777
and any page that has fewer copies, we're going to run into problems

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:20.978
because we're not going to be finding any of those links.

00:04:20.978 --> 00:04:24.979
So, our goal today is to solve all of those problems.
