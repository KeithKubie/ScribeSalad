00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.380
Let's review everything we've
done in the last few videos

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.710
and then take it a few
steps from there.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.910
So let's say we have a reality
that right now-- and this

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.870
isn't the actual exchange rate,
but I'm just using these

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.720
numbers because they're nice
simple numbers-- the current

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.320
exchange rate is 10
yuan per U.S. $1.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.540
And now we're in a reality where
the Chinese Government,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.360
the Chinese Central Bank,
wants to keep this

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.950
[? PEG'd, ?]

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.840
so it wants to lock this.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.390
It wants to lock this exchange
rate right over here.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.660
But the reality is, more is
being sold to the U.S., more

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.860
is being exported from China
to the U.S. than

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.310
the other way around.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.530
And so that leads to this
weird dynamic that we've

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.700
studied in the last
few videos.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.910
So this is China right here, and
then you have the United

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.010
States right over here.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.700
And let's say at this exchange
rate right over here, you have

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.392
goods coming from China to the
U.S. Actually, let me do it in

00:01:10.392 --> 00:01:11.480
that same magenta color.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:22.680
So these are Chinese goods,
and then we are paying for

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.190
those Chinese goods in dollars
and those dollars are being

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.440
sent to China.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.240
So let's say we pay in
this time period.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.110
Let's say it's a year.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:52.190
Let's say that $100 sent to
China for the goods, and this

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.570
is really just a summary
of what we saw in

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.800
the last few videos.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.810
And let's say, on the other side
of this equation, some

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.980
goods are sent from
the U.S. to China.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:08.800
Some are exported, so U.S. goods
are exported to China,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.340
and then we sell them in China
and then we get some yuan in

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.760
return that go back to
the United States.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.690
And, of course, the reality is
that the money seldom is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.110
actually sitting on a ship
going across the Pacific.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.160
It's all in these bank accounts
that can be wired

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160
back and forth.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.190
The actual exchanges are
essentially happening on the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.180
internet, not really in any
physical location, but this is

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.950
a good way to visualize it.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.560
So the U.S. goods are being
sold in China and then the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.100
U.S. producer is going
to get yuan.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.170
And let's say for their goods,
they get 500 yuan.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.650
So if all of these people were
just convert, and you actually

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.400
don't know what the equilibrium
price would be,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.210
because the demand changes
depending on what the price is

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.850
in each of the countries, but
if you really wanted to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.320
convert these $100 that the
Chinese producer gets into

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.600
yuan at 10:1, you would need--
so we're going to assume that

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.670
this PEG is what at least the
Chinese Government wants.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:18.370
So you would need 1,000 yuan in
order to convert all of his

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.450
$100 at 10 yuan per dollar.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.520
Now this producer, the U.S.
producer, only has-- let me do

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.400
it in a different color and I
should put the quotes around

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.730
needs, not around the yuan.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:46.820
Now this U.S. producer only has
500 yuan to convert into

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.810
dollars, and we've seen
this multiple times.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.690
But I really want to reinforce
it about how these currencies

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.990
would fluctuate.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.940
The demand for yuan is much
higher than supply for yuan.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.830
And we could do the exact same
argument for the dollar, that

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.960
the demand for dollars
is much lower than

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.680
the supply for dollars.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.070
At this exchange rate, if we
assumed a PEG, this would only

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.660
be $50 that we need to convert
into, while there's $100 of

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.590
actual supply.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.990
But let's just focus
on the yuan.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.649
They need 1,000 yuan at
this exchange rate.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.900
There's only 1,000 yuan that can
be converted into dollars.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.850
And if we had a floating
exchange rate, that would

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.750
increase the demand for yuan,
and then this number would go

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.150
down, or another way to view
it, either that number goes

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.030
down or this number
over here goes up.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.830
You could say the yuan would
become more expensive, which

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.590
means maybe it's 9 yuan per
dollar or 8 yuan per dollar,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.550
or it could go the other way.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.330
For 10 yuan, instead of $1,
you'd get $1.10 or $1.20 or

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.550
$1.30, either way.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.810
Now, in order for this lock and
for this PEG to occur, we

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.960
saw in the last video that
the Chinese Central

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.210
Bank needs to intervene.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.760
Remember, where are the
excess dollars?

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760
They're over here.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.490
Let me make it clear.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.420
There's $100 over here
that need to be

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.470
converted into yuan.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:21.410
We have 500 yuan over here that
needs to be converted

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.820
into dollars.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.080
Now, the Chinese government
wants this $100 to be

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.670
converted into 1,000 yuan.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:36.900
So what he does or what they
do is they say, OK, $50 of

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.530
this $100 dollars can be
essentially traded

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.040
for these 500 yuan.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.280
Let me draw a two-way arrow
there. $50 goes to the

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.990
American producer and then the
500 yuan go to the Chinese

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.350
producer in exchange
for that $50.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.570
Obviously, this isn't
coordinated.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.600
It's not like matchmaking.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.240
It's not like someone
said, hey, you give

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.180
this money to them.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.400
But essentially, there will only
be $50 to convert into

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:15.660
the yuan and then the other
$50 will go to the Chinese

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.910
Central Bank.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:31.340
Let me draw the Chinese Central
Bank, and they will

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.530
just print yuan and give
another 500 yuan.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.610
And this is exactly what
happened in the last video.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.040
I drew it a little
bit different.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.080
All I'm showing is to make up
for the lack of supply of

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.730
yuan, they needed 1,000
yuan, there's

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.150
only 500 yuan to convert.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.290
In order to make that up, the
Chinese Central Government

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.670
prints the extra Chinese
currency and buys

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.580
dollars with it.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.580
So it's essentially sucking up
the excess dollars, right?

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.330
This was excess dollars right
over here so that the dollar

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.330
does not weaken.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:20.570
It is sucking up extra dollars
so that the supply for dollars

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.280
isn't so high that it weakens
or so that the yuan

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.870
strengthens.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.240
And so that's the way
the Chinese can

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.660
maintain the trade imbalance.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.820
They could continue to
export more goods

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.730
than they are importing.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.340
Now, what is the effect
of this, though?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.060
And we saw this.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.130
In order to maintain this
currency PEG while there is

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.090
this trade imbalance, the
Chinese Central Bank keeps

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.695
printing yuan and they keep
accumulating dollars.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.540
And if they ever stop
accumulating dollars, so it's

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.590
not like they can just hold the
dollars they have and the

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.216
PEG will hold.

00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:57.970
If they ever stop accumulating
dollars, then the PEG will

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:58.400
break down.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.240
They have to do this
every time period.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.840
They have to actively
participate in the market

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.490
printing yuan and
buying dollars.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.280
They are doing it every day
to maintain the PEG.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.020
Not every day, maybe sometimes
when it won't fluctuate on

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.910
their own, but if the yuan is
getting expensive, they

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.270
actually maintain a range, and
they will buy dollars.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.110
So they're just accumulating
more and

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.400
more of these dollars.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.290
And now this is where
it gets interesting.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:24.190
What does the Chinese Central
Bank do with that cash?

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.450
Now, like anybody,
cash is useless.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.310
You're not getting any
interest on it.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.430
It's just paper.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.900
It allows you to buy other
things that could give you

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.130
some income or could give
you some value.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.520
So what the Chinese Central
Bank does, it doesn't hold

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.510
actual dollar bills.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.710
It goes and tries to buy
the safest U.S.-

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.790
denominated asset it can.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.715
And another thing, not only does
it care about safety-- so

00:08:51.715 --> 00:08:54.520
it wants to go to
a safe asset.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:00.690
It wants to go to the safe
dollar-denominated asset,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.450
which means that you would buy
it in dollars, and if it

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.345
produces interest, the interest
would be in dollars.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.070
And it's also doing this on a
massive, massive scale, in the

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.700
hundreds of billions of dollars,
and actually the

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.630
Reserve is in the trillions
of dollars, so it's

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.860
on a massive scale.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.490
So they can't just go buy a
random company's stock, one

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.840
that won't be safe, but also
they would just drive the

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.410
price up to infinity if they
used this many dollars.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:35.800
So it has to be a very liquid
asset, one that has a very

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.660
deep market where the people
trading in that market, it

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.890
really is in the tens
and hundreds

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.510
of billions of dollars.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.730
And there's really only one
asset that meets those

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.445
requirements, and that's
U.S. Treasuries.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.850
And this isn't the only thing
they will do, but this is the

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.700
great majority.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.140
So what the Chinese Central Bank
does with all of these

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.340
excess dollars, it essentially
buys U.S. Treasuries.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.120
So it gives the dollars away.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.910
Well, not gives away, it sends
the dollars to the people who

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.570
are holding the U.S. Treasuries,
and then it gets

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:12.930
U.S. Treasuries in return.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.280
Now, as a bit of review, and
I've done a few videos on

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.860
this, what are U.S.
Treasuries?

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:29.010
U.S. Treasury bills and bonds
are loans to the Federal

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.090
Government.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.080
So that's maybe how you
should view it.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.985
These are loans to the
Federal Government.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.710
These bonds, these Treasury
bonds or these treasury bills

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.010
that they're getting, these
certificates, are

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:56.780
essentially-- in fact, they
are-- IOUs from the U.S.A, not

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.400
to get cheesy with the acronyms.
These are literally

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.770
IOUs from the U.S. Government,
and the U.S. Government will

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.480
pay interest. They are
essentially-- so just to make

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.220
it all clear of what's going
on, they're printing money.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.190
They're accumulating dollars.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.870
They're using those dollars to
go out into either the open

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.250
market or even directly from
the Treasury, from the U.S.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.805
Treasury, and they are buying
U.S. Treasuries, which

00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:28.910
essentially means that they are
lending this money to the

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.160
U.S. Government.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.110
Now, I'll leave you there in
this video, and maybe you want

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.350
to think about it a little
bit before you even

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.350
watch the next one.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.520
But in the next one, we'll talk
a little bit about what

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.280
that even means.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.200
What happens if you have this
big holder of U.S. dollars,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.110
this huge holder of U.S. dollars
going out there and

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.980
buying Treasuries and being
willing to lend money to the

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:57.850
U.S. Government?

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.480
Think about it.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.840
And in particular, think about
what would happen to interest

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.240
rates and what those low
interest rates' impact would

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.670
have on the rest of
the U.S. economy

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.660
and on debt in general.
