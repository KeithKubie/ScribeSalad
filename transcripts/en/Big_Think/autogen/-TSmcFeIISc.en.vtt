than the FBI filing system which you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
than the FBI filing system which you
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.469
than the FBI filing system which you
couldn't have gotten in there and if you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
couldn't have gotten in there and if you
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.639
couldn't have gotten in there and if you
did get in there there were no Xerox

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
did get in there there were no Xerox
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.870
did get in there there were no Xerox
machines and there's certainly no thumb

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
machines and there's certainly no thumb
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.300
machines and there's certainly no thumb
drives so the fact that you know that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310
drives so the fact that you know that
 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310
drives so the fact that you know that
all this data that actually ended up in

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
all this data that actually ended up in

know a cd-rom or on little thumb drives
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300
know a cd-rom or on little thumb drives
would have been impossible back in the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
would have been impossible back in the
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.100
would have been impossible back in the
50s so that was actually more secure

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
50s so that was actually more secure
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.260
50s so that was actually more secure
even though it's much less accessible so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
even though it's much less accessible so
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.940
even though it's much less accessible so
the page has this wonderful sort of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
the page has this wonderful sort of
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.010
the page has this wonderful sort of
echoes back and forth through technology

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
echoes back and forth through technology
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.809
echoes back and forth through technology
and space and time and politics and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
