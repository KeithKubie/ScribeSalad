00:00:00.588 --> 00:00:01.989
- [Voiceover] Aluminum
metal can be recycled

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:03.309
from scrap metal by melting the

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:06.288
metal to evaporate impurities.

00:00:06.288 --> 00:00:08.988
Calculate the amount of
head needed to purify 1.00

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:13.068
mole of aluminum originally
at 298 kelvin by melting it.

00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:17.108
The melting point of
aluminum is 933 kelvin.

00:00:17.108 --> 00:00:19.408
The molar heat capacity of aluminum is

00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:21.808
24 joules per mole kelvin.

00:00:21.808 --> 00:00:24.268
And the heat of fusion of aluminum

00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:27.468
is 10.7 kilojoules per mole.

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:30.426
Alright, so we didn't think
about the heat they'd need to

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:33.425
raise its temperature from 298 kelvin

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:36.505
we raise the temperature of
this one mole of aluminum

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:40.535
from 298 kelvin to 933 kelvin,

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:41.485
and we're going to do that by looking

00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:43.425
at the molar heat capacity.

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:45.565
And then we're going to add to that

00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:47.385
the heat of fusion, the heat necessary

00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:49.585
to actually melt it.

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:50.973
So let's do that in steps,

00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:54.723
so heat needed

00:00:54.723 --> 00:00:59.723
heat needed to raise

00:00:59.863 --> 00:01:03.213
temperature

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:05.893
by how much are we raising the

00:01:05.893 --> 00:01:06.943
temperature by?

00:01:06.943 --> 00:01:09.386
We went from 298 to 933,

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:11.323
so if we raise it by two we get 300

00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:14.624
and then you have to
raise it by another 633.

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:16.263
So that's going to be,
so we're raising our

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:20.683
temperature by 635 kelvin.

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:23.024
That's to get us to the melting point.

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:26.103
So the heat needed to raise
temperature by 635 kelvin.

00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:30.939
Well, we have one mole

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.959
one mole of aluminum

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.349
I can write 1.00, so we can
have two significant digits,

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:38.101
or three significant digits there.

00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.021
One mole of aluminum times the specific

00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:44.301
or the molar heat capacity I should say.

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:48.201
So 24 joules per mole

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:51.451
per mole kelvin

00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:53.631
times, so this right
over here would be the

00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:55.961
amount of heat to raise it by one kelvin

00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:59.417
but now lets multiply by, we
have to raise it by 635 kelvin

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:03.044
635 kelvin

00:02:03.044 --> 00:02:05.457
And the units work out,
moles cancel with moles.

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:10.457
Kelvin cancels with
kelvin, and then we get to

00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:15.555
let's see let me get
my calculator out here.

00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:19.143
So 24 times 635

00:02:19.143 --> 00:02:23.413
is equal to 15,240.

00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:26.393
and we're taking the
product of a bunch of stuff

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:28.493
three significant figures,
two significant figures

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:32.133
three significant figures,
so we should write only

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:36.033
two significant figures
we'll round to 15,000 joules.

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:42.533
So this is going to be 15,000 joules

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.033
temperature to 933 kelvin.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:50.033
And then we have the heat of fusion

00:02:50.773 --> 00:02:55.773
heat to melt once at melting point.

00:02:56.833 --> 00:03:00.053
Melting point.

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:04.952
Well that is going to be 1.00 mole

00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:09.702
1.00 mole times the heat of fusion.

00:03:09.702 --> 00:03:13.590
times 10.7 kilojoules

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.770
kilojoules per mole.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.130
So this is going to
give us 10.7 kilojoules

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.830
or if we want to write it in joules,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.720
so this is 10.7 kilojoules

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.530
which is equal to 10,700 joules.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.911
And so the total is going
to be the sum of these

00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:40.110
so we could say it is
25,700, but we only have

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.790
two significant figures
here so we could round that

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.790
so we could say 26,000 joules or

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.310
I guess we could write 26 kilojoules.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.330
Alright, now part B.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.430
Part B.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.070
The equation for the overall
process of extracting

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.070
aluminum from aluminum oxide
is shown below, alright?

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:10.623
Which requires less energy,
recycling existing aluminum

00:04:10.623 --> 00:04:13.983
or extracting aluminum
from aluminum oxide?

00:04:13.983 --> 00:04:17.733
Justify your answer with a calculation.

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:22.162
Alright, so this reaction right over here

00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:26.902
and this gives us the
heat necessary for a mole

00:04:26.902 --> 00:04:30.202
of the reaction, so if you
get a mole of aluminum oxide

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:32.782
you put in this much heat, you're going

00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:36.142
to get 2.00 moles of aluminum and

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:39.442
1.5 moles of molecular oxygen.

00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:44.442
So the equation for the overall

00:04:44.912 --> 00:04:49.912
so to extract 1.00 mole

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.199
1.00 mole of aluminum

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.199
from aluminum oxide requires

00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:05.119
so this much heat will produce 2.00 moles.

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:07.218
So to do 1.00 mole you just
have to have half of that.

00:05:07.218 --> 00:05:12.218
Requires 1,675 kilojoules divided by two.

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.919
So this is going to be
1,675 divided by two

00:05:19.258 --> 00:05:24.258
is equal to, let's see
it's going to be 837.5.

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:30.258
837.5

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:34.598
837.5 kilojoules, yep that's half here.

00:05:34.598 --> 00:05:35.718
and I had four significant digits here

00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:38.397
and I still have four significant digits.

00:05:38.397 --> 00:05:40.417
Extracting, doing it from,

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:42.598
which requires less recycling existing

00:05:42.598 --> 00:05:44.218
aluminum or extracting it?

00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:48.632
Well to recycle

00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:53.762
1.00 mole requires

00:05:54.853 --> 00:05:57.033
we just figured out, 26 kilojoules.

00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:58.033
26 kilojoules.

00:05:58.033 --> 00:06:01.343
Everything here is in kilojoules,

00:06:01.343 --> 00:06:05.793
which is much less energy.

00:06:05.793 --> 00:06:09.483
Which is much less energy.

00:06:12.553 --> 00:06:14.283
And we are done.
