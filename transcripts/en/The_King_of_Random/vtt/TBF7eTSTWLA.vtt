Whats up my friends of youtube

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.580
Grant jumping in here with a subscriber appreciation

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.440
I picked up a Galaxy S9 plus smartphone that I am going to give one of you.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.820
Link's in the description, go put your name on the list and I'll see you around

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.540
Hey Guys! We're back in the kitchen and if you are a long time fan of The King of Random

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.660
You may recognize the clear glue and Borax that Grant used to make Ninja Turtle Ooze

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.900
several years ago. Today we're going to be mixing up a few batches of that and as an added twist, we're going to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.020
see if we can make it Glow in the Dark

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.520
using the fluid from Glow Sticks. We've got clear glue and we've got Borax and we've got about 30 glow sticks that

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.400
we are going to tear open and extract the fluid out of and see if we can make a glowing, gooey ooze.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.620
The first step is going to be opening all of these glow sticks and separating out the activator fluid and the dye fluid into individual bowls.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:57.300
the reason we've got our glow sticks separated like this is because we're going to try to get five different colors of our glowing ooze. a red, an orange, a yellow-ish green, a fairly blue, and something of a purple.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:18.860
(royalty free music)

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.240
With all 5 colors of our glow stick fluid separated, it's time

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.200
to mix up five batches of our ooze recipe. To do that we take one cup of water mixed with

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.900
one half teaspoon of Borax

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.100
and then in a separate bowl we have

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.840
one half cup of water mixed with five ounces of this clear school glue.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.979
once we have all those ready

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.649
We'll add the separate components of the glow stick fluid into the two halves and then once we mix them together

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.889
hopefully we get an amazing glowing ooze.

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.500
(royalty free music)

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.980
Now that we have our five separated halves of our ooze recipe, let's add the separated halves of the glow stick fluid into them

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.520
We'll put all of the dye in the side with the borax

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.000
and we'll put all of the activator in the side with the glue.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.900
That's interesting, it's turning a very milky white.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:20.440
The dye doesn't seem like it's really mixing in at all though, it's kind of just getting mixed around, but not combining. We'll see if this will work, maybe it will just stay separated out more than we want it to.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.120
Hitting each of these with a black light we can see the color that they are going to fluoresce if everything goes to plan.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:46.100
We've got a bright red-ish pink, a nice highlighter orange, a very vibrant yellow, a nice Avatar glowing blue, and a sort of purple-ish pink

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.440
it's not violet per say but it definitely has a purple-ish tinge to it.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.080
This is the moment of truth, we have to see two things, one, if the two sides of the glow fluid will combine and start

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:09.320
putting off light the way we hope it will, and two, it's also possible the glow fluid itself will prohibit the reaction that normally turns into the ooze and we're hoping that's not going to happen

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.640
but let's find out!

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:19.660
We'll start down here at the pink or magenta end, and we'll hope there is enough space in these bowls to hold all of our liquid.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.040
Kinda give it a stir as I pour it in to get as much of the glow fluid in as possible

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.540
Ooh! I think I see some glowing! (wierd singing voice)

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.960
Woo! Ahh!

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.840
Alright, that's getting everywhere.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.540
(plays with ooze)

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.680
This looks really cool!

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.920
It's interesting because the farther in the ooze you see, the more it seems to glow,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.180
so the outside barely seems like its giving off light but its like the inside is,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.180
Yeah look at this, if I poke a hole down into it, it's like glowing more down inside the hole.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.460
Well I think we need to mix up our other colors!

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.700
(even more royalty free music)

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700
Woah! That looks so cool! It looks like lava!

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.460
That looks so cool!

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500
Look at that! Lava ooze!

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.680
It looks kind of like a nebula in space.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.200
It's kind of funny when I fold it over more of the color comes out like it looks pretty blue when it's flat

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.580
and then I fold it, and then you see a little bit more of the pink in there.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:30.400
Guys, this stuff is ooey and it's gooey and slimy and oozy, and it's glowing and this is so fun looking!

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.380
Woobly Woobly Woobly!

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:40.920
This stuff is amazing, there is one more thing I really think we need to try and that's just sort of combining it into one, giant "Oooberblob" of glowing ooze.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.280
Ahhh! Ahaha!

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.240
Giant blob of glowing ooze!

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.680
Oh now it's running off my hands

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.080
I'm not doing anything with it so it's just starts puddling and running.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.620
in like a rainbow of glowing colors.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.920
I'm not going to do that.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.500
I know what glow fluid tastes like and it's disgusting, so I am not going to put any of this in my mouth.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.340
This just looks like a living creature now

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.940
It's a very short glowing orange poop emoji

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.220
that didn't really work

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.080
Oh no!!

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.080
It's hard juggling things that come apart in your hands.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.460
*smack*

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.400
