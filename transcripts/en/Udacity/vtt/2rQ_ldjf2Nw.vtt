00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.610
Now that you've seen the two other ways of declaring and

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.080
defining objects, let's give them a try by creating two objects,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.830
one using dot notation and the other using bracket notation.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.410
Using dot notation, create an object that contains some of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.379
your work information, including your position, employer, the years worked and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.429
the city of the business.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.130
Then, using bracket notation, create an education object that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.800
includes the school you attended, the years you attended, and the school's city.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.230
&gt;&gt; And how will students know they've done it right?

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.679
&gt;&gt; Underneath your objects, append() work ["position"] and

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:35.000
education.name to the resume.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.350
If you did it right, they should show up.
