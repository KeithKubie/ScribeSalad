00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.920
Let A equal 0, 0 and
B equal lowercase b2

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.820
be points on the
coordinate plane.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.950
Let ABCDEF be a convex
equilateral hexagon.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.130
Convex means that
it's not concave.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.320
A concave hexagon
would look like this.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.707
That's 2 sides-- 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:20.040
This would be a concave hexagon.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.820
So it's going to be popped out.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.089
And all the sides are
going to be equal.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.380
So it's an equilateral hexagon.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.600
They're not telling us that
it's a regular hexagon.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.299
So we don't know that
all of the angles

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:30.340
are going to be the same.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.280
But all the sides
will be the same.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.970
Such that FAB is
equal to 120 degrees.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.620
Then they show us
a bunch of sides

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.359
that are parallel to each other.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:40.150
And then, the y-coordinates
of its vertices

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.770
are distinct elements of
the set 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.490
The area of the hexagon could
be written in the form m square

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.910
root of n, where m and n are
positive integers and n is not

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.570
divisible by the
square of any prime.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.944
That's just a
fancy way of saying

00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:56.420
that we've simplified this
radical as much as possible.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.460
Find m plus n.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.730
So really the first
part-- let's just

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.100
make sure we can
visualize this hexagon.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.200
So let me draw-- we know
1.1 vertex for short 0, 0.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.440
So let me draw my x-axis.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.610
That is my x-axis.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.630
Right over there.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.230
And then my y-axis.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.390
My y-axis would look like that.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.850
Y-axis.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.650
We know that the vertex
A sits at the point 0,0.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.640
That is the vertex A.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.400
Now, we know that
all of the vertices

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.060
have y-coordinates that are
either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.940
And they are distinct
members of the set.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.999
Which means no 2 of the vertices
share the same y-coordinate.

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.290
So they're not going to be
on the same horizontal line.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.860
So let me draw these horizontal
lines-- the x-axis is 0.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.610
Then you have y is equal to 2.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.270
Then you have 4, then you
have 6, and then you have 8,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.880
and then you have 10 up here.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.572
Now, B we already know.

00:01:57.572 --> 00:01:59.530
So first of all, we've
already used up to the 0

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.570
for A. A Is already
using up the 0.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.730
B uses of the 2-- they tell
us that the y-coordinate of B

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.210
is 2.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.560
So we use that as well.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.910
Let me see if I can
draw B over here--

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.310
It sits on this
horizontal someplace.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.464
And the hexagon
has side length S,

00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:24.130
where we don't know
what that length is,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.200
but they're all the same.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.700
So let's just call
this S it's going

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.070
to help me think about it.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.170
Now that I know that this
is equilateral equaliateral

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.080
hexagon, all the sides are
going to be the same length.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.260
We're going to go out here
the coordinate B comma 2.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.030
We don't know what B is,
but that is our vertex B.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.290
Now, F is the other vertex
that is connected to A.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.990
F cannot sit on
this horizontal--

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.000
cannot sit on y is equal to 2.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.080
It can't sit on y is
equal to 6, because then

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.800
this distance
would be super far.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.060
Clearly much further than
this distance over here.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.710
Or, actually, you
could have that.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.126
But then you would
you wouldn't be

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:03.310
able to draw really
a convex hexagon.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.120
The next vertex is just going to
have to sit on this horizontal.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.100
So it's going to be S away.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.810
Maybe it will be
something like that.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.370
So let me draw it-- so
that is the next vertex.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.030
That is vertex F. Because
we're going A, B,C,D, E, F,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.540
and then back to A. Fair enough.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.090
Now what about vertex C?

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.190
Well, vertex C can't
be on the 4 horizontal.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.330
So it's going to have to
be on the 6 horizontal.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.980
So vertex C is going to have
to be someplace like that.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.240
That's vertex C. And once again,
that length is S this length

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.430
is S.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.510
Now what about vertex E?

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.210
Can't be on the 6 horizontal,
already taken up by vertex C.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.990
So the 4 the 6 are taken up.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.540
So it has to be at
the 8 horizontal.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.290
And so this is length S.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.090
And we also know that we're
going back to the origin now.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.810
So this is the
vertex E right here.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.335
We know that we're going
back to the same x value,

00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:07.960
this is going to be
on the y-intercept.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.720
And the reason why
we know that is this

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.040
is the length S and
in this is length S.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.420
And both of these
diagonals travel

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.440
the same vertical distance.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.269
This base is 4.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.390
This base is 4.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.740
So you could kind of view
this as two right triangles.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.940
Both of them have base
4 and hypotenuse S

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.300
and so they share this
side right over here.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.820
So this one goes out to the
left that distance and then

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.360
this one's going to have
to come back that distance.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.650
Now, by the same
logic over here,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.560
this guy's going to
have to come back.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.540
So we can now use the
10 coordinate, the 10 y

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.950
horizontal, or the
y-coordinate of 10.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.610
That's the only one we
haven't used yet for D.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.090
And since we came out when we
had a diagonal of length S,

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.950
traveling 4 up, this
time, same logic--

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.499
we had a diagonal of length
S. It traveled up 4 over here

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:03.790
and it moved out this distance.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.590
When we go back in the other
direction and travel up 4

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.890
you're going to go back
in the same direction.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.550
So this is going to be directly
on top of B. The coordinate

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.570
for D is actually
going to be B comma 10.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.190
The y-coordinate here is 10.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.760
And there we have our hexagon.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.870
We're done drawing
our actual hexagon.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.360
And all this parallel line
information they told us--

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.845
AB is parallel to DE.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.833
And this is kind of obvious
here, BC is parallel to EF.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.940
And then they say CD
is parallel to FA.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.380
And the way that we
drew it, it looks

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.410
pretty clear that is the case.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.540
Now, we need to
find the area, we

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.290
need to find the
area of this hexagon.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.120
And it seems like a
good starting point

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.180
would be to figure
out what S is.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.040
And to figure out
what S is, it's

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.320
really going to be a
function of how much we've

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.390
inclined this thing.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.230
So let's draw--
and you could see

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.410
that since this isn't an
equally angular hexagon,

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.030
that this is kind of skwed.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.470
We distorted it a little bit.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.490
But all the sides
are the same length.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.440
So let's just call this theta.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.130
Let's call that angle
right over there theta.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.570
And then they tell us that
angle FAB is 120 degrees.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.340
That is 120 degrees.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.140
So this angle over
here on the left,

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.330
is going to be 180
minus 120 minus theta.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.250
So 180 minus 120 is 60.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.064
So this angle over
here 60 minus theta.

00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:42.730
Now the reason why I
did that because we

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.320
have some information.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.220
We know that we
traveled up 4 over here.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.759
And we know that we
traveled up 2 over here.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.300
And maybe we can
use that information

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.069
to solve for S. Because S
is the hypotenuse of both

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:56.110
of these right triangles
that I just constructed.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.430
Let me draw them-- So this
right triangle right over here,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.513
I could draw it like this.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.670
So I have S. I have theta.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.620
And I have 2, that's this
right triangle right over here.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.825
This right triangle
looks like this.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.940
This angle is 60 minus theta.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.330
And this height over here is 4.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.254
So let's see what we can do
to solve for S. This triangle

00:07:25.254 --> 00:07:27.170
on the left, or it was
on the right over here,

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.710
this triangle says
predict the sine of theta.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.440
The sine of theta is
equal to the opposite

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.430
over the hypotenuse.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.590
It's equal to 2 over S.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.140
This triangle tells us that
the sine-- and remember

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.730
this hypotenuse
over here is also

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:48.831
S-- the sine of 60 minus
theta is equal to 4 over S.

00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:50.830
And if we want to set
these equal to each other,

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.110
we can multiply this
guy by 2 on both sides.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.450
You could say 2 sine
of theta is equal to 4

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.315
over S. Sine of 60 minus 8
is also equal to 4 over S,

00:07:59.315 --> 00:08:01.270
so we could set them
equal to each other.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:12.010
So we have 2 sine of
theta is equal to sine

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.167
of 60 minus theta.

00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:18.250
And then we could use some
of our trig identities,

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:23.080
we know the sine of A
minus B is the same thing.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.680
The sine of A minus B, this is
equal to the sine of A times

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.730
the cosine of B. Or I should
say theta in this case.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.937
So sine of 60 minus theta--
this is just a standard trig

00:08:36.937 --> 00:08:39.270
identity, it's called the
difference, sum and difference

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:48.840
identity-- minus cosine of
60 times the sine of theta.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.940
And all this is equal
to 2 sine of theta.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:00.170
Well sine of 60 degrees-- This
is the square root of 3 over 2.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:04.970
Cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.374
So we could add 1/2 sine
theta to both sides of this.

00:09:08.374 --> 00:09:09.540
And what we're going to get?

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.740
So we're going to
add 1/2 sine theta.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.390
Then this guy's
going to go away.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.670
And then you add 1/2
sine theta to 2 sine

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.810
of theta, which is
really 4/2 sine of theta.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.390
So that's going to be
5/2 the sine of theta.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.140
So I'm just adding 1/2
sine theta to this.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:31.740
So it's 5/2 sine of theta
is equal to square root

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.290
of 3 over 2 cosine of theta.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.170
Right?

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.180
I added 1/2 sine theta to both
sides of this to get this.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.050
I can multiply both sides
by 2 just to simplify it.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.750
So I get 5 sine of theta.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.210
5 sine of theta is
equal to the square root

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.167
of 3 cosine of theta.

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:53.000
Now, I want to use the
identity sine squared

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.592
of theta plus cosine squared
of theta is equal to 1.

00:09:55.592 --> 00:09:57.300
So let me just square
both sides of that.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.070
That'll also help us
with this radical.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.030
So we'll get 25 sine
squared of theta

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.200
is equal to square
root of 3 squared is 3.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.350
Instead of writing
cosine squared of theta,

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.451
let's just write-- that's 1
minus sine squared of theta.

00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:12.950
Right?

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.810
Cosine squared theta is 1
minus sine squared of theta.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.970
I just squared both sides.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.900
Let me just write
what I just did--

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.070
I just squared to both sides.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.540
And so we get 25
sine squared theta

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:30.190
is equal to 3 minus
3 sine squared theta.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.820
We can add 3 sine squared
theta to both sides--

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.540
We get 28 sine squared
theta is equal to 3.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.770
Or, that the sine squared
of theta-- homestretch--

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.260
is equal to 3 over 28.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.930
Or, we could even write
that sine of theta

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.770
is equal to the square
root of 3 over 28.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.130
So it's equal to the
square root of 3 over 28.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.030
Now, we could simplify
that, 28 is 4 times 7,

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.070
we could take it out.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.377
But that's good enough
for now, maybe we'll

00:11:02.377 --> 00:11:03.710
simplify it later if we have to.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.670
Sometimes these are
easier to deal with.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.920
So let's see over [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.590
So we have the sine of theta.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:13.640
And now we can relate that,
actually, to S over here.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.870
We know that, before I
messed with this thing,

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:21.760
that the sine of theta is equal
to 2 over S. Or that S over 2

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.700
is equal to 1 over
sine of theta.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.260
Or that S is equal to 2
over the sine of theta.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.910
Well, we know what
sine of theta is,

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.310
the square root of 3 over 28.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.470
So S is equal to 2
divided by sine of theta.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.130
That's like multiplying by
the inverse of sine of theta.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.535
So that's 2 times the
square root of 28 over 3.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:51.550
So we figured out our S. 2
times this thing over here.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.010
Now, given that we
know an S, let's

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.700
see how we can
figure out the area.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.240
Well, what immediately
pops out is

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.197
that we have this triangle
over here that has height,

00:12:03.197 --> 00:12:05.530
or I should say maybe its
base, if you view it sideways,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.595
its base is 8.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.140
And this distance
right over here,

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:16.144
we should be able to figure out
using the Pythagorean theorem.

00:12:16.144 --> 00:12:18.310
Because we know that this
distance, right over here,

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.945
is 4.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.470
We know that this distance,
the hypotenuse is S.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.530
So we could call this the
height of it, right over here.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:34.320
We could say that H squared
plus 4 squared plus 16 is

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.180
equal to the hypotenuse
squared, is equal to S squared.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.150
S squared S is this
thing over here.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:49.480
So if we want to square S it
becomes 4 times 28 over 3.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.740
And we just subtract
16 from both sides.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.480
So H is equal to
4 times 28 over 3,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.197
minus, if I want
to write 16 over 3.

00:12:59.197 --> 00:13:01.030
Or if I want it, 16 to
something over three,

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:06.250
that's going to be
minus 48 over 3.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:12.210
And let's see, I don't want to
have to multiply 4 times 28.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.860
So you could write
48 as 4 times 12.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.950
So this numerator is going to be
4 times 28 minus 12 over-- now,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.130
remember that's H squared.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.600
I should say-- H
squared is going

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.470
to be 4 times 28
minus 12 over 3.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.740
Which is equal to
4 times 16 over 3.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.340
Which is equal to 64 over 3.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.510
That's H squared.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.780
So H is going to be the
square root of that,

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.450
which is 8 over the
square root of 3.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.430
So H right over here is 8
over the square root of 3.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.815
So if I want to find the area
of this whole thing over here--

00:13:49.815 --> 00:13:51.940
well first, let's find the
area of this small thing

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.690
right over here.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.990
That's just going
to be H times 4.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.610
So it's going to be-- well,
I could do it either way.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.720
But let's just say this
is H times 4 times 1/2.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.790
So it's going to be 2 times--
so the area of this triangle--

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.610
let me do it in blue right
here-- this triangle's area is

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:15.670
going to be H, which is 8 over
the square root of 3 times

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:20.000
4 times 1/2.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.750
So this guy right
over here is just

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.890
going to be 2 times 8
over the square root of 3,

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.620
or that's going to be 16
over the square root of 3.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.100
So this guy over here is 16
over the square root of 3.

00:14:37.097 --> 00:14:38.930
Now we have a bunch of
it, we have this guy,

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.900
and now this guy's going to have
the exact same area, right over

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.610
there.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.193
And then you have
this guy who's going

00:14:44.193 --> 00:14:46.460
to have the exact
same area again.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.030
Same exact logic, same exact
logic, same base, same height.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.511
They're actually congruent.

00:14:52.511 --> 00:14:53.886
So you have 4 of
these triangles.

00:14:53.886 --> 00:14:55.370
So you are going
to multiply by 4

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.745
If you want the
area of this area

00:14:57.745 --> 00:14:58.870
that I've are initiated in.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.280
So 4 times this.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.370
We're at 64 over the
square root of 3.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.520
Now the only area we
have left to figure out

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.045
is the area of
this parallelogram.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:13.569
in the middle.

00:15:13.569 --> 00:15:15.360
Now, we know the base
of the parallelogram.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.260
The base of this
parallelogram is 8.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.990
We just have to
figure out its height.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.574
And once again, we can use
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:15:28.574 --> 00:15:30.490
So I'll call this, I
dunno, we already used H,

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:31.600
well I'll use H again.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.224
But you just have to
remember that this

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.920
is a different height over here.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.070
This base over here
is of length 2.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.530
I know it's hard to read now.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:47.320
So we can now write that H
squared plus 4 plus 2 squared

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.094
is equal to S squared.

00:15:51.094 --> 00:15:53.510
Now we already figured out
what S squared was in the past.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.320
It's 4 times 28 over 3.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.730
Let's subtract 4
from both sides.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.820
You subtract 4 there.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.380
So minus 12 over 3.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.070
And now let's see, 12 is
the same thing as 4 times 3.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:18.230
So this is equal to
4 times 28 minus 3.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.670
So that's 4 times 25 over 3.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.650
Which is equal to 100 over 3.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.850
That's H squared.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.320
So this H is going to be equal
to the square root of this,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.550
which is 10 over the
square root of 3.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.610
So this distance
right over here is

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.970
10 over the square root of 3.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.082
So if we want the area
of this parallelogram,

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:41.540
it's going to be
that height, times

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.392
the base of the parallelogram.

00:16:43.392 --> 00:16:45.850
So the parallelogram is going
to be 8 times 10 square roots

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:51.294
of 3, or 80 square roots of 3.

00:16:51.294 --> 00:16:55.540
80-- oh no, let me be
very careful-- this

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.767
was 10 over the square
root of 3 is this height.

00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:01.350
So the whole area
of this paralelagram

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.310
is 8 times 10 over
the square root of 3.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.560
It's 80 over the
square root of 3.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:12.500
So our entire area now, if
we add everything together,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.520
we have 64 square roots of
3 for these 4 triangles,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.730
plus 80 over square root of 3.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.480
So let's add it together.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.109
So we have 80 over square roots
of 3 for the parallelogram,

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:27.290
plus 64 over square roots
of 3 for the triangle parts.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.930
And this is equal to 144
over the square root of 3.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.630
We can rationalize
the denominator.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.066
So times the square root of
3, over the square root of 3.

00:17:38.066 --> 00:17:40.232
And in the denominator,
now, we're going to get a 3.

00:17:40.232 --> 00:17:45.690
144 over 3 is going to be what?

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.900
That's 48.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.410
Right?

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.350
Three times 40 is
120, 3 times 8 is 24.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:56.230
So it's going to be
48 square roots of 3

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:00.220
for the area of
our entire hexagon.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.670
And so, we have in the form--
48 square roots of 3-- So

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:09.640
if you want to find m plus
n is 48 plus 3, which is 51.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.760
That was a tiring problem.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.607
My brain started to
fry near the end of it.

00:18:13.607 --> 00:18:15.190
I had trouble keeping
track of things.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.710
Anyway, hopefully
you enjoyed that.
