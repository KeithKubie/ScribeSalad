00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.736
Well, it looks like
Hillary Clinton's e-mails

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.838
could be the subject
of more FBI probing.

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:06.273
Oh, my. Uh...

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.141
KASHER:
Great still for that.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.710
-Yeah.
-(laughter) -Look at her.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.345
-Mid probe.
-Mid probe. Mid probe.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.846
First of all,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.249
why does she have that face with
the headline "Weiner" above it?

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.118
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Oh, it's, uh...

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.020
It's FBI.
The federal beef injection.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.755
-Uh, that's what it is.
-(laughter)

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.557
-And now...
-(applause)

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.559
Can we give you points?

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:28.128
-No, I don't... I can't get
points. -That's not allowed?

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.664
And now the hashtag
#HillaryForPrision is trending.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.466
-Yes, with a typo. -(laughter)
-RICHARDSON: Of course.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.103
In fact, it's been...
"Treading for 2 days"!

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.304
RICHARDSON:
Oh! No!

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.373
It is at the top of the treads.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:42.509
-No!
-Treading for two entire days.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.478
Say what you want
about Hillary's e-mails.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.980
At least
they were spell-checked.

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:48.815
-(laughter) -This is
the biggest political typo

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:51.351
since 1948, when the newspapers
mistakenly reported,

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.087
"Dewey beats off Truman."

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.457
(laughter)

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:01.361
-(applause)
-Which is wrong.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.730
Some people are claiming that
"prision" was spelled that way

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.799
on purpose
to avoid Twitter's censors.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.167
These are the same people
that thought

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.204
"xHamster" was a medical pet
care Web site.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.706
-(laughter)
-Hillary for "prision."

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.975
Comedians, what is "prision"?

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.644
-April.
-That's how you spell "prison."

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:20.080
-The dictionary is rigged!
-HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:23.050
-Yeah, it is. Yeah.
-(applause)

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.886
It's not a typo at all.
That's Hillary's rap name.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.522
-"Prision!"
-HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.490
-(laughter, applause)
-Points.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:33.794
It is musical.
Prision is a Vegas DJ

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.963
that gave my sister
a urinary tract infection.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:37.164
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.032
Sweet tats, though.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.703
And she calls her
vagina "Hillary."

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:42.803
-She sure does.
-(laughter)
