00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:02.141
- [Voiceover] So we have an
interesting equation here.

00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:03.940
Let's see if we can solve for k,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.819
and we're going to assume
that m is greater than zero.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.907
Like always, pause the video.

00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:13.903
Try it out on your own, and
then I will do it with you.

00:00:13.903 --> 00:00:16.559
All right, let's work
on this a little bit.

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:18.486
So you can imagine that the key to this

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:20.785
is to simplify it using our knowledge

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:21.922
of exponent properties,

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.884
and there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:26.067
First, we can look at this
rational expression here,

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:28.076
m to the 7/9 power divided

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:30.033
by m to the 1/3 power.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:31.937
And the key realization here is that

00:00:31.937 --> 00:00:36.764
if I have x to the a

00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:40.247
over x to the b, that
this is going to be equal

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:43.892
to x to the a minus b power.

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:46.249
And actually comes
straight out of the notion

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.291
that x to the a over x to the b,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.833
x to the a over x to the b,

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:54.132
is the same thing as x to the a

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:57.545
times one over x to the b,

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:02.072
which is the same thing
as x to the a times...

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:04.092
One over x to the b, that's the same thing

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:06.449
as x to the negative b,

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:08.109
which is going to be the same thing as...

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.071
If I have a base to one exponent times

00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:11.954
the same base to another exponent,

00:01:11.954 --> 00:01:13.565
that's the same thing as that base

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:16.804
to the sum of the
exponents, a plus negative b

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:19.625
which is just gonna be a minus b.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:21.169
So, we got to the same place.

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:24.605
So, we can re-write this as...

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:28.285
So, we can re-write this
part as being equal to

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:31.513
m to the 7/9 power

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:35.416
minus 1/3 power is equal to,

00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:40.893
is equal to m to the k over nine.

00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:42.611
And I think you see where this is going.

00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:45.180
What is 7/9 minus 1/3?

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.771
Well, 1/3 is the same thing,

00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:48.117
if we want to have a common denominator,

00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:50.998
1/3 is the same thing as 3/9.

00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:53.749
So, I can re-write this as 3/9.

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.829
So 7/9 minus 3/9 is going to be 4/9.

00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:01.541
So, this is the same thing as m to the...

00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:05.242
M to the 4/9 power

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:08.690
is going to be equal to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.900
m to the k-ninths power.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.248
So, 4/9 must be the
same thing as k-ninths.

00:02:15.248 --> 00:02:19.531
So, we can say 4/9 is equal to k-ninths.

00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.975
Four over nine is equal to k over nine,

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:25.037
which tells us that k

00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:28.047
must be equal to four,

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.015
and we're all done.
