00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.379
One of the great intellectual puzzles that
daily life forces all of us to consider on

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:11.981
a slightly too regular basis is: ‘Why are
other people so awful? How come they are so

00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:19.240
unreliable, aggressive, deceitful, mean, two-faced
or cowardly?’ As we search for answers,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.150
we tend quite naturally to fall back on a
standard, compact and tempting explanation:

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.760
because they are terrible people. They are
appalling, crooked, deformed or ‘bad’;

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.469
that’s simply how some types are. The conclusion
may be grim, but it also feels very true and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.699
fundamentally unbudgeable. However, when things
feel especially clear cut, we may be goaded

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.680
to try out an unusual thought experiment,
which stands to challenge a great many of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.780
our certainties and render the world usefully
more complicated: we can try to look at our

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.409
fellow humans through the eyes of love. The
experiment requires particular stamina and

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.299
is best attempted at quieter, less agitated
times of day. When we manage it, it may count

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.229
as one of our highest ethical achievements.
We are normally resolutely on our side, deeply

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.009
invested in our own point of view and prone
to trade in settled and moralising certainties.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.990
Yet, very occasionally, we have the strength
to look at other people through a different

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.210
lens: we notice that their reality is likely
to be far more complicated and nuanced than

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.659
we first expected – and that, contrary to
our impulses, they may be deserving of more

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.070
sympathy and consideration than we thought,
even though they have hurt and frustrated

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.890
us, even though their behaviour runs contrary
to what we expect – and even though the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.299
temptation is to call them idiots and numbskulls
and move on.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.840
Looking at another person through the eyes

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.890
of love involves some of the following: – Imagination
Moralistic-thinking identifies people closely

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.070
with their worst moments. Love-thinking pushes
us in another direction, it bids us to use

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.790
our imaginations to picture why someone might
have done a regrettable deed and yet could

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.390
remain a fitting target for a degree of understanding
and sympathy. Perhaps they got very frightened,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.906
maybe they were under pressure of extreme
anxiety and despair.

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:27.910
Those who look

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.410
with love guess that there will be sorrow
and regret beneath the furious rantings or

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.920
a sense of intolerable vulnerability behind
the pomposity and snobbishness. They intimate

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.281
that early trauma and let-down must have formed
the backdrop to later transgressions. They

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:50.590
will remember that the person before them
was once a baby too. The loving interpreter

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.290
holds on to the idea that sweetness must remain
beneath the surface – along with the possibility

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.140
of remorse and growth. They are committed
to mitigating circumstances; to any bits of

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.960
the truth that could cast a less catastrophic
light on folly and ‘nastiness’.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.360
To consider others with love means forever remembering the child within them.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.520
Our wrong do'er may be fully grown but their actions will always be connected up with their early years.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.730
We overlook the need occasionally to ignore the outward
adult sides of others in order to perceive

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.850
and sympathise with the angry confused infant
lurking inside. When we are around small children

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.080
who frustrate us, we don’t don’t declare
them evil, we don’t bear down on them to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.740
show them how misguided they are. We find
less alarming ways of grasping how they have

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.590
come to say or do certain things. We don’t
readily assign a negative motive or mean intention

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.590
to a small person; we reach around for the
most benevolent interpretations. We probably

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.570
think that they are getting a bit tired, or
their gums are sore or they are upset by the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.490
arrival of a younger sibling. We’ve got
a large repertoire of alternative explanations

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.150
ready in our heads. This is the reverse of
what tends to happen around adults; here we

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.100
imagine that others have deliberately got
us in their sights. But if we employed the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.651
infant model of interpretation, our first
assumption would be quite different. Given

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:16.959
how immature every adult necessarily remains,
some of the moves we execute with relative

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.150
ease around children must forever continue
to be relevant when we’re dealing with another

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.040
grown-up.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.200
Moralistic thinkers reach their certainties
swiftly; love thinkers take their time. They

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.120
remain serene in the face of obviously unimpressive
behaviour: a sudden loss of temper, a wild

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.740
accusation, a very mean remark. They reach
instinctively for reasonable explanations

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.410
and have clearly in their minds the better
moments of a currently frantic but essentially

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.440
loveable person.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.360
Love-thinkers interpret everyone as having strengths alongside

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.580
their obvious weaknesses. When they encounter

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.760
these weaknesses, they do not conclude that
this is all there is, they know that almost

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.990
everything on the negative side of a ledger
could be connected up with something on the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.970
positive. They search a little more assiduously
than is normal for the strength to which a

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.560
maddening characteristic must be twinned.
We can see easily enough that someone is pedantic

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.530
and uncompromising; we tend to forget, at
moments of crisis, their thoroughness and

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.460
honesty. We may know so much about a person’s
messiness, we forget their uncommon degree

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.030
of creative enthusiasm. There is no such thing
as a person with only strengths, but nor is

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.139
there someone with only weaknesses. The consolation
comes in refusing to view defects in isolation.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:49.370
Love is built out of a constantly renewed
and gently resigned awareness that weakness-free

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:56.380
people do not exist. – We Are Sinners Too
The single greatest spur towards a loving

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.650
perspective on others is a live awareness
that we are also deeply imperfect and at points

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.970
quite plainly mad. The enemy of generosity
is the sense that we might be beyond fault

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.300
– whereas love begins when we can acknowledge
that we are in equal measures idiotic, mentally

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.020
wobbly and flawed. It’s an implicit faith
in their own perfection that turns some people

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.090
into such harsh judges Looking at the world
through the eyes of love, we are forced to

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.090
conclude that there is no such thing as a
simply bad person, and no such thing as a

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:38.130
monster. There is only ever pain, anxiety
and suffering that have coalesced into unfortunate

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.930
action. We are not just being kind in this
notion; this isn’t merely an exercise in

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.420
being nice, it’s an exercise in getting
to the truth of things, which may – when

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.830
we get down to the details of human psychology
– be roughly and almost coincidentally the

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.400
same thing.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:09.120
To learn more about love and how to find love, which explains why we have the types we do and how our earlier experiences shape how and whom we love.
