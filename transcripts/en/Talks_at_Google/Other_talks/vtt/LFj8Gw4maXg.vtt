00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:02.080
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.855
Well, welcome everyone.

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:06.480
I'm glad you all could make it,
even though it's a day of

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.100
the "Star Trek" opening,
and some other

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.850
exciting geek events.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.760
But we're in for real
treat today.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.970
We have Eric Hautemont.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.370
And that's really testing my
high school French there, but

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.470
I hope I said it right.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.410
He's the co-founder and
CEO of board game

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.880
publisher, Days of Wonder.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.410
So let's give him hand,
first of all.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.690
MALE SPEAKER: So Eric and his
co-founder, Mark Kaufman,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.080
started Days of Wonder
in 2002.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.020
And they've just won a lot
of awards, including a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.580
prestigious German Game of the
Year award, again, which will

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.880
test the limits of my European
languages, so I won't try.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.110
But they've won many other
industry awards for their

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.200
blockbuster title, "Ticket to
Ride." And they are one of the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.080
youngest companies to ever win
the prestigious German award.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.350
They also have a top-selling
app store game.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.740
And so in the digital world of
Silicon Valley, Eric and Mark

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.970
have dared to go analog.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.940
And as you can tell, that's
paid off pretty well.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.110
But actually, Eric is also
from a background of

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.290
technology.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.370
He was at companies like Ray
Dream, which was a 3D Mac

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.820
software developer.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.260
And he was at Fractal
Design before.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.090
And so here today, he'll give
a talk, and a Q&amp;A. And he'll

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.660
sort of talk about his path
towards going from digital to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.410
analog, why he decided to start
a board game company.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.920
And then at the end, we'll
actually have a chance to play

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.510
board games with him.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.120
He has some "Ticket to
Ride" boxes here.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.980
And so if you stick around,
towards the end,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.070
we'll have some fun.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.047
So without further ado, let me
introduce Eric to the stage.

00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:46.995
ERIC HAUTEMONT: Thank
you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:46.995 --> 00:01:48.456
Thank you.

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:49.920
Thank you.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.760
Hello, everyone.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.580
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.300
It was kind of fun driving down
the shoreline, because I

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.140
used to work at about two blocks
from here 20 years ago.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.460
So that brought back some
good memories, back

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.460
in the digital days.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.500
But what I'd like to talk about
today is something a bit

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.300
different, and that's
board games.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.070
And the reason why board games
are different is they're

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.390
different from any other form
of entertainment, and really

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.850
any other form of consumer
product you can think of.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.500
And they're different in a big
way, but that takes a while,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.255
especially when you're coming
from the digital side, like I

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:22.850
did, to kind of like sink it.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.680
And the big difference is
how long they last.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.280
To put some things in
perspective, the best selling

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.970
board game today, in terms of
number of units sold, if not

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.450
profit, is still a game called
"Monopoly," which was the best

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.730
selling title back in 1935.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.620
Now that's kind of like if Errol
Flynn was making more

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.500
money this year than
Brad Pitt.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.630
Or if Cole Porter was outselling
Lady Gaga, which

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.960
needless to say, no one
expects would happen.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.690
Right?

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.670
And what's interesting is, if
you look even at the packaged

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.390
goods business--

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.580
you look at something like

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.030
Campbell's Soup, for instance--

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.675
and their packaged good
business, their soup, has

00:03:01.675 --> 00:03:07.850
changed more as a product than
has "Monopoly." And that is

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.730
one thing that gave us pause
as we were starting the

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.280
business, but that was one of
the things that attracted us

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.310
to that business.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.440
And the reason that it attracted
us to the business

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.110
is because in another life, my
partner and I used to run high

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.000
tech companies.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.160
I ran a photographics company in
the late '80s, early '90s,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.660
called Ray Dream, which was
doing photographic software.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.510
And while that was fun, and we
learned a lot, one thing that

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.100
I felt frustrated with is, we
sold that company to a company

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.190
called Fractal Design, which
had just gone public.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.050
And two years later, I was
offered to buy back that

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.190
company, which I had sold
to them for over $50

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.460
million, for $1.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.120
And I politely declined, and I
was right to decline because a

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.470
friend of mine who [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.870
lost his shirt.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.780
But what was frustrating about
that was, that while you can

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.300
make money and learn things,
there's very few companies--

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.410
and Google is one of the
exceptions, so I think you

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.980
guys are lucky--

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.110
that can really stand the test
of time on the digital side.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.910
And so that's one thing that
was very attractive to us

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.140
about the board game business.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.150
Now, the flip side of that, of
course, is that means the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.240
incumbents, the "Monopolies" of
the world, if they've been

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.010
on top for the last 80
years, how are you

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.070
going to displace them?

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.709
Or how are you going to carve
your own place in the sun in

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.880
that market?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.640
And that's an interesting
challenge.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.190
So when we started the company,
we had a theory, and

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.210
we had a bet.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.690
The theory was that the main
reason why those games can

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.990
stand for so long at the top is
not because they have the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.710
best game design out there.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.630
I mean clearly, since
"Monopoly," game design has

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.370
evolved a lot.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.570
You have games now, like
"Settlers of Catan" and

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.430
"Ticket to Ride," that arguably
are better from a

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.230
plain game design standpoint.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.890
So how come "Monopoly"
is still on top?

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.930
Well, we think the reason that
is if we were to take people

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.830
up front that are in this room,
or anywhere else in the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.100
world, for that matter, and I
was to invite some of you to

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.810
my house to play a game, no
matter what's the game.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.360
Let's just assume it's
a good game.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.220
We'll play together.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.840
Eight out of 10 of you at least,
if not more, will have

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.670
a great time.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.010
And at the end of the evening,
you'll say, that was great.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.160
Where can I go and
buy this game?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.720
Now, I take the exact same
sample of people, so the exact

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.250
same people, and I give you a
copy of the same game we were

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.430
playing that night in
the shrink wrap.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.050
And I call you back in six
months, and I ask you how you

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.110
like the game.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.400
And a large number of you won't
even have cracked the

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.204
shrink wrap open.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.020
OK?

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.820
And so that was the theory.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.060
The theory was that while people
enjoy playing board

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.830
games, they don't like having to
figure out how to play the

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.810
game that much.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.480
OK?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.960
The bet was that if that theory
is true, then what

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.750
really matters, as a board game
company, is how can you

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.690
get the large number of people
to play the game correctly

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.780
while getting them over
that initial fear?

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.560
And truth be told, what's
interesting with games like

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.770
"Monopoly" is that most people
don't play the game right.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.770
And most people, when they go
and buy a box of "Monopoly,"

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.040
they buy it because they
remember buying it as a kid,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.640
and playing it--

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.820
not buying it as a kid, but
playing it as a kid.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.740
And then truth be told, what
they'll do is they'll open the

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.980
box, and they'll quickly browse
through the rules.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.360
And they will still play
it wrong, by the way.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.650
But which is a different issue,
which is that great

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.470
game designs, I think,
are very [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.810
to errors in the way
you play that.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.460
So the interesting question then
was that if that theory

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.140
is true, how do you reach a lot
of the people, and teach

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.700
them the game?

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.970
And we felt that doing digital
editions of the games would be

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.290
a great way to do that.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.960
And the bet we made was that
maybe if we did digital

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.450
versions of our board games,
right, we could develop a

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.200
virtual circle where the sales
of the physical board games

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.740
would drive downloads of the
digital games, and the

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.960
download of the digital games
would drive the sales of the

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.390
board game.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.910
And you'd have that happy loop
that they develop together.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.750
So the question then becomes,
the only question that really

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.010
matters as a board game company,
even though you're

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.610
dealing with real cardboard
pieces like that, is how do

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.920
you make sure that your digital
version is as good as

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.850
your board game version?

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.180
Your cardboard version?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.070
I think before we go into the
challenges about designing the

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.960
digital editions of the board
games, one thing I'd like to,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.570
I'd like to do some more
differences between the

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.650
digital side and the
cardboard side.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.370
So what's interesting about
the cardboard side is that

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.480
it's relatively quick and
cheap to develop.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.330
The typical board game today,
I'd say you can go and put a

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.460
real cardboard board game in the
market for under $20,000.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.690
And you can develop that
in a couple of months.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.900
It's kind of tough to do the
same thing under the same

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.070
budget and the same time frame
with a digital game.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.200
So that's one thing that is in
favor of the cardboard side.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.460
The other thing that is
interesting about the

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.480
cardboard is that people develop
this really unique,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.220
very strong, emotional
attachment to the game itself.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.750
So again, taking some examples,
if you take a game

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.602
box like this, even if you end
up opening this game, and not

00:07:58.602 --> 00:08:03.800
playing it for many years, and
putting it away in a corner,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.350
one day you'll be just wanting
to open it again.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.840
And you're going to go, gee, I
want to clean my apartment.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.740
Let's throw this, and then
you're going to keep it.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.140
And most of the time, when you
get above the trash can,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.670
you're going to say, no.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.290
Looks too good.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.220
I'm too attached to it.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.740
I have good memories to it, and
you're putting it back.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.290
Or you're playing it again.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:19.730
OK?

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.480
Whereas, if you have a digital
version, there's, I think,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.150
much less of a hangup to just
pressing the Delete button.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.920
So there's a unique, emotional
attachment.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.280
Now, the flip side of that,
and the bad thing on the

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.500
cardboard side, as you can
imagine what happens when

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.909
you're trying to ship hundreds
of thousands of these boxes

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.970
across the oceans with
a small company.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.140
OK?

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.130
That's kind of a pain.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.549
It's definitely harder than just
publishing something on

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:48.050
the Google Play Store
or the app store.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:54.350
The other thing in favor of the
digital side is the price.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.925
It tends to be a lot more
excited, and a lot more

00:08:56.925 --> 00:08:59.070
willing to talk about digital
stuff than they are about

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.690
traditional card games
or board games.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.990
So that's a plus on
the digital side.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.900
And these are the main
differences that we see

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.760
between the cardboard side
and the digital side.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.660
Now, let's talk about game
design and where the

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.760
challenges are.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.610
So the thing that is very
particular about board games

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.830
as a problem for development
is that the rules you're

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.970
dealing with have to
be very simple.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.730
And the reason why those rules
have to be simple is because

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.570
you're playing with those
rules in your head.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:25.840
OK?

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.350
So there's a minimum of keep
you're willing to do.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.640
And if you try to do too
much, it's just not

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.820
going to be much fun.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.290
And so what that means is that--
that's what I call

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.360
nowhere to hide.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.490
There's no fancy graphics that
can hide a bad game.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.680
If the interaction of your rule
set with the players who

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.120
are playing it is not fun,
there's no fancy graphic that

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.990
is going to save you.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.440
The flip side of that is that
also means that when you

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.860
design a digital prototype
of the game, you can

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.040
design it in text mode.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.790
That's what we did with the very
first digital version of

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.080
the game we had.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.060
We had a smaller card game we
launched in the company we've

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.930
called "Gang of Four." And
initially, we developed a very

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.910
simple text-based
version of that.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.590
And the minute we knew the thing
was going to work is

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.590
when we started playing
that multi-player card

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.060
game in text mode.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.680
Because that was fun, even
though it was in text mode.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.070
And so my point is, if you have
a game that is fun with

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.190
sucky graphics, or in
text mode, you know

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.140
you have a real winner.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:20.740
OK?

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.350
So that's one thing that is
really important to focus on.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.550
The next thing is that board
games are fun because you're

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.600
playing this simple set
of rules against

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.100
another human being.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.820
So yes, we can develop
artificial

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.220
intelligence opponents.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.930
And for some games, you can
actually develop world-class

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.740
AI that will beat the
hell out of you.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.240
But that's not what is fun.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.610
What is really fun is
interacting with other people,

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.470
and being able to compete mind
against mind with all the

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.950
weakness and logic that
comes with that.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.040
And that creates a set of
interesting issues from a

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.190
development standpoint.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.640
One of the interesting issues is
the board games tend to be

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.690
turn based.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.230
So you would think, well,
they're perfect

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.570
asynchronous games.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.880
Well, except when you look at
how people really play board

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.160
games, they aren't exactly
playing them asynchronously.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.850
I mean, yes, they are taking
their turns, but they're

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.260
playing in one game session.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.900
You've don't like to
play over a billion

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.130
different game sessions.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.070
And what we ended up discovering
is that what

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.450
people really, really wanted
then-- and sometimes don't

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.510
know how to express it-- but
what they really want with a

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.760
digital board game is they want
the best of both worlds.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.560
They want to be able to stop the
game asynchronously, and

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.950
to start the game whatever they
want, because they might

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.640
not be face to face with the
other online players.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.300
But at the same time, when they
happen to be together,

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.040
they want the game to perform
like a real-time game.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.590
So that's created some
difficulties.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.530
And I said the [INAUDIBLE] to
develop a basic board game

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.140
that people can enjoy
as a multiplayer

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.136
online games is this.

00:11:49.136 --> 00:11:52.570
It's quite significant as a
result of on those issues.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.220
So let's talk now about some
of the specific design

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.260
challenges that we see.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.890
One of the challenges
is what kind of

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.090
information do you display?

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.530
When you have a real board game,
you don't ask yourself,

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.280
what am I displaying?

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.860
Because if there is
a stack of cards,

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.800
there's a stack of cards.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.750
And everybody is looking at this
stack of cards, and gets

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.210
the same information.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.860
Now, when you display that stack
of cards on the computer

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.900
screen, or any electronic
device, you don't have the

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.730
same resolution.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.310
You don't have the same
perception of depth that you

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.270
have with the real
deck of cards.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.130
So at what point do you start
showing people that there's

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.030
only a few cards left
in the deck?

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.650
And how do you display
that information?

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.980
Do you actually put a number
that says, there's only three

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.860
cards left in the deck, Eric?

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.120
Or how do you account
for that?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.630
This, I assure you,
is non-trivial.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.910
The other issue that is
non-trivial is in the real

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.000
world, you can deal with
something that is quite large.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.270
OK?

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.860
So you take a board, a
game board like this.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.070
OK?

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.670
And you lay pretty, plastic
trains on them.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.280
And the information really
jumps at you.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.880
So when you're trying to
connect, let's say Vancouver

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.170
to Atlanta, it's quite obvious
on the map where

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.310
those things are.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.510
When you're dealing with a
screen, whether it's a tablet

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.970
screen, or even worse, if you're
dealing with a smaller

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.880
format screen, it's a lot
harder to see that

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.710
information.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.260
And it's a lot easier
to miss some things.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.290
So you're tempted to do things
that help prompt the user, and

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.830
say, OK, these are
your objectives.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.190
Well, the problem is in the
real world, you don't have

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.730
something that flashes on the
board, these are your

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.160
objectives.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.800
Because everybody else
would see it.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.790
Right?

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.030
And again, this kind of subtle
design changes change the

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.640
flavor of the game.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.810
So you have to be super careful
when you implement the

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.610
game, and you decide what
information to display.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.960
You have to really think through
how that's going to

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.210
impact to the game.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.120
Another issue is that reality
tends to be a lot more complex

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.390
than it looks.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.730
So going back to our first game,
"Gang of Four," so it's

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.180
trick-taking game where
you have 64 cards.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.200
You play with four players.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.270
Each players has 16 cards.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.340
And you're trying to get rid of
your cards before the other

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.670
players do.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.440
And there's this thing, which
gives the game it's name,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.230
called the "Gang of Four," where
if you have four of a

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.000
kind, that acts as a trump.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.180
And that allows you to play
on anyone's hand.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.960
And when we started programming
that game, people

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.980
complained, the game
is broken.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.500
There's way too many
"Gang of Fours.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.150
And so, of course, if everybody
has trumps in their

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.190
hands, the game kind
of breaks down.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.700
And so we looked at the
code initially.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.400
And we're thinking, OK, maybe
there's a bug somewhere.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.210
So we run some starts, and
we look at actual game

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.370
plays, and so on.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.350
And the odds of having a "Gang
of Four," are exactly what

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.820
that the maps say it should.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.190
So we go, wait.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.580
There is no error in the
way we programmed this.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.250
And then we realized the error
is a human error that is

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.490
actually built in the physical
game itself, and that the game

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.940
realized that you don't need it
to work, which is that when

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.550
you play with a real deck of
cards, you will not truly do,

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.110
that is, most humans won't
really, truly do a random

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.580
shuffle from one end
to the next.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.100
OK?

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.220
And if you do a true,
random shuffle, the

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.380
game will break down.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.240
I grant you that.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.100
So if you guys play "Gang
of Four," don't

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.654
shuffle it too much.

00:15:01.654 --> 00:15:03.090
OK?

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:08.380
What that means is we had to
actually go back and program a

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.420
real shuffle that kind of mimics
the way you would truly

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.170
shuffle the deck.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.930
Because otherwise, the
game does break down.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.940
So that's one example.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.490
There's another even more
embarrassing and simple

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.390
example of reality being more
complex than it looks, or

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.790
deeper and richer than it
looks, which is almost

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.230
embarrassing to admit, which is
linked to another game we

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.560
have called "Small World." And
in "Small World," it's kind of

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.280
like a fantasy game of "Risk."
and you have a die.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.800
And that die you can roll on
your last conquest to try to

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.170
grab your territory.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.640
And that die has a feature that
is a bit unique, which is

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.070
that there's one side with one
pip, one with two, one with

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:47.660
three, and the other three
sides happen to be blank.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.320
OK.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:48.830
No big deal.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.100
When you play with the real
game, you grab the die.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.770
It seemed to really
jump at you.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.040
I don't need to write
anything in the

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.590
rules that says, beware.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.160
This dice has three
blank sides.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.770
OK?

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.760
Well, when we programmed the
electronic version, we started

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.330
getting lots of reviews.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:04.960
And on the upside, it's very
frustrating because you can't

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.850
leave feedback or answers to
these people on their reviews.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.880
They're saying, the
game is cheating.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.850
I'm always rolling blanks.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.390
I'd realize, well, yeah.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.930
it's rolling the die for you.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.220
And when it's rolling on the
screen, you don't really ever

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.610
get a chance to see it's
literally side by side.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.580
It kind of rolls too fast.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.940
It rolls like a real die, and
you can't really know that

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.250
there's three blank sides.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.540
So that's another example where
you really need to be

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:34.430
careful about how you handle
the display of information,

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.710
and how you translate the
physical components into the

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.680
digital site.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.890
One of the challenges is
the perception of time.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.050
When you're playing face
to face, you have the

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:46.800
interaction.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.300
And that's true by the way--

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.500
it's not so much a digital
versus cardboard issue here.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.270
It's an issue of playing face
to face verus playing online

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.640
against people that are on
the remote connection.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.160
Which is that when you are
playing face to face, there is

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.319
so many human interactions that
doesn't really pertain to

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.170
the game itself, that comes
into play, that your

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.700
perception of time is vastly
different from what it is when

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.313
you just focus, looking
on your screen.

00:17:12.313 --> 00:17:12.790
OK?

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.200
And what that means is in a game
like "Gang of Four" where

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.180
you can play a hand or you
can pass, even if you

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.200
could play that hand.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.569
And that information is crucial,
because it's giving

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.700
me, as your opponent, a
lot of information.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.000
If I see that you hesitate
about passing, I know

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.100
something about your hand that
you don't want me to know.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.680
And what's happening is when
you're just watching the

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.620
screen, you have no
one to look at.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.370
So you're missing that whole,
additional information, social

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.290
information.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.760
And as a result of that--

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.090
and we did this, really
timed it.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.110
We did the test--

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.350
If you pause for even
less than a half a

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.800
second, we will notice.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.720
Or the good players
will notice.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.140
OK?

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.380
And that's something
they would never

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.720
notice in the real world.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.190
OK?

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.420
So that is a challenge, and that
means that people will

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.350
play the game differently.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.700
And you have to accept that
there's some things you just

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.070
won't to be able to change, and
people will play the game

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.860
differently.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.850
Another example of that is
because you have no one to

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.140
look at, and interact with
directly, you will focus on

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.680
what information you're
presented with.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.870
So again, looking at that very
simple card game, "Gang of

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.220
Four," it's a game where there's
four players, but

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.390
there's only one winner.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.490
And there's no second,
third, fourth player.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.190
You're either the winner,
or you lost.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.700
And when you play the game
online, all you get to see at

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.620
is potentially an avatar, the
name of that avatar, which we

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.870
usually don't change
during the game

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.550
itself, and the score.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.620
And as a result of that, you
focus on the score a lot more

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.920
than you would in
the real world.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.520
In the real world, people would
write everyone's names.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.190
They would write down
the scores.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.650
And at the end of every couple
of hands, people will go and

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.600
say, OK, what is your score?

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.190
What is your score?

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.035
And that's kind of in the
background of your mind, in

00:18:46.035 --> 00:18:46.710
the back of your mind.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.140
But it's not something that
is facing you on the

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.140
screen all the time.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.080
And as a result of that, what
we've seen is competitive

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.980
players who play online get into
this metagame where the

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.390
scoring information of all the
partners is so present in

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.450
their mind that whole time that
it alters the way they

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:06.440
play the game, and the
strategies they use.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.060
Another unique challenge for the
digital versions is that

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.580
people will have a hard
time believing

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.746
that AI doesn't cheat.

00:19:14.746 --> 00:19:15.170
OK?

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.480
A really hard time.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.310
So we have a game.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.420
It's a World War II game.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.390
It's called "Memoir 44."

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.220
And it's a game where you
get to roll lots of die.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:30.760
And when you roll those dices,
people are not willing to

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.980
believe that the computer rolls
the same dice you are.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.290
So people ask us, they'll
say, I'm a programmer.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.660
I want to see your routine.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.200
So we show the actual code.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.020
And then they say, I want
to see recalls.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.690
So we published 500,000
game recalls.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.160
And we explained to those
people, oh, by the way, the

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.850
dice-rolling function has
no idea who it give that

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.660
information to.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.330
So the dice-rolling function is
exactly the same as rolling

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.740
the computer dice,
and your dice.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.550
It doesn't know when it's
giving the results.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.330
People still don't believe it.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.930
The reason why people don't
believe it is very simple.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.750
It's a game that you
play on the board.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.940
And we have the position of
different pieces, and so on.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.110
That's going to be of impact
on the strategy.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.410
And that's something that is
kind of expensive to compute,

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.110
and in some instances, actually
tough to compute on

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.730
the computer.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.090
The flip side of that is with
the computer, what you can

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.590
really do much better than 99.9%
of the human population

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.320
is you can compute the odds.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.790
And you can compute the
odds very well.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.460
So I'm holding a dice, and I'm
looking for this sample, and

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.920
that sample, but not that one.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.160
This is five, and I'm looking
for that one and that one.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.050
The computer will do much better
than the typical human.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.530
So as with all of that, when you
program AI, we say, well,

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.420
let's use the computer
strength, and let's

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.070
program it that way.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.560
So our AI got really good at
maximizing its dice rolls.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.630
And that, combined with the fact
that the perception of

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.510
time changes, and that when
you're playing in the

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:53.510
computer, you see the dice rolls
happen in a shorter, a

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.252
compressed period of time.

00:20:55.252 --> 00:20:57.050
Totally changes your
perception.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:57.530
OK?

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:58.510
And it's really rigged up.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.610
I mean, you can show people
the actual evidence.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.080
It's basically we've come to the
conclusion it's impossible

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.630
to convince people the
AI isn't cheating.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.320
OK?

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.160
The other interesting challenge
with AIs is that

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.730
sometimes the AI, the game
looks simple to play.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.740
The rules are simple, like
"Ticket to Ride." So you

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.600
think, well, the AI should
be easy to program.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.960
Well, not so.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.260
It can be very difficult.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.730
It can be like really
difficult.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.670
And the flip side of that is
there's games that look

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.480
complex to play for humans, and
the AI is actually quite

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.120
simple to program.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.700
One thing that we like to do
is we don't think it's that

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.970
interesting to try
to develop--

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.070
it's challenging, and it's not
that interesting, usually, to

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:43.190
try to develop an AI that
plays like a human does.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.480
Because in that case, just
go and find a friend.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.010
I mean, come on.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.190
It's not that difficult,
especially if

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.010
you can play online.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.630
So we tried to take
advantage of that.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.620
So with a game like "Small
World," for instance, we use

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.230
the fact that the initial
version of the game was only a

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.090
two-player game.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.330
And in the two-player game,
it's a zero-sum game.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.740
So whatever points I'm scoring,
I'm taking away from

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.160
you, and vice versa.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.680
And as a result of that, we
used that in the way we

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.310
designed the AI.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.195
And people felt that the game
was super aggressive.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:13.540
It was super aggressive because
you'd put at a stack

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.250
of armies like that
on one territory.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.690
And in the regular play in the
real world, people will never

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.900
go after that stack.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.100
They're literally physically
intimidated by the height of

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:23.870
your stack.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.990
Even though all you need is
one more token, OK, and it

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.980
doesn't matter whether the stack
is that high, or that

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.060
high from a score standpoint.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.760
And so we were able to develop
something that played really

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.920
fundamentally different.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.410
And that's kind of fun, because
what that shows you is

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.310
that when you're developing
digital games the right way,

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.040
they will allow you to learn
the game, but they will

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.650
scratch a different itch.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:49.640
So what you get as a player
from playing the digital

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.490
version of the game
will be different.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.830
And the pleasure you'll get out
of it, and the frustration

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.570
you'll get out of it sometimes,
too, will be

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.980
different from the one when
you playing the cardboard.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.860
And that really has made the
game a success, the business a

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.730
success, because then you really
do get that feedback

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.250
loop where people who play the
physical board games are aware

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.460
of the game, and are interested

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.590
in playing it online.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.860
And that creates a base level,
if you want, of sales online.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.340
That allows you to be visible
and stay visible if you have a

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.350
large number of physical
players out there.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.990
And in turn, because you're
visible in the charts, people

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.330
can buy the online version.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.870
Some people will discover the
game online, and eventually

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.300
they'll want to go and buy
the physical board game.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.920
Because the physical board
game will give

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.730
them different things.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.460
And one of the things that
will be different is the

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.930
memories that you
get out of it.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.960
If you think about when you
were playing board games,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.330
maybe as a child, I'm sure
most of you can jog some

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.440
memories of some specific
games where you remember

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.860
So-And-So did that after
he was going to

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.390
capture that territory.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.110
And it's much harder--

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.280
I'm not saying it's
impossible--

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.230
but it's much harder to have the
same emotional connection

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.270
with a digital site.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:55.070
So being able to play on both
fronts is really something

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.510
that we strive to do.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.450
And that's really, I think, that
really captures what we

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:02.860
try to do as a business.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.625
We really enjoy being one foot
on the physical side, one foot

00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:08.790
on the digital side.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.950
That allows us to keep the
business interesting because,

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.740
frankly, the cardboard side,
it's interesting initially

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.100
because the spectrum of time is
so different and it impacts

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.000
the way you drive and you
develop your business.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.990
But after a while, you've
figured it out.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.210
OK?

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.700
So you understand how that
fragmented, antiquated

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.310
distribution network works.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.090
And it kind of gets boring.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.100
The nice thing on the digital
side is things change so

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.740
quickly that you always have
to stay on your toes.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.280
And so being able to combine
the two really makes for a

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.570
fun, lifestyle business.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:40.170
And I think that kind of sums
up what I wanted to discuss

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.180
about for getting the
design of the games.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.482
And I'd be happy to open
it to Q&amp;A now.

00:24:46.482 --> 00:24:51.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.950
MALE SPEAKER: So why don't you
guys raise your hand, and I'll

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.720
run by and put the mike
in front of you.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.100
Obviously, so we can
get it recorded.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.750
AUDIENCE: The digital versions
of your games are so good.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.220
I was just wondering how you
guys made that pivot, or how

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.116
you built up the team to
start creating those.

00:25:08.116 --> 00:25:10.320
ERIC HAUTEMONT: So I think
there's a couple of things

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.286
that gave us an edge.

00:25:12.286 --> 00:25:17.010
One is that-- and that goes back
to the fact that people

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:20.240
in the cardboard business
will fail in a hurry.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.630
That's one of the things that,
for us, makes it interesting,

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.720
which is that there is
no shortcut, and

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.950
you need to go slow.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.420
And we tried to adopt the same
thing with the digital side.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.900
So one of the nice things about
the board game side is

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.730
once you have--

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.790
It's both the best and the worst
business in the world,

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.040
because it's like the book
publishing business.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.820
Until you have a hit, it's
a really, really bad

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.630
business to be in.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.460
And I would recommend to no one
interested in making money

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.300
to go in the board
game business.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.860
OK?

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.080
Because it's expensive
to manufacture.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.360
It's expensive to distribute.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.800
And it's low margins.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.300
OK?

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.800
But that's only true until
you get a hit.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.870
And the day you get the next
"Ticket to Ride," or the next

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.690
"Harry Potter" in the book
business, that becomes a

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:00.590
wonderful business.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.170
Because once a year, you
call your printer.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.350
You say, please, pretty
please, print

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.750
me some more money.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.460
There's very little
competition,

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.610
and it lasts forever.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:11.200
And it's true.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.980
I mean, we look at "Ticket to
Ride." So we came up with

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.230
"Ticket to Ride" 10 years ago,
and we've been selling more

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.520
"Ticket to Ride" every single
year of the board game.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.520
Every single year than
the year before.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.620
And our marketing expenses
are literally this much.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.970
As my partner and friend, Mark,
likes to say, all the

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.120
marketing is in the game box.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.360
We put all the money in the box,
and the word of mouth is

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.090
what's going to do it.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.550
Now, the flip side of that
is the word of mouth

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.170
only goes so fast.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.860
So if you're in a hurry, just
spend money and waste it.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.470
So I think the luxury of having
those hits under our

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.200
belt on the cardboard side has
allowed us to go very slow on

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.190
the digital side.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.450
OK?

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.630
So the first version of "Ticket
to Ride," the digital

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:54.320
board game, was actually on
the web back in 2005 as a

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.610
small Java app.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.370
And initially, it was free.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.060
And what we realized, as people
started playing it, is

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.590
that some people were
playing it a lot.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.100
I mean a whole lot.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.450
Like there's some people--

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.530
I won't name names-- but there's
some people that have

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.450
played in excess of
80,000 games of

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.340
"Ticket to Ride" online.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.460
Now, online plays faster than
the real board game, so if

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.950
you're really fast and good--

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.530
and by the time you're at your
80,000th game, you should be

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:21.560
fast, at least, if not good--

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.180
you'd be able to play maybe
three to five minutes, if it's

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.040
a two-player game.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.380
But then they do do the math.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.920
80,000 times three to five
minutes, that's a pretty good

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.430
chunk of time.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.585
So we realized that maybe
there was a business for

00:27:32.585 --> 00:27:34.500
actually selling the
digital versions.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.450
And what really, I think,
allowed us to get to the next

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.880
level was the unveiling
of the iPad.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.400
And we have the iPad,
and all the tablets.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.380
It's not specific to the iPad.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.340
But where I think the tablets,
and not the phones, but the

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.570
tablets differ from every other
form of device is that

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.190
they have this first device that
I think are really-- or

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.390
can in certain usage be very
transparent, meaning that you

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:02.440
can play on that device, and you
don't realize consciously

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.690
on that, that you're
sitting in front of

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:04.360
an electronic device.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.350
When I'm sitting in front of
computer playing a game of

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.220
"Ticket to Ride," I know I'm
intimately aware that I'm in

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.180
front of my computer playing
"Ticket to Ride." When you are

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.070
playing on the tablet, sometimes
you can forget that.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.590
And it's especially true when
you're playing face to face on

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.460
the tablet.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.750
So the answer--

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.710
I guess the long-winded winded
answer to your question is the

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:26.380
reason we've been successful, I
think, is we take our time.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.800
We don't hesitate to be late.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.040
So we have lots of people that
come to us, and they say, we

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.020
have a new platform.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:31.970
You must do that.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.950
So a couple of years ago, we had
people say, oh, if you're

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.620
not on Social Live, if
you're not on social

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.760
networks, you're dead.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.440
And we're like, maybe
we're dead.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.510
Maybe we're not.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.160
The nice thing is we
can afford to wait.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.170
And the same thing was true with
consoles, where people

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.500
come in and say, you need
to be on this console.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.620
Well, no, we don't really,
actually, because we're doing

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.780
just fine on the
cardboard side.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.520
We've got the digital side
of the business.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.980
And so if we're not on that
version, we can be on the next

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.330
version, or the next version.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.650
And by the way, if we miss the
train, maybe that train will

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.370
go off road somewhere.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:01.700
And we don't have to
worry about it.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.538
And we still have some time.

00:29:04.538 --> 00:29:06.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.940
So I play "Memorial 44," and
after your comments about the

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.140
AI, I was wondering if you've
ever felt the urge to actually

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.420
tweak the AI so that
it cheats, but in

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.200
favor of the player.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.290
A lot of video games do that.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.340
Like they make it seem like it's
fair, but it's actually

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.070
in favor of the player, so the
player doesn't complain.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.540
ERIC HAUTEMONT: No, we don't
for a couple of reasons.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:30.690
One is an economical reason,
which is that we're a very

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.030
small company, actually,
in terms of people.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.830
We are 16 people worldwide, and
that includes the people

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.420
that do the physical cardboard
stuff, and all the people who

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.510
do the programming and the art
for the online versions.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.690
So once we have a version that
we're happy with, we try not

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.680
to tinker with it too much
because it's expensive.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.180
It's expensive not in
terms of money.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.130
It's expensive in terms
of our time.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.030
And whatever time we spend
developing these additional

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.970
tweaks to the AI is time that we
don't spend taking the next

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.000
game online.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.620
So that's one reason.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.090
The other one is that we
actually think that part of

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.760
the fun of doing AIs, or of
playing the AIs, is figuring

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.600
out the AI.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.280
It's almost like a puzzle.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.820
And once you've solved that
puzzle, than frankly, we want

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.750
to encourage people to
go and play online.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.130
There's no way-- we could have
the entire company work on AIs

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.510
for "Memorial 44" for the next
10 years, and I still don't

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.510
think we could duplicate the
variety of opponents that are

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.130
playing face to face.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.240
AUDIENCE: A short followup.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.580
When can we expect Android
versions of your games?

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.330
ERIC HAUTEMONT: So I'll
give an answer.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.060
I'll give an answer, but before
I give that answer, I

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.500
need to promise everyone that
you'll be able to keep your

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.180
mouth shut for the next, uh,
for the next two weeks.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.166
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:48.640
ERIC HAUTEMONT: So is
that a "yes?" OK.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.005
So we'll be shipping--

00:30:51.005 --> 00:30:53.090
and I know I've been kind of
famous in the board game

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.410
industry, because people--

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.380
every time we ship a new version
on the iPhone, or

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.730
something, people say, Android,
Android, Android.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.430
And I've actually gone to the
press a couple of years ago on

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.830
record, and saying, we don't
want to do Android versions,

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.480
and here's why.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.750
And I got a lot of flak for
that from board gamers.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.150
But we actually came in with--

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.680
we actually came with a "Ticket
to Ride" version on

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.170
the Android tablets.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.040
And I say tablets.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.600
So we work on some
of the large--

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.930
I mean, one thing that is
interesting, and kind of

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.510
change for a small team like
us on Android, is that you

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:23.470
have this wide variety.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.340
You have this continuum of
phone factors, from like

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.660
really tiny phones all the
way to large tablets.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.380
But you'll be able to play
"Ticket to Ride" on tablets.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.400
The game will ship on Google
Play on May 30.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:41.230
And if some of you are
interested, you can send me an

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.400
email after we are done.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.540
You can send me an email at
eric-- that's E-R-I-C--

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.870
@daysofwonder.

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:50.240
And if you really can't wait
until May 30, we can probably

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.750
get you to download the
application we used to

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.560
distribute beta version,
which is [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.590
app, and send you an APK of
the game ahead of time.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:01.890
The only thing we ask is, as a
company, we tend to be quite

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:05.520
secretive about what we do
until the day we launch.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.060
So you're welcome to email me.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.460
I'll give you a version.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.940
Please don't try to go and pass
it around or anything

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.781
like that until May 30.

00:32:17.781 --> 00:32:20.630
AUDIENCE: So my daughter and I
would like to play "Ticket to

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:24.570
Ride," but I find when we play
together-- she's eight--

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.475
we don't play the sort of
cutthroat game of like, oh,

00:32:26.475 --> 00:32:27.370
I'm going to cut you off.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.720
And you can't finish a route.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.710
But we kind of played in a
cooperative way, where oh, I

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.790
see you're trying to
build over here.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:33.925
I'll build over there.

00:32:33.925 --> 00:32:36.060
Have you thought about what some
of your games, thinking

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.420
about ways you could make them
like cooperative variants of

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.290
the games, or cooperative
gameplay, so that for

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:42.190
families and stuff?

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.875
Those kind of environments?

00:32:42.875 --> 00:32:43.370
ERIC HAUTEMONT: Yeah.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:46.860
So we actually have a game
called "Shadows Over Camelot,"

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.820
which is a game that is actually
built around the

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.280
whole idea of being cooperative,
meaning that all

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.900
the players together
play against the

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.630
game mechanics itself.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.710
Now, even there, I'm
afraid though, we

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:57.620
couldn't quite help it.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.250
So we did put a small wrinkle
in that, which is that even

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.170
though all the players are
playing together against the

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:06.280
game mechanic itself, there is
always the possibility, or the

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.080
risk, even in your case, that
one of the players is a

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:14.183
traitor, and will win if
everybody else loses.

00:33:14.183 --> 00:33:14.870
OK?

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.020
But you don't have a guarantee
that that player is there.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.760
And if you want to play it in
purely cooperative mode, you

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.840
can do that.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.610
On a game like "Ticket to Ride,"
there's a way to play

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.040
cooperatively, like on the
Asia map, for instance.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.300
We have a team version.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.160
So where players have a limited
amount of information,

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.350
the connections, how they
can share together.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.300
So you're playing cooperatively,
but you still

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.790
playing competitively against
other players.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:42.490
And the reason for that is,
again, with real board games,

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.670
you must use a very simple
set up rules.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.250
Otherwise, you lose the vast
majority of players.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.230
And so it's difficult to keep
the tension that makes a game

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.030
fun and tight when being
purely cooperatively.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.530
so unless you design the game
from the ground up for that, I

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.580
think it's very difficult to
take a game that is not a

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.230
cooperative game and
turn it into one.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.120
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could speak a bit about

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.909
the collaboration process
between the company and

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:13.270
working designers, and sort
of like where the work--

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.760
how the work is split up.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.139
And also, I'm also curious about
sort of like the origins

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.210
of "Ticket to Ride," and
how you got started

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.480
creating the game.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:21.770
ERIC HAUTEMONT: Sure.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:22.310
OK.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.370
So we're getting at how we
work with game designers.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:29.560
It really runs the whole gamut
for a number of reasons, one

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.254
of which is that we haven't met
two game designers that

00:34:34.254 --> 00:34:35.090
are the same.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.100
There's actually very few people
in the business who

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.360
make a living, full time,
from game design.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.750
Most of those that do make
a living full time tend

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:44.860
to be in the US.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.360
But there's game designers
all around the world.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.969
And we've seen people that have
submitted prototypes to

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.909
us that we're working for the
Secret Service, that we're

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:55.780
working for that Coast Guard, on
the equivalent of the Coast

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.120
Guards in other countries.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.430
People that are teachers.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.510
People that are priests.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:02.740
All kind of people.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.460
And so depending on the work
they do, and the type of

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.140
designed they do, the amount
of interactions we have is

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.450
more or less significant.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:12.090
So we have some people that have
worked with us, and they

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:14.890
say, I have a design,
and the design was

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.030
perfect from the get-go.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:21.020
And so the interaction we had
with them was sending a

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.190
publishing agreement, and then
keeping them informed as we

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.930
went to develop the game from
the graphic design standpoint

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.380
that you want.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.970
One thing that we
don't do is--

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.430
and that goes back to
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:34.100
collaboration--

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.850
is I actually don't believe in
the design by committee.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.700
So when we do graphic design and
things like that, we have

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.040
an art director.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.100
We discuss together.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.310
We discussed in the company, but
there's someone that makes

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.670
the decision.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.860
And that someone is me, because
I'm the one who is

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.520
paying for this mistake if we
screw up, and we don't sell

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.550
the board game as well as
I thought we would.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.500
So we inform the game designers,
and we show them

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.070
who we're going to work
with, and so on.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.800
But it's not really
collaborative in that we don't

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.930
let them decide which
[INAUDIBLE] they are

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.080
going to work with.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.802
All the things like that.

00:36:07.802 --> 00:36:08.190
OK?

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:13.430
Now, from a gameplay standpoint,
depending on the

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.650
game, it can be very
interactive.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:18.160
So if we take a game like
"Memoir 44," Richard Borg

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.580
developed that game,
and designed a

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:26.260
great game about the--

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:26.710
Sorry.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:27.880
My mind goes blank.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.730
He had designed a great game
about the Civil War.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.790
And we went to him, and we said,
we'd like to do a game

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.030
on World War II.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:37.510
And we spent the better part of
six months working with him

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.970
on the game design itself,
tweaking the game design that

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:43.180
he had to make it work
for World War II.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:43.610
OK?

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.620
So it runs the whole gamut.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.270
Now, regarding "Ticket to Ride,"
the way we stumbled on

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.620
"Ticket to Ride" is we went to
a small board game conference

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.180
in Baltimore that is
held every year.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.710
And now it's moved
to Lancaster,

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:55.330
Pennsylvania, I think.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.670
It's called the World Board
Game Championship.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:00.550
It's kind of a misnomer to call
it the World Board Game

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.130
Championship.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:03.870
We tend to think of it as
the Baltimore Board Game

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:09.550
Championship, because 95% of the
people there are in close

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:10.750
proximity of the convention.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.220
But it's a great conventional
where people go and play games

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.000
competitively for a week
of time every summer.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.120
And we met with Alan there.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.290
We'd never met with
him before.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:21.930
It was Mark and myself.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.440
And we said, let
me [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.210
And he said, oh, I have these
game that I need to show you.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:27.390
And he pulled this small
cardboard box, and it says

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:30.200
"Station to Station." And he put
the map on the table that

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.170
looked like a cool version
of the original

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.680
"Ticket to Ride" map.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.770
And we started playing
the game.

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.050
He said, OK, so it's
a very simple game.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.780
Here are the rules.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.650
And so we started playing two or
three times with Mark, and

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.980
we look at each other,
and we're like,

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.130
yes, this feels good.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.800
And so then [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.410
Alan just wipes off of the whole
map clean and said, OK,

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.790
so you understand
how it plays.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.440
So you can take it
home and decide.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.025
And with Mark, we just said,
like, you just stopped the

00:37:55.025 --> 00:37:55.390
whole game.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.090
You just destroyed
our whole game.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.360
We were playing!

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.780
What did you do?

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.640
And to this day, to this day,
I'm not quite sure whether

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.320
Alan used that as a genius
marketing trick to really make

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.050
sure he had hooked us as
a publisher, or not.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.850
Now, Alan will claim, if you ask
him in public, Alan will

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:15.960
claim no recollection whatsoever
of ever wiping that

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.590
board clean.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:21.270
But that's kind of the
background story behind

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.790
"Ticket to Ride."

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:23.960
And what was fun with that, and
that's true of all board

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.190
games, is that I then traveled
with that little prototype.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:30.120
I actually flew to Korea because
back in 2004, there

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.275
was kind of this board
game craze in

00:38:32.275 --> 00:38:33.690
coffee shops in Korea.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.160
And I wanted to witness
that first hand.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.600
And so I traveled with
that small prototype.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.740
And what I saw there--

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.790
and I've seen it again and again
with board games-- is

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.070
what's interesting is board
games, if they're really good,

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.350
they will work anywhere
in the world.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.380
So no matter whether you speak
the language of the people you

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.040
play with or not, you can
have a great time.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:51.940
And we saw that.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.480
Landed in Korea.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.960
Quickly was in a cafe where I
have no clue what people were

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.960
talking about.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.330
OK?

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.740
I couldn't understand a word,
and they probably couldn't

00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.580
understand a word.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.600
You guys probably don't
understand half of the words

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.660
I've been talking about.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:06.830
And I called Mark, and I said,
you know, this game

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.570
is going to be big.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.420
We knew right then.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.920
So that's one of the nice things
about the prototypes is

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.760
again, even if you have really
bad graphics, you'll know very

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.345
quickly, once you play with
people, whether you have a

00:39:21.345 --> 00:39:22.620
winner or not.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.940
AUDIENCE: So first of, I wanted
to thank you very much.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.300
I absolutely love "Ticket to
Ride." I actually bought a

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.360
copy for my family back home in
Chicago, and they've been

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.270
playing it like every day for
the past several months.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.050
ERIC HAUTEMONT: Thank you.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.688
Thank you or sorry?

00:39:37.688 --> 00:39:40.090
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's more of
a thank you, actually.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:41.860
It helped me survive
a few trips home,

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.900
which is always nice.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.340
One thing I noticed in
particular, because I play the

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.000
tablet version a lot, is that
when you play the tablet

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.070
version, it tends to be more of
a single player experience,

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:57.160
even when you're
playing online.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.160
Because your goal is to kind
of finish your routes.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.780
Where when you're playing in
person, there's more of this

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.140
competitive edge, where you kind
of want to screw people

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.900
over, and you want
to cut them off.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.250
And you want to kind of see
where they're trying to get

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.940
to, and cause more mayhem.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:19.150
Is there any way of kind of
adding that into the digital

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.490
version of the game?

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.440
I just found that even though
I play both copies, that my

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.740
strategy changes from
game to play.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.870
ERIC HAUTEMONT: What you
say is very true.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:32.050
I think it's very tough on a
game like "Ticket to Ride."

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:35.000
And the reason for that, and
that's something that's shared

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.630
with a lot of board game
designs, is that there's

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.030
hidden information.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.450
And so because you have it, that
hidden information, it's

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.460
very difficult for us to have
a commercially practical

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.330
version where you could play
"Ticket to Ride" sharing the

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.320
same tablet as your digital
board with other people

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.850
sitting across from you.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:51.810
OK?

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.830
And until we get that, so that
means we have to assume, then,

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.260
that everybody has a phone,
too, that they can use, to

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.100
hold in their hand.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.570
And then you have to
deal with all these

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.620
interface issues of, OK--

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.620
Again, the real world
is complex, or it's

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.380
simpler than it looks.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.070
So when you have real cards in
your hand, you just drop you

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.530
cards, and you're done.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.370
If you have a digital device
in your hand, and you're

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.780
trying to drop those cards onto
the digital device in the

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.140
middle, it gets quickly
pretty awkward.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.440
And you have to worry about your
Bluetooth connection or

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.910
your Wi-Fi connection dropping
off, and all kinds of crap

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.220
that you don't have to
worry about with a

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.485
real deck of cards.

00:41:24.485 --> 00:41:24.800
OK?

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.000
So for games with hidden
information like "Ticket to

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.650
Ride," I'd say it's very
difficult until the technology

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.020
gets a lot more transparent.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.950
Now, with games like "Small
World," you can actually play

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.520
a game of "Small World" face
to face around the tablet.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.930
And in that case, we actually
see the behavior on the type

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.925
of play very much being the
same, with the kind of

00:41:44.925 --> 00:41:47.310
aggressiveness you describe,
and so on.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:51.950
What's interesting is we run a
"Ticket to Ride" tournament,

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.220
championship tournament.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.490
Real "Ticket to Ride" with
the real board game.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:57.930
And because we have people that
have played 80,000 games,

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.000
where lots of people online that
think like, they're the

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.790
king of "Ticket to Ride," and
nobody can beat them.

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.220
So when we started doing
national qualifications for

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:09.390
that tournament, we had lots
of people who said, I'm so

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.560
good online.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.420
I'm not even going to go
for the qualifiers.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.623
I'm just going to go in the
actual competition, and I'm

00:42:14.623 --> 00:42:15.810
going to crush everyone.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.460
And I'd say over 90% of people
that had that kind of

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.400
attitude, got their clock
cleaned when they actually

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.000
played the real, physical
board game.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:24.410
OK?

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.570
Because it plays different.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:27.820
It really does.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.890
And we had the final where
we had one person--

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:31.430
it was interesting.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:33.860
We had the final where we had
one best one that actually

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.490
played a lot of physical board
game versions of "Ticket to

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:38.160
Ride."

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.330
And we had this opponent, who
was the opposite of my

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:43.190
finalist, who was actually a
professional player, in that

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.100
he didn't really particularly
care, at the time, about

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.640
"Ticket to Ride." He cares about
playing tournaments with

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.140
money to win.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.590
And he studies the game, and
he just goes after that.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.080
And so he had only played like
five games of "Ticket to Ride"

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.670
in real life, and a couple
of games online.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.420
But he'd studied all about the
ticket distribution, and

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.700
everything else.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.190
And he finished second.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:07.250
So I guess experience
does pay off.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.950
But it shows there's
different sides.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.280
To us, that's part of what's
fun, is what you get out of

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.830
playing online tends to be
different from what you get

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.700
out of playing the physical
board game.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.880
And so eventually, you
end up buying both,

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.531
which we love you for.

00:43:22.531 --> 00:43:23.320
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.010
We just have time for a
couple more questions.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:27.077
There's one from VC, and
then we're going to

00:43:27.077 --> 00:43:28.300
take one over here.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.690
So one from VC from Henry.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:34.480
He asks, "Given your emphasis
on simplicity of design, how

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.980
do you feel about the recent
popularity of really complex

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:40.660
games, like 'Fantas.y Flight,"
coming out of "Fantasy

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.380
Flight," like "Civilization,"
"Ora et Labora?"

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:50.080
ERIC HAUTEMONT: So I think it's
interesting that the more

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.700
complex games can be
very exciting.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.410
And it's interesting you
mentioned "Civilization,"

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:58.460
because the old Avalon Hill
"Advanced Civilization" is

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.170
kind of the all-time favorite
of mine, even though I would

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:02.950
never publish it as
a board game.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.770
I have memories of playing down
the block, literally, for

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.520
like 14 hours in a row.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.540
And that's some of
my best memories.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:17.230
I think the difference between
the long games, or the simple

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:20.300
games and the complex
games, is the--

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.010
it goes back to the
word of mouth.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:25.250
The word-of-mouth factor on
the complex games is a lot

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.120
harder to grow fast.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.940
And so you have a much
smaller population.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.900
So you have people that
have become, I'd

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.680
say, board game literate.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.520
And so you have people that
actually-- you have a small

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.470
segment of the population
that actually enjoys

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.280
learning new games.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.200
And so when we go to like Alan
Moon's Gathering of Friends,

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.970
there are people who are there
just to play new games.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:44.830
And if you propose to them to
play a game they've already

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.350
played, they're going
to say, no.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.030
I actually want to
play a new game.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:49.920
And so there's people that
kind of enjoy that mental

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.130
gymnastic, if you want.

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.390
And once you get over the hump,
I can see why people

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:54.090
enjoy that.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.366
But that's a very
small minority.

00:44:56.366 --> 00:44:58.510
AUDIENCE: So this is a slightly
different question.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:04.070
But you're talking about
ensuring the dice rolling in

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:06.550
"Memoir 44," and games
like that, was fair.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:09.790
So I was curious as to why the
die in "Small World" has the

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:12.640
one across from the three,
instead of having the three

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.610
sides all across from blank
faces, which would have a

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:18.641
greater guarantee of
having a fair die.

00:45:18.641 --> 00:45:21.880
ERIC HAUTEMONT: Actually,
it's a good question.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.670
Because in the game itself, that
difference, when you look

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:28.200
at the impact of the difference,
makes no

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.100
difference.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.990
So we went with whatever was
the simplest for the game,

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.440
which was easiest for the shop
design, to give to the tool

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.070
manufacturer to do.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.110
So that's the actual
reason why.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.490
We had a simulation when we
did that World Board Game

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:46.950
Championship with "Ticket
to Ride." One of the two

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:51.410
finalists came to me and said,
OK, so I looked at whether the

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:52.620
tournament rules work.

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.140
And how are we going to
decide who starts?

00:45:55.140 --> 00:46:00.090
It was the first person
to win two games.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.110
And since there's no tie, within
three games, you know

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.350
what happens.

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:06.890
And he's like, how are we going
to decide who's going to

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:08.660
start the first game?

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.440
And I looked at the guy,
and I said, say what?

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.380
And he said, yeah, there's
an advantage to

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.212
whoever starts first.

00:46:16.212 --> 00:46:17.700
And I said, well, yeah, there's

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:18.650
a theoretical advantage.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.420
And the guy got like really--

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.210
So we said, OK, fine.

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:23.480
So I went to see the
other finalist.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.100
I said, OK.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.870
So that guy wants to discuss
who's going to start.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.360
And the other finalist looked at
me, and he said, that's OK.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.300
let him start.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:33.830
I'll just work a little
bit harder.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:35.790
And then he proceeded
to just crush him.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.420
And he won two games in a row.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.260
So I guess that kind of
sums up my view about

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.050
those kind of things.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:46.000
They're kind of fun to think
up from a math standpoint.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.270
From a practical standpoint--

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:54.380
I'll give you the dice
design that favors

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.920
your odds any time.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.230
AUDIENCE: About the online
versus offline gaming.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:01.855
So in offline, one
of the biggest--

00:47:01.855 --> 00:47:04.820
the thing that I enjoy most
is pitting people

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.700
against each other.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.640
And you're like, oh,
he's leading.

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.090
You should attack him,
and so forth.

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.900
And that like doesn't translate
to online at all.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.840
And so I've been thinking.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.325
I saw this implemented for
"Dominion." I think it's over

00:47:18.325 --> 00:47:20.330
in Google Hangouts.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:24.060
And letting people like see
each other, and then like

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.550
encouraging that interaction.

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:26.540
What do you think about that?

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.100
Could that be?

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:32.130
ERIC HAUTEMONT: The only thing
about that, the only

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:33.660
reservation I have about those
kind of things-- and we

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.020
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:34.240
people.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.370
That's why we don't implement
them ourselves.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:38.360
We let people, if they want--
and we know there's some

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.260
people, sometimes, that actually
will literally open a

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.920
chat channel, and just like
trash talk with each other

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.830
during a game.

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:47.220
The reason we don't support that
directly in the game--

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.610
besides the fact that it's work
that we'd rather spend on

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:52.170
designing other games--

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.530
so what I want to say is we're
always leery of things that

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.170
remove transparency.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.820
We think it's already such a
challenge to translate a

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.940
physical board game
properly online.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:07.560
That the more tools, the more
technology you add, it's very

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.370
difficult to do that in a way
that is really transparent.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.990
So even though when I'm playing
in real life, it's

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:14.930
very easy for me to do some
trash talk, if I have to go

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:16.730
and actually type that,
we think that's a big

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:17.470
distraction.

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:19.090
And that's not a very
transparent way of

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:20.630
communicating with people.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:24.400
And so that's the other reason
why we don't care so much

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.120
about those kinds of things.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.010
We're really striving for, I
think, the technology not

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:29.660
getting in the way.

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.050
I mean, that's one thing that is
fascinating to us, being in

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.390
Silicon Valley, there's
all these people--

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.700
Every three months, there's
someone who's come out with a

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.870
new dice design.

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:38.710
And they go, Look.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:41.130
There's this superduper
electronic dice, and it's got

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:42.250
a USB connection.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.370
It's got a hard drive in it, and
it does all these things.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:49.500
I'm like, dice have worked fine
for thousands of years.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.390
OK?

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:52.340
What's the point?

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.750
And so we try and--

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:59.020
On the one hand, we look at
new technology, and we're

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.275
really curious to see what
happens with Google Glasses in

00:49:02.275 --> 00:49:04.730
terms of certain types of hidden
information that we

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:07.910
think it could take care
of during the games.

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:10.340
At the same time, we're really
careful to go slow, and not do

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.940
things that are non-transparent,
and really

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.480
become more cumbersome, and
remove more than they add.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.560
MALE SPEAKER: Let's give Eric
a big round of applause.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.884
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:20.884 --> 00:49:22.470
ERIC HAUTEMONT: Thank you.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.920
Thank you.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.420
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
again for coming.
