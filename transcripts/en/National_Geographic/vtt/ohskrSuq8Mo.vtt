00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.276 line:0%
I decided after much
research to go to Greenland.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.247
And I went to the eastern
part of Greenland

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.481
which is less inhabited.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.350
The western part is
quite inhabited.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.086
Also I was going in December,
so if I would go too far north

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.488
there wouldn't be any
light whatsoever.

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:24.524
I wanted some light, it's
useful when you take pictures.

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.393
<i> And so, I went to this
 place called Isortoq.</i>

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:30.296
<i> There's about 110,000 Inuits.</i>

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:33.165
<i> There's about 16,000
 Iso living in the US.</i>

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:36.302
<i> And they eat only
 meat, traditionally.</i>

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:39.271
And by far has made the
transition to market food.

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:42.475
But if I would have wanted to
really see a true Inuit diet

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.912
I would have needed to go
there 60, 50-60 years ago.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:48.448
It's not the case,
but they still,

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.851
you know, go on with a
lot of traditional food

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:52.952
and do eat that a lot.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.020
So, that's what I
would be focusing on.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.289
<i> This is Isortoq.</i>

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.424
<i> That's the whole of it.
 And it took me two flight</i>

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.893
<i> and two helicopter
 ride to get there.</i>

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:03.796
<i> It's very surreal atmosphere,
 I've never been to the Arctic.</i>

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.098
<i> Never been up there.</i>

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:09.302
<i> Lots of dog howling and very
nostalgic feel about the place.</i>

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:11.670
I had contacted a
family before.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.173
So when I arrived I was
met by this family.

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:15.941
<i> And I spent ten days</i>

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:17.777
<i> sleeping there
 in the living room.</i>

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.813
<i> I was staying with Bent,
 he's there in green</i>

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.348
<i> and Dina, standing up.</i>

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.549
<i> And they are hunters.</i>

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.050
<i> They go hunting
 a few times a week.</i>

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.886
<i> They are active hunters still.</i>

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.822
<i> Every day they would put these
 pile of clothes on the floor</i>

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:32.858
<i> and they just start to put
 one layer after the other,</i>

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:35.728
<i> after the other, after the
 other and boom we go out.</i>

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.997
<i> So we go out, we
 break the thin ice</i>

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.866
<i> that have pile up in
 the night by boat.</i>

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.569
<i> We drive out and they
 are looking for--</i>

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.404
<i> what they like most is seal.</i>

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:47.406
<i> And they, you know,
 hunt with rifles.</i>

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.908
<i> They used to hunt
 with harpoons.</i>

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.543
<i> That was about
 30-40-50 years ago.</i>

00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:53.579
<i> So she's looking at
 this environment,</i>

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.016
<i> looking for little
 black spot to pop up.</i>

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.283
<i> By then when
 I took that picture</i>

00:01:58.283 --> 00:01:59.552
<i> I wasn't sure what
 we were looking for</i>

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.421
<i> because for four days we went
 and we didn't get anything.</i>

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.488
<i> It was quite depressing.</i>

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:03.589
<i> And then that day</i>

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.826
<i> we only got this ptarmigan,
 they are called, these birds.</i>

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:09.062
<i> Quite common there
 in the Arctic.</i>

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.996
<i> Then I see what she is
 doing in the kitchen.</i>

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:13.699
<i> She, you know, gut the birds,
 prepare them and stuff</i>

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.201
<i> and I am taking pictures
 and I am thinking,</i>

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.970
"this is not super
interesting, it doesn't--

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.472
it doesn't call
out for Arctic,

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.774
it's just not
working right now."

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:23.342
You know, it's the
beginning of the story

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:25.845
so I am impatient to try and
get something done here,

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.513
visually, that is telling.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:30.015
So I said, I asked
Dina, cooking, I said

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:33.019
"do you have anything like
more Arctic, like whale?"

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.054
And she's like, "yeah, I
got plenty of whale meat."

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.856
So, she popped out this
beautiful bag of...

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:40.960
<i> You know, I am like,
 "no, not working."</i>

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.464
( audience laughter )

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:46.966
Ah, yeah...

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.667
Well, I put that, it's
not a good picture but

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.502
it's just to show you the
struggle as a photographer

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:51.871
that you encounter some time.

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.907
You fly there, you have
these ideas of, you know,

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.140
they are going to
be with harpoon

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.809
throwing at whales and stuff,

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.077
and when you get
there it's just

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.945
plastic bag coming
out of the freezer.

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:03.215
- It doesn't work.
- ( audience laughter )

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:04.484
So then I turned
to Bent and I said,

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:08.154
"Dude, it's not working, I
am not getting anything,

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.588
you know, I need
to look at meat

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:11.991
and know which animals
it comes from."

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.360
He's like, "yeah, well, there's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.261
this place on the
edge of town...

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:18.564
Town, you know, the
settlement, the village,

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.166
where we keep a lot
of meat that we...

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:22.869
you know, that we you
know, we go and get.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.372
when we want more meat for us
or for animals, for the dogs."

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.473
I say, "yeah."

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:28.941
<i> We arrive at
 this wooden box,</i>

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:30.743
<i> he takes out the
 stones and lifts it</i>

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.845
<i> and there's this
 really pungent smell</i>

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:35.247
<i> of fat, and
 ocean and animal,</i>

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:36.382
<i>you know, that comes out of it.</i>

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.650
<i> And I am really
 excited, like "wow."</i>

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.552
<i> And then he starts to
 take out the stuff.</i>

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.521
<i> He sorts out what he's
 going to give to his dogs.</i>

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.789
<i> He sorts out and,
 you know, I look</i>

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.523
<i> at this and I'm
 like, "wow".</i>

00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:47.893
<i> This is killer whale jaw,
 you know, whale rib,</i>

00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:50.096
<i> bearded seal paw,
 these are all animals</i>

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:51.898
<i> that they have hunted
 during the migration</i>

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.632
<i> when whales come
 by their village.</i>

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:56.502
And for me it's telling.
Finally I got something.

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:57.637
<i> We return back,</i>

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.872
<i> he's going to give
 a good portion to the dogs</i>

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.342
<i> because the dogs help
 the Inuits hunting</i>

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:05.378
<i> and they always split
 the result of the hunt.</i>

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.848
<i> And, you know, stores
 most of it in the storage</i>

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:10.283
<i> gives some to the dogs</i>

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:13.152
<i> and goes and brings it
 to Dina for cooking.</i>

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:16.522
<i> And look at it when we return
 with meat to the village.</i>

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:19.458
( dogs barking )

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:20.560
You know, the
dogs are super excited

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.761
they know meal is coming.

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.963
<i> And so, you know, you
 walk around and you have</i>

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:27.566
<i> this puppy licking the fat off
 the fin of a killer whale.</i>

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:29.335
<i> Quite surreal in the night.</i>

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.205
But then I still needed to
get some hunting scene.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.406
You know something that
is telling what you see.

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:36.943
And then I hear about
this other hunter.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:40.613
<i> Magnus, who would
 often go hunting on canoe</i>

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.082
<i> because you can approach
 animals much more quietly.</i>

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.351
And I said, "hey, bring me on."

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.653
And it was quite a
terrifying experience.

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:50.289
I do a lot of kayaking,
I love kayaking.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.960
But not in, you know,
freezing cold water with...

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.260
thousands of dollars
of equipment

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.230
hanging around my neck, so...

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.066
<i> Matthieu : Ah, yes,
 I saw something here.</i>

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.702
<i> I think a little black spot.</i>

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.838
<i> Yeah, yeah, Magnus...</i>

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.608
<i> Magnus, here.</i>

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.645
That means head of a seal.

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:15.781
- Sign language.
- ( audience laughter )

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:18.484
<i> And so, that's right
 there, you see?</i>

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.585
<i> That's the head
 of a seal,</i>

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:22.188
<i> it comes out for about
 10-20 seconds</i>

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:24.190
<i> and then it would
 just dive back in.</i>

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.193
So, you have to be quick,
you have to be close.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:28.461
Also you need quiet sea

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.797
because if there's waves
you can't see the head

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.298
and so I am just
following behind.

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:33.832
And, you know, that day
we didn't get anything.

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.301
The next day after we
didn't get anything.

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.836
I went back on the...

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.705
on the boat with Bent and
Dina and then finally one day

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:40.939
<i> they got a seal.</i>

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.276
<i> And I had thought about
 that situation as</i>

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:45.778
<i> "wow, this is just gory and
 it's going to be difficult."</i>

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.947
<i> In fact, it is
 difficult because</i>

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:49.749
in the Inuit eating
means blood.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.284
There's going to be
spilling of blood.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.052
This is meat-only
diet traditionally.

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.722
The only thing you can maybe
eat are berries in summer

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:58.190
that is non-meat,
berries and a bit of seaweed,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.660
but otherwise you survive
on meat, that's all.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.894
And so it means,

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:03.896
you're the hunter,
but you're the butcher.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.832
<i>Everybody, all the hunters they
know how to butcher their meat.</i>

00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:10.336
<i> That's how you survive,
 traditionally in the Arctic.</i>

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:11.637
<i> That's how they have
 been doing that</i>

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.606
<i> and surviving for
 thousands of years.</i>

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.741
<i>One delicacy that they all love</i>

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:18.143
<i> is the liver of the seal.</i>

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:21.881
<i> And this is son of Bent
 having a piece of fresh liver</i>

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.350
<i> of the seal that his
 father brought back.</i>

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.618
<i> I tasted, it's very
 tasty like iron.</i>

00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:28.187
<i> It tastes like very strong.</i>

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.623
<i> For holidays and birthdays</i>

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.992
<i> then they really put an
 effort in</i>

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:35.428
<i> eating almost
 only traditional.</i>

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.863
<i> These are stuffed
 intestines and,</i>

00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:39.765
<i> you know, smoked seal meat.</i>

00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:42.635
<i> Muktuk it is called,
 it's the blubber of the whale.</i>

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:43.936
<i> There's some salmon also</i>

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:45.905
<i> you can see that they fish
 in summer and dry it.</i>

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.207
<i> They also eat musk-ox.</i>

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:51.610
<i> And this is a bit of a
 shocking image to many</i>

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.579
<i> but the kid doesn't
 seem troubled at all.</i>

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:54.980
( audience laughter )

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.850
<i> I was like, "whoa,
 what is that alien?"</i>

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.686
<i> It's the head of a polar bear,
 that his father hunted.</i>

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:04.690
It's legal to hunt polar bear
to a certain amount.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.058
I think it's about
30 polar bear

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.927
that can be killed
every year.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:11.063
Under very strict
situation, only by Inuits.

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:14.366
And it's a very important
traditional food.

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:15.901
What's interesting with
polar bear is that

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:17.703
the person who first
see the animal

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:19.404
will be the person
that gets all the meat.

00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:21.006
Not the guy who will kill it.

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:24.009
Bit of a feel good image
after that. You can all relax.

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.077
( audience laughter )

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:27.713
<i> And just imagine not knowing</i>

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:30.549
<i> not long ago for this Inuits,
 not knowing what it was.</i>

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:31.984
<i> It must have been
 just a ground for</i>

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:34.754
<i> just tons of religious,
 spiritual experiences.</i>
