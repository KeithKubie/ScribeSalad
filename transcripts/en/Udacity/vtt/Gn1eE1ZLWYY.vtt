00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.410
So now you see how in the coding region of the ABO Gene we can take a small

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.370
region. And see how it is turned from DNA into protein by playing into our

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.710
genetic code and coming up with those amino acids. Now, the interesting thing is

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.590
not everybody has the same sequence for the ABO Gene. Some people

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.780
have a different letter At position 796. So this is position

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.880
793, 94, 95, this would be position 796.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.810
This C, this cytosine right here. Some people

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.700
have a cytosine, but not everybody. So one

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.680
person has a variation where that position 796

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.024
is changed to an A. And another person has a variation where that position 796

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:50.800
cytosine is changed to a T. I want you to tell me which variant you think would

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.140
have a more significant change compared to this original sequence that

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670
we showed up here. Remember, make use of your genetic code here

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.960
that's given on the screen. If this is too small or

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590
you can't read it well. Then you can also click on the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.310
link in the instructor's notes to see, the full version of

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.373
the genetic code again. I want you to select which variant you

00:01:09.373 --> 00:01:12.635
think is a more significant change. And then I want you

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.538
to explain why you think that is in this textbox right here.
