00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:02.198
- [Voiceover] Rectangle ABCD is graphed

00:00:02.198 --> 00:00:03.608
in the coordinate plane.

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:05.811
The following are the
vertices of the rectangle,

00:00:05.811 --> 00:00:08.086
and they give us the labels
for the vertices as well.

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:09.549
Given these coordinates,
what is the length

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.359
of side AD of this rectangle?

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.404
So let's just plot it.

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:14.889
That's one way that we could tackle it.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.995
So let's, let me see,
all of these are actually

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:17.865
in the first coordinate,

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:20.444
so I could focus on the first coordinate.

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:23.974
So let's say that's my y-axis.

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:26.868
It's my y-axis, and let me draw my x-axis.

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:31.126
My x-axis, and actually
I wanna really focus in

00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:32.566
on the points A and D,

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.863
because we just need to
find the length of the side

00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:37.163
from point A to point D.

00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:39.925
So point A, let me do
this in another color.

00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:44.400
So point A is at x equals seven,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.654
y is equal to one.

00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:50.274
So one, two, three, four,

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:54.686
five, six, seven, so
that's x equals seven.

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:56.985
Y is equal to one.

00:00:56.985 --> 00:01:01.211
Y is equal to one, so that
is point A right over there.

00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:04.810
Point A, let me label it. Point A.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.643
And then where's point D?

00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:11.643
Point D has the exact same x-coordinate,

00:01:11.643 --> 00:01:13.862
but its y-coordinate
is a little bit higher.

00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:16.788
Its y-coordinate is six.
It's actually five higher.

00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:20.097
So point D is at x equals seven,

00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:22.721
y is equal to six.

00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:26.993
So y is equal to one, two, three,

00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:30.453
four, five, and six.

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:32.661
So that's y is equal to six,

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:34.704
and so we can draw the point.

00:01:34.704 --> 00:01:37.096
It is going to be right over here.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.093
This is point D,

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:41.600
and we could actually connect
them with a line, if we like,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.364
to show that this is
a side of a rectangle.

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:47.823
Let me draw that. I can
just draw this like this.

00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:48.868
And there you have it.

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:50.540
I haven't even drawn
the whole rectangle yet,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.212
but just by plotting these two points,

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.857
we can think about how long side AD is.

00:01:55.857 --> 00:01:59.131
We could say, look, the x
doesn't change going from A to D,

00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.405
but we do increase in
the y direction by five.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:06.863
We go from y is equal to
one to y is equal to five,

00:02:06.863 --> 00:02:08.604
to y is equal to six.

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:11.739
So our change in y is equal to five.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.596
So what's the length of this line?

00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:14.641
Well, it's gonna be five.

00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:17.567
It's gonna be five,
whatever the units are.

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.471
So that's the length of side AD.

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.212
It's going to be equal to five.

00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:24.881
We went from the point (7, 1)

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:28.990
to the point (7, 6).

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.709
Now, they said that this was a rectangle.

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.707
Now, just for our satisfaction,

00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:33.878
we can draw the entire rectangle.

00:02:33.878 --> 00:02:37.347
We have that point B
that is at x equals five,

00:02:37.347 --> 00:02:39.706
y is equal to one, so let me draw that.

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:41.888
And I'm just doing this just
for fun now at this point.

00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:44.001
We're done with the problem.

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:47.530
So x equals five, y equals
one. That's right over here.

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:51.942
That's point B.

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:55.611
Let me write B. That's the point (5, 1).

00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.490
And then we have the point C.
I'll do this in another color.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.462
The point C is at x
equals five, y equals six.

00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:04.643
X equals five, y equals six.

00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:07.452
Point C is right over here.

00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:11.957
Point C is the point x equals
five, y is equal to six.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.325
And then we could connect
all the dots, if we like,

00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:16.994
and clearly see that it is a rectangle.

00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:18.760
So I could connect those.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.082
I could connect these two.

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:22.754
Then I could connect these two.

00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:24.797
And then we see that we
indeed have a rectangle.

00:03:24.797 --> 00:03:26.840
But we answered it awhile
ago that the length

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.510
of side AD is equal to five.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.880
If we cared about the other sides,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.458
the length of BA, well, this is two.

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:36.755
a difference of two along the x direction,

00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:37.776
the horizontal direction,

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.796
difference of two along the x direction,

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:42.397
difference of five in the y direction.

00:03:42.397 --> 00:03:45.269
We go from y equals one to y equals six.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:45.983
So there you have it.

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:47.905
We actually will figure
out all of the dimensions

00:03:47.905 --> 00:03:49.274
of this rectangle.
