00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.214
Move the orange dot to
9/4 on the number line.

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:07.130
Let's think about this
number line right here.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.360
This is 0.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.230
This is 3.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.870
So this must be 1 and 2.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.660
We need to go to 9/4.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.690
So there's two ways
of thinking about 9/4.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.350
One way is to try to convert
it to a mixed number.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.810
4 goes into 9 two times.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.840
And you'll have 1 left over.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.340
So this you could
do as 2 and 1/4.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.410
So you could say, this is 1, 2.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.409
And then, we have to go 1/4
of the way between 2 and 3.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.840
So that looks like
about 2 and 1/4.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.440
So you could think
about it that way.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.960
Or you could even view it
as an improper fraction.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.790
So let's go by 1/4's.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:49.740
So that's 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4,
which is a whole, 5/4, 6/4,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.730
7/4, 8/4, which is
equal to 2 wholes.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.980
8 divided by 4 is 2.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.150
And then, we go from 8/4 to 9/4.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.410
Either way, we get to that exact
same point on the number line.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.800
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.720
Move the orange dot to
11/5 on the number line.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.680
So we can do it both ways again.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.989
5 goes into 11 two times.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.280
And then, you have 1 left over.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.660
So you could call
this 2 and 1/5.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.969
So we could go 1,
2, and then 1/5.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.510
Or we could just
think of it in terms

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.580
of 1/5's as an
improper fraction.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:35.740
1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5 is
a whole, 6/5, 7/5, 8/5, 9/5,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.050
10/5.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.480
10 divided by 5 is 2.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.530
10/5 is two wholes.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.440
10/5 and 11/5--
I'm having more fun

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.790
than I expected to
with this exercise.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.460
Let's do one more.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.010
Orange dot to 5/2
on the number line.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.300
So this is 1/2.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.480
This is 2/2, which is a whole.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.050
This is 3/2.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.010
This is 4/2, which
is two wholes.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.262
This is 5/2.

00:01:59.262 --> 00:02:01.220
Another way you could
have thought about it-- 2

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.890
goes into 5 two times
with a remainder 1.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.240
So this is 2 and 1/2
as a mixed number--

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.640
1, 2, and 1/2 as a mixed number.
