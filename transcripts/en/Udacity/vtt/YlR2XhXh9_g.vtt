00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.242
Of course, there are situations or life events that can bring on a depressive

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:07.623
episode. But for some people, depression just seems to come on without an

00:00:07.623 --> 00:00:12.110
external event. So, here we can see the interplay between our Neurochemistry

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.936
and our life circumstances. For example, people who are deficient in the

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:20.880
neurotransmitters seratonin and neuropeptide Y, are more likely to experience

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.050
depression following an extremely stressful event. Therefore, we can have two

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.830
people face the same stressful event and only the person who's deficient in

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.197
serotonin and neuropeptide y will actually result in depression. So, here we

00:00:37.197 --> 00:00:40.725
see the environment or nurture which is the stressful event and the

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:44.694
neurochemistry or nature, the lack of serotonin and neuropeptide Y and the

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:47.760
resulting depression.
