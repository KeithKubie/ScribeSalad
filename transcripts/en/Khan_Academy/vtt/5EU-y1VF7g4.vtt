00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.860
SAL: I've done a bunch of videos
where I use words like

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.150
pressure and-- let me write
these down-- pressure and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.950
temperature and volume.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.840
And I've done them in the
chemistry and physics

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.780
playlist. Especially the physics
playlist, but even in

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.220
the chemistry playlist, I also
use words like kinetic energy.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.120
I'll just write e for energy.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.280
Or I use force and velocity.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.940
And you know, a whole bunch of
other types of, I guess,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.300
properties of things, for
better or for worse.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.910
And in this video what I want
to do is I want to make a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.510
distinction.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.800
Because it becomes important
when we start getting a little

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.660
bit more precise, especially
when we get more precise in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.110
thermodynamics, or, I guess,
you know, the study of how

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.740
heat moves around.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.320
So these properties right
here, these are

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.655
properties of a system.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:02.085
Or we could call them
macrostates of a system.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.340
And these could be
macrostates.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.170
So for example, let me make it
clear, when I call a system,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.750
if I have some balloon like
this, and it has a little tie

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.410
there and, you know, maybe
it has a string.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.350
This has these macrostates
associated with it.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.060
There is some pressure
in that balloon.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.020
Remember that's force
per area.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.030
There is some temperature
for that balloon.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.850
And there's some volume to
the balloon, obviously.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.170
But all of these, these help
us relate what's going on

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.200
inside that balloon, or what
that balloon is doing in kind

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.560
of an every day reality.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.020
Before people even knew about
what an atom was, or maybe

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.830
they thought that there might
be such an atom but they had

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.910
never proved it, they were
dealing with these

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.820
macrostates.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.070
They could measure pressure,
they could measure

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.210
temperature, they could
measure volume.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.030
Now we know that that pressure
is due to things like, you

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.020
have a bunch of atoms
bumping around.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.870
And let's say that this is a
gas-- it's a balloon- it's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.170
going to be a gas.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.910
And we know that the pressure is
actually caused-- and I've

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.320
done several, I think I did
the same video in both the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.750
chemistry and the physics
playlist. I did them a year

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.670
apart, so you can see if my
thinking has evolved at all.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.790
But we know that the pressure's
really due by the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.280
bumps of these particles as they
bump into the walls and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.740
the side of the balloon.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.570
And we have so many particles
at any given point of time,

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.530
some of them are bumping into
the wall the balloon, and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.280
that's what's essentially
keeping the balloon pushed

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.260
outward, giving it its pressure
and its volume.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.790
We've talked about temperature,
as essentially

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.290
the average kinetic energy of
these-- which is a function of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.430
these particles, which could
be either the molecules of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.650
gas, or if it's an ideal gas,
it could be just the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.650
atoms of the gas.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.260
Maybe it's atoms of helium or
neon, or something like that.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.030
And all of these things, these
describe the microstates.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.440
So for example, I could describe
what's going on with

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.890
the balloon.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.510
I could say, hey, you know,
there are-- I could just make

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.500
up some numbers.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:29.040
The pressure is five newtons
per meters squared, or some

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.760
number of pascals.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.320
The units aren't what's
important.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.490
In this video I really
just want to make the

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.430
differentiation between these
two ways of describing

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.150
what's going on.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.640
I could say the temperature
is 300 kelvin.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.230
I could say that the volume
is, I don't know,

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.660
maybe it's one liter.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.020
And I've described a system,
but I've described in on a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.520
macro level.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.400
Now I could get a lot more
precise, especially now that

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.600
we know that things like atoms
and molecules exist. What I

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.690
could do, is I could essentially
label every one of

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.930
these molecules, or let's say
atoms, in the gas that's

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.810
contained in the balloon.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.570
And I could say, at exactly this
moment in time, I could

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:21.399
say at time equals 0, atom 1
has-- its momentum is equal to

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:27.760
x, and its position, in
three-dimensional coordinates,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.480
is x, y, and z.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.910
And then I could say, atom
number 2-- its momentum-- I'm

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.700
just using rho for momentum--
it's equal to y.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.050
And its position is a, b, c.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.270
And I could list every atom
in this molecule.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.300
Obviously we're dealing with a
huge number of atoms, on the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.320
order of 10 to the
20 something.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.580
So it's a massive list I would
have to give you, but I could

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.300
literally give you the state of
every atom in this balloon.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.280
And then if I did that, I
would be giving you the

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.790
microstates.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.550
Or I would give you a specific
microstate of the

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.280
balloon at this time.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.300
Now when a system-- and I'm
going to introduce a word

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.020
here, because this word is
important, especially as we

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.400
go-- is in thermodynamic
equilibrium.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.680
So let me write that down.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.550
Equilibrium.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.330
We learned about equilibrium
from the

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.390
chemistry point of view.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.680
And that tells you, that the
amount of something going into

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.620
forward reaction is equivalent
to the amount going in the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.890
reverse reaction.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.300
And when we talk about
macrostates, thermodynamic

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.820
equilibrium essentially
says that the

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.300
macrostate is defined.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.580
That they're not changing.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.260
If this balloon is in
equilibrium, at time 1 its

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.240
pressure, temperature, and
volume will be these things.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.690
And if we look at it a second
later, its pressure,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.340
temperature, and volume will
also be these things.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.870
It's in equilibrium.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.550
None of the macrostates
have changed.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.620
And actually, I'll talk about
in a second, in order for

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.180
these macrostates to even be
defined, to be well defined,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.270
you have to be in equilibrium.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.970
I'll talk about that
in a second.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.110
Now, at second number, at time
equals 0, you might have this

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.750
whole set of-- I went and
I listed 10 to the

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.680
20th-something microstates of
all the different atoms in

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.900
this molecule.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.120
But then if I look at these
gases a second later, I'm

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.280
going to have a completely
different microstate right?

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.210
Because all of these guys are
going to have bumped into each

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.640
other, and given each other
their momentum.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.770
And all sorts of crazy things
could have happened in a

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.530
second here, so I would have
a completely different

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.510
microstate.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.520
So even though we're at
thermodynamic equilibrium, and

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.320
our macrostate stayed the same,
our microstates are

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.770
changing every gazillionth
of a second.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.440
They're constantly changing.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.590
And that's why, for the most
part, in thermodynamic, we

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.370
tend to deal with these
macrostates.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.430
And actually most of
thermodynamics, or at least

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.510
most of what you'll learn in
a first-year chemistry or

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.210
physics course, it was devised
or it was thought about well

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.280
before people even had a sense
of what was going on at the

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.410
macro level.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.350
That's often a very important
thing to think about.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.430
And we'll go into concepts
like entropy and internal

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.930
energy, and things like that.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.040
And you can rack your brain, how
does it relate to atoms?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.320
And we will relate them to
atoms and molecules.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.980
But it's useful to think that
the people who first came up

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.680
with these concepts came up
with them not really being

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.890
sure of what was going on
at the micro level.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.860
They were just measuring
everything at the macro level.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.490
Now I want to go back to this
idea here, of equilibrium.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.370
Because in order for these
macrostates to be defined, the

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.140
system has to be
in equilibrium.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.800
And let me explain
what that means.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.220
If I were to take a cylinder.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.000
And we will be using this
cylinder a lot, so it's good

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.685
to get used to this cylinder.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.210
And it's got a piston in it.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.840
And that's just, it's kind of
the roof of the cylinder can

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.830
move up and down.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.510
This is the roof of
the cylinder.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.780
The cylinder's bigger, but let's
say this is a, kind of a

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.850
roof of the cylinder.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.550
And we can move this
up and down.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.420
And essentially we'll just be
changing the volume of the

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.260
cylinder, right?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.150
I could have drawn
it this way.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.400
I could have drawn it
like a cylinder.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.950
I could have drawn it like this,
and then I could have

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.490
drawn the piston like this.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.210
So there's some depth here
that I'm not showing.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.220
We're just looking at the
cylinder front on.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.130
And so, at any point in time,
let's say the gas is between

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.099
the cylinder and the floor
of our container.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.140
You know, we have a bunch of
molecules of gas here, a huge

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.250
number of molecules.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:52.200
And let's say that we have
a rock on the cylinder.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.170
We're doing this in space
so everything above

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.480
the piston is a vacuum.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.070
Actually just let me erase
everything above.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.110
Let me just erase this stuff,
just so you see.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.410
We're doing this in space and
we're doing it in a vacuum.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.990
Just let me write that down.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:13.500
So all of this stuff up here is
a vacuum, which essentially

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.940
says there's nothing there.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.380
There's no pressure from here,
there's no particles here,

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.410
just empty space.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.410
And in order to keep this-- we
know already, we've studied it

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.710
multiple times, that this gas is
generating, you know things

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.800
are bumping into the wall,
the floor of this

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.240
piston all the time.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.390
They're bumping into
everything, right?

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.850
We know that's continuously
happening.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.970
So we would apply some pressure
to offset the

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.350
pressure being generated
by the gas.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.110
Otherwise the piston
would just expand.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.380
It would just move up and the
whole gas would expand.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.920
So let's just say we stick a
big rock or a big weight on

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.440
top of-- let me do it in a
different color-- We put a big

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:58.580
weight on top of this piston,
where the force-- completely

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.100
offsets the force being
applied by the gas.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.370
And obviously this is some force
over some area-- right,

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.240
the area of the piston-- over
some areas so that we could

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.070
figure out its pressure.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.020
And that pressure will
completely offset the pressure

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.940
of the gas.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.720
But the pressure of the gas,
just as a reminder, is going

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.370
in every direction.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.230
The pressure on this plate is
the same as the pressure on

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:22.250
that side, or on that side, or
on the bottom of the container

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.510
that we're dealing with.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.450
Now let's say that we were to
just evaporate this-- well

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.330
let's not say that we
evaporate the rock.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.220
Let's say that we just evaporate
half of the rock

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.560
immediately.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.630
So all of a sudden our weight
that's being pushed down, or

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.700
the force that's being pushed
down just goes to half

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.270
immediately.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.630
Let me draw that.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.850
So I have-- maybe I would be
better off just cut and

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.980
pasting this right here.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.610
So if I copy and paste it.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.392
So now I'm going to evaporate
half of that rock magically.

00:10:56.392 --> 00:10:59.980
So let me take my eraser tool.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.190
And I just evaporate
half of it.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.180
And now what's going
to happen?

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:11.110
Well, this piston is now
applying half the force.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.150
It can't offset the pressure
due to this gas.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.430
So this whole thing is going
to be pushed upwards.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.240
But I did it so fast. I did it
so fast. And you could try it.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.220
I mean, this would be truth
of a lot of things.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.300
If you had a weight hanging from
a spring, and you would

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.610
just remove half the weight, it
wouldn't just go very, you

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.940
know, nice and smoothly
to another state.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.920
What's going to happen is--
and let me see if I can do

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.070
this using their cut and paste
tool-- it'll essentially,

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.660
right when I evaporate half of
it, the gas is going to expand

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.945
a bunch, and then this weight
is going to come back down,

00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:41.590
it's going to spring
and go down.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.570
So let me do it again.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.260
It's going to expand, because
that gas is going to push up,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.750
and then it's going
to come back down.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.020
And then, it's just going to
oscillate a little bit.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.330
And then eventually it'll come
back to some stable and maybe

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.490
it'll go back.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.680
It'll look, like right
about there.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.380
And let me fill this in.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.605
This shouldn't be white,
it should be black.

00:12:01.605 --> 00:12:04.605
Let me put some walls on
it, on the container.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.240
So if we wait long enough,
eventually we'll get to

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.720
another equilibrium state, where
this thing, the piston

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.570
on top isn't, or the ceiling
isn't moving anymore.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.810
And now the gas has filled
this container.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.850
Now, at this point in time
we were in equilibrium.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.520
The pressure throughout
the gas was the same.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.960
The temperature throughout
the gas was the same.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.720
The volume was in a
stable situation.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.860
It wasn't changing from
second to second.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.050
So because of that, our
macrostates were well defined.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.750
Now, when we wait long enough,
this thing will get to some

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.600
stability where this
thing stops moving.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.440
When this thing stops moving
our volume stops changing.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.760
And hopefully our pressure will
start to become uniform

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.800
throughout the container.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.290
And our temperature will
become uniform.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.240
And we'll now be a higher volume
or lower pressure,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.160
probably a lower temperature if
we assume that there's no

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.870
other heat being added
to the system.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.580
And then we'll be well
defined again.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.140
So we could say what the
pressure, and the volume, and

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.070
the temperature's going to be.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.880
But what about right when
I removed this rock?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.030
And this thing flew up and it
oscillated, and for a while

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.080
the pressure at the top
was lower than the

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.790
pressure down here.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.750
Maybe the temperature at the
top was lower than the

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.930
temperature down here.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.740
The whole thing was in
a state of flux.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.440
It was not an equilibrium.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.390
And at that point, when we're--
let me let me draw

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.110
that really-- so you know, when
we were in that state,

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.140
where everything was just
crazy, right when we

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.840
evaporated the rock.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.560
You know, we have a little
rock up here.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.490
Everything is going
up and down.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.320
Maybe the pressure up here
was lower than the

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.820
pressure down here.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.610
Everything did not have
a chance to reach an

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.560
equilibrium.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.950
At this state-- and this is
important, especially as we go

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.570
into talking about things like
reversible reactions, and

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.580
reversible processes, and
quasi-static processes.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.100
At this point in the reaction,
when we just did this, none of

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.030
these macrostates were
well defined.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.350
You couldn't tell me what the
volume of this system is,

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.720
because it's changing for every
second to second, or

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.000
microsecond to microsecond,
it's fluctuating.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.110
You couldn't tell me what the
pressure of the system is,

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.950
because it's changing
every second.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.300
You couldn't tell me what
the temperature is.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.380
Maybe the temperature could
be something there.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.880
It could be something there.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.900
All sorts of crazy things
are happening.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.500
So when the system is in
a state of flux, your

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.670
macrostates are not
well defined.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.690
And I really want to hit
that point home.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.190
So me just draw that
in a diagram.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.450
Let me draw that in
a PV diagram.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.340
And we're going to use
these fairly heavily.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.300
So on my y-axis I'm going
to put pressure.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.500
In my x-axis I'm going
to put volume.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.720
So our initial state here, when
we had the rock sitting

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.420
on top of the ceiling, this
movable ceiling or this

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.100
piston, maybe we had
some well-defined

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.090
pressure and volume.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.420
So my y, this is pressure
and this is volume.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.260
So this is where
we started off.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.800
So it was well defined.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.050
This is state 1.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.500
Let me label it right there.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.270
Now when we evaporated half the
rock, we eventually waited

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.580
long enough, and this got
to an equilibrium.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.560
We got to state 2, and our
pressure volume and out

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.310
temperature was well defined.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.670
And I'll just put it on
this pressure volume.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.630
So maybe this is state 2.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.500
We got down here.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.920
And just as an aside, I could
maybe put temperature as an

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.690
extra dimension, but temperature
is completely

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.420
determined by pressure and
volume, especially if we're

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.030
dealing with an ideal gas.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.470
Remember, and we did this in
multiple videos, you have PV

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:55.300
is equal to nRT.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.750
These are constants.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.260
The number of moles
isn't changing.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.710
This is the universal gas
constant, not changing.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.180
So if you know P and
V you know T.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.110
So that's the only two things
we have to plot.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.460
But I'll talk a lot more about
that in future videos.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.020
But the important thing to
realize is, I started off at

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.750
this state, where pressure and
volume were well defined.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.980
I finished in this state, where
pressure and volume were

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.210
well defined.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.810
But how did I get there?

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.220
And because this reaction I
did, all of a sudden it

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.960
happened super fast, and it was
essentially thrown out of

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.210
equilibrium.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.650
I don't know how I got here.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.960
The pressure and volume were
not well defined from going

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.090
from that state to this state.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.500
Pressure, volume, and
temperature are only well

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:50.580
defined if every intermediate
step is still almost in

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.190
equilibrium.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.950
And we'll talk a lot more about
that in the next video.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.500
But I want to really make
this point home.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.390
It would be nice if we
could draw some path.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:02.240
We could say, we moved from some
pressure and volume to

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.339
some other pressure and volume,
and we moved along a

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.720
well-defined path.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.410
But we cannot say that.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.240
Because when we went from there
there, our definitions

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.910
just disappeared for pressure
and volume.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.839
We cannot define those
macrostates in these

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.000
intermediate non-equilibrium
states.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.560
Now, just as a little aside,
we could have defined the

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.800
microstates.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.230
The microstates never change.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.950
At any given snapshot in time,
I could have listed every

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.470
particle that's in this thing.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.310
And I could have given you
its kinetic energy.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.890
I could have given
you its position.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.780
I could have given
you its momentum.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.900
And there's no reason why I
couldn't have done that.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.920
So I could have actually
made a plot of

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.270
one particular particle.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.980
And I could have said what its
kinetic energy, and over a

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.170
course of time, is at any
given moment in time.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.110
And this is really important.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.690
So microstates are always
well defined.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.330
The microstate is what's exactly
happening to the atom

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.970
in terms of its force and its
velocity and its momentum.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.800
While macrostates are only
defined, I should say well

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.260
defined, when the system-- in
this case it's the balloon, in

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.060
this case it's this piston on
top of this cylinder, this

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.730
movable ceiling-- the
macrostates are only well

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.700
defined when the system is in
equilibrium, or when you can

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.390
essentially say, the pressure is
x, the pressure is the same

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.920
throughout.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.950
Or the volume isn't changing
from moment to moment.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.000
Or the temperature is the
same thing throughout.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.870
Anyway, I'll leave you there and
we'll talk more about why

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.320
I went through all this pain
in the next video.
