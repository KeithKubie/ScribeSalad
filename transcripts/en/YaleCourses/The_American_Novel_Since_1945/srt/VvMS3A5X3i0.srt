1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,360
My first lecture on the
known world focused on the
question of knowledge and the

2
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:11,200
problems of knowledge that
the text raises for us, uh,

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,110
through out both at the formal
level and at the thematic level,

4
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:19,620
so I ended up with a reading of the

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,270
account of the Broussard trial and how
more and more detailed knowledge comes to

6
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,980
us through the voice of the narrator
and were really left for that question.

7
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:33,750
Where does that knowledge come from?

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,770
Now I suggested in the first lecture
that my second lecture was going to be

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,920
about an equally abstract subject and
that is how how can anything exist in the

10
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,800
world. I'm going to get that to that
about in the middle of the lecture.

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,010
Beginning from this question though where
we ended last time about the Broussard

12
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,110
trial and the problem of knowledge
where knowledge comes from.

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,200
If we look a little bit earlier in the
passage about the Broussard trial on one

14
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:06,201
7,172 you find what I think is quite a
striking model for the very problem of

15
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:09,930
this novel as a whole.

16
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,820
And this is when Skiffington
is trying to write an account

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,160
of Broussard's crime,

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,880
and here it is on the bottom of one 71

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,920
he's having trouble filling out this form.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,340
Skiffington picked up
the list of questions.

21
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,010
Now he would have to start all over again.

22
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,680
Nature of the alleged crime.

23
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,680
Are there witnesses to the alleged crime?

24
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,830
Can such witnesses be believed?

25
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,970
So the problem of evidence and the
problem of whether witnesses are to be

26
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:56,020
trusted,
the problem of enumerating a crime,

27
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,540
these are all problems that the novel
as a whole takes up for the crime of

28
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,374
slavery.

29
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,940
Yeah.

30
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,580
So we can think of the novel itself as
a version of Skiffington [inaudible]

31
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,783
report.

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,010
Now it's important that Skiffington
has such a problem writing it.

33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,860
The very difficulty of writing is the
Matteis over and over and over again.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Not just in moments like this where
it's actually talking about writing,

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,300
but I'm going to argue,
uh,

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,390
in a number of ways that are much more
subtle and to show you one of them.

37
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,300
I want to look on one side,
one 92 with you.

38
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,610
This is the scene where Stanford,

39
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,440
the slave is trying to remember
the names of his parents

40
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,010
and this is how he does it.

41
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,560
This is the middle of one 92.

42
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,413
Yeah.

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,080
He closed his eyes and took his parents
in his hands and put them all about the

44
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:09,030
plantation where he had last seen them,

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,320
his mother in his left hand and
his father in his right hand,

46
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,150
but that did not feel right.

47
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,160
And so he put his father in his left
hand and his mother in his right hand and

48
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:24,030
that felt better.
He set them outside the smoke house,

49
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:25,800
which had a hole in the roof in the back.

50
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,650
Hands come down that hole
and take you to the devil.

51
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,450
And older boy had once told him Stanford
was five and it had been on not been

52
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:38,010
long since his parents had been sold away.
And you get more of the story.

53
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,130
And he finally,
uh,

54
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,990
to remember the parents' names,
his parents' names.

55
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,470
Why does he take them
in these specific hands?

56
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,010
His father in his right hand
and his mother in his left
that did not feel right.

57
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,350
So he put his father in his left
and his mother in the right.

58
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,780
I would argue that this is for
two reasons, a figure of Jones,

59
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,560
his own writing. Uh, first of all,

60
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:15,561
in the obvious sense that it's an act
of recovery of recovering a past that

61
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:19,230
needs to be imagined or
somehow entered into,

62
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:23,730
not through rational thought,
but through an imaginative act.

63
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,160
So that's one reason that Stanford
in this moment is a double of Jones.

64
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,570
But the other reason is this
handedness that's noted.

65
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,690
Uh, I'm going to tell you throughout
the lecture a few things about Jones,

66
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:41,490
his life and his work
outside of this novel.

67
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,750
And so here's the first
piece of that story. Um,

68
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,160
Edward P.

69
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Jones was the son of a very
poor single mother living in DC.

70
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,210
He had a younger brother
who was mentally disabled,

71
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,630
who had to be given away to an institution
because the mother could not support

72
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,560
him. Uh, Jones, his mother was illiterate.

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,600
Okay.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,600
So here is someone writing this novel
and his background is an illiterate

75
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:21,600
mother.
This matters enormously to him.

76
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,490
He in his first story
collection and has, uh, has a,

77
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,920
a story called,
I think it's called first day,

78
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,760
where he tells the story of a young girl
going off to school for the first time,

79
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,260
holding the hand of her illiterate mother
Jones reveres his mother when he talks

80
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:44,820
about her.
Uh,

81
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:48,570
it's with incredible reverence and love.

82
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,160
Jones sees his mother very much
as a source of his writing.

83
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,210
So here's that first tension in the of
writing that here is a writer who takes

84
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,950
as his source spiritual source,

85
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,990
an illiterate woman.

86
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,340
That's why the mother has to go
in his right hand in this scene.

87
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,990
Now. Um, of course not everybody
writes with their right hand,

88
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,620
but I think no matter whether
Jones his right or left handed,

89
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:27,620
and I think Andy Hazel for
pointing out our wonderful ta,

90
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,970
Andy Hazel for pointing out that in the
photograph of Jones he is wearing his

91
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:36,770
watch on his left hand.
And so this would suggest

92
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,390
that he is perhaps right handed,

93
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,850
but even if we didn't want to rely,
Oh Neil,

94
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,360
you're going to give me trouble.
Um,

95
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,210
even if you did not want to rely
on that little piece of evidence,

96
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,720
we can say that in the cultural
vocabulary of handedness,

97
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,780
the dominant hand is the
right hand for writing.

98
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,130
So I would say that whenever you see
right handedness or left to right movement

99
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,010
Jones is meditating on and
figuring the act of writing.

100
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,190
And I'm going to show you some more
examples because it's quite striking.

101
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,290
It's subtle and strange
but quite striking. So the,

102
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,380
the mother has to go on the right hand
because she is the source of inspiration.

103
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,150
The Father Jones,
his father was very distant.

104
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:37,100
He only met him when he was much older
and he was not really a part of Jones his

105
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:40,190
life at all. Uh, it really
revolved around his mother.

106
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,780
So if writing is undermined by the
shadow of illiteracy for Jones,

107
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,480
it's undermined in other ways too.

108
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,660
And I want to look at one
of those stranger episodes.

109
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,850
This is on one 40 to one 43.

110
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,120
Okay.

111
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,660
Um,

112
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,660
this was the story of how Henry began
to court Caledonia at for Nelsons dinner

113
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:12,980
table. And this is a very, um,

114
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,040
detailed scene.
This is in the middle of one 42.

115
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,340
He's telling Caledonia that she needs
to look up when she rides her horse.

116
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,300
He took the pepper
Shaker in his right hand,

117
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,310
extended his arm before him and
move the arm from right to left.

118
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,430
Everyone at the table
was now watching him.

119
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,890
The hand with the Shaker moved smoothly,

120
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,390
gracefully from the right to the left.
That's how everyone else,

121
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,780
everybody else rides. Henry
said, me and everybody else,

122
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,680
Henry put the pepper Shaker in
his left hand, tipped it and Ooh,

123
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,700
moved his arm less gracefully from
the left to the right as it moved,

124
00:08:56,071 --> 00:09:00,840
pepper poured out of the shaker onto
ferns, white tablecloth. He said,

125
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,240
I'm sorry to say this,
but that's how you ride.

126
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,220
Henry did this with the Shaker several
times going from right to left,

127
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,640
the pepper Shaker was upright,
but going from left to right,

128
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,440
the pepper flowed down for and thought
there was something rather sad about the

129
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:20,310
pepper falling and it was all the sadder
because it really didn't have to be

130
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:24,780
that way. She said to Anderson,
the pamphlet here from Canada,

131
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,740
it was, this was his clumsy
way of telling Caledonia.

132
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,830
She was losing something
by not looking up.

133
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,330
How odd that insistence on
the movement left to right,

134
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,680
right to left.

135
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,040
It figures Henry's mixed up relation to
both language and the act of creation.

136
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,470
It's mixed up because when he's moving
in the direction that text is read,

137
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,400
read and written left to right,
he's using his left hand and the,

138
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,930
the uh,

139
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,670
corroborative of that left handedness
of his relation to language is in the

140
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:10,200
dialect. He doesn't speak
correctly in fern Alston's house,

141
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,140
no matter how hard she tries to teach him.

142
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,620
Okay,

143
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,620
so he is clumsy not only in
spilling pepper on the table,

144
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:23,410
but also in not being able
to speak proper English.

145
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,730
But the other thing about that movement
is that when it goes left to right,

146
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,780
pepper spills on the table, this is
an image of ink flowing out of a pen.

147
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,590
It is black on the white tablecloth and
it's an image for language in jeopardy

148
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,710
because of course it's dust, it's
powder, it will never cohere.

149
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,670
It's the sign of his
uncouth table manners.

150
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,200
So it's never going to be a redemptive
medium for him and it's represented by

151
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,120
this pepper that then he can
a scrape into a little pile.

152
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,520
This is the fragmentation of
language in it's very literal sense.

153
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,303
Yeah.

154
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,810
There are other examples of this.

155
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,820
I'm in one 80 on one 89 when you get
the first account of the frozen dog that

156
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:25,490
Calvin is so interested in
in the photograph from New York.

157
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,700
Yeah.

158
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,530
Once again,
direction is,

159
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,210
is carefully noted in the front yard
alone was a dog looking off to the right.

160
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,740
The dog was standing its tail sticking
straight out as if ready to go at the

161
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,910
first word from someone on the
porch and I'm going to skip down.

162
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,430
He had a very tiny hope that
when he got to New York,

163
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,290
he might be able to find the house and
those people and that dog and learn what

164
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,430
had transfixed him.

165
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,270
There was a whole off to the right that
the photograph had not captured off to

166
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:03,480
the right is the direction of
flowing narrative, a world,

167
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,490
a possible world that his imagination is
drawn to and it's a visual image of the

168
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:14,440
imagination and it's seduction,

169
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,250
but because of this obsessive direction
noting I would read it as a textual

170
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,730
imagination that there's a narrative off
to the right and you can see that Jones

171
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:31,390
is novel,
works this way.

172
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,990
There's always a narrative
proximate to wherever you are,

173
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,350
a little narrative that arises from the
next character who shows up on the road

174
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,790
and you'll get that narrative.

175
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,720
So this is just one of those that
doesn't quite get articulated,

176
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:49,480
but Calvin can imagine that it's there.

177
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:54,481
He can see as if he can see the form
of the novel that Jones is writing.

178
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,520
And then there are just even
tinier ones on one 62 um,

179
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,190
this is John Skiffington

180
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,610
sitting and reading the Bible.
After visiting Clara's house,

181
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,860
Skiffington looked up and followed a
male cardinal as it flew from the left to

182
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,410
right and settled in
one of the peach trees.

183
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,680
They're all over the place
once you start noticing them.

184
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,220
So I think this is why that it's a
constant meditation among the multiplying

185
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:33,961
versions of meditations on the composition
of this novel within the novel.

186
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,520
So we'll get to some others.

187
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,110
The problem is that the written
word is always threatened.

188
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,220
So if writing has all this
static that surrounds it,

189
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,510
it also has some more direct
and aggressive enemies.

190
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,530
And on three 75,
you see one version of that.

191
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,470
This is the account of Barnum Kinsey's
grave marker that his son makes

192
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,020
after they leave Manchester
County and he dies.

193
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,560
This is the bottom of three 74 Matthew
stayed up all the night before he was

194
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:20,981
buried.

195
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:25,840
This is Kenzie son putting his
father's history on a wooden tombstone.

196
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,800
He began with his father's name on the
first line and on the next he put the

197
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,210
years of the father's coming and going.

198
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,780
Then all the things he
knew his father had been,

199
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,620
and then lists this whole set of things.

200
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:42,730
The boy filled up the whole piece of wood
and at the end of the last line he put

201
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,940
a period his father's grave would remain,

202
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,730
but the wooden marker would not last out.

203
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:53,690
The year text is fragile
as a material object.

204
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,650
So that's what this scene
tells us in a poignant way.

205
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,890
But of course the most poignant example
of this is when Augustus is free.

206
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,560
Papers are eaten by Travis.

207
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,940
So the real terror of the
written word comes in that scene.

208
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,230
Now the terror is of course
that it's an exercise of power,

209
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,140
arbitrary,
violent.

210
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,940
It will end in Augustus's
death back in slavery.

211
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,440
There are lots of ways of
imagining what the terrorism,

212
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm going to go into some of them,

213
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,160
but this is the sign of it
that even though Augustus
has memorized every word of

214
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:46,320
his free papers,

215
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:50,160
remember we're told that he has them
read to him every day for a month.

216
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,330
He's illiterate.

217
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,840
He has them read to him every day
for a month until he has them totally

218
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:57,240
memorized,
after he gets his freedom,

219
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,500
even though those words
will exist forever.

220
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,480
In Augustus's mind,

221
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,620
his freedom is nowhere once
the written word has gone.

222
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,790
So this is my question. How can
something exists in the world here?

223
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:20,030
The ultimate thing to which that
question applies is freedom.

224
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,320
How can freedom exist?

225
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,740
What makes Freedom Exist?
Well,

226
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:33,480
in the law, those free papers
make freedom exist for Augustus,

227
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,080
but the law cannot guarantee
that freedom exists.

228
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:43,320
When the physical artifact
of the text is gone.

229
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,190
That's how weak writing is.

230
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,190
It seems to be everything.

231
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,530
This is something that Mildred understood,
uh,

232
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,360
quite early on,
on one 13,

233
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,260
when she and Augustus are worried
about Henry hanging out with Robin's,

234
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,510
she says in suggesting that it's okay
to let Henry go about with William

235
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,580
Robbins, them free papers. He
carried with him all over the place.

236
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,250
Don't carry enough freedom.

237
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,220
She said to her husband
with slavery behind him,

238
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,320
she wanted her son to go about and
see what had always been denied him.

239
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,330
Yeah.

240
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,630
So she wants the world to
be a big place for him.

241
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,890
She sees that freedom is something
much more than those papers.

242
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,100
But the problem is that freedom cannot
be without them and that once they're

243
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,570
gone,
it is gone too.

244
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,110
So that is one of the threats
that is associated with writing,

245
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,960
but there are more of them.
Um,

246
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,960
on three 11 and three,
12,

247
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,380
one danger is that it's simply in
the effort to write justice in law.

248
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,840
It's simply ineffective.

249
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,510
So here is the story we get of

250
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,990
Skiffington trying to write up this crime,
the crime of selling Augustus,

251
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:28,850
a free man back into slavery.
This is on three 12. Um,

252
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,300
he's been in contact with,
uh,

253
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,510
a man named Sanderson in,
uh,

254
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,620
I think it sees in Georgia.

255
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,880
You got a letter from Sanderson three
days after that the crime had indeed been

256
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:44,301
committed.

257
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:47,960
He wrote and Sanderson included material
he had copied from book saying so.

258
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,720
So skiffington wasn't sure
whether it was really a crime.

259
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:55,430
Somehow he began to get confused and you
can see that confusion. I won't read it,

260
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,540
uh, on the prior page on three
11 in the middle of the page. Um,

261
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,650
so when Skiffington once again starts
writing up the crime, he becomes confused.

262
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:06,740
Did he really have a crime to describe?

263
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,500
He gets confirmation that he does,

264
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,570
but skiffington heard from Richmond.
Yes. It's a letter from Richmond again,

265
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,900
four days later in handwriting,
he did not recognize a grace.

266
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:21,950
Yella Sanderson let him know that her
husband Harry was dead and that he was now

267
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,410
she was now charged with
keeping up his correspondence.

268
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,690
He read the eight page letter twice,

269
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,020
but he found nothing in it
about what Virginia was doing,

270
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,880
about the crime of selling free negroes.
The widow told him about her husband,

271
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,440
how she had met him when he vacationed
in Italy, how he had wooed her,

272
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,700
brought her to America after their
wedding and made her a happy woman in

273
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:48,701
Richmond quote where the governor is in
residence quote and then she closes with

274
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,500
comments about the weather.

275
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,370
Yeah,

276
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,370
so the law's effort to deliver justice
through the writing of a crime.

277
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,600
The documenting of a crime is displaced
by a woman's effort to recover her last

278
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,560
husband by telling that story.

279
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,640
So there are competing claims
on language in this scene,

280
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,880
the widows and Skiffington ins and more
distantly Augustus's and Mildred's.

281
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,990
None of these claims are adjudicated in
any kind of way that puts one above the

282
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:32,260
other. And skiffington
is weakness, of course,

283
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:36,110
is that he will never seek to right.
That balance,

284
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,390
he resigns himself to
the weakness of writing

285
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,840
more chillingly.
I think more complicating Lee

286
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,060
writing also carries the risk of
reinstating the master slave relationship

287
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,910
and I think it does this by direct
reference back to Jones himself.

288
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:14,370
If you read slowly through the scene of
Augustus being sold back into slavery,

289
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,130
it's quite striking.

290
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,310
The way contingency or happenstance
plays a part in the scene.

291
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,830
So after Travis has
eaten Augustus's papers,

292
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,090
this is at the very bottom of two 12 a
wagon twice as large as Augustus's came

293
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:43,540
up to the four men driving.
It was a large black man and beside him,

294
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,400
a much smaller white man.

295
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,940
And Travis teases Darcy,

296
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,420
the slave trader about how he's
never known the time in his life,

297
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,990
but suddenly here he is
at exactly the right time.

298
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,330
Then he later says,

299
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:05,500
as he's formulating the idea
of selling Augustus to Darcy,

300
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,910
he says,
God works in mysterious ways.

301
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,990
This ain't exactly what I had in
mind when I stopped this nigger,

302
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,660
but this year we'll do just the same.

303
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,440
Who made that wagon appear?
Why does that wagon appear?

304
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,130
Jones made that wagon appear.

305
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,320
What we're given is not a fiction about
Travis intending to sell Augustus back

306
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,160
into slavery,

307
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,410
but what we're given instead
is a surprise on the road.

308
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,470
Who makes that surprise
appear only one person,

309
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:49,750
the person in charge of
making the narrative.

310
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,630
So the problem with writing is not
just that it's shadowed by the fact of

311
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:03,640
illiteracy. It's not just that
it's vulnerable to physical decay.

312
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,700
It's not just that it's weak and it
can't make anything exist in law.

313
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,290
It's not just that it's
demanded by multiple people
for different purposes that

314
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:23,440
come to cancel each other out.
It's that by writing,

315
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,190
by taking on that
quality of masterfulness,

316
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,040
you begin to be complicit in the
very crime that you're describing.

317
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,020
The imagery of God looking down on his
creation is everywhere in this novel.

318
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,640
And it's to all kinds of characters,
uh,

319
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,660
including,
uh,

320
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,500
including Henry who thinks that he will
look down on his slaves the way God

321
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:00,590
looks down on his creation from heaven.

322
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,510
That position of mastery
and that geographic remove
of being above your subject

323
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,240
is associated with the slave master,

324
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,970
but it's associated very much with Jones.

325
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,610
And I'll come back to this, uh, in a
minute when I talk about the tapestry,

326
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:27,611
because of course the tapestry at the
end of the novel Alesis tapestry is the

327
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:30,050
most dramatic figure for the whole novel.

328
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,550
There are lots of figures for the novel,
including the map of the known world,

329
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,010
but foremost that tapestry at the end,
which mimics the,

330
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,350
the novel in,
in every way.

331
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,050
Even that has the perspective
of little figures looking up.

332
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,250
So it even puts Alice in that masterful
position or indeed anyone who looks upon

333
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:56,720
that tapestry.

334
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,610
So if writing is so weak,

335
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,670
if it entails such terror,

336
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,940
are we given any alternative
for creative durability?

337
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,680
And I think we are in
the plastic arts now. Uh,

338
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,090
I'm sure you've noticed how much
carving goes on in the book,

339
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:25,070
not just because Augustus is a
woodworker, but you know, because, uh,

340
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:28,250
Elias carbs for Celeste,

341
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:32,420
that's his first act of love.
And if you read John's a story,

342
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,840
this is a rampant in his stories.

343
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,490
He has carvers everywhere and
various kinds of workers in,

344
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,630
in plastic arts. Alice's, another
example, working in textiles,

345
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:49,631
clay paint some amalgamation
of a sculpture and painting.

346
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,253
Yeah.

347
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,350
On to 79,
the two arts,

348
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,890
the verbal art and woodworking are
put in competition with one another or

349
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,500
injects to position with one
another. And I think you see, uh,

350
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,670
who has the upper hand here.
This is an account of

351
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,680
Skiffington bookcase,
which Augustus made.

352
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:16,840
Yeah.

353
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,760
In winter, Fred and John
Skiffington, his parlor,

354
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:20,920
there was a wondrous
looking bookcase case,

355
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,950
lovely oak alions Groundling face at
each edge of the top ends three shelves,

356
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:30,910
the second hand item made by Augustus
towns in La not long after Augustus bought

357
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:31,744
his freedom.

358
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,800
He had first thought he would keep it
for himself and the family he would buy

359
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:38,710
out of slavery,
though none of them could read them.

360
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,380
He and Mildred would never learn to read.

361
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:45,000
There's that shadow of our
attention is called to it.

362
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:47,070
The minute the books are mentioned,

363
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,150
he would keep it as a kind of symbol
for his determination to get them.

364
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,500
But then he realized that what he could
get for the bookcase would bring his

365
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:59,490
wife and child closer to him.
So he put a price on it, $15.

366
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,420
It had been originally sold to a man
of two slaves who lost his sight.

367
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,230
Another risk to reading.
You can go blind.

368
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,300
And so as he told Skiffington lost
his hunger and thirst for books.

369
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,450
Skiffington bought it for $5.

370
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Augustus's art is durable.

371
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:27,000
It can be passed from person to person
and it maintains it's figurative power.

372
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:30,270
It's important that all
of his work is figurative.

373
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,670
It suggests narrative.

374
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,270
And so it's aligned with
Jones art in that way,

375
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,620
but it is not subject to
the vulnerability of texts.

376
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:46,621
And here in this bookcase you see the
vulnerability of texts set right next to

377
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,210
the wondrous durability of the bookcase.

378
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,810
There are other examples,
um,

379
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,030
when Rita is discovered and
the box of walking sticks,

380
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,030
when she sent in a box out
of slavery to New York,

381
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,240
she hands the boy who
is looking down at her,

382
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,790
the walking stick with Adam and
eve and all their generations.

383
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,340
It's as if in that act,

384
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,130
Rita's freedom is instantiated,

385
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,560
that she and all her descendants
emerge into this new world.

386
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,210
And that that is a kind of gift to the
family that takes them in, in the north.

387
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,630
So it has a very evocative narrative power
that doesn't depend on people's being

388
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:35,340
able to read it.

389
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,750
And we're told in that scene that the
boy receives it as if this is what he had

390
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:43,410
been waiting for.
All along suggests a perfect receptivity.

391
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,040
No going blind here.
Perfect receptivity.

392
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,493
Okay.

393
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:50,860
Uh,

394
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,860
there is also on to 19 one of Augustus's
chairs that I think is worth looking

395
00:28:58,931 --> 00:28:59,764
at.

396
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,100
Yeah.
This

397
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,820
is when Travis is reflecting on or,

398
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:12,690
or we're being told about how
Travis first came to know Augustus.

399
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,860
He had first come to know Augustus
towns in many years ago through a chair

400
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:20,040
Augustus had made for a white
man in the town of Manchester.

401
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,340
The man weighed more than 400 pounds
and then I'm skipping down in the man's

402
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:33,120
parlor was Augustus as chair. Plane, not
even painted, but smooth to the touch.

403
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,800
And when the man sat in it, the chair
did not complain, not one squeak.

404
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:43,010
It just held up and did its job waiting
for the to put on another 300 pounds.

405
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,240
Travis examined the chair,
looked all about it,

406
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,540
trying to discover it's secret.
The chair gave nothing.

407
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,100
It was a very good chair.
Was a chair worth stealing?

408
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,130
The chair gave nothing.
Well,

409
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,340
it gave nothing in terms
of knowledge to Travis.

410
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:06,130
It would not give up its
secret of durability.

411
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,030
And that's in a way what makes it durable,

412
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,470
that it can hide the essence of itself.

413
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,510
Keep it to itself.
It takes the weight without one squeak.

414
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,660
It's very silence is what marks.

415
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,730
It's in vulnerability.

416
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,470
It's also what enrages a man like Travis.

417
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,740
So the novel sets up a
competing set of art forms,

418
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:44,530
carving foremost among them
against the art form of language.

419
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,800
The tapestry at the end answers one of
our questions from the first lecture,

420
00:30:55,461 --> 00:31:00,140
which is, who knows, the
known world known by whom.

421
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,630
What we come to find out is that Alice,
although she seemed insane,

422
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,170
is the one who knows Manchester County.

423
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:15,171
She has walked all over it in the
freedom carved out by her insanity.

424
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,470
One thing that's interesting about,
uh,

425
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,240
Alice is that she,

426
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,440
despite her insanity seeming insanity,

427
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,410
is the one most in
control of her language.

428
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:36,090
She is the most successful
storyteller in this novel.

429
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,080
So if you think of other alternatives,
Moses,

430
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,250
he tells Caledonia stories
that finally failed

431
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:51,050
to persuade her imagination that
any slave she owns could be free.

432
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,670
We're told explicitly as Calvin tries
to persuade her at the end of the novel

433
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,320
that it's her failure of imagination that
keeps her from emancipating her slaves

434
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:05,700
after Henry's death.
Despite all of Moses stories,

435
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,080
she still cannot see him or
anyone else as a free person.

436
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,470
So Moses is,
storytelling is,

437
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:16,920
it is a complete failure in this way,

438
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,760
but how Ellis' storytelling about
the mule that kicked her in the head,

439
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:27,090
we find that out early in the novel.
That's the story about her.

440
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:31,470
That's why she said to be
crazy was we're told so vivid,

441
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,890
so sad that everybody believed it.

442
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,880
The very control she has over her crazy

443
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,520
are what persuades the whole world
around her that she's not worth bothering

444
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:52,481
with as she wanders around
the roads with impunity.

445
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:54,850
Yeah.

446
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:59,170
It also gives her occasion
to mock the master,

447
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,500
the structure of slavery,
the patrollers,

448
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,370
and she can do it with impunity as well.

449
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:11,200
So she has a freedom of mind as well as
a freedom of movement that nobody else

450
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,360
in the novel has who was a slave.

451
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,640
So she has doubly marked as an artist

452
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:25,180
in language and in the plastic arts,

453
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,250
but she's importantly,
uh, I think not a writer.

454
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,240
You'll note if you look at three 84,
three 85,

455
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:39,160
where the tapestry is described,

456
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,270
there still some whiff of that fragility.
Um,

457
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,400
and I see that in the admonition that
is hung next to the tapestry and that

458
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,780
Priscilla repeats.
When Calvin reaches out to touch it,

459
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,630
she says,
please do not touch.

460
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,190
There's that sense that this is still
something that needs to be protected.

461
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,830
Now why the terror?

462
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,180
Why the fragility?
Well,

463
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:16,540
I think this has a lot to do
with how this novel was composed.

464
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,510
Edward P.

465
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,500
Jones wrote his first book of
short stories in the 1990s,

466
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:27,130
in the early nineties.
I can't remember the date exactly.

467
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,500
And it was very successful,
but not successful enough to support him.

468
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:37,501
So he worked as an editor at
a journal called tax notes.

469
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,680
It was a journal of tax law.

470
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:48,330
Scintillating Jones was working there.

471
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,530
And I'm going to tell you a story now
that he tells in some of his interviews,

472
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:57,880
but I heard first from his agent,
a guy named Eric Simon off, um,

473
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,350
who I had up to visit one
of my classes. Um, when we,

474
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,420
uh, we're studying this novel, um,

475
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,300
Eric says that he heard from Edward that
Edward had this idea for a novel about

476
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,540
a black slave owner,
but he said, you know,

477
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,120
don't tell anyone this
is a stealable idea.

478
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,240
So, you know, Eric,

479
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,830
when he went down to DC would occasionally
stop in over the years and see Edward

480
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:31,030
and he'd say, how's the novel going? Hmm.

481
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,740
Didn't seem to be much on paper

482
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,580
and time passed 10,
10 years or so.

483
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,310
And Eric Thought,
you know,

484
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,980
I'm not sure if this novel
is ever going to get written.

485
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,830
In the meantime,

486
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,280
John's had amassed about 125
books of history of the period,

487
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,870
uh,
that he's working in,

488
00:35:56,871 --> 00:36:00,240
in the novel because he felt that
in order to write a novel like this,

489
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:04,500
he really needed to master that history.
It was very intimidating to him though.

490
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,100
So that combined with his tax notes job,

491
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,320
he had about 12 pages written.

492
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,740
So he went on vacation after a long time.
He hadn't had a vacation.

493
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,620
He had about a six week vacation.

494
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,400
He finally got a start and one of the
ways that he got himself to start was he

495
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:26,880
decided that he was going
to forget about the history.

496
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,290
He was going to make it all up.
So all the historical sources,

497
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,180
if you read the back of the book,
you will know this.

498
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,810
All the historical sources are
fictional here. The census reports,

499
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,670
every detail is fictional.

500
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,770
So that was his first move.

501
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:48,860
Then he got laid off from text
notes right after this vacation.

502
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,170
Edward P. Jones then wrote
this novel in three months.

503
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:56,780
Yeah.

504
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,780
And Eric says that it became clear to
him over the years that Jones had in fact

505
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:11,620
memorized entire chapters
of what became this novel.

506
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,410
It was all in his head,

507
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,620
all the words in their order.

508
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,800
And so when he had the time and when
he freed himself from the obligation to

509
00:37:24,801 --> 00:37:27,380
history out at came.

510
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:35,380
I think this says a lot about the images
of writing that you see all over the

511
00:37:36,711 --> 00:37:37,544
novel.

512
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Imagine the kind of terror that you would
feel knowing that you had all this in

513
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:51,581
your mind and knowing also that
it didn't yet exist on paper,

514
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,900
that you had only 12 pages.

515
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:59,050
Maybe if you're writing papers now you
feel this terror of the blank page.

516
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,280
It's possible.

517
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,243
Okay.

518
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,130
That's a real terror for a writer.

519
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,890
Combine that with the
shadow of illiteracy,

520
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,280
the feeling of possible betrayal for
a son to be a writer when his beloved

521
00:38:21,071 --> 00:38:24,790
mother had no access to the written word.

522
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,100
This is a very vexed,

523
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:32,130
complex psychological relationship that
I would suggest my guests is that it has

524
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:34,660
a lot to do with how he,

525
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,800
the relative fragility and the relative
power of fiction versus these other

526
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:42,244
arts.

527
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,730
So Jones models his narrative on those
other arts in an effort to solve the

528
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:58,740
problems that are presented by the
terror of the written words. Fragility.

529
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,790
It's very uneasy relation to existence.

530
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,820
Does a novel exist?
Does it not?

531
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:14,270
And I think there's actually even a figure
for Jones in a particular character,

532
00:39:17,431 --> 00:39:20,880
one of these tiny characters on uh,
three 43.

533
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,343
Okay.

534
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,530
Uh, this is a young man with a
wonderfully complicated mind.

535
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,033
MMM.

536
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,280
Wilson had learned a great deal at
that university in his mind would have

537
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:44,530
contained even more but well,

538
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:49,531
and his second year of the cadavers began
to talk to Wilson and what they said

539
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:53,560
made far more sense than what
his professors were saying.

540
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,780
The professors being gods did not like
to share their heaven with anyone dead or

541
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:03,130
alive. And they sent the young man
home in the middle of his second year.

542
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,353
Here

543
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,890
you see a figure for someone
whose imagination is so
powerful that it makes the

544
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:13,570
dead talk.

545
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,840
And think back again to the image of
Stamford finding by placing the image of

546
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:24,490
his parents all over the mansion,
all over the plantation,

547
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,720
finding their names.
That's a little like, uh,

548
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,410
talking to cadavers, they
are dead. Those parents,

549
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,450
it verges on insanity.

550
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,460
This is another problem with the
mode of composition that a mind,

551
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:48,461
this powerfully populated by an
alternate reality comes to look insane.

552
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:55,250
And I think this is another reason why
Alice is what she is as a character.

553
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:59,690
If she's going to be one of
the major doubles for Jones,

554
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,000
her insanity is part of that picture.

555
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,050
We can think of it as a willed insanity,

556
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,120
but it has the residue of doubt about it.

557
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,740
Maybe she really is insane to some degree.

558
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:19,741
Is there a sharp line
between and imagination that
can produce a narrative so

559
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:25,930
thoroughly populated as
this one and a narrative,

560
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,770
uh, and a mind that, uh,

561
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,960
sees cadavers talking to you.

562
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,070
Another thing that is remarkable
about Jones, his work, and um,

563
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:47,310
this relates back to what I was saying
about postmodernism and grand narrative

564
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:52,090
last time.
Jones's work is

565
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,780
seemingly very fragmented.

566
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,350
There are lots and lots of narratives,

567
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,970
but they don't all come
together in one narrative.

568
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:09,160
So it seems fragmented and
when you start to read it,

569
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,660
it looks disorienting.
If you read his stories,

570
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:19,470
you will see that all the stories are
interconnected back to the novel to Jones

571
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:27,700
his life. So for instance,
in all antique ours children,

572
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:29,320
his most recent story collection,

573
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:34,060
I think it came out in 2007 there is a
woman who has a walking stick that is

574
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:37,630
clearly made by Augustus
in the 20th century.

575
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:39,620
Yeah.

576
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:44,570
What I was saying about the durability
of the plastic arts is imagined in that

577
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:45,890
quality of his fiction,

578
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,920
these objects of carving
turnip throughout his stories.

579
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,850
Also, people are related to
each other in separate stories.

580
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,400
They're related to people in this novel.

581
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:04,150
The title of this novel appears in a
story called tapestry in all and Hagar,

582
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:07,874
his children,

583
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:13,210
he is obsessive about putting
the locations of all the
places that he lived in

584
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:17,330
DC into his stories perfectly accurately.

585
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,800
When an editor at the New Yorker tried
to get him to change one of these

586
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:26,660
descriptions and the address in one of
the stories that he submitted for the

587
00:43:26,661 --> 00:43:29,870
magazine, he was very resistant. He,

588
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,880
he finally changed it for the New Yorker,

589
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,410
but when it went into
the story collection,

590
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:38,590
it went back because he wanted to be
absolutely accurate to what it was like

591
00:43:38,751 --> 00:43:43,100
when he lived there. What it actually
looks like on that corner in DC,

592
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:49,450
what I think Jones is doing in the
largest version of his project is actually

593
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:56,921
one of the most wide reaching
and ambitious unifying
efforts that I know of in

594
00:43:58,491 --> 00:43:59,660
contemporary fiction.

595
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:04,190
So this is not about the
fragmentation of grand narrative.

596
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:09,730
It's about the enormous large
scale accumulation of wholeness.

597
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:16,120
He is piecing a world together bit by
bit by bit as he adds to his literary of,

598
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:25,810
so this is a vision of unity that
goes way beyond generic boundaries.

599
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,400
Is it a short story?
Is it a novel?

600
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:38,510
This is something more like an opus that
Jones is building and more importantly,

601
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,470
it's something that lives in his
mind very clearly. These people,

602
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:49,080
these characters live in his mind.

603
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,960
There is no one doing
what Jones is doing today.

604
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,550
If there's something truly postmodern,
I would say Jones is it.

605
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:06,020
He looks very different
from what comes before him.

606
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:11,690
And modernism and it's a
ascendancy in the mid 20th century.

607
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,160
He is making pretty dramatic
claims for the power of fiction,

608
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,270
for the power of narrative
to put the world together.

609
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:25,783
Okay.

610
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,060
But at the same time,
as I've noted,

611
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,660
acknowledges the very
difficulty of that project,

612
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,840
the very weakness that lies at its heart.

613
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,810
And I think that's what for me,
makes his work extremely powerful.

614
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,390
That for all its ambition,
we are never allowed to forget.

615
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,500
It's ambivalence

616
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:55,180
that ambivalence is always there on the
surface and it's bodied fourth in the

617
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:59,240
kinds of moral problems
that this novel dwells upon.

618
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:03,890
The question of how human
love can exist in slavery,

619
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,630
whether it can exist all
it's complicated forms,

620
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:13,130
what the forms of freedom look like,
how freedom can possibly exist,

621
00:46:13,131 --> 00:46:15,830
how you build it,
how it can be maintained.

622
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,460
All these things are there in an
incredibly ambitious literary form.

623
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,710
That's what Jones is doing that
nobody else is doing at this moment.

624
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:37,090
So I will stop there and we will think
about what forward is doing on my,

625
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,050
I will think about what
forward is doing on Monday.
