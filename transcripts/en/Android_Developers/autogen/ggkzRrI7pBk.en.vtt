to do is download and run our sample
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.959
to do is download and run our sample
application now I don't actually know

want you to follow that link hopefully
there will be a zip file there that you

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
there will be a zip file there that you
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.830
there will be a zip file there that you
can download and by the time you unzip

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
can download and by the time you unzip
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.479
can download and by the time you unzip
it you should get something that looks a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
it you should get something that looks a
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.790
it you should get something that looks a
little like this it's a basic Xcode

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
little like this it's a basic Xcode
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.190
little like this it's a basic Xcode
project let's open it up and take a look

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
project let's open it up and take a look
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.590
project let's open it up and take a look
at what we've got here now the first

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
at what we've got here now the first
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.119
at what we've got here now the first
thing I'm going to do before I even run

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
thing I'm going to do before I even run
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.760
thing I'm going to do before I even run
it is change my bundle identifier from

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
it is change my bundle identifier from
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.850
it is change my bundle identifier from

google you should change this to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
google you should change this to
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.029
google you should change this to
something that's more appropriate for

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
something that's more appropriate for
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220
something that's more appropriate for
your company I do find that if you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
your company I do find that if you
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.170
your company I do find that if you
change the bundle identifier after

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
change the bundle identifier after
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240
change the bundle identifier after
you've already run it once you end up

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
you've already run it once you end up
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.709
you've already run it once you end up
with two copies of the game on the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
with two copies of the game on the
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.570
with two copies of the game on the
simulator and sometimes it gets confused

simulator and sometimes it gets confused
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.520
simulator and sometimes it gets confused
so I like to change it first before I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
so I like to change it first before I
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890
so I like to change it first before I
even run it once that's done we can run

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
even run it once that's done we can run
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.679
even run it once that's done we can run
it and check out our game and we are

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
it and check out our game and we are
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.020
it and check out our game and we are
presented with a fantastic main menu

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
presented with a fantastic main menu
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660
presented with a fantastic main menu
where I get to pick from an easy medium

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
where I get to pick from an easy medium
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550
where I get to pick from an easy medium
and hard difficulty level for the guests

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
and hard difficulty level for the guests
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.499
and hard difficulty level for the guests
my number game I'm going to pick an easy

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
my number game I'm going to pick an easy
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.230
my number game I'm going to pick an easy
game here and I get to guess a number

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
game here and I get to guess a number
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660
game here and I get to guess a number
between 1 and 100 so I'm going to start

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
between 1 and 100 so I'm going to start
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.780
between 1 and 100 so I'm going to start
by guessing 50 and it's higher than 50

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
by guessing 50 and it's higher than 50
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270
by guessing 50 and it's higher than 50
you'll notice that as it tells me the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
you'll notice that as it tells me the
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.370
you'll notice that as it tells me the
value is higher or lower than what a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
value is higher or lower than what a
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.330
value is higher or lower than what a
guest the min and Max values here they

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
guest the min and Max values here they
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.770
guest the min and Max values here they
tell me what the minimum and maximum

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
tell me what the minimum and maximum
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.069
tell me what the minimum and maximum
possible values could be for our mystery

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
possible values could be for our mystery
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.550
possible values could be for our mystery
number so let's seal guess 85 it's

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
number so let's seal guess 85 it's
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.819
number so let's seal guess 85 it's
higher than 85 how about 90 to iron the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
higher than 85 how about 90 to iron the
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.530
higher than 85 how about 90 to iron the
92 Wow okay all right 95 got it in five

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
92 Wow okay all right 95 got it in five
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.749
92 Wow okay all right 95 got it in five
guesses and now it's asking me if I want

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
guesses and now it's asking me if I want
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.060
guesses and now it's asking me if I want
to play again and I don't think I well

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
to play again and I don't think I well
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.859
to play again and I don't think I well
because that wasn't really all that much

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
because that wasn't really all that much
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.319
because that wasn't really all that much
fun so we're going to stop this and

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
fun so we're going to stop this and
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.389
fun so we're going to stop this and
let's get a quick overview of this

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
let's get a quick overview of this
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.309
let's get a quick overview of this
application I'm not going to spend a lot

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
application I'm not going to spend a lot
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.600
application I'm not going to spend a lot
of time on this partly because it's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
of time on this partly because it's
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.850
of time on this partly because it's
pretty basic but also because

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
pretty basic but also because
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.560
pretty basic but also because
there's a very good chance you are a

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570
there's a very good chance you are a
 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.690
there's a very good chance you are a
better objective-c programmer than I am

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
better objective-c programmer than I am
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.550
better objective-c programmer than I am
so if you find that you're doing

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
so if you find that you're doing
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.840
so if you find that you're doing
something different than the way I'm

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850
something different than the way I'm
 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.940
something different than the way I'm
doing it don't assume that my way is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
doing it don't assume that my way is
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.830
doing it don't assume that my way is
necessarily more proper or more correct

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840
necessarily more proper or more correct
 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.330
necessarily more proper or more correct
than what you're doing there's a very

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
than what you're doing there's a very
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.500
than what you're doing there's a very
good chance that you're doing the right

good chance that you're doing the right
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.750
good chance that you're doing the right
thing and I'm not and if so feel free to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760
thing and I'm not and if so feel free to
 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.190
thing and I'm not and if so feel free to
leave some suggestions in the comments

I'll read those just you know don't be a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
I'll read those just you know don't be a
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.900
I'll read those just you know don't be a
jerk about it so first thing we're going

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910
jerk about it so first thing we're going
 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.160
jerk about it so first thing we're going
to do let's take a look at the app

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
to do let's take a look at the app
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.050
to do let's take a look at the app
delegate well we've got here is pretty

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
delegate well we've got here is pretty
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.810
delegate well we've got here is pretty
basic we're creating an intro view

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820
basic we're creating an intro view
 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.970
basic we're creating an intro view
controller and we're creating a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
controller and we're creating a
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.190
controller and we're creating a
navigation controller and then we're

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
navigation controller and then we're
 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.930
navigation controller and then we're
simply taking our intro view controller

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
simply taking our intro view controller
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.850
simply taking our intro view controller
and making that the the root of our

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860
and making that the the root of our
 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.130
and making that the the root of our
navigation controller we display that on

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
navigation controller we display that on
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.830
navigation controller we display that on
the screen and we're ready to go let's

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
the screen and we're ready to go let's
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.210
the screen and we're ready to go let's
take a look at our interview controller

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
take a look at our interview controller
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.040
take a look at our interview controller
we can see here in the nib we've got

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
we can see here in the nib we've got
 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.229
we can see here in the nib we've got
three buttons easy medium and hard for

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239
three buttons easy medium and hard for
 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.940
three buttons easy medium and hard for
playing on those different difficulty

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950
playing on those different difficulty
 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.460
playing on those different difficulty
levels if we look at our dot M file

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470
levels if we look at our dot M file
 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.530
levels if we look at our dot M file
basically the three buttons here I'll

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540
basically the three buttons here I'll
 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.479
basically the three buttons here I'll
call start game with difficulty with a

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489
call start game with difficulty with a
 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.880
call start game with difficulty with a
different difficulty level I'll start

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890
different difficulty level I'll start
 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.410
different difficulty level I'll start
game with difficulty does is it creates

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
game with difficulty does is it creates
 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.930
game with difficulty does is it creates
a game view controller sets the game

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940
a game view controller sets the game
 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.910
a game view controller sets the game
difficulty and then pushes that to the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920
difficulty and then pushes that to the
 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.440
difficulty and then pushes that to the
top of our navigation controller if

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
top of our navigation controller if

top of our navigation controller if
you're wondering where these difficulty

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459
you're wondering where these difficulty
 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.070
you're wondering where these difficulty
levels are coming from that's coming

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080
levels are coming from that's coming
 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.590
levels are coming from that's coming
from our enemies h-file where we define

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600
from our enemies h-file where we define
 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.170
from our enemies h-file where we define

they got it just right and they went so

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900
they got it just right and they went so
 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.360
they got it just right and they went so
let's take a look at our game model next

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370
let's take a look at our game model next
 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.670
let's take a look at our game model next
in our dot H file you'll see we have a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680
in our dot H file you'll see we have a
 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.130
in our dot H file you'll see we have a
number of properties here game max is

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140
number of properties here game max is
 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.289
number of properties here game max is
the maximum possible value for any game

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299
the maximum possible value for any game
 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.509
the maximum possible value for any game
so in a game where I'm guessing between

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519
so in a game where I'm guessing between
 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.789
so in a game where I'm guessing between
one and a thousand game X will always be

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799
one and a thousand game X will always be
 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.070
one and a thousand game X will always be
a thousand player Minh and player max

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080
a thousand player Minh and player max
 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.380
a thousand player Minh and player max
are the minimum and maximum values based

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390
are the minimum and maximum values based
 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.900
are the minimum and maximum values based
on the players guesses so far so you'll

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910
on the players guesses so far so you'll
 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.880
on the players guesses so far so you'll
saw you saw when I guess 50 didn't told

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890
saw you saw when I guess 50 didn't told
 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.920
saw you saw when I guess 50 didn't told
me it was too low and that my min and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930
me it was too low and that my min and
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.590
me it was too low and that my min and
Max were 51 and 100 that's what player

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600
Max were 51 and 100 that's what player
 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.229
Max were 51 and 100 that's what player
min and player max are numb guess this

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239
min and player max are numb guess this
 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.820
min and player max are numb guess this
is the number of guesses that I've made

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830
is the number of guesses that I've made
 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.430
is the number of guesses that I've made
so far max length is the maximum number

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440
so far max length is the maximum number
 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.890
so far max length is the maximum number
of digits that are possible in my answer

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900
of digits that are possible in my answer
 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.259
of digits that are possible in my answer
and that's based on the game max value

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269
and that's based on the game max value
 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.870
and that's based on the game max value
and then we have two public methods new

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880
and then we have two public methods new
 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.819
and then we have two public methods new

if we look at the game model we can see

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670
if we look at the game model we can see
 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.580
if we look at the game model we can see
most of these methods new game with

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590
most of these methods new game with
 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.590
most of these methods new game with

and determine the max length again based

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320
and determine the max length again based
 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.910
and determine the max length again based
on the number of digits in game max

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920
on the number of digits in game max
 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.110
on the number of digits in game max
player guest increments the number of

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120
player guest increments the number of
 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.480
player guest increments the number of
guesses it will adjust the player min

know so now let's take a look at the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780
know so now let's take a look at the
 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.420
know so now let's take a look at the
game view controller this is probably

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430
game view controller this is probably
 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.310
game view controller this is probably
where most of the interesting game logic

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320
where most of the interesting game logic
 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.890
where most of the interesting game logic
is if you look at the nib we've got some

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900
is if you look at the nib we've got some
 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.350
is if you look at the nib we've got some
basic labels a text field I guess button

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360

play again button if we look at the dot

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710
play again button if we look at the dot
 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.130
play again button if we look at the dot
H file we really only have one property

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140
H file we really only have one property
 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.960
H file we really only have one property
here and that's the game difficulty

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970
here and that's the game difficulty
 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.300
here and that's the game difficulty
you'll recall that was set by the intro

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310
you'll recall that was set by the intro
 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.740
you'll recall that was set by the intro

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.100
view controller when we start a new game
and finally in our dot M file let's go

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110
and finally in our dot M file let's go
 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.690
and finally in our dot M file let's go
to the top here we have a number of

to the top here we have a number of
 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.850
to the top here we have a number of
properties to represent all of the UI

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860
properties to represent all of the UI
 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.430

model and resets a number of on-screen

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520
model and resets a number of on-screen
 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.090
model and resets a number of on-screen
elements at that point it updates the

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100
elements at that point it updates the
 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.550
elements at that point it updates the
interface updates the min/max labels and

basically just preps the screen for a
 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.380
basically just preps the screen for a
new game update min max labels just

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390
new game update min max labels just
 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.910
new game update min max labels just
updates those labels based on what we

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920
updates those labels based on what we
 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.370
updates those labels based on what we
got from the model update interface

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380

the interesting logic is in our game we

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240
the interesting logic is in our game we
 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.900
the interesting logic is in our game we
take the integer value from the players

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910
take the integer value from the players
 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.900
take the integer value from the players
guess and will pass that to our game

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910
guess and will pass that to our game
 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.760
guess and will pass that to our game

either adjust some of the interface

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120
either adjust some of the interface
 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.360
either adjust some of the interface
elements on screen or if the player

guessed right then we say hey games over

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800
guessed right then we say hey games over
 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.330
guessed right then we say hey games over
and we update our interface this method

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340
and we update our interface this method
 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.460
and we update our interface this method
here text field should change characters

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470
here text field should change characters
 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.770
here text field should change characters
in range replacement string all this

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780
in range replacement string all this
 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.570
in range replacement string all this
really does is it make sure I can't

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580
really does is it make sure I can't
 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.740
really does is it make sure I can't
enter more digits in the

enter more digits in the
 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.990
enter more digits in the
xfield then are appropriate for this

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000
xfield then are appropriate for this
 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.910
xfield then are appropriate for this
game so if I'm guessing a number between

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920
game so if I'm guessing a number between
 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.830
game so if I'm guessing a number between
1 and 100 this will stop me from

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840
1 and 100 this will stop me from
 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.560
1 and 100 this will stop me from
entering more than three digits touches

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570
entering more than three digits touches
 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.720
