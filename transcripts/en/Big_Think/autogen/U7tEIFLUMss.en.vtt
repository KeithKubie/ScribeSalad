I think the US automakers are so big and

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
I think the US automakers are so big and
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.440
I think the US automakers are so big and
so important it's very difficult for the

so important it's very difficult for the
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.660
so important it's very difficult for the
government to just a idly by and watch

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
government to just a idly by and watch
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.390
government to just a idly by and watch
them die but I think it's very important

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
them die but I think it's very important
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.910
them die but I think it's very important
to learn for the future what were the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
to learn for the future what were the
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.830
to learn for the future what were the
mistakes and how do we avoid them what

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
mistakes and how do we avoid them what
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.870
mistakes and how do we avoid them what
are the systemic lessons we can learn

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
are the systemic lessons we can learn
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.990
are the systemic lessons we can learn
and I think one extremely important

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000
and I think one extremely important
 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.839
and I think one extremely important
aspect is the legacy costs today every

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
aspect is the legacy costs today every
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.570
aspect is the legacy costs today every
car sold is burdened not only by the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
car sold is burdened not only by the
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.089
car sold is burdened not only by the
cost to produce it the steel the labor

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
cost to produce it the steel the labor
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.819
cost to produce it the steel the labor
put into it but the price tag must also

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
put into it but the price tag must also
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.970
put into it but the price tag must also
include costs for those 70 and eight

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
include costs for those 70 and eight
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860
include costs for those 70 and eight
year old people worked in those

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
year old people worked in those
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.060
year old people worked in those
industries 10 20 30 years ago and those

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
industries 10 20 30 years ago and those
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220
industries 10 20 30 years ago and those
costs were not paid by those support

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
costs were not paid by those support
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.430
costs were not paid by those support
course at that time they are paid by the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
course at that time they are paid by the
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.740
course at that time they are paid by the
people by course today and the reason is

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
people by course today and the reason is
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.959
people by course today and the reason is
that in the United States you have

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
that in the United States you have
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.350
that in the United States you have
chosen to have corporate based social

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
chosen to have corporate based social
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.049
chosen to have corporate based social
security in practice I think that is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
security in practice I think that is
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.840
security in practice I think that is
old-fashioned it's on modern it is a

old-fashioned it's on modern it is a
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.509

hinder for flexibility a Hindu for

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
hinder for flexibility a Hindu for
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.670
hinder for flexibility a Hindu for
growth and it is a very bad burden on

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680
growth and it is a very bad burden on
 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.620
growth and it is a very bad burden on
competitiveness and I believe this is

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
competitiveness and I believe this is
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.910
competitiveness and I believe this is
the most important lesson of this crisis

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920
the most important lesson of this crisis
 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.590
the most important lesson of this crisis
in the car industry to do something

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
in the car industry to do something
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.990
in the car industry to do something
about for the future that cannot be

about for the future that cannot be
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030
about for the future that cannot be
addressed in the short term but it's a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
addressed in the short term but it's a
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.749
addressed in the short term but it's a
systemic negative element in the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
systemic negative element in the
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.590
systemic negative element in the
American economy and it tells me that

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600
American economy and it tells me that
 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.999
American economy and it tells me that
the story about the American economy

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
the story about the American economy
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.600
the story about the American economy
being so flexible that that story is if

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

not miss it is at least grossly
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.569
not miss it is at least grossly
exaggerated this is something that locks

exaggerated this is something that locks
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.870
exaggerated this is something that locks
up labor in individual companies it

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
up labor in individual companies it
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.420
up labor in individual companies it
makes movement between different

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
makes movement between different
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.630
makes movement between different
industries more difficult and in today's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
industries more difficult and in today's
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.230
industries more difficult and in today's
globalized economy change is the key to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
globalized economy change is the key to

that's extremely important
