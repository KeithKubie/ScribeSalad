A, IT IS A PASTIME, YOU KNOW,
THING OF MINE.

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.157
WHATEVER.

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.159
I COULD HAVE WENT TO THE LEAGUE.
I CHOSE NOT TO.

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:28.161
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND, I
UNDERSTAND. SMART CHOICE.

00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:29.863
YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL. YOU'RE
DOING VERY WELL.

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:31.031
&gt;&gt; Jon: ME AND YOU SHOULD START
A

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:34.935
LEAGUE FOR THE GENTLEMAN
PLAYER THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:37.037
THE SIZE...
&gt;&gt; THE SIZE...

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.039

THEMSELVES SOMEWHAT AGILE.

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:42.042
&gt;&gt; WELL, I'M AGILE, BUT THEN YOU
GO TO THE SPORT WHERE YOUR SIZE

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:44.044
WORKS, LIKE SOCCER.

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:48.048
AND, THEN I FIGURED OUT I'M NOT
REALLY THAT FAST. YOU KNOW, SO,

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.050
I GOT PROS AND CONS FOR
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.052
I BOX. AND, I WAS REALLY
GOOD WHEN I HAD A TRAINER.

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.054
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, BUT I JUST HIT HIS

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:57.057
HANDS, AND HE WAS LIKE, YOU
KNOW, IT WAS NOTHING ELSE.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.992
IT WAS JUST HIS HANDS.

00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:01.061
AND I WAS LIKE, YO, I'M REALLY
GOOD. AND, YOU KNOW,

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:03.063
I WAS LIKE, YO, I'M FAST.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.065
MY TIMING IS GREAT.
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, YEAH.

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:08.068
&gt;&gt; AND ONE DAY WE WERE DOING IT,
AND, YOU KNOW, HE DID THIS.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.071
HE'S NEVER DONE THIS EVER.

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:14.074
HE'S NEVER... LISTEN, WE TRAINED
SO MUCH.

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:17.077
NOT ONCE HAS HE EVER DONE THIS,
BUT I GUESS HE EXPECTED A NASTY

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.079
REACTION. SO, YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:22.082
ONE-TWO-THREE,
ONE-TWO, BOP-BOP-BOP.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:24.084
AND HE WENT LIKE THIS.

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.086
AND, IT HIT ME.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.088
I STOPPED.

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.090
I TOOK MY GLOVES OFF.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.092
I SAID, WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.094
WHEN DID WE START FIGHTING BACK?

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:36.096
LIKE, WHAT IS THAT?

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.098
I WAS PISSED OFF.
I WAS LIKE, DUDE, I'M DONE,

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:40.100
I'M NOT, LIKE I'M DONE WITH THIS
SESSION.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.102
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS NOT BOXING.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:44.104
&gt;&gt; HE WAS LIKE, KEVIN, THIS IS
FOR YOU TO DUCK. I WAS LIKE,

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:46.106
FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S NOT. THAT'S
A PUNCH, WHAT YOU DID.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.940
THAT'S A PUNCH.

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:48.041
HE'S LIKE, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
DUCK.

00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.010
WELL, YOU THOUGHT WRONG, AND YOU
ALSO JUST GOT DOCKED.

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:52.946
I DEDUCTED AN AMOUNT. THAT'S
ABOUT IT.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.948
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, I THINK THAT'S
WISE. WELL, VERY NICE.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:56.884
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:57.951
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE COME BACK
AND SEE US.

00:06:57.985 --> 00:06:59.186
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO, MAN!

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:01.388
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE MOVIE, "THINK LIKE A
MAN TOO," IT'S IN THE THEATERS

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.222
ON FRIDAY.

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:03.023
&gt;&gt; YES!

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:03.924

HART.
