Hey guys, I'm Nate, welcome back to the workshop

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.069
We love having comment requests from you guys for ideas of what we should do and we have a request here from Matthew DeRossett

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.450
Matthew asks what happens if you put whipped cream or beaten egg whites in a vacuum chamber

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.939
would they turn back into regular cream and egg whites respectively

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.889
well Matthew we think that's an excellent question so today we're going to try out both of those things

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.170
We'll take some heavy cream and turn that into whipped cream, then we'll take some egg whites and beat that until we have a meringue

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.059
Then we'll see what happens if we pull as much air out as we can and see if they return to their regular

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.090
un-whipped state. Let's start by whipping up some cream

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:41.249
Most of the time when you're making whipped cream you do add sugar to it to make it taste a little sweeter, but because we

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.159
want to see if our whipping cream returns to normal after being whipped,

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.839
inflated, and deflated in a vacuum chamber, I'm not going to add any sugar to this one

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.689
so we can see how close it is to the regular unchanged whipping cream

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.929
There we have it, we have our whipped cream and a bowl and it has been filled with air to the point that it is

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.709
no longer even a liquid. Now let's take some of this, scoop it off

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.710
into our vacuum chamber, and see what happens when we depressurize

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.070
whipped cream

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.650
I'm not really sure how much of this to put in. I don't know how much it will expand, and I don't want to go

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.050
so high that I have to turn off the vacuum pump

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.010
Let's try starting with just a nice little glob not the whole bowl full, and see what happens when we depressurize it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.770
It's alive~ That's certainly growing quite a bit. Oh

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.130
boy, it still might be too much

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.479
That was enough to fill the whole chamber all the way

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.439
Several times

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.950
Wow I thought the cake batter expanded a lot. It's got nothing on this

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.498
That's gonna work so cool when we add food coloring

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.219
Think that it just started to break before I

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.859
opened the valve a little that last time

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.760
There we go

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.638
Well that looks kind of disgusting in there right now

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.569
Doesn't look like whipped cream, and it doesn't look like un-whipped cream

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.869
It's just sort of this mass of- it looks kind of like plastic sheets got melted onto the walls

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.439
Guess I'll turn it off

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.809
Open this up and let some pressure back in

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.020
There we go, repressurized

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.670
First impressions, I'm gonna say that has not turned back into regular whipping cream. I don't know what that is,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.940
but it's not regular whipping cream

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.789
All right so when I have a larger

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.200
amount, of it together on the spatula it is a little more liquid. Definitely more liquid than whipped cream

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.720
Tastes about the same

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.440
Unsurprisingly

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.150
Um-

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.929
I feel like some of the milk fat may have started to change form, not so much that it started turning into butter,

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.689
but something is different about it see what happens if I just scrape all of it as much as I can

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.849
into sort of one spot

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.640
Give it an opportunity to cool a little bit

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.929
All right, we do have a liquid here. It looks like it's still

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.480
maybe a little thicker than

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.170
just

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.190
normal cream. I'm wondering if there's still some air in it, and now that we've gathered it all in one spot,

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.119
we can pull more out. So let's try turning the vacuum chamber back on and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.280
sucking any additional remaining air out of our little pool of cream. Here goes.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.170
So it is expanding, so there's definitely still some air inside that blob

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.689
in fact it's expanding quite a bit, so I guess there is a lot of air still inside that blob.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.050
It's tough to suck all of the air out of something

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.980
Oh, it's gross

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.689
well it's still bubbling and popping a lot, and I kind of want to just let it run until

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.410
that bubbling and popping is mostly stopped, because I think that's when we'll have most of the air pulled out of our cream

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.160
If it takes too long though, I'm just gonna turn it off

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.780
All right, this is still bubbling-

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.630
at about the same rate as it was like, three minutes ago. I think at this point we're just boiling the liquid

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.060
inside the cream so let's just let the pressure out, and see how liquidy our cream has returned to being.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.399
Stops bubbling as soon as I turn it off. I haven't even put any pressure back in but as soon as I turned off the vacuum

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.640
it stopped bubbling

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.560
Oh look at that, it's running

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.040
Already running as a liquid. Y'know I think that looks pretty much just like cream. We may have done it, we may have just

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.299
returned whipped cream to an un-whipped state

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.960
It tastes like cream. It looks like cream.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.870
Well that's really cool. But my favorite part of that is how much the whipped cream expanded, and we didn't really get

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.360
to see

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.150
Its full potential because this container is too small. so let's try using the larger jar, and

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.609
maybe a tiny bit less whipped cream and see if we can still get a tiny bit of cream to fill the whole jar it

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.419
looked like it was about to do that

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:47.740
And that's awesome

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.949
There we go, I've got a little cup full of our whipped cream. Now let's add just a little bit of food coloring because I

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:59.128
think this will be even cooler in color. Let's just add a couple of drops of red and gently mix it in

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.580
Alright, three

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:15.039
The larger chamber of course, does take longer to depressurize, so it's gonna go a little bit slower, but it's definitely growing

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.359
Is it gonna break? Is it gonna break?

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.440
Aughhhhhhh

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:38.290
I have to add- Nope, nope. I didn't add any pressure back! That was it. It's like hollow on the inside of this, it's just completely

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.630
GONE

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.610
That was great

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.419
That was great~ look at this

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:53.949
That was the most expansive thing we've ever put in a vacuum chamber, I'm pretty sure. I thought the cake batter was good, this

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.300
well, it takes the cake

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.960
Takes the cake from cake. That was beautiful.

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.769
I'm touched. Alright, let's add pressure back in and see what happens

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.490
Didn't change a whole lot

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:19.529
Yep, that's sort of creamy. It's a little bit liquid. I bet we could combine this together and pull out a little bit more air

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:26.789
But we've already tried that. We know what happens. Now I just want to see more whipped cream expanding. Let's try more colors

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.409
Alright. Here goes- marbled yellow and blue whipped cream

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.530
And.. plop. Falls to the bottom. That's great

00:07:55.069 --> 00:08:00.398
Delightful. There you have it, whipped cream in a vacuum chamber. When you pull out all the air, it actually does a pretty good job

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:00.759
of

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:07.268
returning to normal cream. It seems like it's about the same consistency, it tastes the same, so I think that one kind of works

00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:11.439
Now let's try the same experiment using whipped egg whites, also known as meringue

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.220
There we go,

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.319
Egg whites from six eggs. I don't make meringue much, so I don't know how much it's gonna make. I feel like it's gonna

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:27.749
be way more than I need. Guess we'll find out

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.850
Alright, we're gonna call that good. I think they might actually be able to beat even more till they're even

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.939
more full of air and a little bit stiffer and shinier but

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:53.429
I'm also pretty sure that egg whites can break if you beat it too much and since I am not a baking expert, I

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.859
don't want it to break and have to start over. So right now it's pretty stiff, it's not very liquid

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.739
We're gonna try this, I bet it'll work really well

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.549
Now the egg whites did expand more than the whipping cream, so I'm kind of wondering if they're going

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.830
to do the same thing in the vacuum chamber. I almost want to start with an even smaller amount of the meringue

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.830
Yeah, let's just try about this much- see how it turns out. Alright, here goes

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.379
And it is growing

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:30.519
And it's holding a shape. It kind of looks like a little ghost or something, like, "I'm a big ghost now~" I

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.559
can see some bubbles on the surface starting to pop already

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.689
Broken. Nowhere near the expansion of the whipped-cream

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.559
So while it had a lot of air in it, I

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.540
wonder if it had so much that it meant all of the walls holding in the bubbles were extra thin

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.349
It's far from done moving, but it didn't grow very much

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.110
I think I'm gonna kill this

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:05.230
I've killed the vacuum for the moment, and I want to try this same experiment in the smaller chamber, because it pulls the air out

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:11.050
of that much faster. I think we'll have better luck getting our meringue to reduce back down to egg white in there

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.540
Here goes, 3, 2, 1

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:22.270
Yeah, it just starts growing so much faster in this chamber. It just sort of tears itself apart. I

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.410
don't think it's expanding, it just has air trapped underneath it, and so it's just lifting the whole blob at once

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.679
Okay let's try adding the pressure back

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.499
That to me looks- I mean it's the same color as the egg white

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.670
The

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.219
whiter parts here floating around, I think they're that little tail that attaches the yolk

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.799
to the egg white. We had some of that floating around in there I think it's just a little bit more liquid because we've beaten

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.300
it half to death with a beater. It doesn't really have any of the connections holding it together

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.649
that it did before. It's kind of return to an egg white state. Not bad

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.789
Well there you have it, whipped cream and whipped egg whites in a vacuum chamber

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.689
We pull out all of the air, and they kind of return to their un-whipped state

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.140
The egg whites have a very different texture, and I think that's because

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.640
we broke up the bonds that were holding together the albumin with our egg beater

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.869
But the whipped cream actually seemed to return to about how it started, which I thought was pretty cool

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:38.349

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.730
Thanks guys for joining us for this video and remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at thekingofrandom.com

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.630
See you there.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:58.630
New experiment. We get a box. It goes around my arm and the bowl, and we fill it with helium. It's airtight mold box

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:06.699
Fill it with helium, and then we whip it so that it's full of helium and not air and we make a meringue that literally

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.209
floats, and it floats- it's not going to work guys, don't- they won't

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.399
I'm going to crack one egg and then I'm going

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.840
to put a whole egg in the vacuum chamber, I'll pull a vacuum and we'll see if anything happens to either of them

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.790
And now quite a few bubbles inside the egg mixture are expanding out.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.790
Ooh~

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.890
delightful

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:32.739
