00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:15.800
Hello there future internet users, I've been
Trace and I will hopefully still be him, and

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.100
this is probably still DNews.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.100
We'll see.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.130
You've probably heard about the Butterfly
Effect -- usually explained by the idea that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.720
a butterfly flaps it's wings in Brazil and
causes a hurricane in Texas.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.920
Premise ridiculous!

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.220
Of course they can't.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.259
There are millions of butterflies, if every
one caused the beginnings of a storm Earth

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.780
would be in chaos.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.649
The thing is, that's not what the Butterfly
Effect is about.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.590
It's about how tiny changes in big systems,
can have complex results.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.320
Systems, in this case, could be anything from
weather patterns, to how big groups of asteroids

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.719
move, or how lots of people interact.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.930
For an example of a system: picture a Tilt-a-Whirl
ride at a carnival.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.140
If you don't know what that is: it's a rotating
and shifting platform, with shell-like cars,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.000
each rotating on a smaller circle, with people
inside.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.869
It has rules, and follows those rules rigidly:
the platform rotates the same every time,

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.960
and the carts can only rotate around specific
points…

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.670
By analyzing this, you can see the butterfly
effect in action.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.159
If I sit alone in one of the tilt-a-whirl
carts, it would spin completely differently

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.200
than if you sat in there with me, right?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.889
Together we'd be heavier and so our cart would
have a completely different ride!

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:29.630
Every spin would be completely different from
taking the ride alone.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.649
Now, imagine all the carts as part of a system.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.340
With tiny changes to each: someone being a
little lighter or heavier in one cart, someone

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.429
sitting forward on the seat or with their
back on the wall...

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.200
These tiny variations affect the WHOLE Tilt-a-whirl
system!

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.810
That's the butterfly effect -- which does
have a scientific name: "sensitive dependence

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.229
on initial conditions."

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.189
This was originally discovered by an MIT mathematician
and meteorologist Edward Lorenz, who was using

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.179
an old computer to calculate weather patterns.

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.709
He ran a simulation, and wanted to see it
again.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.259
The first time, he put in the data to six
decimal places, but figured the second time

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.929
those tiny fractions of a degree wouldn't
matter, so he only used three decimal places.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.060
In the end, because he cut out a few fractions
of a fraction, the whole simulation completely

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.060
changed.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.710
It was unrecognizable!

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.829
And that's when the crap hit the counter.

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.680
At the time mathematicians thought, if you
changed it a little at the start, it would

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.090
only change a little at the end.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.950
It was logical, but these "systems" don't
behave that way, and we needed new math to

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.569
understand why!

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.780
In walks: Chaos Theory.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.240
Chaos Theory, by definition, deals with "complex
systems whose behavior is highly sensitive

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.349
to slight changes in conditions."

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.430
It appears to be chaos, but it's actually
governed by the same rules as everything else

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.379
in nature, physics, and the universe.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.870
But because there are so many moving parts;
it's impossible for us to comprehend them

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.870
all.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.930
Imagine watching all the people get on a Tilt-a-Whirl
and then guessing how every cart is going

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.340
to move…

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.379
LOL.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.280
Chaos Theory was groundbreaking when it was
discovered, because it threw off classical

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280
physics!

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.620
Isaac Newton's laws of nature -- equal and
opposite reactions and such, were imagined

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.610
in a "clockwork universe," not one filled
with apparent chaos.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.349
Basically, if we understood the basic rules
of the universe, we should understand everything

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.800
in the universe too, right?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800
Wrong.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.790
Because even a tiny change in something with
as many moving parts as the universe would

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.739
mean any assumptions we make would be astronomically
wrong.

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.080
And that's super scary.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.609
We went from grasping a good chunk of our
universe, to who knows where.

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.230
But, the universe is not random, it's governed
by RULES.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.180
Rules which mathematicians have worked on
understanding for centuries.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.990
Take nature for example, it might seem random,
but it's governed by rules, and that's why

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.630
it makes shapes like this.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.180
These are called FRACTALS, and they show us
how chaos is really order.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.349
[pause] It's an infinitely complex, repeating
pattern that appears chaotic at times, but

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.280
is actually ordered!

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.180
Chaos theory is an attempt to approximate
and understand all the people getting on the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.569
Tilt-a-whirl, and how the tilt-a-whirl will
react to their actions; thus finding order

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.969
in the chaos.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:19.500
The more we understand the math, the better
handle we will have to predict how a complex

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.210
system will react to tiny changes.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.810
The practical applications are huge from understanding
the brain, to social interaction, to how gas

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.670
moves in our atmosphere.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.650
A study in the Journal of Family Psychology
followed 95 couples, attempting to predict

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.870
divorce rates using chaos theory math.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.150
They were correct 87 percent of the time.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.900
Turbulence and weather slash climate change
models keep getting better with as we gather

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.419
more data, because we can harness that chaos
math.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.680
The rules that govern fluid dynamics are pretty
well understood.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.930
We get temperature, pressure, volume, and
mass, we get solar energy and gaseous emissions,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.930
and so on.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.440
But, if somehow, a tiny bit of moisture, dust,
heat or cold causes a cloud to form somewhere

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.830
we didn't expect… the whole system can be
thrown off.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.830
It's maddening.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.060
Which is why the National Weather Service
runs the same weather models again and again:

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.479
tweaking it each time -- eventually they getting
an inkling of the true result.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.850
So, when you think of the butterfly effect,
what should you think of?

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.330
Understanding order from chaos.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.520
The original model Lorenz was working on appeared
to spit out chaos, until it was graphed…

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.300
and then it looked like this: [show picture?]

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.840
It looks like a butterfly.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.460
It didn't get it's name from an actual butterfly,
but from the graph of chaos becoming order.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.130
Which is pretty.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.130
And Insane.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.479
It's Pretty Insane.

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.960
To see how the butterfly effect could wreak
havoc on a female police detective in 2016

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.819
after she discovers she can reach her estranged
father over the airwaves and through the decades

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:49.819
in 1996 via ham radio.

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.950
Don’t miss the Series Premiere of Frequency,
Wednesday October 5th, at 9/8c only on The

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.950
CW.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.170
If chaos is really just order, is anything
in the universe truly random?!

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:17.479
Jules looked 
at it here.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.580
Math was not my strong suit, but i find it
super fascinating.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.100
What about you guys? Let us know down in the comments.
