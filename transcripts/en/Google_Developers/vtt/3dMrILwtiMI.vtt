Kitagawa: Hi, my name's
Justin Kitagawa,

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:04.267
and I'm a senior product manager
at GoGrid.

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:06.267
I was also
the lead developer

00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:09.934
that helped build
our application "GoGrid."

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:11.567
I'm here today
to show you our application,

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.801
and we used GWT
to build it.

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.000
"GoGrid" is our
award-winning control panel.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.567
Using "GoGrid,"
you can create,

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.234
deploy, and destroy
your infrastructure on demand.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.534
You're able to add
load balancers,

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:26.000
virtual servers, and storage
easily and quickly

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.234
with just a mouse.

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:32.734
Our load balancers are F5
hardware-based load balancers.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.801
You can specify
a virtual IP,

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.133
which will get multiplexed out
to real IPs.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.334
Our virtual servers
support numerous OSs:

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:45.300
CentOS, Red Hat,
Windows 2003 and 2008.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.367
And coming soon
will be Ubuntu and Debian.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.133
And our cloud storage
is an infinitely-scalable,

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.334
mountable, um,
disc offering,

00:00:55.334 --> 00:00:59.234
so that you can store your data
permanently and reliably.

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:01.634
We implemented on-hovers
for the various objects,

00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:03.868
so that you can see
detailed information

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:06.033
for each
of the objects.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.067
We've also implemented
context menus,

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.167
so that with
a right mouse click,

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:12.667
you're able
to get to pertinent actions

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.934
for the various objects.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:17.267
Deleting objects
is just as easy

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:19.033
as creating objects.

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:21.534
And with a couple clicks,

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:24.567
you're able
to destroy your server.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.601
We used GWT
to build our AJAX front end.

00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:30.000
We knew that we were going
to be redefining and, uh,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.834
data center automation
with "GoGrid,"

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:33.133
and we wanted
to make sure

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:36.133
that we had a state-of-the-art
control panel to do so.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:40.200
Inspired by state-of-the-art
AJAX applications,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.567
we wanted to make sure that
we were on the cutting edge.

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:44.634
We wanted to build
a thick client

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:47.868
inside the browser.

00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:50.367
GWT has allowed us
to create

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:51.934
many of our own
custom widgets,

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:56.367
so that we are able to get
our own unique look and feel.

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:59.434
But we've also been able
to leverage and utilize,

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:03.968
um, many of the existing
UI constructs

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:07.834
such as, um,
the various panels,

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:12.067
suggests, tree widgets,
so on and so forth.

00:02:12.067 --> 00:02:13.501
One thing that's great
about GWT

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.067
is it's open source.

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:18.067
So if a widget doesn't look
or feel or act

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:19.501
the way
that we want it to,

00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:22.033
we're able to essentially
just copy it and tweak it

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:23.534
as we need it to.

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:25.801
And so we've done that
in numerous occasions as well.

00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:27.234
It's very powerful,

00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:30.033
and it's increased
our productivity greatly.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:33.033
Um, essentially,
it's build once,

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:34.634
and then you can
deploy it anywhere.

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:36.334
It'll just work
in the various browsers.

00:02:36.334 --> 00:02:39.534
And so that's really facilitated
our testing strategies,

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:42.968
and, um, really opened up
development as well.

00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:45.234
We're able to build
a very complex,

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:48.834
rich UI application
quickly and easily.
