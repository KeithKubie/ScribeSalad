1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:00,881
For me,

2
00:00:00,881 --> 00:00:05,680
the only way to do that is to talk about
my life and the things that grow along

3
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:09,130
with me.
The only thing that grows along with me,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,650
my experiences, my family,
my marriage, my mistakes,

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,080
my ups,
my downs.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,390
Those are the things that I can talk
about forever because as you get older,

7
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:24,220
things change.
Shit gets different.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,940
But it's all coming from
my personal opinion of me,

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,880
my view on me and how I see life.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,220
You can't lose material in a state.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,730
That's why I stay away from certain
things because those things can become

12
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:44,530
boring after awhile for me because I don't
have the knowledge of everything that

13
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:49,210
I should kind of, well, politics,
I don't joke. And the politics,

14
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:50,740
I don't,
I don't joke.

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,950
And anything that has to do with the
slander of others or other communities,

16
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:59,980
I don't do anything divisive. Good for
you. That's my, that's my biggest thing.

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,090
And you know, uh, this past year was,

18
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,000
was one that got a little
weird because I was like, Yo,

19
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:11,860
I've really dedicated myself to
bringing people together. Like,

20
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:15,040
um, I love, that was my, my goal.

21
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:19,780
That's my priority at Damn Shadow.
That's what I was doing on a global scale.

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,890
Everybody, all races, shapes, sizes,
whoever you are, whatever you are,

23
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:25,480
you can come to a Kevin Hart
show and have a good time.

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,220
So when it came off as if I
was a person that was divisive,

25
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,030
that was tough. You're talking about
the Oscars Oscar Shit. Yeah, like this

26
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,940
time where people were just looking to
be upset about things 100% they're not

27
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:41,330
looking to looking at you, Kevin Hart
as just a human being, like what? What?

28
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,220
Who is he overall super positive.
They're not even concentrating on that.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,491
I mean,

30
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:50,420
think about how positive you are and yet
they tried to concentrate on some jokes

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,520
that you did what,
nine years ago?

32
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,440
It was a, it's a, it's a wake up
call of understanding the towns,

33
00:01:57,441 --> 00:02:01,910
but then more importantly, you know,
for me it was okay, I went through it.

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,510
I made sure that the people of the
Lgbtq community really understand that,

35
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,820
hey guys, I apologize before,
but I'm apologizing again.

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,210
I'm sorry I'm not that guy.
I don't want you to think I'm that guy.

37
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,840
Then it just became the constant
conversation that never happened.

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,960
It just became a constant
conversation. And, and now it is guys.

39
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,850
I'm not only sorry,

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,800
I don't condone anything that
has to do with hate to anybody.

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,640
This is no longer a conversation.
So guys,

42
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:39,641
I'm going to stop talking about it because
now I feel like I'm feeding into what

43
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,780
I'm not.
I,

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,790
I know I'm not the world in public
should understand and know to them that

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,290
because over this time period
I've shown that I'm not.

46
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,790
So the apology, once again, I'm sorry,

47
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,370
genuinely, I'm sorry, but
it just kept, it just,

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,500
it never stopped. And at that point I
just made a decision and I'm like, guys,

49
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,010
at this point, I just am making a
decision to not talk about it anymore.

50
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,590
That doesn't mean to them
being disrespectful to anybody.

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,450
That doesn't mean to them shutting
down anything. It means that for me,

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,550
I'm going to stop talking about it because
at this point I don't know what to do.

53
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,360
At this point. I thought, I thought the
apology is what you wanted me to do. I do.

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,520
Uh, I made sure that you understand it.
I'm not a hateful person. I don't get,

55
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,130
don't hate. I did that. I stepped down.

56
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,840
So I don't take attention
off of that night.

57
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,360
And those people that are
there to be celebrated,

58
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,380
I don't want to draw attention to myself
and what's around me. I stepped down.

59
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,940
Everything I did was for
the better of good. I'm,

60
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,620
I'm stepping away guys,

61
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,160
because I don't want this to be a
negative night or a negative thing.

62
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,780
And then it still became a conversation.
So I waited for it to die down.

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,350
I went on my radio show,
gave another public apology.

64
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,110
May should have he
understand and I'm sorry,

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,400
I hope these words didn't hurt anybody.
I once again apologize.

66
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,830
I don't condone hate to anyone.

67
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,220
I hope that you guys can forgive
me for those jokes of all.

68
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,410
So now I say, if you don't understand
and that you don't believe it,

69
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,280
I don't know what else to give.
I don't know what else to do.

70
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,770
There's nothing else you can
do that's very wise of you.

71
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,400
Nothing that's very wisely to step
away, locked up. Because if you didn't,

72
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,870
they would probably pursue it forever.
But I mean,

73
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,730
it becomes a point of attention.
That's all it is.

74
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,580
They just decide that this is something
that they're going to focus on. What a,

75
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:38,040
I had a, I had a good talk, and I'm
talking about this for a minute.

76
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,970
Friend of mine, Lee Daniels, you know,
me and Lee Daniels, uh, Lee called me,

77
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:46,270
told me where to talk to them. You
know, Lou Daniel's is director,

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,190
a producer, the show empires,
this biggest shows, um,

79
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,510
you know, so he calls me, he's like, Kevin
won't talk to you. And, and us talking,

80
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,950
he's like,
look,

81
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,250
this is a time where you
could speak up and talk about,

82
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:04,900
you know,

83
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,900
the community that's been
affected by hatred and you know,

84
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,490
hateful crimes.

85
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,730
You can step up and be a voice and
say that you don't condone or don't,

86
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,330
uh, stand with any type of
hate or whatever. You can
take that stage and do that.

87
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,980
And I said, Lee, I said, let's understand
what you're saying. I said, well,

88
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,190
why did you expect me to know what's
been happening within this community in

89
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:43,030
regards to hate and crimes? I
said, I, I'm not aware. I said,

90
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,020
some people can just not be aware.
I'm not in the know.

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,030
I have no idea what's going on.
I have no idea.

92
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,600
Community within that community,
I have no idea.

93
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,840
When you tell me this,
I'm now educated and I understand,

94
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,950
so it's easy to simply inform,
right?

95
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,930
Information is key. When people get
information, they process the information.

96
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,910
When you can process the information, you
go, oh, wait a minute. That makes sense.

97
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,960
Hey, if you guys think that I
can, don't hate, wait a minute,

98
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,640
I don't in anybody that does, fuck
you, man, as bad you shouldn't.

99
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,990
I can say that,
but instead when this happened,

100
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,940
it was become an ally,

101
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,840
become a voice and that's,

102
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,900
that's where there was
just a miscommunication.

103
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,350
That's where a back and forth kind of
was establish that I think people just

104
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:45,710
started to take things and run with it,
and I'm just not,

105
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm just not one to feed into what I feel
isn't going to eventually evolve into

106
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,270
a positive thing in a real
conversation. Yes. Yeah. When I'm,

107
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,470
when I'm trying my best to,

108
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,640
it was becoming tablet bullshit pretty
much took a real discussion, clickbait,

109
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,780
clickbait.
