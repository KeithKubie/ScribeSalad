00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Hello, and welcome to Crash Course Astronomy!
I’m your host, Phil Plait, and I’ll be

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.860
taking you on a guided tour of the entire
Universe. You might want to pack a lunch.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.660
Over the course of this series we’ll explore
planets, stars, black holes, galaxies, subatomic

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.490
particles, and even the eventual fate of the
Universe itself.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.740
But before we step into space, let’s take
a step back. I wanna talk to you about science.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.160
There are lots of definitions of science,
but I’ll say that it’s a body of knowledge,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.480
and a method of how we learned that knowledge.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.880
Science tells us that stuff we know may not
be perfectly known; it may be partly or entirely

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.170
wrong. We need to watch the Universe, see
how it behaves, make guesses about why it’s

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.870
doing what it’s doing, and then try to think
of ways to support or disprove those ideas.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.660
That last part is important. Science must
be, above all else, honest if we really want

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.250
to get to the bottom of things.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.760
Understanding that our understanding might
be wrong is essential, and trying to figure

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.070
out the ways we may be mistaken is the only
way that science can help us find our way

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.370
to the truth, or at least the nearest approximation
to it.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.460
Science learns. We meander a bit as we use
it, but in the long run we get ever closer

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.420
to understanding reality, and that is the
strength of science. And it’s all around us!

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.240
Whether you know it or not, you’re soaking in science.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.340
You’re a primate. You have mass. Mitochondria

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.150
in your cells are generating energy. Presumably,
you’re breathing oxygen.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.430
But astronomy is different. It’s still science, of
course, but astronomy puts you in your place.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.340
Because of astronomy, I know we’re standing
on a sphere of mostly molten rock and metal

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.570
13,000 kilometers across, with a fuzzy atmosphere
about 100 km high, surrounded by a magnetic

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.210
field that protects us from the onslaught
of subatomic particles from the Sun 150 million

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.330
km away, which is also flooding space with
light that reaches across space, to illuminate

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.210
the planets, asteroids, dust, and comets,
racing out past the Kuiper Belt, through the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.750
Oort Cloud, into interstellar space, past
the nearest stars, which orbit along with

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.460
gas clouds and dust lanes in a gigantic spiral
galaxy we call the Milky Way that has a supermassive

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.180
black hole in its center, and is surrounded
by 150 globular clusters and a halo of dark

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.560
matter and dwarf galaxies, some of which it’s
eating, all of which can be seen by other

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.290
galaxies in our Local Group like Andromeda
and Triangulum, and our group is on the outskirts

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.890
of the Virgo galaxy cluster, which is part
of the Virgo supercluster, which is just one

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.520
of many other gigantic structures that stretch
most of the way across the visible Universe,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.510
which is 90-billion light years across and
expanding every day, even faster today than

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.320
yesterday due to mysterious dark energy, and
even all that might be part of an infinitely

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.320
larger multiverse that extends forever both
in time and space.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.160
See? Astronomy puts you in your place.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.940
But what exactly is astronomy? This isn’t
necessarily an obvious thing to ask. When

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.820
I was a kid, it was easy: Astronomy is the
study of things in the sky. The sun, moon,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.060
stars, galaxies, and stuff like that. But
it’s not so easy to pigeonhole these days.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.060
Take, for example, Mars. When I haul my ‘scope
out to the end of my driveway and look at

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.680
Mars, that’s astronomy, right? Of course!
But what about the rovers there? Those machines

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.580
aren’t doing astronomy, surely. They’re
doing chemistry, geology, hydrology, petrology…

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.040
everything but astronomy!

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.840
So nowadays, what’s astronomy? I’d say
it’s still studying stuff in the sky, but

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.020
it’s branched out quite a bit from there.
Borders between it and other fields of science

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.230
are fuzzy… a theme I’ll be hitting on
several times over this series. Humans might

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.319
like firm, delineated boundaries between things,
but nature isn’t so picky.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.280
And that brings us to our first edition of
“Focus On…”

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.470
This week’s topic: Astronomers! Who are
we? What do we do?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.550
I used to look through telescopes for a living,
or at least study the data that came from

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.250
detectors strapped onto them. But now I talk
and write (and make videos) about astronomy,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.430
and relegate my viewing to my personal backyard
telescope. But I still consider myself an

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.190
astronomer, so that should give you an idea that
there’s a lot of wiggle room in the profession.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.320
In fact, when I worked on Hubble Space Telescope,
I was actually hired as... a programmer!

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.040
I coded in the language used by the folks
helping to build and calibrate a camera that

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.340
was due to launch into space and be installed
onto Hubble by an astronaut.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.280
Once the data from that camera are taken and
analyzed, you have to know what to do with

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.050
them. Do the observations fit the physical
model of how stars blow up, or how galaxies

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.360
form, or the way gas flows through space?
Well, you better know your math and physics,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.110
because that’s how we test our hypotheses.
And someone who does that is generally called

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.380
an astrophysicist.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.790
Of course, those telescopes and detectors
don’t create themselves. We need engineers

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.590
to design and build them and technicians to
use them.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.620
Most astronomers don’t actually use the
telescopes themselves anymore; someone who’s

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.130
trained in their specific use does that for
them.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.160
Some of those instruments go into space, and
some go to other worlds, like the moon and Mars.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.400
We need astronomers and engineers and
software programmers who can build those, too.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.040
And then, at the end of all this, we need
people to tell you all about it. Teachers,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.810
professors, writers, video makers, even artists.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.080
So I’ll tell you what: If you have an interest
in the Universe, if you love to look up at

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.220
the stars, if you crave to understand what’s
going on literally over your head, then who

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.980
am I to say you’re not an astronomer?

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.710
However you define astronomy, humans have
been looking up at the sky for as long as

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.520
we’ve been humans.
Certainly ancient people noticed the big glowy

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.970
ball in the sky, and how it lit everything
up while it was up, and how it got dark when

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.480
it was gone. The other, fainter glowy thing
tried, but wasn’t quite as good as lighting

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.900
up the night. They probably took that sort
of thing pretty seriously. They probably also

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.930
noticed that when certain stars appeared in
the sky, the weather started getting warmer

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.280
and the days longer, and when other stars
were seen, the weather would get colder and

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.360
daytime shorten.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.460
And when humans settled down, discovered agriculture,
and started farming, noticing those patterns

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.820
in the sky would have had an even greater
impact. It told them when to plant seeds,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.760
and when to harvest.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.510
The cycles in the sky became pretty important.
So important that it wasn’t hard to imagine

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.810
gods up there, looking down on us weak and
ridiculous humans, interfering with our lives.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.740
Surely if the stars tell us when to plant,
and control the weather, seasons, and the

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.670
length of the day, they control our lives
too… and astrology was born.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.880
Astrology literally means “study of the
stars”; as a word it’s been used before

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.690
science became a formal method of studying
nature. It irks me a bit, since it got the

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.850
good name, and now we’re stuck with “astronomy,”
which means “law or culture of the stars."

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.150
That’s not really what we do! But what the
heck. Words change meaning over time, and

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.000
now it’s pretty well understood that astronomy
is science, and astrology… isn’t.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.419
Millennia ago, astrology was as close to science
as you got. It had some of the flavors of

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:03.319
science: astrologers observed the skies, made
predictions about how it would affect people,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.480
and then those people would provide evidence
for it by swearing up and down it worked.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.430
The thing is, it really didn’t; the fault
of astrology lies in ourselves and not our

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.740
stars. People tend to remember the hits and
forget the misses when predictions are made,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.090
which is why they sometimes sit in casinos
pumping nickels into machines that are in

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.460
proven to be nothing more than a method for
reducing the number of nickels you have.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.130
But astrology led to people to really study
the sky, and find the patterns there, which

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.630
led to a more rigorous understanding of how
things worked in the heavenly vault.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.740
It wasn’t overnight, of course. This took
centuries. Before the invention of the telescope,

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.440
keen observers built all sorts of odd and
wonderful devices to measure the heavens,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.680
and in fact it was before the telescope was
first turned to the sky that a huge revolution

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.840
in astronomy took place.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.320
It is patently obvious that the ground you
stand on is fixed, rooted if you will, and

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:03.310
the skies turn above us. The sun rises, the
sun sets. The moon rises and sets, the stars

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.220
themselves wheel around the sky at night.
Clearly, the Earth is motionless, and the

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.960
sky is what is actually moving.
In fact, if you think about it, geocentrism

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.580
makes perfect sense that all the objects in
the sky revolve about the Earth, and are fixed

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.889
to a series of nested spheres, some of which
are transparent, maybe made of crystal, which

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:28.909
spin once per day. The stars may just be holes in the
otherwise opaque sphere, letting sunlight though.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.710
Sounds silly to you, doesn’t it?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.149
Well, here’s the thing: If you don’t have
today’s modern understanding of how the

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:41.029
cosmos works, this whole multiple-shells-of-things-in-
the-sky thing actually does make sense. It explains

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:45.410
a lot of what’s going on over your head,
and if it was good enough for Plato, Aristotle,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.399
and Ptolemy, then by god it was good enough
for you. And speaking of which, it was endorsed

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:55.290
by the major religions of the time, so maybe
it’s better if you just nod and agree and

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.490
don’t think about it too hard.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.910
But a few centuries ago things changed. Although
he wasn’t the first, the Polish mathematician

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.550
and astronomer Copernicus came up with the
idea that the sun was the center of the solar

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.529
system, not the Earth. His ideas had problems,
which we’ll get to in a later episode, but

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:14.079
it did an incrementally better job than geocentrism.

00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:19.389
And then along came Tycho Brahe and Johannes
Kepler, who modified that system, making it

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:26.290
even better. Then Isaac Newton - oh, Newton
- he invented calculus partly to help him

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:31.240
understand the way objects moved in space.
Over time, our math got better, our physics

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:37.160
got better, and our understanding grew. Applied
math was a revolution in astronomy, and then

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.860
the use of telescopes was another.
Galileo didn’t invent the telescope, by

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:46.129
the way, but made them better; Newton invented
a new kind that was even better than that,

00:09:46.129 --> 00:09:47.839
and we’ve run with the idea from there.

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:53.429
Then, about a century or so ago, came another
revolution: photography. We could capture

00:09:53.429 --> 00:09:58.189
much fainter objects on glass plates sprayed
with light-sensitive chemicals, which revealed

00:09:58.189 --> 00:10:04.600
stars otherwise invisible to us, details in galaxies,
beautiful clouds of gas and dust in space.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.470
And then in the latter half of the last century,
digital detectors were invented, which were

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.709
even more sensitive than film. We could use
computers to directly analyze observations,

00:10:14.709 --> 00:10:19.019
and our knowledge leaped again. When these
were coupled with telescopes sent in orbit

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:23.410
around the Earth - where our roiling and boiling
atmosphere doesn’t blur out observations

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.199
- we began yet another revolution.

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:27.339
And where are we now?

00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:32.649
We’ve come such a long way! What questions
can we routinely ask that our ancestors would

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:36.749
not have dared, what statements made with
a pretty good degree of certainty?

00:10:36.749 --> 00:10:43.149
Think on this: The lights in the sky are stars!
There are other worlds. We take the idea of

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:48.629
looking for life on alien planets seriously,
and spend billions of dollars doing it. Our

00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:55.449
galaxy is one of a hundred billion others.
We can only directly see 4% of the Universe.

00:10:55.449 --> 00:11:00.869
Stars explode, and when they do they create
the stuff of life: the iron in our blood,

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:06.119
the calcium in our bones, the phosphorus that
is the backbone of our DNA. The most common

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:10.980
kind of star in the Universe is so faint you
can’t see it without a telescope. Our solar

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:16.050
system is filled to overflowing with worlds
more bizarre than we could have dreamed.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:21.309
Nature has more imagination than we do. It
comes up with some nutty stuff. We’re clever

00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:26.089
too, we big-brained apes. We’ve learned
a lot… but there’s still a long way to go.

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:29.670
So, with that, I think we’re ready. Let’s
explore the universe.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.699
Today you learned what astronomy is, and that
astronomers aren’t just people who operate

00:11:33.699 --> 00:11:39.999
telescopes, but include mathematicians, engineers,
technicians, programmers, and even artists.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:43.759
We also wrapped up with a quick history of
the origins and development of astronomy,

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:46.339
from ancient observers to the Hubble Space
Telescope.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.200
