00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.300
One of the most compelling mysteries besides
what happened before the big bang and how

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.360
life began, is the question of what killed
the Neanderthals?

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.329
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.740
Neanderthals have captured our imaginations
since they were first discovered in 1856 in

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.020
a cave in Neander Valley, near Dusseldorf,
Germany.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.000
They weren’t human, but they were just so
much like us.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.510
We share a common ancestor with Neanderthals
about 500,000 years ago.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.820
And like us, they came out of Africa and made
their way across Europe and Asia, but long

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.840
before we did.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.540
Perhaps as early as 230,000 years ago, while
humans didn’t leave Africa until 60,000

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.540
years ago.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.740
We know a few things about them.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.930
Like, ancient humans weren’t all that different
or better than the Neanderthals.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.170
I know it’s tempting to say they were just
stupid apes and our superior brains drove

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.220
them to extinction.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.860
But that’s not the case.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.180
They’re both smart and social creatures.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.719
Neanderthals made sophisticated tools and
made cave paintings, just like early humans.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.670
There’s evidence that they could plan ahead
and maybe even talk like us.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.970
They were not stupid guys with big foreheads.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.970
Okay yeah, they did have big brow bones and
big noses.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.970
So anyways what happened to them?

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.090
At most there might have been only 70,000
but that number could have been a lot smaller.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.110
By dating bones, researchers think Neanderthals’
population shrank around 50,000 years ago.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.560
This left them in small, isolated groups.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.020
Some estimates think there could have been
only as few as a couple thousand females of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.229
reproductive age.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.450
This was, maybe coincidentally, around the
time when homo sapiens arrive on the scene.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.740
The two groups probably interbred a little
bit.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.119
1 to 2% of modern human DNA is from Neanderthals.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.890
Alright, cool so two groups mixing and mingling,
what could go wrong?

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.790
Well something happened around 45,000 years
ago.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.550
In 5,400 years, Neanderthals vanished.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.250
There are two events that happened around
the same time that may have wiped out the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.220
already weakened Neanderthals population.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.360
A volcano near Naples, Italy erupted and blanketed
the surrounding areas in ash.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.799
Some researchers think this caused a "volcanic
winter" in Europe.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.689
This cooling climate in Europe could have
damaged ecosystems just enough to knock out

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.190
the fading Neanderthals.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.320
Another idea proposed by anthropologist Pat
Shipman, is that modern humans put the final

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.330
nail in the Neanderthal’s coffin.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.330
No we didn’t hunt them to death.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.330
We just out competed them.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.720
She compared human’s arriving on the scene
to an invasive species.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.870
Just like kudzu, a vine that’s taking over
the south, out competes native species for

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.510
food and resources, that’s just what humans
did.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.150
Human’s advantages weren’t that many,
early humans had a lower metabolic weight

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.560
and used different kind of weapons, projectile
rather than hand held.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.930
But this was just enough to tip the balance
in our favor.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.471
She also put forward an interesting idea,
that maybe it was the domestication of dogs

00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:35.160
that gave humans the upper hand.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.970
Once humans trained dogs for hunting, it was
simply too good of a team for the Neanderthals

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.970
to beat.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.819
Dogs could have helped humans track down prey
and even protect that carcass from other predators.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.080
Shipman calls the dynamic duo of humans and
dogs, a “fatal innovation.”

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.250
Most research seems to suggest that whatever
killed off our Neanderthal cousins, it wasn’t

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.250
a singular event.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.450
But a complex process that happened over a
couple of millenia.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.450
Maybe we’ll never know.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.330
But we can sure keep trying to figure it out.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.330
Because science.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.269
Alright humans, what’s your favorite hypothesis
on what killed off the Neanderthals?

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.210
Let us know in the comments below!

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.959
Was it bunnies? was it volcanoes?

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.890
Will we ever know!?
