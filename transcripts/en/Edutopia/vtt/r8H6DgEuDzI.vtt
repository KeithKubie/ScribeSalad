00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:09.436
&gt;&gt;Mark: One of our core values
is achieving social justice.

00:00:09.636 --> 00:00:13.776
And this is something that, I mean,
it kind of defines what we do.

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:16.056
Our Founder and Head
of Schools often talks

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:19.266
about education being the
civil rights issue of our day.

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:21.496
And I couldn't agree more.

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:25.416
And it goes back to this idea
of giving 100 percent every day.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:29.056
When you think about the civil rights
activists, they didn't take time

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:33.646
to ask themselves, "Do I
have energy left to give?"

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:37.246
If you truly believe that this
is an issue of civil rights,

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:39.916
then it kind of inspires
you to give more

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:41.866
than you thought you
were able to give.

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.306
And then when you look at
our demographic of students

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:47.216
at this school, 83 percent
of our students qualify

00:00:47.216 --> 00:00:49.436
for free or reduced lunch.

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:52.486
We don't have the exact numbers
yet for at-risk, but I would guess

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:55.216
that roughly half of our
students are considered at-risk.

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:59.046
It's just a very high need
segment of the population,

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:00.626
and historically under-served.

00:01:01.096 --> 00:01:04.046
And so when we say,
"Achieving social justice,"

00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:06.876
what we mean is we are giving
opportunities to students

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:10.906
that they would not get at another
school, but we believe are kind

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:13.946
of just baseline opportunities.

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:19.176
All students in America should
have access to excellent education,

00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:20.876
and that currently isn't the case.

00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:25.456
And so we're here to kind
of level the playing field.

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:30.466
&gt;&gt;Mark: We're looking to not just
give students a baseline education,

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.366
but look for ways to enhance that.

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:37.306
So that involves implementing
programs that they wouldn't get,

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:38.976
maybe, at their traditional
public school.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:44.466
It includes going on field lessons
or field trips to different colleges

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:48.786
around the country, exposing them
to college, so that it's not just,

00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:49.986
"Yeah, we're going to
send you to college,

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:51.256
or you're going to get into college."

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:52.816
But it's very much, "We're going

00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:56.666
to provide you opportunities along
the way, so that when it's time to go

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:59.226
to college you've been
exposed to that opportunity,

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:00.176
and you're ready for it."

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.186
&gt;&gt;Mark: I've been asked a number

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:04.636
of times what makes YES
Prep North Central great.

00:02:04.986 --> 00:02:08.066
And I've even had people
say, "You know,

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.396
what do you do to make it great?"

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:13.196
And I'm not being falsely
humble here, like it's not me.

00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:15.056
It's people, people, people.

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:16.526
It's the teachers that we have here.

00:02:16.876 --> 00:02:21.466
And so we have a very clearly
defined way that we recruit teachers.

00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:26.776
And we use, basically, a personality
profile to ensure that the people

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:33.946
who come to work here are not
just dedicated to this idea

00:02:34.536 --> 00:02:38.956
of social justice, but they're also
dedicated to working in a team,

00:02:39.156 --> 00:02:42.046
and they're dedicated to being part
of something greater than themselves.

00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:44.616
So we work really hard to make sure
that we've got the right people,

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:47.466
and then once we have them here, we
work really hard to keep them here.

00:02:47.616 --> 00:02:51.046
&gt;&gt;Mark: You know, it's challenging
for me sometimes as a leader,

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:55.356
because your tendency is to want
to keep control of everything.

00:02:55.766 --> 00:03:00.866
And what I realize more and more
is that leadership can be this--

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:02.626
you can think of it as this pyramid.

00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:05.516
And the more that I sort of
sit up top on the pyramid

00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:09.956
and keep the authority to myself and
keep the decision-making to myself,

00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:12.876
the more likely our school
is to become stagnant

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:17.446
and just become basically
a microcosm of me.

00:03:17.716 --> 00:03:19.076
And that's the last
thing I would want.

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:21.556
And so I intentionally hire
people who are different than me.

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:25.846
I intentionally look for ways to
have people on my leadership team,

00:03:25.846 --> 00:03:27.856
and have people in my
school who push me.

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:34.026
Just making sure that there are as
many voices in this school onboard

00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:35.096
and feel like they have a voice,

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:37.846
and I think that makes
it much more genuine.

00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:40.686
&gt;&gt;Mark: I really fight hard to
not micromanage my teachers.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:44.436
I think of it as I'm the
support there for them.

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:47.386
I've used the analogy with
them before of being oxygen.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:51.106
And that if things are going well,
I sort of fade into the background.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:53.516
But if I'm not doing my job,
or things aren't going well,

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:56.226
then they're suffocating and
they know I'm not doing my job.

00:03:56.226 --> 00:04:01.056
So it's very much like find the
right people, and spend a lot

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:03.866
of time doing that, and then
just let them run the school.

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:08.616
And in a lot of ways, they have a
lot of autonomy here at this school.

00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:13.656
&gt;&gt;Mark: Teachers are each provided a
cell phone from the school in order

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:15.226
to make themselves accessible

00:04:15.226 --> 00:04:18.066
to students twenty-four hours
a day, seven days a week.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:23.146
And the idea being is that students
aren't allowed to use the excuse

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:24.566
that they didn't understand
something.

00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:27.066
And it, again, exemplifies that idea

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:31.146
that we want teachers building this
positive relationship with students.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.936
So that doesn't just happen
during the school day.

00:04:33.936 --> 00:04:35.106
It happens at night.

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:38.736
If a student has an issue that comes
up at night, they have an avenue

00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:40.786
to get in touch with
the teacher directly,

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:43.496
and we pay the cell phone
bill for the teachers.

00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:47.606
But so students use that for personal
reasons, but they also use it

00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:50.156
if they have a question on their
homework, and they need help,

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.866
they can call their teacher.

00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:53.556
So that the next day they
can't come in and say,

00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:55.606
"I didn't understand
something, so I didn't do it."

00:04:56.246 --> 00:05:00.316
They always have an avenue to
look for, to reach out for help.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.056
&gt;&gt;Mark: Working 100 percent
every day means different things

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:04.936
to different people.

00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:08.846
Some things that, I think, are
pretty common when people talk

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:12.226
about it is the availability
that we talked about earlier.

00:05:12.676 --> 00:05:17.206
Are you available to your students
past the normal school hours, which,

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:21.096
I think, is probably 8:00 to 3:30,
and we're in school from 7:30

00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:22.806
until 4:30 Monday through Friday.

00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:26.266
So are you available those
times, which are already longer?

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.266
Then on top of that,
are you available

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:30.526
to your students outside
of those hours?

00:05:30.806 --> 00:05:32.796
Are you available to pick up
the phone when they call you

00:05:32.796 --> 00:05:35.836
at 9:00 upset about a fight that
they've had with their parents?

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:40.256
Are you available to return a phone
call when they ask about homework

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.286
that you gave that
they don't understand?

00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:47.386
Then when you're in the
classroom, we're not okay

00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:49.486
with just average lessons.

00:05:49.656 --> 00:05:53.086
They need to be high energy, high
impact lessons that are going

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:57.336
to ensure that students who
are here for-- what is that?

00:05:57.336 --> 00:05:58.326
Nine hours a day?

00:05:58.626 --> 00:06:01.886
Are making sure that during those
nine hours that they're here,

00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:05.776
they're not getting, eh, four to
five hours of great instruction.

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:07.686
But they're getting
as close to nine hours

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:10.056
of great instruction as possible.

00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:13.176
&gt;&gt;Mark: Burn-out is something that we
have to deal with, but we work hard

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:20.026
as administrators to find ways to
relieve teachers and kind of try

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:23.766
and provide some balance in a
job that's inherently unbalanced.

00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:27.556
You know, we do things like making
sure they have common planning times.

00:06:27.826 --> 00:06:31.056
So that they aren't having
to meet after school.

00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:34.816
After school they can spend time with
students, or if they need to go home

00:06:34.816 --> 00:06:36.616
and spend some time with their
families, they can do that,

00:06:37.036 --> 00:06:39.836
but try and maximize the time
that they have in school.

00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:42.706
So common planning
times is one of them.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.786
We also have a weekly early dismissal
on Wednesdays where teachers gather

00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:48.046
to do professional development.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.766
And sometimes if we don't have
something really well-planned,

00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:55.076
then we'll do something fun like
have a staff volleyball game,

00:06:55.076 --> 00:06:56.996
or a staff picnic or
a staff barbeque.

00:06:57.386 --> 00:06:59.786
Just something to continually
draw on our strength

00:07:00.366 --> 00:07:01.986
of relationships with each other.

00:07:01.986 --> 00:07:05.216
&gt;&gt;Mark: We don't have fights,
because we don't allow fights.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:08.916
And I believe that if
we lowered that bar--

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:12.456
just like if you lower an academic
bar, if you lower a behavior bar,

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.656
what it ends up doing is
it makes things permissible

00:07:15.656 --> 00:07:17.006
that shouldn't be permissible.

00:07:17.176 --> 00:07:19.566
And if we're going to call
ourselves a family-oriented school--

00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:23.156
now, I know families fight-- we're
not going to have people getting

00:07:23.156 --> 00:07:25.416
in fist-fights in the hallway,
and say, "That's okay,"

00:07:25.416 --> 00:07:26.506
by allowing them to stay.

00:07:26.926 --> 00:07:31.426
And thinking about the course of
this year, we've had two fights,

00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:35.956
and for a middle school and a high
school, I mean, it's remarkable.

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:38.586
And I guess you can write it
off and say, "Oh, yeah, well,

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:40.766
you got to hand pick the
student who were here,

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:42.696
and so they're not
prone to fighting."

00:07:42.986 --> 00:07:43.956
I would disagree.

00:07:43.956 --> 00:07:47.586
A) We didn't handpick them, because
we do an open enrollment lottery;

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:50.506
B) Middle school students
and high school students,

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:51.936
period, are prone to fighting.

00:07:52.226 --> 00:07:56.276
And what we need to do is educate
them about the alternatives.

00:07:56.276 --> 00:08:03.366
And so we have a social worker
on-staff, a full-time social worker.

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:05.076
We're looking to expand that role.

00:08:05.456 --> 00:08:09.426
Every day students are in advisor
meeting with a group of teachers.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.636
So we're looking for ways not just
to say, "Oh, students don't fight,"

00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:14.526
but how do we educate students

00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:17.686
so that fighting isn't their first
choice, they have other alternatives.

00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:21.076
&gt;&gt;Mark: The first group
that came here, they left,

00:08:21.286 --> 00:08:24.176
and their parting words to
me were, "This is possible.

00:08:24.316 --> 00:08:25.416
We can do this."

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:27.256
And I believe that, right?

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.006
It's possible.

00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:30.196
Is it going to look
exactly like what we do?

00:08:30.196 --> 00:08:33.636
No, I don't think you can take it
and just kind of cookie-cutter,

00:08:33.636 --> 00:08:36.496
lay it on top of whatever
you're doing at your school.

00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:38.676
But are the ideas here?

00:08:39.046 --> 00:08:39.866
Are they possible?

00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:40.676
Absolutely.

00:08:40.736 --> 00:08:44.486
And what you have to have
is a sense of a possibility.

00:08:44.486 --> 00:08:48.076
I mean, it's not going to be easy,
and we've been working at this

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:51.166
for ten years, and we still
have a ton of stuff to do.

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:53.496
So there aren't any quick
fixes, I don't think.

00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:58.576
I think it requires a ton of hard
work, and I mentioned this earlier,

00:08:58.576 --> 00:09:03.776
and I believe this, that it involves
people seeing education as much more

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:08.056
than just a job that you go to, but
you would give it the same passion

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:10.776
that you would give it
if you truly believed

00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:12.206
that someone's life was in danger.

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:13.376
So I think about a doctor.

00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:17.156
If a doctor is saving someone's
life, they're not going to stop

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:18.586
because the workday ends.

00:09:18.586 --> 00:09:20.766
They're going to keep going
and doing whatever it takes

00:09:20.766 --> 00:09:21.746
to make sure that happens.

00:09:22.046 --> 00:09:24.446
And if you had more people thinking
like that, that this would--

00:09:24.446 --> 00:09:27.606
that our nation's health depends

00:09:27.606 --> 00:09:29.596
on how well we're educating
our students;

00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:32.736
if you had more people
completely bought into that idea,

00:09:32.736 --> 00:09:37.276
that their welfare is directly
tied to the students' welfare,

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:39.826
I think it's absolutely possible.

00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:42.966
