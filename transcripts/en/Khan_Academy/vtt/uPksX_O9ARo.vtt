00:00:00.173 --> 00:00:01.406
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can find the limit

00:00:01.406 --> 00:00:03.494
as x approaches negative infinity

00:00:03.494 --> 00:00:06.915
of the square root of
4x to the fourth minus x

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:09.165
over 2x squared plus three.

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:11.574
And like always, pause this video

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:13.857
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:15.785
Well, whenever we're trying to find limits

00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:17.763
at either positive or negative infinity

00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:19.837
of rational expressions like this,

00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:23.264
it's useful to look at what
is the highest degree term

00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:26.075
in the numerator or in the denominator,

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:28.525
or, actually in the numerator
and the denominator,

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:30.989
and then divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.694
by that highest degree,
by x to that degree.

00:00:34.694 --> 00:00:36.818
Because if we do that,
then we're going to end up

00:00:36.818 --> 00:00:38.575
with some constants and some other things

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:40.618
that will go to zero
as we approach positive

00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:42.329
or negative infinity,
and we should be able

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.838
to find this limit.

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:46.099
So what I'm talking about,
let's divide the numerator

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:50.266
by one over x squared and
let's divide the denominator

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:53.770
by one over x squared.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.744
Now, you might be saying, "Wait, wait,

00:00:54.744 --> 00:00:56.006
"I see an x to the fourth here.

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:56.972
"That's a higher degree."

00:00:56.972 --> 00:00:59.281
But remember, it's under the radical here.

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:01.251
So if you wanna look at
it at a very high level,

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:03.103
you're saying, okay, well x
to the fourth, but it's under,

00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:05.943
you're gonna take the square
root of this entire expression,

00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:08.774
so you can really view this
as a second degree term.

00:01:08.774 --> 00:01:10.610
So the highest degree
is really second degree,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.590
so let's divide the numerator

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.884
and the denominator by x squared.

00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:15.491
And if we do that, dividing,

00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:18.387
so this is going to be the same thing as,

00:01:18.387 --> 00:01:21.137
so this is going to be the limit,

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:27.476
the limit as x approaches
negative infinity of,

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.756
so let me just do a
little bit of a side here.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.409
So if I have,

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.076
if I have one over x squared,

00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:37.498
all right, let me write it.

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:39.652
Let me just, one over x
squared times the square root

00:01:39.652 --> 00:01:41.779
of 4x to the fourth minus x,

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:43.711
like we have in the numerator here.

00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:46.203
This is equal to, this is the same thing

00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:50.515
as one over the square
root of x to the fourth

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:54.682
times the square root of
4x to the fourth minus x.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.311
And so this is equal to the square root

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.561
of 4x to the fourth minus x

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:07.296
over x to the fourth, which is
equal to the square root of,

00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:10.922
and all I did is I brought
the radical in here.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.351
You could view this as the
square root of all this

00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:13.582
divided by the square root of this,

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:15.609
which is equal to, just
using our exponent rules,

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.152
the square root of 4x
to the fourth minus x

00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:19.638
over x to the fourth.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:23.482
And then this is the
same thing as four minus,

00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:27.219
x over x to the fourth is
one over x to the third.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.667
So this numerator is going to be,

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.216
the numerator's going
to be the square root

00:02:32.216 --> 00:02:35.799
of four minus one, x to the third power.

00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:39.602
And then the denominator

00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:42.583
is going to be equal to,

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:45.725
well, you divide 2x squared by x squared.

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:47.503
You're just going to be left with two.

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:49.924
And then three divided
by x squared is gonna be

00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:51.924
three over x squared.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.479
Now, let's think about the limit

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.835
as we approach negative infinity.

00:02:56.835 --> 00:02:59.706
As we approach negative infinity,

00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:02.706
this is going to approach zero.

00:03:02.706 --> 00:03:05.842
One divided by things that are becoming

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:07.805
more and more and more and
more and more negative,

00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:08.988
their magnitude is getting larger,

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:12.008
so this is going to approach zero.

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:14.280
This over here is also going to be,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.546
this thing is also going
to be approaching zero.

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:20.128
We're dividing by larger and
larger and larger values.

00:03:20.128 --> 00:03:22.152
And so what this is going to result in

00:03:22.152 --> 00:03:25.532
is the square root of four,
the principal root of four,

00:03:25.532 --> 00:03:27.945
over two, which is the same thing

00:03:27.945 --> 00:03:29.855
as two over two,

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:31.688
which is equal to one.

00:03:33.223 --> 00:03:34.556
And we are done.
