00:00:00.686 --> 00:00:02.791
- [Voiceover] In the figure
at left, I put, pasted it

00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:06.133
up here, point O

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.558
is the center of a circle of radius 1.5.

00:00:09.558 --> 00:00:11.312
We see that right over there.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.112
The missing sector of the
circle has central angle AOB

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:22.956
equal to 2pi over 3 radians,
that's this right over here,

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.333
and that's the central
angle for the missing,

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.143
for the missing sector, right over there.

00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:31.028
What is the length of arc ACB?

00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:35.660
Now ACB, ACB is this arc.

00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:37.989
It's kind of the rest of the circle,

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:39.553
the part that's not missing.

00:00:39.892 --> 00:00:42.276
So, this is ACB right over here.

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:44.253
Well, the way that I would tackle this,

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:45.675
I would think, well,
what's the circumference

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:48.723
of the entire circle, and then
what fraction of the entire

00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:51.106
circle is this arc length?

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.906
So, let's first think
about the circumference

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:54.090
of the entire circle.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.513
Circumference is equal to 2 pi times r

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.967
In this case, our r, our radius, is 1.5.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:04.624
So, it's gonna be 2 pi times 1.5.

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.794
Now, 2 times 1.5 is 3.

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:09.818
And so, this is going to be equal to,

00:01:10.108 --> 00:01:13.513
this is going to be equal to 3 pi.

00:01:13.513 --> 00:01:17.055
So, the circumference of
the entire circle is 3 pi,

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:19.153
and now there's a couple
of ways you could do it.

00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:21.867
You could figure out, well,
what is the length of this arc

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:23.899
right over here and then subtract that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.012
from the circumference and
then you'd be left with

00:01:26.012 --> 00:01:28.287
the magenta part, or we could figure out

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:30.589
the central angle of the magenta part.

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:33.367
We could figure out this
angle, and think about

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:36.102
well, what fraction is
that going to be of the,

00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:37.374
if we were to go all the way around,

00:01:37.374 --> 00:01:39.670
and if we're thinking in
radians, going all the way around

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.403
is 2 pi radians.

00:01:41.844 --> 00:01:44.755
So, what fraction is this angle of 2 pi,

00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:47.045
and then that's going
to be the same fraction

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.220
that this arc length is of
the entire circumference.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.902
Well, what's this angle going to be?

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.103
Well, it's going to
be, if we want remember

00:01:55.103 --> 00:01:58.191
all the way around, if we
went all the way around

00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:01.055
the circle, if we went all
the way around the circle

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:02.984
that'd be 2 pi radians.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.611
But, if we wanna figure out
this magenta central angle

00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:08.721
it's going to be 2 pi minus this

00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:11.124
2 pi over 3.

00:02:11.504 --> 00:02:13.827
So, this is going to be 2 pi,

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.448
let me do it in that magenta color.

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:21.498
So, the central angle for
this piece of the circle

00:02:21.716 --> 00:02:24.302
for that's kinda the central angle for ACB

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.235
is going to be 2 pi

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.675
- 2 pi over 3.

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:31.849
I'm going all the way around,
but then I'm subtracting

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.927
out this part right over here.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.812
Now, what's 2 pi minus 2 pi over 3?

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:39.216
Let's see I can find a common denominator,

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:41.979
instead of writing it as
2 pi I can write that as

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.267
6 pi over 3, so let me do that.

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.487
It's gonna be 6 pi over 3

00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:48.844
minus 2 pi over 3.

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:51.465
Well, that's going to be 4 pi over 3

00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:55.475
So, once again, this angle right over here

00:02:55.753 --> 00:02:57.486
is 4pi over 3.

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.848
4 pi over 3 radians.

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.589
Now, what fraction is
that of if we were to go

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:08.058
all the way around the circle?

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:12.101
Well, once again, this
central angle is 4 pi over 3.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.005
If you were to go all
the way around the circle

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:15.250
that's 2 pi.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:19.267
So, this is the fraction
of the entire circle

00:03:19.592 --> 00:03:22.036
that this arc represents.

00:03:22.213 --> 00:03:24.001
And so, let's just multiply that times

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:25.450
the entire circumference.

00:03:26.337 --> 00:03:30.002
Times 3 pi, and let's try to simplify it.

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:33.414
Let's see we have pi divided by pi,

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.602
and let's see if we take
this 3 and multiply it times

00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:38.493
the numerator this three is
going to cancel that three.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.891
And, we're gonna be left with 4 pi

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.395
over 2, 4 pi divided by 2

00:03:47.897 --> 00:03:50.788
is equal to 2 pi.

00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:53.179
So, that's the length, that's the length

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:55.807
of this arc.

00:03:56.064 --> 00:03:59.516
So, it actually exactly 2/3

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:03.469
of the entire circumference.

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.178
So, let me just select that 2 pi.

00:04:07.074 --> 00:04:08.600
And, we're done.
