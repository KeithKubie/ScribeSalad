00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.422
Keeping persona's in mind when
you're designing a product,

00:00:03.422 --> 00:00:05.693
how does accessibility
play in the persona's?

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:10.097
&gt;&gt; Well, like with all persona's you
want those to be based on information

00:00:10.097 --> 00:00:11.840
from talking to real users.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.440
And so again, is no different here.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.070
So you want to go out and actually talk
with people that have these impairments.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.858
And when you're developing your persona,
some key pieces of information that you

00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:25.860
want to include are,
what is their impairment?

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.430
What is the severity of it?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.600
How do they kind of tackle and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.910
get through their daily
challenges with the impairment?

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.470
What are certain assistive
technologies that they use?

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.570
What's or how experienced are they
with those assistive technologies?

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.460
What's their skill level?

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.702
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:45.702 --> 00:00:49.765
&gt;&gt; You want to talk about what
are their pain points in trying

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:54.350
to achieve tasks that
are related to your product.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.290
The whole goal is just to really
try to get in some important

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.930
insights into how they go
about completing tasks,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.050
and what are some of their different
approaches that they might take that

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.650
maybe other users that you've
already spoken to haven't.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.790
&gt;&gt; And what if I don't have
access necessarily to someone who

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.430
has an impairment, like who else could I
contact, or how may I get that insight?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.860
&gt;&gt; Well, you'd be surprised at
because there is a wide range

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.710
of impairments like again,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.370
if somebody that has just kind of lower
vision versus somebody that's completely

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.390
blind, you probably do know somebody
with some sort of impairment.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.250
And just thinking about
an older relative maybe that

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.060
has lost a bit of their vision or
has arthritis and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.670
their level of dexterity
isn't as what it use to be

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.380
that's really valuable in sites that you
can talk to them about or somebody who's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.230
not a native speaker of the language
that's prominent in your app.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.900
They have to kind of approach
things in a different way too,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.070
that could be really insightful.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.810
So there's a lot of people
out there that you might not

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.889
immediately consider talking to,
that would be really valuable.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.050
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.120
What companies have you seen that
have been designing for all users and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.440
especially with those with impairments?

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.850
&gt;&gt; So,
stepping out of the digital world for

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.750
a minute, I think two great examples are
the Bradley Watch, which is right here.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.030
The Bradley Watch was designed
from the get go thinking about

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.710
people with impairments, at least with
the visual impairments in particular.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.030
And so what this watch allows
you to do is tell time

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.900
with just feeling the watch.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.200
And you can see there's two magnetic
balls here that indicate the hour and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.510
the minute, and
this is obviously great for

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.010
people with disabilities in that
it helps them tell the time, but

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.170
it also is visually appealing,
it's very aesthetically pleasing.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.780
And it doesn't look like anything
very different than other watches.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.220
So it doesn't draw attention
to their disability,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.900
which is always an added bonus
to these types of devices.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.450
But then just thinking about in
situations where if you are sighted,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.280
you might be in a dark movie theater,
or in a meeting,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.960
or discussion where you don't
want to take your gaze away and

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.230
you want to still understand what
time it is, it's really valuable.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's great.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can see, this is
a great example of thinking about

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.550
those needs upfront and coming up
with a great product for everybody.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.870
&gt;&gt; And the other one was Oxo.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.300
&gt;&gt; Yes, and so,
Oxo design is that they have a whole

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.380
design team that focus on universal
design, which we talked about before.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.750
And some of their products always have,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.200
are always keeping in
mind different needs.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.800
And so some examples are, they talk
about this again on their website where

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.280
they can use a basalts
bender with one hand, or

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.787
their measuring cups are really unique,
in that you don't have to kind of

00:03:53.787 --> 00:03:57.610
bend down to see where
the liquid is measuring.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.450
You can look over and
see where the numbers are.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.940
So they take a lot of
things into consideration.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.060
Again, it benefits all users,
not just those with disabilities.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.570
&gt;&gt; And to wrap up, what are you
final thoughts on accessibility?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.070
&gt;&gt; I'd like to say that yes,
it can be daunting.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.120
It can be time-consuming if it's left
to the end of the design development

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.649
process.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.920
There's always a lot of retrofitting and

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.860
rethinking that needs to happen
if it's left to the end.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.070
There's no doubt about it.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.860
So, to save everyone time and
pain, think about it early.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.000
Think about throughout
the entire process and

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.830
just incorporate it into
your existing process.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.810
And in the end,
not only will you have saved time.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.550
But you will also come up with
a much better product that's usable

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.070
for everybody.
