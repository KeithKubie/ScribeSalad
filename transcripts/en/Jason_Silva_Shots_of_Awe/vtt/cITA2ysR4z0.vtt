00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.540
All right.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.080
So let's talk about
the Six Epochs.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.180
Ray Kurzweil talks about
the Six Epochs of Evolution

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.280
as leading us inexorably towards
a technological singularity,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.706
a crescendo, an orgasm
of cosmic proportion.

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:24.520
He talks about Epoch 1,
physics and chemistry,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.730
information stored
in atomic structures.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.050
We move on then to
Epoch 2, biology,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.579
information stored in DNA.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.090
We then get to Epoch
3, brains, information

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.060
stored in neuropatterns.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.650
We then move to
Epoch 4, technology,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.817
information stored in our
tools and software programs.

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:47.820
Then we move to Epoch
5, we're currently

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.395
living through today, the merger
of biology and technology,

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:53.765
the extension of our
cognition, the outsourcing

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:57.230
to our technological tools,
the creation of the eye-mind,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.970
the symbiosis between man
and machine that turns us

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.970
into something far greater,
which eventually gets us

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.190
to Epoch 6, a complete
flourishing of nanotechnology

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.240
and biotechnology.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.350
We impregnate the universe
with intelligence.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.360
We merge with all the
matter in the universe.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.890
And the universe
essentially wakes up.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.220
Tell me that that is not
an intoxicating idea.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.310
The kind of idea that inspired
Alan Harrington to say,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.610
in my mind, "having created the
gods, we can turn into them."

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.182
