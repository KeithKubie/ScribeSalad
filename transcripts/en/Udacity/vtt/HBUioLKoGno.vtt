00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.970
Let's make our GitHub account.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.570
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I'm going to call it 2048-class. Okay, and

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.570
then I'll do the free play, and I"m sure that's fine. Right?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.786
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:13.997
&gt;&gt; That doesn't seem to do anything, but

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:16.760
I don't want to enter my credit card number

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.994
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:19.724
&gt;&gt; Maybe I can, okay set up my account.

00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:22.985
&gt;&gt; Let's see. Yeah, let's just see if we can go

00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:25.699
to the account. It looks like it's set up. I don't know.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.696
I guess we don't need to put in a credit card.

00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:32.003
&gt;&gt; Alright, so we have an account. What's, what do we do next?

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.829
&gt;&gt; Well so we, first we need to install Git.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.681
And so there, there are two ways to access Git.

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:38.819
&gt;&gt; What is, what is Git?

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:39.942
&gt;&gt; It's the version control system itself.

00:00:39.942 --> 00:00:40.818
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:40.818 --> 00:00:45.607
&gt;&gt; So GitHub is just a place to store Git repos, repositories. So

00:00:45.607 --> 00:00:50.775
we actually need the, the software on our computer to, to actually make the

00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:53.765
Git commits and run all the Git commands.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:57.840
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, should I, does Git have software like that?

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.010
&gt;&gt; So there, there is a get hub specific UI that could

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.185
handles Git for you, and it installs Git when you install it. So.

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:06.960
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240
&gt;&gt; We can go ahead and use the Git gooey.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.736
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to just search for

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:13.974
that. What I, what should I search for? GitHub?

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.091
&gt;&gt; Gui?

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:15.553
&gt;&gt; yeah,

00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:17.721
that'll probably get us there.

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:17.782
&gt;&gt; Get us there.

00:01:17.782 --> 00:01:20.093
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:20.093 --> 00:01:21.652
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll do GitHub for Mac.

00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:25.055
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we want the one for Mac.

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:29.237
&gt;&gt; Okay, easy enough.

00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:30.096
&gt;&gt; There it goes.

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:40.014
&gt;&gt; Alright, so we've downloaded it, unzipped it. Now, let's install.

00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:41.012
Alright.

00:01:41.012 --> 00:01:43.436
&gt;&gt; Alright, so we've installed it. We opened it,

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.552
and now we have this folder that says My Repositories.

00:01:45.552 --> 00:01:48.016
&gt;&gt; Yep. So now we actually need to get our repository

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:48.846
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:48.930
&gt;&gt; To put in there.
