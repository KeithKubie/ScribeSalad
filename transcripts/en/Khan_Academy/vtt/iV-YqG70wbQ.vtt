00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:07.235
(upbeat music)

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:11.448
- My name is Tess Winlock.

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:13.422
I'm a software engineer at Google.

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:14.560
Here's a question.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.728
How does a picture, text message, or email

00:00:16.728 --> 00:00:18.756
get sent from one device to another?

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:20.099
It isn't magic.

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.363
It's the Internet, a
tangible, physical system

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:24.500
that was made to move information.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.647
The Internet is a lot
like the postal service,

00:00:27.647 --> 00:00:28.981
but the physical stuff that gets sent

00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:30.527
is a little bit different.

00:00:30.527 --> 00:00:33.136
Instead of boxes and envelopes,

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:36.344
the Internet ships binary information.

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:38.093
Information is made of bits.

00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:40.671
A bit can be described
as any pair of opposites,

00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:43.903
on or off, yes or no.

00:00:43.903 --> 00:00:45.893
We typically use a one, meaning on,

00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:47.979
or a zero, meaning off.

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:50.046
Because a bit has two possible states,

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:52.299
we call it binary code.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.993
Eight bits strung together makes one byte.

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:58.116
One thousand bytes all
together is a kilobyte.

00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:00.402
One thousand kilobytes is a megabyte.

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:02.400
A song is typically encoded using about

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.659
three to four megabytes.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.199
It doesn't matter if it's a
picture, a video, or a song.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:08.973
Everything on the Internet is represented

00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:10.436
and sent around as bits.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.711
These are the atoms of information,

00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:14.453
but it's not like we're physically sending

00:01:14.453 --> 00:01:16.450
ones and zeroes from one place to another

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.354
one person to another.

00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:21.233
So, what is the physical
stuff that actually gets sent

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:23.032
over the wires and the airwaves?

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:25.222
Well, let's look at a small
example here of how humans

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:27.675
can physically communicate
to send a single bit

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:30.152
of information from one place to another.

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:32.755
So say that we could
turn on a light for a one

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:34.782
or off for zero or use beeps

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:37.950
or similar sort of things
of like Morse code.

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:41.208
These methods work, but
they're really slow, error prone,

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:42.634
and totally dependent upon humans.

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:44.344
What we really need is a machine.

00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:47.076
Throughout history, we've
built many systems that can

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:48.952
actually send this binary information

00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:51.339
through different types
of physical mediums.

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:53.698
Today, we physically send bits

00:01:53.698 --> 00:01:56.368
by electricity, light, and radio waves.

00:01:56.368 --> 00:01:58.450
(electricity humming)

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.052
To send a bit via electricity,

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:01.515
imagine that you have two light bulbs

00:02:01.515 --> 00:02:03.197
connected by a copper wire.

00:02:03.197 --> 00:02:05.400
If one device operator
turns on the electricity,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.281
then the light bulb lights up.

00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:09.104
No electricity, no light.

00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:12.459
If the operators on both ends
agree that light on means one

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.759
and light off means zero,

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.820
then we have a system for
sending bits of information

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.193
from one person to
another using electricity.

00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:21.631
They have kind of a small problem.

00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:24.394
If you need to send a
zero five times in a row,

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.350
well, how can you do that in such a way

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.859
that either person can actually
count the number of zeroes?

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.435
Well, the solution is to
introduce a clock or a timer.

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:35.717
The operators can agree that
the sender will send one bit

00:02:35.717 --> 00:02:38.164
per second, and the receiver
will sit down and record

00:02:38.164 --> 00:02:40.539
every single second and
see what's on the line.

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.232
To send five zeros in a row,

00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:45.121
you just turn off the
light, wait five seconds.

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.180
The person on the other end
of the line will write down

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.602
all five seconds, fives ones in a row.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:50.749
Switch it on.

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.191
Five seconds, write down every second.

00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:55.556
Obviously, we'd like to send
things a little bit faster than

00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:58.562
one bit per second, so we need
to increase our bandwidth,

00:02:58.562 --> 00:03:02.056
the maximum transmission
capacity of a device.

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.123
Bandwidth is measured by bitrate,

00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:06.680
which is the number of bits
that we can actually send

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.669
over a given period of time,
usually measured in seconds.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.805
A different measure of
speed is the latency,

00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:16.003
or the amount of time it
takes for one bit to travel

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:18.140
from one place to another,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.880
from the source to the requesting device.

00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:25.054
In our human analogy, one bit
per second was pretty fast,

00:03:25.054 --> 00:03:27.051
but kind of hard for a
human to keep up with.

00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:28.357
So let's say that you
wanna actually download

00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:31.772
a three megabyte song in three seconds.

00:03:31.772 --> 00:03:33.432
At 8,000,0000 bits per megabyte,

00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:36.813
that means a bitrate of about
8,000,000 bits per second.

00:03:36.813 --> 00:03:38.706
Obviously, humans can't send or receive

00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:40.130
8,000,000 bits per second,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.127
but a machine can do that just fine,

00:03:42.127 --> 00:03:44.507
but now there's also a
question of what sort of cable

00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:45.947
to send these messages over

00:03:45.947 --> 00:03:47.990
and how far the signals can go.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.232
With an Ethernet wire,

00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:51.647
the kind that you find in
your home or office or school,

00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:54.967
you see measurable signal
loss or interference

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:57.547
over just a few hundred feet.

00:03:58.275 --> 00:04:00.012
For the Internet to work
all around the world,

00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:02.654
we need to have an alternative
method to send bits

00:04:02.654 --> 00:04:04.473
really long distances.

00:04:04.473 --> 00:04:07.012
We're talking across oceans.

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:07.818
So what else can we use?

00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:09.894
Well, what do we know
that moves a lot faster

00:04:09.894 --> 00:04:12.574
than just electricity through a wire?

00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:13.716
Light.

00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:16.284
We can actually send bits as light beams

00:04:16.284 --> 00:04:19.302
from one place to another
using a fiber optic cable.

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:21.047
A fiber optic cable is a thread of glass

00:04:21.047 --> 00:04:23.249
engineered to reflect light.

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:25.188
When you send a beam of
light down the cable,

00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:27.266
light bounces up and down
the length of the cable

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.112
until it is received on the other end.

00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:30.842
Depending on the bounce angle,

00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:33.430
we can actually send
multiple bits simultaneously,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.683
all of them traveling
at the speed of light,

00:04:35.683 --> 00:04:39.102
so fiber is really, really
fast, but, more importantly,

00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:41.446
the signal doesn't really
degrade over long distances.

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:43.369
This is how you can go hundreds of miles

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:44.354
without signal loss.

00:04:44.354 --> 00:04:46.602
This is why we use fiber optic cables

00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:50.467
across the ocean floors to
connect one continent to another.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.387
In 2008, there was a cable
that was actually cut near

00:04:53.387 --> 00:04:56.362
Alexandria, Egypt, which
really interrupted the Internet

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:59.098
for most of the Middle East and India.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.596
So we take this Internet
thing for granted,

00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:03.777
but it's really a pretty
fragile physical system,

00:05:03.777 --> 00:05:05.983
and fiber is awesome, but
it's also really expensive

00:05:05.983 --> 00:05:07.282
and hard to work with.

00:05:07.282 --> 00:05:10.134
Form most purposes, you're
gonna find copper cable.

00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:12.909
But how do we move things without wires?

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.080
How do we send things wirelessly?

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:19.364
Wireless bit sending machines
typically use radio signal

00:05:19.364 --> 00:05:21.980
to send bits from one place to another.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.884
The machines have to actually
translate the ones and zeroes

00:05:25.884 --> 00:05:28.649
into radio waves of different frequencies.

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:30.925
The receiving machines reverse the process

00:05:30.925 --> 00:05:33.682
and convert back into
binary on your computer.

00:05:33.682 --> 00:05:35.951
So wireless has made our Internet mobile,

00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:38.273
but a radio signal doesn't
travel all that far

00:05:38.273 --> 00:05:40.630
before it completely gets garbled.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.392
This is why you can't
really pick up a Los Angeles

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:44.506
radio station in Chicago.

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:46.865
As great as wireless is,

00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:48.870
today it still relies
on the wired Internet.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.432
If you're in a coffee shop using Wi-Fi,

00:05:50.432 --> 00:05:53.127
then the bits get sent
through this wireless router

00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:54.966
and then are transferred
to the physical wire

00:05:54.966 --> 00:05:58.236
to travel the really long
distances of the Internet.

00:05:58.236 --> 00:06:00.302
The physical method for
sending bits may change

00:06:00.302 --> 00:06:03.006
in the future, whether it's
laser sent between satellites

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:05.624
or radio waves from balloons or drones,

00:06:05.624 --> 00:06:08.333
but the underlying binary
representation of information

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:10.627
and the protocols for
sending that information

00:06:10.627 --> 00:06:12.589
and receiving that
information have pretty much

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:13.831
stayed the same.

00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:15.991
Everything on the Internet,
whether its words, emails,

00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:18.371
images, cat videos, puppy videos,

00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:20.873
all come down to these ones
and zeroes being delivered

00:06:20.873 --> 00:06:24.158
by electronic pulses,
light beams, radio waves,

00:06:24.158 --> 00:06:26.535
and lots and lots of love.

00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:31.535
(upbeat music)
