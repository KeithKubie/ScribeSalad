00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.879
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.719
about the Protestant Reformation.

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:08.199
Mr Green, Mr. Green, this is irrelevant for me; I’m an atheist.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.599
Yeah I know Me From the Past, because I’m you. Although

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.440
actually you are now Episcopalian, a Protestant
church started because a King wanted to get

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.630
a divorce.
But anyway let me submit that religious history

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.240
is important regardless of your personal religious
beliefs, because it helps us to understand

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.660
the lenses through which people have viewed
their lives and communities, and given that,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.910
the Protestant Reformation is what proper
historians refer to as A Big-Ass Deal -- which I

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.910
will remind you is not cursing if you are
referring to donkeys.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.060
So before the Reformation, pretty much all
Christians in Europe were Roman Catholic.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.040
Yes, there were other types of Christians
in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa, but Roman

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.960
Catholicism was the dominant form of Christianity
and had been since like the 4th century.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.290
The Protestant Reformation broke so-called
“western Christendom” in two—then three,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.890
then four, --until finally there were uncountable
denominations of Christianity--not just Lutherans

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.960
but Apostolic Lutherans and Reformed Lutherans
and Free Lutherans and Lutherans for Just

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.140
Going Back to Being Catholic Because This
Has Become So Complicated.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.180
This was hugely important--it changed people’s
way of looking at themselves and the world,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.880
it led to wider European literacy, and eventually
forced governments to grant religious freedoms,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.280
while also at the same time maybe being more
of a political revolution than a religious one.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.439
So, during the European Middle Ages, the Catholic

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.560
Church really dominated European civilization.
It’s almost impossible to imagine the scope

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.640
of the Church’s power in the Middle Ages,
but let’s try.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.600
First off, the Catholic Church was the caretaker
of the most important thing that Christians

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.590
had, their souls, which, unlike our temporal
bodies, were eternal.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.250
And then there was the parish priest, who
played a pivotal role throughout every person’s

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.040
life, baptizing them, marrying them, hearing
their confessions, providing last rites.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.880
The church also provided all of the social services:
It distributed alms to the poor, and ran orphanages,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.420
and provided what education was available.
And most Europeans would in their lives meet

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.590
exactly one person who could read the Bible,
which was only available in Latin - their

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.099
parish priest.
And, the church owned over 1/3 of all the

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.459
land in Europe, which helped make it the most
powerful economic and political force on the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.740
continent. And the Pope claimed authority
over all the kings of Europe, as the successor

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.750
to the Roman Emperor.
So this was a very powerful institution, and

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.250
it was undone by one chronically constipated
monk.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.310
Here at Crash Course, we don’t like to get
too into like, Great Man History, but the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.810
Reformation really was initiated and shaped
by one man: Martin Luther. No, Stan, the Martin

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.760
Luther he was named for. No, Stan! The Martin
Luther that HE was named for. Yes.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.810
Okay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble:
Luther studied law, and like most law students,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.349
he hated it. Then one day a sudden storm blew
up, lightning struck him to the ground, and

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.700
in a panic, he cried, “Help me, Saint Anne!
I’ll become a monk!” He survived and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.040
in the next two weeks, he withdrew from university,
entered an Augustinian monastery, took his

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.849
vows, and sent a message to inform his family,
who I’m sure were delighted to have spent

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.010
all that money on education because monking
is so lucrative.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.680
In 1505, Luther was sent to Rome on a diplomatic
mission, and he ignored all the awesome art

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.160
and focused instead on Rome’s corruption—with
prostitutes openly soliciting on the filthy

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.569
streets, priests who made light of their duties,
hurrying through mass so fast that it seemed

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.449
to mean nothing, and openly deriding Church
doctrine.

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:34.000
Luther was obsessed with his own sinfulness
and he kept confessing, incessantly. And finally

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.460
his confessor and teachers sent him to the
University of Wittenberg, because you know,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.600
they were a little bit annoyed with him, and
they figured he’d be good at teaching scripture.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.940
These days of course, incessant confessors
are put on the real housewives of New Jersey,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.220
but back then, you sent them to the University
of Wittenberg.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.970
Anyway, Luther finally found his answer in
St. Paul’s epistles, specifically in one

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.549
line that said, “The just shall live by
faith” (Bainton 65). In other words, salvation

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.690
comes through faith, not good works—not
through prayer, or fasting, or vigils, or pilgrimages,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.030
or relics, giving to the poor, or the sacraments,
or any action that a person can take. We can’t

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.360
ever be good enough, through our actions,
to merit salvation. We can only have faith.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.900
In Latin, sola fide, only faith.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.709
So, Martin Luther’s new interpretation of
“sola fide” grew into a full-scale conflict

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.589
with the Catholic Church when a friar named
John Tetzel came to Wittenberg, selling indulgences.

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:30.520
An indulgence was a donation to the church
that came with a promise from the pope to

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.490
reduce a sinner’s time in purgatory. Like,
to quote from an indulgence that Friar Tetzel

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.020
sold, “[I] replace thee in the state of innocence and
purity in which thou wert at the hour of thy baptism."

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.820
Luther felt like that that wasn’t the sort of thing that, you know, should be for sale.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.300
The price of this whole-life complete-forgiveness-of-any-horrible-sin

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.540
certificate, by the way, was three marks,
probably about half a year’s wages for a

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.639
laborer.
So, Luther didn’t like seeing his parishioners

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.369
handing over money they didn’t have for
a scrap of paper that he believed to be meaningless,

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:06.559
so in response, he wrote 95 Theses against
indulgences, and then dramatically nailed

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:12.430
them to the Church door, for all to see on
October 31, 1517—or else he mailed them

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.180
to the archbishop, or possibly both. We don’t
actually know.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.059
This led to a series of debates with other
men of the cloth, during which Luther’s

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:23.939
positions became increasingly radical. Starting
from the statement that Christians were saved

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.909
only through faith and the grace of God, for instance,
Luther then upped the ante, saying that the Church’s

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:34.909
rituals didn't have the power to save souls.
And then he argued that far from being infallible,

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.649
the church, and the pope made errors all the
time.

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:41.839
That was a pretty bold thing to say, and then
it got even more dramatic when Luther ultimately

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:46.710
denied that the church and the officers of
it had any spiritual powers.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.619
He said that the priesthood was a human invention;
and that individual Christians didn’t even

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:54.990
need priests to receive the grace of God.
Instead, Luther described a “priesthood

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.889
of all believers.”
So this had gone from a call for reforming

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.679
indulgences to, to a revolution. So in
1521, Luther was called to defend his ideas

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:09.939
before the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V,
at the Imperial Diet of Worms. Or in German,

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.569
Worms.
Also, let me say retroactively, now that everyone

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.700
has commented on my poor German pronunciation,
Wittenberg.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.240
Emperor Charles famously said, “A single
friar who goes counter to all Christianity

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.080
for a thousand years must be wrong.”
To which Luther was like, “stop flapping

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.960
that hideous Hapsburg jaw of yours.”
But there was something to what Charles was

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.800
saying, right? Because plenty of radical friars
had criticized the church’s abuses and hypocrisies

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.449
over the years; why would Luther prove influential?
Well, one reason was the printing press.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.520
Now, most people in Europe at the time couldn’t
read, but a lot of people could, including,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.759
of course a lot of priests. And over two thousand
editions of Luther’s writings appeared between

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.579
1517 and 1526.
And his ideas also appeared in pamphlets,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.620
and posters, and cartoons that were seen and
read aloud, reaching millions of readers and

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.219
listeners,
In short, Luther’s ideas were all over,

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:05.610
like, the Tumblr of the day, which was a town
crier and broadsides nailed to doors.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.529
And it caused quite a stir, especially the part
about, like, the Pope being the Anti-Christ

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:12.009
sent by the devil. Like I said, it got pretty
radical.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.729
But maybe the most revolutionary of Luther’s
publications was his new translation of the

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.300
Bible into German.
For the first time ever, non-priests could

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.559
read the Bible for themselves, because Luther
used the German that people actually spoke,

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:28.779
instead of Latin, and his work quickly caught
on among common people.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.860
Hundreds of thousands of copies of Luther’s
Bible were printed; people carried it in their

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.539
pockets and memorized it. Now everyone could
quote scripture and discuss its meaning.

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:41.259
Now, Luther’s theory was that if everyone
just returned directly to the scriptures,

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:46.919
they would see the one single truth, and the
Church would be restored to its original simplicity.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.420
Yeah, no. I have a message to the restorers
of history. There is no original simplicity!

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:55.089
The thing is, once you start making scripture
accessible to everyone and tell them that

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:59.309
their opinions are just as good as those of
the clergy, what happens is that people start,

00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:02.749
you know, having different interpretations
of what religious truth is.

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:06.529
So Luther’s protest started creating spinoffs:
the Zwinglians, and the Calvinists, and the

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:09.679
Anabaptists…and then the spinoffs had their
own spinoffs.

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:13.589
It's like how first there was Iron Man, and
then there was the Avengers, and then you

00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:18.289
know, like an Avengers TV show. Pretty soon
we’re gonna have Ant Man get his own movie.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:21.439
The Protestant Reformation is just basically
the same thing as the Marvel Comic Universe,

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:24.770
but no Thor! Because he’s pagan.
Anyway, many of these new denominations will

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.749
be familiar to you: the Anglicans and Puritans,
the Quakers, the Presbyterians, the Methodists,

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:32.449
the Baptists.
Each of these new Protestant churches thought

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:37.389
that it knew the one true way to worship God—and
that, you know, everyone else was going to

00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:42.060
hell, and this led to some fighting.
And also some disemboweling. Oh, it’s time

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.190
for the open letter.
But first, let’s see what’s in the globe

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.110
today. Oh, that’s nice, I thought it would
be disemboweled people, but it’s Anabaptists

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.150
not baptizing their infants.
Hi there. So, you don’t believe in infant

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.060
baptism. You believe that like, people should
come of age; that they can make their own

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.709
decision about salvation.
Other people: Catholics, many protestants,

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:02.490
believe that it’s OK to baptize infants,
or even that it’s good.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.769
I don’t feel like this disagreement should
lead to disembowelment, and yet it did.

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:11.089
The fascinating thing to me, Anabaptists, is that
you never had a state, you never had, like,

00:09:11.089 --> 00:09:16.920
widespread political say in any community.
And yet, your brand of evangelical Christianity

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.470
managed to become incredibly important in
world history.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:26.329
In short, the bad news is that many of you
are going to be executed. The good news is

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:29.620
that your message will prove surprisingly
resilient

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.079
Stan, who did I even make that open letter
for? The Anabaptists are Amish now. They’re

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:36.039
not watching this. I guess some of them are
Mennonites. I made it for you Mennonites!

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.180
OK, So with all these new denominations, there
were years of religious mayhem.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.970
Clergy preached radical new ideas, and then
other people interpreted them in even more

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.310
radical ways. People, especially young people,
smashed up churches because the bible says

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.540
no graven images.
What started as a doctrinal dispute turned

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.360
into a social revolt, and in 1525, German
peasants took up Luther’s ideas to give

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.290
voice to longstanding grievances against landlords
and clergymen.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:05.279
In their most famous revolutionary proclamation,
the Twelve Articles, the peasants echoed Luther’s

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:09.730
language, proclaiming that serfdom was invented
by men, with no basis in scripture.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.529
The peasants rebelled, refused to pay taxes,
pillaged Church lands, and raised an army

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:21.120
estimated at 300,000 people.
And Luther was like YES FREE SOULS SOVEREIGN

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.649
AT LAST. No, just kidding, he wasn't.
Luther chose the elite, and said that “Christian

00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:31.220
liberty” was a spiritual concept, not meant
to promote equality or freedom in like, the

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.060
physical world. He then urged
the faithful to “smite, slay and

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.990
stab” rebels and kill them like mad dogs.
He also gave up his idea that congregations

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.310
should elect their own ministers and argued
that kings and princes were put in place by

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.639
God as caretakers of the church. And that
turned out to be the winning side.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:52.350
For a few hundred years, anyway. The German
Peasants’ Revolt, the biggest revolutionary

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.980
uprising in Europe before the French Revolution,
was suppressed with crushing brutality; an

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.209
estimated 100,000 people were killed.
So Luther chose the princes, in the name of

00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:07.389
stability and success, but why would princes
choose Lutheranism, when the Holy Roman Emperor

00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:10.329
had forbidden it?
Let’s look at one example: the first actual

00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:16.300
ruler who broke with the Pope: the heroic,
frequently divorced, founder of Anglicanism,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.540
King Henry VIII of England... What’s that
Stan? Apparently it was not King Henry VIII.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.699
It was Grand Master Albert of the Teutonic
Order of monks, crusaders who’d come to

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:30.660
rule parts of what is now Poland.
So many Teutonic knights individually left

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.040
the order for Lutheranism because they liked
the theology. Albert started by reading Lutheran

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.660
tracts and he became a fan, allowing Lutheran
preachers into his cities, and even traveliing

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.069
to meet with Luther in person.
On Luther’s advice, Grand Master Albert

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:48.129
dissolved the Teutonic State, and founded
instead the Dougy of Prussia. I guess that was

00:11:48.129 --> 00:11:52.009
a country where they all danced the Dougie?
Oh, it’s the Douchey of Prussia.

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:56.029
Stan informs me that it is neither the Dougy
nor the Douchey of Prussia, but the Duchy

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:01.620
of Prussia. Anyway, Albert established a Lutheran
Church there—the first Lutheran state Church.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.019
But it’s unlikely that Albert was really
motivated by a desire to purge the church

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:10.040
of corruption. I mean, at the time of his
decision, the Grand Master had been in trouble;

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.089
he was losing a territorial battles against
the rest of Poland and he was running out

00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:16.360
of money.
By breaking with the Church, Albert was able

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.999
to seize the Church assets within his territory
which bolstered his military might and then

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:25.170
allowed him to settle the war favorably.
In another major plus, now that he was a

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.499
Duke instead of a Grand Master monk, he could
get married and produce heirs…

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:34.449
Which he did, founding the House of Hohenzollern,
destined to unify and rule the German Empire

00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:37.920
a few centuries later.
And this points to a huge incentive for princes

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.060
and kings to break with the Pope.
What if instead of the Church having all of that

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.820
money and power, I could have it?
Those are like the two favorite things of

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.519
monarchs, and protestantism allowed them to
confiscate Church land and other wealth, collect

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:56.290
Church taxes, and use Church land for themselves.
Why is the Queen the largest landowner in

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:01.199
England? Because the Protestant reformation.
That said, we shouldn’t minimize the extent

00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:06.399
to which the reformation really was about
belief. I mean, Catholics truly believed that

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:11.310
Protestants were heretics, and Protestants
truly believed that the Pope and his hierarchy

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.579
were impostors.
If it were only about land and influence,

00:13:14.579 --> 00:13:18.420
how could we explain the case of Saxon elector
John Frederick, for instance?

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.680
When defeated and imprisoned by his Catholic
emperor, Frederick was given the choice between

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.009
his lands and his faith. He chose his faith.
And then there were the Catholics like Sir

00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:32.259
Thomas More, who would not sanction Henry
VIII’s break with the Pope, and chose execution

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:35.660
over sacrilege.
So in the end the Reformation was both a religious

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.100
movement AND a political one.
Now, many argue that the Reformation eventually

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.019
led to more religious toleration in Europe,
because people just had to learn to live with

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:45.970
each other, once they had a bunch of wars
and figured out that there were going to be

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.350
both Catholics and Protestants moving forward.
There were other effects of the Protestant

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.610
revolution. Max Weber famously called it the
foundation of European capitalism.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:58.140
But for me the most crucial aspect of the
Protestant Reformation is contained inside

00:13:58.149 --> 00:14:03.059
the words: Protest and Reform.
These have become two of the central political

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:08.189
ideas in recent centuries, and while religion
has justifiably been blamed for much violence

00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:12.740
and intolerance, we should also remember that
many of the leaders of the American civil

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.400
rights movement, for instance, were Protestant
clergy. And they saw a history of protest that could

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:23.080
fuel real and lasting reform, that included
people like Gandhi and Thoreau, but also people

00:14:23.089 --> 00:14:26.729
like Martin Luther. Thanks for watching, I’ll
see you next week.
