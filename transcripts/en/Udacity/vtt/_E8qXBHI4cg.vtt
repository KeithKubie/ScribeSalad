00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.260
Okay. So now, we've discussed basic browsers, HTML, HTTP, which is

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.640
how the browsers talk to the servers. And now, we're finally

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.790
going to get to servers, which is what most of this course

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.170
is going to be about. How to run programs on servers. The

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.149
purpose of a server is to respond to HTTP requests. We've

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.230
drawn this picture a couple of times now. This is you.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.890
This is your computer running your browser. And these are our

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.520
servers. These little pink boxes. Your browser is speaking HTTP to these

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.690
servers to request documents. There are two

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.230
main classifications for the type of responses the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.460
server will do. They are called static

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.048
and dynamic. Content is considered static if it's

00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:41.734
a pre-written file that the server just

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:45.690
returns. An example would be an image. Most

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.160
images are static requests. All the server does

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.560
is says, it looks up the image off

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.700
of its hard disk or off of its cache, and just

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.030
sends it over the wire using HTTP. More interesting requests are dynamic

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.620
requests. These are requests where the response is built on the

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.410
fly by a program that's running. Just about all of the content

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.220
online these days is dynamic. That didn't always use to be

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.420
the case. When the web was first invented in the early 90s,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.060
almost all of the content online was static. They were just

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.970
files. People would edit the files, put them on their servers, and

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.670
they all linked to one another, but that was

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.366
that. These days, almost every website including Udacity, Reddit

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:26.000
and Hipmunk, the two websites that I worked on.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.090
Wikipedia, Facebook. All of those pages, almost 100% of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.790
them are built dynamically on the fly by programs

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.740
called web applications. And a web application is just

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.780
a program that generates content. And that is what

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.340
we're going to learn how to build in this course.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.270
So we've spent all of this time getting to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.550
this description of what a web application does. Which

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.930
is, it lives on a web server, it speaks

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.420
HTTP, and it generates content that your browser requests.
