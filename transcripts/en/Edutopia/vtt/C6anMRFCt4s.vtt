00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:08.996
&gt;&gt;Minli Virdone: It feels great
to get students engaged.

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:11.546
Innately, I believe that
they're already engaged.

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:13.516
And what we're trying
to do is just inspire

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:15.576
and really make the
topics really interesting

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:16.976
so students get excited
about learning more.

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:27.486
&gt;&gt;Karl Wendt: We've got robotics.

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:30.476
And there's going to be
trading games and stock market--

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:31.286
it's going to be amazing.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.786
Today it starts off fun
and it gets even better.

00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:36.966
&gt;&gt;Minli: Welcome, welcome,
to the Discovery Lab.

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.356
&gt;&gt;Karl: You guys excited to be here?

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:38.746
&gt;&gt;Students: Yeah!

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:39.856
&gt;&gt;Karl: All right!

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:40.416
&gt;&gt;Minli: Well done, well done.

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:42.916
So we're really excited
to have you here.

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:45.016
&gt;&gt;Minli: At Khan Academy,
we felt that we needed

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:48.236
to have our own version of the summer
camp, because we had so many ideas

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:49.836
that we wanted to test out.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.936
What we're really driving
towards is individualized

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:54.226
and mastery-based learning.

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:58.106
One would think that a Khan Academy
Summer Camp could be be just kids

00:00:58.106 --> 00:00:59.796
sitting in front of their
computers watching videos.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.206
There are videos, and videos are
extremely important to help students

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:04.116
with self-paced learning.

00:01:04.176 --> 00:01:08.496
But that goes hand-in-hand with
hands-on projects and activities

00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:13.016
that really drive the intuition,
and really get people excited.

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:18.516
The Discovery Lab will include
robotics, computer science,

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:22.716
mathematical geometry,
probability and economics.

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.076
And even more things
that we'll add in.

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:26.626
&gt;&gt;Student: I'll give you a dice.

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:28.786
&gt;&gt;Sal Khan: Based on this, do you
think countries should trade

00:01:28.786 --> 00:01:29.436
with each other?

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:31.026
&gt;&gt;Students: Yes.

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:33.246
&gt;&gt;Sal: So why should they
trade with each other?

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:36.226
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, maybe we
could trade to prevent wars.

00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:38.106
&gt;&gt;Sal: Well, you brought out
an interesting point that a lot

00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:39.896
of people do bring up
between trading countries,

00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:41.696
that it often makes the
countries more stable.

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:45.526
If we're reliant on your country for
our food, and you're reliant on us

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:48.636
for your oil, we're not likely
to go to war with each other,

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:49.806
because we need each other.

00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:52.726
You know, it's fascinating,
people do PhDs on this.

00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:54.836
&gt;&gt;Sal: You can't learn
these things with lectures.

00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:57.396
You have to learn -- pretty much
almost everything you have to learn

00:01:57.396 --> 00:01:59.926
by doing it, by struggling
with it, I mean,

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:01.026
because that's what
the real world is.

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:03.706
The real world, you just engage,
you jump into an experience.

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:06.496
And your brain starts to draw
connections, your brain starts

00:02:06.496 --> 00:02:09.376
to struggle with it and says,
"Well, hey, how does this work?

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:10.536
Can I see any patterns here?

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:12.196
Can I make any reason out of it?"

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:14.786
&gt;&gt;Minli: And the other thing
that's really important that's not

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:16.186
content-based, is resilience.

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:18.496
These topics are complex topics.

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:22.096
And students are going to have to
work really hard to be successful,

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:24.086
and they just have
to try and try again.

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:27.986
The summer camp is one of those
places where we can allow them to try

00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:31.496
and try again, because we're
not set by a particular date

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:33.076
where you have to have
an examination.

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:36.166
We'll say, "We'll give
you tools to guide you,

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:39.616
but you have to learn
how to figure this out."

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.986
&gt;&gt;Karl: Right now we're going to
assemble a three-dimensional version

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:46.096
of Sierpinski's triangle,
which is a fractal.

00:02:46.096 --> 00:02:49.816
&gt;&gt;Karl: It's a chance to take a
two-dimensional construct and go

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:51.896
into three dimensions and give
the students a chance to sort

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:54.616
of experience it in a way
that they probably wouldn't

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.526
if they were just learning
about it in a textbook.

00:02:56.526 --> 00:02:58.996
&gt;&gt;Mohan: In school, I've
heard about this stuff,

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.506
I've read about it,
but I never did it.

00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:05.376
But today, I've been doing it, and
now I can honestly see what it is.

00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:07.736
&gt;&gt;Julia: It's more interactive,
and you're doing more stuff.

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:10.276
You're not sitting down
with a piece of paper

00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:11.866
and a textbook doing math problems.

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:13.456
It's more fun here.

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:15.846
&gt;&gt;Karl: As we get further along,
they'll get a chance to see math

00:03:15.846 --> 00:03:18.206
in a different way, because it's
more applied and more hands-on.

00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:20.216
&gt;&gt; I call them quadripoints.

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:22.216
&gt;&gt; I'm going to look cool...

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:27.456
&gt;&gt;Minli: There's something to be said
about just doing it with your hands,

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:29.106
and taking out the conceptual world,

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:33.486
even though it doesn't necessarily
translate into an immediate increase

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:35.186
in test scores or anything like that.

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:37.856
It does translate into some level 
of excitement in the student.

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:40.896
And that is something that
you don't measure very often,

00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:44.756
but it's still really important.

00:03:44.756 --> 00:03:44.866
&gt;&gt;Students: Good!

00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:44.976
Woo!

00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:53.316
&gt;&gt;Minli: Discovery Lab, it's a
laboratory not only for the kids,

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.046
but it's also for us at Khan
Academy, because what's important

00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:58.146
for us is not to just
run a summer camp.

00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:00.986
What's important is to
understand what it is that works,

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:04.346
and if we find activities that work
really well, we can try it again

00:04:04.346 --> 00:04:06.666
in a different summer camp
or in a different setting.

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:09.826
We believe that we can
package this together simply,

00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:14.686
so that there's a curated set of
projects that are high quality,

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:17.726
highly interactive for teachers

00:04:17.726 --> 00:04:20.586
to immediately be able
to use in the classroom.

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:21.926
&gt;&gt;Sal: This is all
a work in progress.

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:25.006
Khan Academy is a work in progress,
the summer camp's a work in progress

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:27.146
over the course of this year,
but definitely by next summer.

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:29.046
We're going to have summer
camps that go much deeper.

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:32.486
Summer camp in writing, summer camp
in filmmaking, summer camp in music.

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:36.146
We really want to explore the
experiential side of things --

00:04:36.146 --> 00:04:38.586
not just in traditional STEM
subjects -- really across the board.

00:04:39.256 --> 00:04:39.896
&gt;&gt;Minli: Great!

00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:41.146
Thank you everybody!

00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:41.586
Onward!
