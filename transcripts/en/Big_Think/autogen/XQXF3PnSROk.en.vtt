00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.180
right now all of our eggs are in one

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190
right now all of our eggs are in one
 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.950
right now all of our eggs are in one
basket and the baskets called earth we

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960
basket and the baskets called earth we
 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.839
basket and the baskets called earth we
can't stay in this solar system forever

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849
can't stay in this solar system forever
 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.230
can't stay in this solar system forever
it's just a fact so if we if we do stay

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
it's just a fact so if we if we do stay
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.749
it's just a fact so if we if we do stay
here we would essentially you know the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759
here we would essentially you know the
 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.950
here we would essentially you know the
Sun would essentially engulf the inner

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960
Sun would essentially engulf the inner
 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.269
Sun would essentially engulf the inner
planets and even if we've achieved

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
planets and even if we've achieved
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.769
planets and even if we've achieved
perfect world peace and there's no

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
perfect world peace and there's no
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.510
perfect world peace and there's no
hunger there's no poverty there's no

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
hunger there's no poverty there's no
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.150
hunger there's no poverty there's no
disease it'll all be gone if we're still

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160
disease it'll all be gone if we're still
 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.519
disease it'll all be gone if we're still
here so some of the first missions to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
here so some of the first missions to
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.230
here so some of the first missions to
Mars obviously we have multiple

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
Mars obviously we have multiple
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.849
Mars obviously we have multiple
satellites already in orbit and so some

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
satellites already in orbit and so some
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.650
satellites already in orbit and so some
of the first missions are really planned

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
of the first missions are really planned
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.479
of the first missions are really planned
for within the next 15 years

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
for within the next 15 years
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.790
for within the next 15 years
but there are active and long-term plans

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
but there are active and long-term plans
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.250
but there are active and long-term plans
in NASA to have people you know colonies

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
in NASA to have people you know colonies
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.389
in NASA to have people you know colonies
there living there whether it's either

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
there living there whether it's either
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.220
there living there whether it's either
asteroids moons or potentially Mars

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
asteroids moons or potentially Mars
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.510
asteroids moons or potentially Mars
you know the timeline goes up to two or

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
you know the timeline goes up to two or
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.650
you know the timeline goes up to two or
three hundred years out is when we've

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
three hundred years out is when we've
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.180
three hundred years out is when we've
started to begin some of that work of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
started to begin some of that work of
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.100
started to begin some of that work of
actually not just sending exploratory

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
actually not just sending exploratory
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.360
actually not just sending exploratory
missions but people are Chua living

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
missions but people are Chua living
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.310
missions but people are Chua living
there and I think this is not only sort

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
there and I think this is not only sort
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930
there and I think this is not only sort
of what is the natural next step of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
of what is the natural next step of
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.420
of what is the natural next step of
really human evolution and exploration

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
really human evolution and exploration
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.250
really human evolution and exploration
but I would even argue is our duty as a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
but I would even argue is our duty as a
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.930
but I would even argue is our duty as a
species because we're the only species

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
species because we're the only species
 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729
species because we're the only species
that has an awareness of extinction that

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
that has an awareness of extinction that
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.930
that has an awareness of extinction that
so I think it gives us the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
so I think it gives us the
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.760
so I think it gives us the
responsibility to preserve not only our

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
responsibility to preserve not only our
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.650
responsibility to preserve not only our
species but actually all species but if

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
species but actually all species but if
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.880
species but actually all species but if
you keep going further out eventually go

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
you keep going further out eventually go
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.050
you keep going further out eventually go
to Mars you go to other solar systems

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
to Mars you go to other solar systems
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.170
to Mars you go to other solar systems
it's really uh the question just begs

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
it's really uh the question just begs
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.820
it's really uh the question just begs
the question back on itself is like well

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
the question back on itself is like well
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.590
the question back on itself is like well
you can't keep going and going going at

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
you can't keep going and going going at
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.260
you can't keep going and going going at
the end of the time eventually the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
the end of the time eventually the
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.240
the end of the time eventually the
universe Alleva keep expanding and so it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
universe Alleva keep expanding and so it
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920
universe Alleva keep expanding and so it
will be too far apart or it may collapse

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
will be too far apart or it may collapse
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.440
will be too far apart or it may collapse
back in on itself and so I think there

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
back in on itself and so I think there
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.359
back in on itself and so I think there
are the last question of my long term

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
are the last question of my long term
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.010
are the last question of my long term
plan for the laboratory is which of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
plan for the laboratory is which of
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.980
plan for the laboratory is which of
course will all be long dead for but is

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
course will all be long dead for but is
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.929
course will all be long dead for but is
is do we prevent the universe from

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
is do we prevent the universe from
 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.120
is do we prevent the universe from
collapsing back on itself in the hopes

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
collapsing back on itself in the hopes
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980
collapsing back on itself in the hopes
that life will arise anew or do we

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
that life will arise anew or do we
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.539
that life will arise anew or do we
actually use our ingenuity and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
actually use our ingenuity and
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.730
actually use our ingenuity and
technological acumen to prevent the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
technological acumen to prevent the
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.260
technological acumen to prevent the
universe from collapsing and at that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
universe from collapsing and at that
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.580
universe from collapsing and at that
point maybe we'll be controlling gravity

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
point maybe we'll be controlling gravity
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410
point maybe we'll be controlling gravity
I think we would have to probably

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
I think we would have to probably
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.030
I think we would have to probably
prevent it and maybe carve out a small

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
prevent it and maybe carve out a small
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.679
prevent it and maybe carve out a small
area of the universe that wouldn't

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689
area of the universe that wouldn't
 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.450
area of the universe that wouldn't
collapse or would somehow survive which

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
collapse or would somehow survive which
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.980
collapse or would somehow survive which
we have no idea how that's going to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
we have no idea how that's going to
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.660
we have no idea how that's going to
happen but I think the ethical question

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
happen but I think the ethical question
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.240
happen but I think the ethical question
we can think about today is how much

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
we can think about today is how much
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.130
we can think about today is how much
into what degree do we literally alter

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
into what degree do we literally alter
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.139
into what degree do we literally alter
the universe to preserve ourselves and I

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
the universe to preserve ourselves and I
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.690
the universe to preserve ourselves and I
think life and gravity are the only two

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700
think life and gravity are the only two
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.819
think life and gravity are the only two
things that prevent expansion of matter

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
things that prevent expansion of matter
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.709
things that prevent expansion of matter
in the universe and so I think and sort

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
in the universe and so I think and sort
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.330
in the universe and so I think and sort
of decrease entropy and so I think we

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
of decrease entropy and so I think we
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.910
of decrease entropy and so I think we
have a responsibility to try and maybe

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920
have a responsibility to try and maybe
 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.800
have a responsibility to try and maybe
keep ourselves alive so I think not only

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
keep ourselves alive so I think not only
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.360
keep ourselves alive so I think not only
maybe should we keep ourselves alive

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
maybe should we keep ourselves alive
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.290
maybe should we keep ourselves alive
even at the end of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
even at the end of
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.230
even at the end of
universe but that we may we may have you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240
universe but that we may we may have you
 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.370
universe but that we may we may have you
know no choice because I think that's

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
know no choice because I think that's
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.370
know no choice because I think that's
what we usually do as a species
