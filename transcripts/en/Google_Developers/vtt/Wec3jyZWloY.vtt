[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:10.980
JENNIFER PERSON: Hi, everyone.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.970
Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.850
My name is Jen Person.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.430
I'm a developer advocate at
Google for the Firebase team,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.810
and I am so thrilled for
you to be part of this,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.182
my first talk as a Googler.

00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:25.006
Um, yeah.

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:25.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.715
Thank you.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:27.490
Thank you so much.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.590
Yeah, I really can't think
of a better place to do it.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.320
I hope you've had as
much fun as I have.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.694
I've seen some really great
talks and some really awesome

00:00:37.694 --> 00:00:40.461
trainings and met
some of you, and I

00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:41.710
hope to meet some more of you.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.330
So thanks so much
for being here.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.110
So what I want to talk
to you about today

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.100
is incorporating Firebase
into your existing app.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.720
So what I found is talking
to other developers

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.990
at conferences, you may like
the idea of incorporating

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.920
the Firebase database or
storage or authentication,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.142
but a lot of developers already
have an existing app that

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:07.600
has all those things
in it, so they

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.474
think Firebase isn't for them.

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.890
But I'm here to tell you that
there are some features that

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.010
are still very useful for
incorporating your app,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.560
especially to grow
your user base.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.340
So I'm going to talk
about two main topics.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.860
One is app quality, and
another is app growth.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.290
I find that when deciding
what to talk about,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.390
these things really went
hand-in-hand for me,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.380
because a lot of what
makes an app grow

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.840
has to include a quality app.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.220
People aren't
going to be sharing

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.260
their app with their
friends and telling them

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.700
about it if it's crashing.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.850
So I'll briefly spend
a little time talking

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.210
about the Firebase features
that can help with your app's

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.682
performance and
your app quality,

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:57.015
and then I'll talk about some
of our app growth options.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.730
So according to a study of
one and two star reviews,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.140
nearly half of
the complaints are

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.120
related to problems
developers can address.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.240
So crashes and
performance-- exactly what

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.650
I was talking about.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.190
And since we all tend to want
to be informed consumers,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.450
we tend to look at
our reviews first.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.300
I don't know about
you, but I have not

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.250
bought anything for
the past, let's say,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.370
five years without looking
at the reviews first.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.520
So definitely poor reviews
can curb your app's growth.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.150
So with that in mind, let's
take a look at the app

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.040
I'm going to use as a sample
to incorporate Firebase.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.770
And it's called
Friendly Translate,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.110
and if you've done any
of our code labs before,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.500
you know that we love
things that are friendly.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.790
It uses the Google
Cloud Translation

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.620
API to translate from a
couple of different languages,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.530
and it doesn't use
Firebase, at least not yet.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.725
So I'll show you
Friendly Translate.

00:02:58.725 --> 00:03:02.560
And here it is, so simple
interface, looks a little bit

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.440
like another translate
app that you may know,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.500
has some languages to
choose from, and it--

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.380
I am glad you are here.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.880
Now you're going
to see how bad I am

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.840
at texting on a small screen.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.610
But yeah, that's all
there is to my app.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.020
So even though I have this
totally awesome Translate app,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.900
it is certainly possible it can
have some not so great reviews.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.200
So what do I do if
I'm getting reviews

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.154
like these in the App Store
or the Google Play Store?

00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:43.570
These really aren't
unlike reviews

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.790
you may have seen for
other apps before.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.577
I even did like a very quick
search of the App Store

00:03:48.577 --> 00:03:50.410
and found one that
sounds like it could even

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.701
pertain to something like this.

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.404
Like reading other reviews, I
realize that it's not just me.

00:03:55.404 --> 00:03:57.070
It's been at least a
month or so since I

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.350
tried using the app on
my iPad, but I couldn't,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.000
because it crashed instantly.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.450
It's worked for me in the past.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.180
That was awhile ago.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.860
Again, definitely
not something you

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.340
would want potential
users to be reading.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.790
So sometimes reviews will tell
you exactly what's going on,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.700
but you may not know why
users dislike your app.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.940
So Firebase has a bunch
of features to help.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.250
I'm going to take a look at
each one of those reviews

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.010
I just showed you,
and then show you

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.370
how a Firebase feature could
help you address that issue

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.420
and, thus, help you
grow your user base.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.680
Let's look at this one.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.210
"Always crashing."

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.620
We see these ones
a lot, and they

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.090
can have a huge effect on
how your app is received.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.190
And so even though I
know what the problem is,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.942
this really doesn't
help narrow it down.

00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:45.400
If I have some sort
of crash that I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.480
didn't catch in my
initial testing,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.550
it can be tough to do so if
I haven't already found it.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.360
So Firebase provides a
couple different resources

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.370
for reporting and
prioritizing crashes

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.090
that are happening in your app.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.980
So Firebase Crash Reporting
has been around for awhile,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.192
and Firebase developers like it.

00:05:08.192 --> 00:05:10.150
And I imagine you've
heard that Google recently

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.060
acquired Fabric, which
provides Crashlytics,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.150
which is another option
for crash reporting.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.270
In fact, if you go to the
Firebase console right now,

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.370
and you haven't registered
any crashes yet,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.110
this is the screen
that you'll see.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.480
And it's pretty
clear from what's

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.960
written that Firebase is
advocating to use Crashlytics

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.760
if you haven't used one already.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.470
It's even like a
slightly different color.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.350
But there are still
reasons you may

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.014
want to use one or the other.

00:05:42.014 --> 00:05:43.430
No matter which
option you choose,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.370
just know that Firebase will
help developers migrate easily

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.590
to a final solution
that combines

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.656
the best of both of these.

00:05:50.656 --> 00:05:52.280
If you're developing
in an Android app,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.140
in fact, you could
just incorporate both.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.870
In iOS, you do have to choose.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.900
So while there are good
reasons for both of them,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.150
I wanted to try out
Crashlytics, so that's

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.100
what I'm going to show you
today for my crash reporter.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.040
Crashlytics is the world's
fastest crash reporter.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.200
I'll even show you
what that looks like.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.810
It combines similar
issues and shows priority

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.690
to help you find and
resolve problems quickly.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.020
And you can minimize the impact
of your crashes for your users

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.230
by focusing on the ones that
are impacting the most of them.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.910
And it's available
on iOS and Android.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.430
Now Firebase-- oh, pardon.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.250
Crashlytics will give me
deep insights into what's

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.930
crashing in my
app, and it'll even

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.360
send me email notifications,
which I can set up what kind

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.550
of notifications I want to get.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.935
Here we can see already
there's been some sort of crash

00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:47.980
in Friendly Translate.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.160
So let's take a look at
just how fast Crashlytics

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.720
reports on crashes.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.510
I happen to know that
there is a crash in my app,

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.356
and I'm going to make it
crash for you right now,

00:06:58.356 --> 00:07:00.480
and we'll take a look at
Crashlytics shortly after.

00:07:07.256 --> 00:07:08.720
OK.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.240
So here, I have my app.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.460
Change my language.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.330
Oh, here we go.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.470
Yes.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.890
Friendly Translate crashed.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.320
So after a moment, we'll be
able to see that in the console,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.990
and we have our crash reported.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.670
So there we go.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.990
So it really is that fast.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.490
You can really find
out what's going

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.000
on in your app in real time,
and because it aggregates

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.200
those different crashes, you
can see what those trends are.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.870
Now what about a
review like this one?

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.300
"The app worked quickly
for me on my new device

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.250
in my fast office Wi-Fi."

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.410
This is something that
you may have heard before,

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.110
but depending on where
your users are located

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.850
or what kind of
devices they're using,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.950
they may not have
that same experience.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.510
And certainly, you
can try to test

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.190
in several different scenarios,
but you will not necessarily

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:09.070
catch very specific
issues that way.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.040
So I can monitor and address
such performance issues

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.590
using Firebase for
Performance Monitoring,

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.960
and it gives you
actionable insights

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.060
into your app's performance
from your user's point of view.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.510
And it was released in
beta at I/O this year.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.640
Performance
Monitoring can tell us

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.430
how the app performs from
your user's perspective,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.920
and it runs in the production
version of your app

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.610
with minimal overhead.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.520
So you can rest
assured that it's not

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.830
bogging down your app
in the process of trying

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.710
to improve it.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.860
So Performance Monitoring offers
a couple of features right out

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.240
of the box--

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.440
automatic tracing-- and you can
create custom traces and also

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.420
automatic HTTP and
HTTP/S metrics.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.500
So a trace is a report
for a period of time

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.780
that is going to have a
defined beginning and end.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.290
And there are some that are done
automatically like a cold app

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.290
start, how long your app
is in the foreground,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.013
and how long it's
in the background.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.070
HTTP and HTTP/S
traffic metrics include

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.110
response time,
which is going to be

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.740
from the moment of invocation to
the final byte that's received,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.440
payload size in bytes,
and success rate.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.940
So it's going to take a
look at your status codes

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.330
like 200 types being
successful and 500 type errors.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.670
And it's going to
help you narrow down

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.950
if there's a specific
server or network

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.530
issue that's causing that.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.630
It also includes URL
pattern globbing,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.040
so again, you're sort of
aggregating the different URLs

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.710
so that all of these will be
considered the same structure.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.350
So that gives you
an aggregated view

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.392
of how your APIs are performing.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.500
And the transaction
metrics it includes

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.992
are app version, device,
country, OS level, carrier,

00:10:06.992 --> 00:10:08.450
and radio, which
I'll show you what

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.280
that looks like in the console.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.110
Now this is a sample of an app
that is live and uses Firebase

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.160
Performance Monitoring.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.850
And what I want to briefly
show you, besides the traces,

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.000
including the defaults
and the custom traces,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.165
is that deep insight you can
get into network requests.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.846
So here, if I want
to find out more

00:10:33.846 --> 00:10:35.720
about what kind of
response time I'm getting,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.250
I can have it,
again, broken down

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.070
by how long each
carrier has taken

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.800
and the app version
and what device it's on

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.010
to really narrow down if I'm
having some trend in an issue.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.810
Sometimes it can be
just a single carrier

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.289
that's causing it,
and this really

00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:52.330
helps you narrow it down.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:00.510
So sometimes user feedback
is not particularly helpful.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.810
Very few of your users are going
to be leaving that feedback,

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.240
so there's the possibility
that they're not even reporting

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.531
the issues that they're having.

00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:11.030
They're just
uninstalling your app.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.080
So how can we find out more
about what the users like

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.580
and don't like about our app?

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.170
That's where Google Analytics
for Firebase comes in.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.160
And what I love about Google
Analytics for Firebase

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.020
is that it's free and unlimited.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.670
So you have this out-of-the-box
solution when you incorporate

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.610
Firebase into your app that
gives you reporting on up

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.210
to 500 distinct events, and
you can have custom events with

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.000
custom parameters, and you
can view all of that data,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.660
including how it connects up
to other Firebase features.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.480
For instance, if you
use crash reporting,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.360
you can incorporate that
into your analytics,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.850
take a look at your
dynamic links performance,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.370
notifications,
in-app purchase data,

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.850
and see how your
campaigns are performing.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.430
Next feature I want to talk
about is Remote Config.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.680
This is another feature that
works well with Analytics

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.500
to really help you narrow
down what people may really

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.510
enjoy about your app, what they
may like and not like about it,

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.365
and helps you give a custom
experience to your users.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.310
So Remote Config lets you change
the behavior and appearance

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.680
of your app without
pushing an update,

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.990
so you don't have to depend
on your users to do so,

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.700
because if they're
anything like me,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.400
there's at least 12 updates
that need to be done,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.080
and especially if
you have something

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.030
important like a
crash that you want

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.310
to resolve by
removing some feature,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.040
you don't want to have to
wait for them to update it.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.900
You can use the Firebase console
to override default values,

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:41.130
so you can have default values
for different scenarios,

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.020
including user properties
that you can set up,

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.590
app versions, operating
systems, audiences that you

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.510
define in Firebase Analytics.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.510
It's really up to you to how you
want to segment and customize

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.940
how you send out that
different configuration.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.330
So, for instance, you could
change your app's color theme

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.560
to match a seasonal
promotion or change

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.685
the start date of the sale.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.810
Or I can use Remote Config
to change what the default

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.310
language is going to be.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.686
On the one hand, it's possible
that in a certain country,

00:13:11.686 --> 00:13:13.685
they may want to start
with whatever language is

00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:16.060
native to that area, or
maybe a lot of people using

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.010
the app in the
area are visiting,

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.080
and they want to translate
something into that language.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.380
So depending on
where somebody lives,

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.720
you may want to have a
different default language.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.320
So here, I can use Remote Config
to change what the default

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.100
language is and use the region
where the device is located

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.500
to decide which
language is shown

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.159
as being the original one.

00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:41.950
Come up and check it
out later, because I'm

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.730
pretty excited about that
one, and I'll show it to you.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.030
So according to a study
by Localytics in 2016,

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.970
an average of 23% of
users abandon an app

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.080
after just one use.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.000
So those few first moments that
a user interacts with an app

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.130
are critical, and you
don't want to become

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.870
part of those statistics.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.720
So Firebase provides
some great tools

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.340
to make the user's
first experience as

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.332
easy and enjoyable as possible.

00:14:08.332 --> 00:14:10.540
And the ones I want to talk
to you about a little bit

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.760
are App Invites
and Dynamic Links.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:22.280
Also, to go with App Invites and
Dynamic Links, 82% of Americans

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.340
ask for recommendations
from friends and family,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.360
and that's even higher, 92%,
for 18 to 34-year-olds, which

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.220
is why these features
are so powerful.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:39.420
So App Invites allow you to
share referral codes or content

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.680
via SMS or email, and it really
is an out-of-the-box solution

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.150
that enables you to send
invites from your actual users

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.090
to their friends and who can
give better recommendations

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.450
than people who
already enjoy your app.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.320
And then with just
a few lines of code,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.650
you can have that set up
to send out those invites.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.840
And this can include
Dynamic Links,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.150
so rather than just
going to, let's say,

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.450
the default page in your app, if
there's some specific contents

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.670
that that user would
be most interested in,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.930
you can have a link that sends
them there and even survives

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:14.995
the install process.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.210
So let's say you've fixed
your performance issues,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.000
you've resolved your
crashes, and you've

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.530
made it a much
better experience.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.260
How do you reengage
those users that haven't

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.230
touched your apps in a while?

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.840
Firebase Cloud Messaging
makes it super easy.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.600
So Google Cloud Messaging sends
out so many messages every day,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.030
and they are nearly
instant and very reliable.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.640
Firebase Cloud Messaging
makes it really easy

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.930
to send out messages that are
directed to specific groups

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.110
rather than just spamming
messages to all of your users.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.620
Let's say that this particular
user-- in this case, me--

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.660
is not very interested
in using the app anymore,

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.970
because every time I try to
pick my favorite language,

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.050
it crashes.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.240
But now that crash
has been resolved.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.960
I can send a message
to a specific group.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.840
It can be based on
properties or events,

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:22.402
and I can just say, come
back to Friendly Translate.

00:16:22.402 --> 00:16:23.110
And there we are.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.700
Come back to Friendly Translate.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.332
It invites me to come back.

00:16:26.332 --> 00:16:28.540
And it doesn't have to be
a simple message like that.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.660
It can include custom links
to get you right to the place

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.520
where you want them
to be in your app.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.455
Just a simple example.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.250
So again, you can use Firebase
Cloud Messaging to invite

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.190
users to drive user
engagement, invite them back

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.270
to use your app.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.440
You can send messages all the
way down to a single device,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.770
groups of devices.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.650
You can have topics that
they are subscribed to.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.070
There are endless possibilities
to reengage your users

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.020
and, again, without
spamming them

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.740
by making it simple for you
to choose specifically who

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.260
that notification pertains to.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.369
There we go.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:06.990
And there is one
last demo that I

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:11.010
wanted to show you that
incorporates Analytics using

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.319
Cloud Functions for
Firebase, because I

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.554
am a huge fan of Cloud
Functions for Firebase.

00:17:15.554 --> 00:17:16.970
If any of you have
seen my videos,

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.510
you know I love to
talk about them,

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.550
and I couldn't help
but include an example.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.079
So I just want to
briefly show you

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:29.460
some code with how you
can incorporate Analytics

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.540
events to respond to things
users do to reengage them

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.990
with your app.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.810
So what I've done here
is create an event

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:44.690
that is triggered when
the app is removed.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.770
And again, this occurs
in the server side

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.140
and not in your user's app.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.480
And so in order to have
this event trigger,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.180
just make sure that if
you're using Analytics Events

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.060
Triggers for Cloud
Functions for Firebase,

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.660
it has to be a conversion event.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.580
So you may have to
go into the console

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.160
and make sure it's triggered
as a conversion event.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.610
So if an Android
user removes the app,

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.180
you can log that event, or
it is logged automatically.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:16.570
And you can send them an email,
and you can invite them back

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.440
to use your app.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.880
Now, in this case, I
wrote out verbatim.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.900
I wrote out specifically
for each language.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.350
You could even incorporate
the translate API

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.410
here as well if you
wanted to make sure

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.800
that you are translating
custom to whatever location

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.290
the user is at, what
language they would be using.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.350
But in this case, I figured
it may make sense to hard code

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.320
something, because if some
sort of faulty translation

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.330
is the reason that they
stop using your app,

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.455
you wouldn't want to
incorporate that here as well.

00:18:45.455 --> 00:18:47.140
You'd want to make
sure that everything

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.660
was translated in a way
that looked right to them.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.660
In this case, I don't
speak all these languages,

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.510
so they might actually not
be the best translations.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.540
So again, using the--

00:19:01.662 --> 00:19:06.340
I'm sending them an
email, logging the event.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.730
That way, anytime a user
decides to leave my app,

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.500
I can invite them
back, and I can even

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.080
give them some sort of discount
or motivation to come back.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.180
So after making some
great changes to my app,

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.410
it seems like people
like it a lot more now.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.560
Five stars-- would
translate again.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.000
And it translates so fast.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.310
And so easy to use and fun.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.650
So these are all features
that you can incorporate

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.380
into your app, even if it's
already up and running,

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.870
and that's actually the
best time to use them,

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.690
to really get your
idea out there.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.610
I mean, you've
already spent the time

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.234
to build something and
come up with a great idea.

00:19:41.234 --> 00:19:43.650
Why not really make sure that
the users who would enjoy it

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:47.550
are actually getting to see it?

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.850
So here's a summary of the
features that I added--

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.730
Crashlytics, Performance
Monitoring, Remote Config,

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.046
Firebase Cloud Messaging, App
Invites and Dynamic Links,

00:19:57.046 --> 00:19:59.670
and because I can't help myself
but talk about Cloud Functions,

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.070
I also included a
brief example of using

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:05.100
Cloud Functions for
Firebase with Node Mailer

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.700
to mail out messages
whenever a user on Android

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.950
removes the app
from their phone.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.590
So thank you all
so much for coming,

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:19.810
and I hope you are having a
great time here at GDD Europe,

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.210
and I hope to see you next year.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.050
I'm Jen Person.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.030
I will be upstairs
for Office Hours

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.880
if anyone has any additional
questions about these features

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.580
or anything else
Firebase related.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.180
Thank you.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:31.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.430
