00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:03.661
- [Voiceover] There are
four seasons each year.

00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:07.944
Rafael gets a haircut
two times each season.

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:12.763
One at Arlo's barber shop, and
the other at Awesome Snips.

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:15.479
Which choices represent the number

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.100
of haircuts Rafael will get this year?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.436
And they've even made a little

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:22.640
diagram for us right over here.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.767
So they tell us there's
four seasons in the year,

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:27.611
Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter.

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:31.535
And that each season
Rafael gets two haircuts.

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.890
He gets one at Arlo's
and one at Awesome Snips.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.293
So in Spring this is
the one that he gets at

00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:39.974
Arlo's, this is the one that
he gets at Awesome Snips.

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:42.134
And Summer, this is the
one he gets at Arlos',

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:44.653
this is the one he gets at Awesome Snips.

00:00:44.653 --> 00:00:47.416
Autumn this is the he gets at Arlo's,

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.412
this is the one at Awesome Snips.

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:51.049
And Winter, this is the one at Arlo's,

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.348
this is the one at Awesome Snips.

00:00:53.348 --> 00:00:56.691
So they ask us, which choices represent

00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:59.714
the number of haircuts
Rafael will get this year?

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.974
Well one way to this about it is:

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:05.608
In Spring he will get two haircuts then

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:07.928
in Summer he is going to
get another 2 haircuts.

00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:10.581
In Autumn he is going to
get another two haircuts.

00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.138
And then in Winter he is going
to get another two haircuts.

00:01:13.138 --> 00:01:15.893
So he is going to get two in Spring,

00:01:15.893 --> 00:01:18.331
plus two in Summer, plus two in Autumn,

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:19.967
plus two in Winter.

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:23.404
Which is going to be
equal to eight haircuts.

00:01:23.404 --> 00:01:26.421
So which of these represent eight?

00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.104
Well let's see, two plus
two, that's not eight.

00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:31.611
Four plus four plus four plus four,

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:34.049
that's not eight, that's 16.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.083
Two plus two is four.

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:36.952
Four plus four is eight, plus four is 12

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:39.401
plus four is 16, that's not eight.

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:41.966
Four plus four, that is equal to eight.

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.544
That is the number of haircuts

00:01:43.544 --> 00:01:45.206
Rafael is going to get this year.

00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:46.483
So we can check that one.

00:01:46.483 --> 00:01:48.526
Two plus two plus two plus two,

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:51.428
that's exactly what we
wrote here, and it is eight.

00:01:51.428 --> 00:01:53.227
So that is equal to the number

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:55.085
of haircuts he is going to get this year.

00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.348
And then two plus four, well that's not

00:01:57.348 --> 00:01:59.647
equal to eight, that's
six, so that's not right.

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:02.770
So these are the two that represent

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.770
the number of haircuts
Rafael will get this year.
