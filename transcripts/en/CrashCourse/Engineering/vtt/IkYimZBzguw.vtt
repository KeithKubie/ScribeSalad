00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.000
From the size of our airplanes to the height
of our skyscrapers, feats of engineering just
keep getting bigger and bigger.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.340
But bigger isn’t always better.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.780
Sometimes you want things to be small.
Really small.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.500
And if you want things to be really small,
you’re gonna need to make them out of small
materials: nanomaterials.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.880
These are used everywhere from the healthcare
industry to electronics.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.520
And, even though they’re small in size,
they pack a big punch!

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:37.940
[Theme Music]

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.140
It’s easy to think of big problems,
ones that you can see.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.440
But many of today’s most important problems
are actually microscopic.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.740
Think of things like cancer or autoimmune
diseases.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.060
These are issues at the cellular level, far
too small to solve with any conventional tools.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:59.340
And even if we find a solution to the root problem,
the body's own defense mechanisms will often see
a potential cure as a threat and attack it.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.120
A good example of this is Type I diabetes,
a chronic condition that requires treatment
with insulin.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.720
To permanently fix the problem, doctors
might want to implant cells to produce that
insulin without needing daily injections.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.260
But if you just stick those cells right into the human
body, the patient’s own antibodies will probably
attack and kill them before they can help.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.219
So for this potential treatment to work, you
need to find a way to protect them.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.760
To solve this problem, and others like it,
you’re going to need to build really small
things.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.180
And for that, you’ll need nanomaterials.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.160
For something to officially be a nanomaterial,
at least one of its dimensions must be smaller
than 100 nanometers.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:43.340
To put that in perspective, a nanometer is one
millionth of a millimeter, or about 100,000 times
smaller than the diameter of a human hair.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.440
So pretty tiny!

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.060
In fact, most nanoscale materials are too small to be
seen even with the help of conventional microscopes,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.740
like the ones you might find
at your high school or college.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.140
If you want to take a look at nanomaterials,
you’ll have to use a better microscope,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.900
like an electron microscope, some of which
can magnify samples by up to 1 million times.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.440
Even then, to actually work on the nanoscale,
you need something like the scanning tunnelling
microscope,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.800
which not only allows you to see individual atoms
and molecules, but also lets you move them around.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.600
But don’t let the small size of nanomaterials
fool you.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.540
Compared to their larger-scale counterparts, they
often have better properties like increased strength,
chemical reactivity, and conductivity.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.720
These traits can let you solve new kinds of
problems, like protecting those implanted 
insulin-producing cells I mentioned earlier.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.160
The device you’ll need to protect those
cells will have to have holes large enough
to let the insulin flow out,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.440
but small enough to keep the body’s attack
cells from getting in.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.500
That kind of precision engineering is a perfect
application of nanotechnology.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.740
While nanomaterials are certainly small, they
actually have a comparatively large surface area.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.660
That may sound a bit counterintuitive, but if
you break something down into smaller chunks,
the overall surface area increases.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.380
You can see what I mean if you take a block
and slice it down the middle.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.920
You didn’t change the overall mass or amount
of material, but now you have two new sides
that add more surface area.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.100
The more surface area there is, the more direct
contact a material can have with its surroundings,
and that contact matters!

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.080
For example, break a material into nanometer-sized
particles, and the increased surface area will lead
to a faster rate of any surface-level reactions.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.540
This makes nanomaterials great catalysts,
or substances that increase the rate of a
chemical reaction,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.180
and it’s why they’re used in a wide range of
important industrial chemical reactions.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.540
Nanomaterials are also often more attractive
to water and oil molecules, making them more
absorbent than larger materials.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.760
That’s why they’re used in water treatment
plants to remove pollutants and at sea to
clean up oil spills.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.700
We’ve also found that solid nanoparticles
can even act like liquids –

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.220
not just as some sort of bulk movement, like you
might see when a pile of sand acts like a fluid, but
in the motion of individual particles themselves.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.940
On their outermost layers, only about an
atom or two thick, these nanoparticles appear
to move about like a liquid.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.580
Even though their insides are solid, their
outsides can change shape and wobble about
like a drop of water!

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:12.640
If you want to form solid, stable shapes out of
nanoparticles, these movements could potentially
cause your designs to fail, like losing an electrical
connection in a circuit.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.440
The nanoscale will even change other properties
of a material, like its melting point and fluorescence,
or the visible light that it emits.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.860
Basically, its color.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.680
A great example of this is gold.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.440
Instead of the color we’re used to seeing
in a treasure chest, nanoscale gold can appear
red or purple.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.580
This unique visual property might one day
lead to better imaging and detection of things
like tumors.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.340
In these ways, it’s possible to literally fine-tune
some of the properties that you’re interested in
just by changing the size of a material.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.220
By taking advantage of these characteristics
and making your own nanomaterials,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.480
you’ll create what we call engineered
nanomaterials, ones that are designed and
produced to help solve problems.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.840
There are also naturally occuring nanomaterials,
like volcanic ash or soot from a fire,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.200
as well as ones that are produced as by-products
of other processes like combustion.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.540
These are often termed ultrafine particles and
aren’t really what you’ll be worried about as an engineer.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.880
However, you might have to factor in the effects
of any ultrafine particles that you accidentally make.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.940
But it’s the engineered materials that you’ll
work with that show great potential for medicine,
electronics, and other fields.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.100
The nanotechnology you can make with nanomaterials
can be used to design medicine that will target specific
cells or parts of the body.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:33.100
Think of the potential in not only helping out your
own cells or keeping implanted ones safe, but in
fighting off things like cancer or harmful bacteria.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.700
And the small size of nanomaterials makes
them perfect for electronics.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.780
If you’ve ever looked at a circuit board,
taken apart your smartphone, or put together
your own computer,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.900
you can see just how small
some of their components can be.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.940
In fact, the semiconductors in computers are
often on the nanoscale – and soon some may
have parts only a nanometer long!

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.820
With electronics only getting smaller and smaller,
we’ll likely see nanomaterials playing bigger and
bigger roles in our tech-based future.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.240
And hand-in-hand with modern electronics are
batteries.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.880
The strength and conductive properties of
nanomaterials make them perfect for energy storage
and creating high-capacity batteries.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.200
You know, so your phone actually lasts through
the day.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.580
Nanomaterials can even be added to other materials,
like cement or cloth, to make them stronger and lighter.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.940
Thousands of common products contain engineered
nanomaterials, while many others are manufactured
using tools built from them.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.900
Think of sunscreens, cosmetics, tires, and
many sporting goods.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.180
One of the most prominent areas of nanomaterial
research is carbon nanotubes.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:41.480
Efforts are being made to use this tube-shaped material
for cleaning up oil spills, making better capacitors for
circuits, and even creating artificial muscles.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.880
But while nanomaterials seem great, there’s
one pretty big problem:

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.120
we don’t have a complete sense of the potential
effects that they might have on the human body
or the environment.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.140
That means that we don’t know all of the
safety risks and what the proper protocols
should be when dealing with them.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.840
And there have already been problems with
nano-sized particles.

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.479
It’s easy to ingest or breathe in such small
things by accident and without even noticing.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:10.940
For example, we’ve seen that some kinds of
carbon nanomaterials can cause inflammation in
the lungs in ways that are similar to asbestos.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.800
If you’re using nanomaterials to treat a
disease, the last thing you want is to create
new, unexpected problems.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.020
Fear of the unknown isn’t a good reason
to stop moving forward, but more research
is always better.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:29.800
The nanotechnology that could keep implanted
cells safe inside your body to treat diabetes is still
pretty new and in the development stage,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.600
but what it could do for patients would
be life-changing.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.980
Similar designs could be applied to other
diseases, giving us effective cures to many of
the problems that millions face every day.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:46.800
From healthcare, to carbon nanotubes, to
making better batteries, the possibilities of what we
can do with nanomaterials seem endless.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.440
Today we learned about nanomaterials, how
small they are, and some of the things that
they can do.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.580
We learned about the special properties of
nanomaterials and how some of them can change
at different sizes.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.599
Then we found the difference between engineered
nanomaterials and ones that occur naturally.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:09.640
Finally, we saw that since nanomaterials and nanotechnology are so new to us, we still need further research to fully figure out just how safe they are to use.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.240
I’ll see you in our next episode, when we’ll
learn more about biomaterials.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.240
Crash Course Engineering is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.060
If you want to keep exploring big scientific
mysteries by going very, VERY small,

at the very edge of our visible world, from eye popping
mantis shrimp to blood sucking mosquitos.
