Hey guys, Trace here for Dnews.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.269
And you're on the internet right now, right?

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.899
So you may be familiar with the vices of human
life and we've put together a playlist of

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.059
substances, both legal and illegal, that surrounds
us everyday.

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.520
So if you're interested in how a cop might
be able to tell if you're high, or if you

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.200
want to know the science behind the placebo
effect, or maybe how magic mushrooms might

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.650
be treating depression, then this is the playlist
for you.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.700
And you should click on the little floating
box somewhere in front of me here, or look

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.980
in the description for the link.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.160
And hey, if you like the vids, make sure you
subscribe to Dnews so you don't miss any our

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.080
future explorations into the back-alley parts
of the human experience.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.079
See you later.
