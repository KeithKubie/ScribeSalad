1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.680
Well,
now I have to fight this guy because he,
I don't even like this girl really.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.960
So now it's like a,
but it's a,
it's a weird thing.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.030
So I just pretended I didn't hear him.
I was like long ago,

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.500
that was always kind of like scuffled and I was like,
that was that.

5
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:16.840
And she's like,
did you hear what he said?
I was like,
no.
Well,
he's telling him,

6
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:21.690
man,
you had to fight for my,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I,

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.380
but I dated girls like that,
that will you get in your head stopped.
She's like,

8
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:27.810
I'm going to get a hot dog.
I've had,

9
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.750
I've had girls that I've dated that would want you to fight for them.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.490
Not what they would just ladies,
if any ladies listen to the show,

11
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.710
all three or four ladies that are listening to this show right now,

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.460
if I just don't get your man into a fight,
let him decide.

13
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.090
Don't start talking shit to another dude.
You're,

14
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.790
you're putting him in a situation that maybe he doesn't want to be in and you're

15
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.700
never going to know whether or not he wants to be in that situation.

16
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.430
You're never going to get the honest story.

17
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.840
What's going on in his fucking mind right there just no,

18
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:57.960
we never want you to start talking shit to a dude in the middle of an

19
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.880
altercation cause it's never gonna end good.

20
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.930
<v 1>No.
Most of the time,
most of the time does not end good.</v>

21
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.620
Especially if blows start flying,
man.
People getting knocked out.

22
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:10.380
Some guy got hurt really bad at a Dodgers game recently.

23
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.840
He got knocked out and cracked his head off the ground.

24
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.240
That's what people need to understand.
People die from that shit.

25
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200
Watch movies and people knock people out in the person's fine.
Yeah,

26
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.900
you could get a goddamn murder rap if you punch someone and they fall.

27
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.970
And most people,
when you punch him in the face that go unconscious,

28
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:26.390
they have no idea what happened.
They go unconscious,

29
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
their head bounces off the ground,
they die.
It happens all the time.

30
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.960
Kevin James when he was a kid when he was a bouncer in Long Island and one of

31
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.180
the guys at the bar,
I don't think he was working that night,

32
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.270
but one of the guys he knew and worked with knocked the guy out.
The guy fell,

33
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:43.020
hit his head off a curb.
Dead Guy went up to going to going to jail for years,

34
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.910
spent years in jail at some fucking $10 an hour job or you fight and drunks.

35
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.010
Yeah,
just getting into some dumb fight,

36
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.500
which is thinking it's okay to just tee off on someone's face.

37
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.520
It's also probably pretty rare people falling and hitting their head and dying.

38
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.670
That's not rare at all.
That's really common.
Think about what that is.

39
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.810
Somebody I've seen a lot of people get knocked out,
so I'm the wrong guy to ask,

40
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.450
but I'm saying dying from hitting their head on the car.
I haven't seen him die,

41
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:11.130
but they could easily,
yeah,
I mean I guarantee you in a major city like New York,

42
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.370
I bet somebody dies falling and hitting their head off the curb every week.

43
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.080
When you punch someone and they fall.
Think about how far that is,
right?

44
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.510
Think about the amount of force that's involved.

45
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:24.450
Now think about if you were standing there and someone hit you in the back of

46
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:28.380
the head with something.
Now think about that.
Something was the fucking world.

47
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.710
The earth,
it doesn't give it all concrete doesn't give it all.

48
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.210
The only thing that gives your head,

49
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.460
your head has to bounce and your skull fractures and you get internal bleeding.

50
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:42.480
Your brain hemorrhages,
it cuts off your ability to move.
You might have a stroke,

51
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.650
you might have,
I mean,
it's horrible.
Getting knocked out and falling in,

52
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:49.290
hitting your head off the ground is a terrifying thing.

53
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.910
And when you hear the sound of smack of someone's head bouncing off the
concrete,

54
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:58.740
it's,
it's,
it sounds hollow.
That sounds like a,
like a,
like a melon.

55
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.980
It sounds terrible.
Like

56
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.720
<v 0>a hard melon or something like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You see it happen.</v>

57
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.430
Um,
where people pass out,

58
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.980
there's like videos that are out there and just like fall over and then they

59
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:09.940
just split their head open.

60
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.930
<v 1>Worse Dude,
gruesome falling backwards though.
There's something,</v>

61
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:17.080
especially when you get hit,
you get fucking clipped on the chin years,

62
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.770
head snaps and you lights shut off and you just fall and bounce.

63
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.630
It's even in boxing matches men.

64
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.680
So then the scariest knockouts when a guy gets k out and then his head bounces

65
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:28.780
off the ground and MMA and the UFC,

66
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.840
same thing when guys fall back and their head bounced off the ground.

67
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:32.920
It's like a double knot.

68
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.510
<v 0>That's what I watched that fight science thing back in the day they were doing</v>

69
00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:37.970
on spike TV and I was like a show called,

70
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.350
I think it was called fight science and they were just explaining why ground and

71
00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:46.130
pound was so much more brutal than a straight up standing punch and they were

72
00:03:46.131 --> 00:03:46.964
just,
they like,
you know,

73
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.260
they showed the three d animation of the head and the fist coming down and then

74
00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:54.770
the head bouncing off the mat and then the brain bouncing off the front and

75
00:03:54.771 --> 00:03:55.610
bouncing to the back.

76
00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:59.030
Then the fist comes back up again and your brain is just being over and over

77
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:01.700
again and you can't go anywhere.
You're stuck.
It's terrifying.

78
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.800
I got beat up in the sixth grade by an African kid named Bubba tuneday analysts.

79
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.580
Every day a hundred,
right.

80
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.360
<v 1>53 people in the United States die from injuries that include traumatic brain</v>

81
00:04:11.361 --> 00:04:16.050
injury when,
wait a minute.
Okay.
That include traumatic brain injury.

82
00:04:16.051 --> 00:04:18.620
So it's an injury that also has traumatic brain injury.

83
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.493
I see what they're saying.

84
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.440
Those who survive a Tbi can face effects that lasts a few days or the rest of

85
00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:28.160
their lives.
That's the other thing.
Impair thinking or memory movements,

86
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:31.760
sensation,
vision,
emotional functioning,
personality changes or depression.

87
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.360
These issues not only affect individuals can have lasting effects on families.

88
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:39.710
The community.
Well that's,
yeah.
Um,
yeah man,
don't,
don't get hit in the head.

89
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.510
Dot.
Yeah.
Take her for somebody that's been hitting the head.
Avoid it.

90
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.280
<v 0>Yeah.
I,
uh,
w whenever,
when my son,
cause there's just like a lot of,</v>

91
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.760
there's a weird thing in New York as well where there's like a lot of tough guys

92
00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:53.540
that it's like this Alpha energy we'll get on the subway and there's another

93
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:56.210
dude who like make eye contact with you and then you're like,

94
00:04:56.211 --> 00:04:59.450
weirdly like you're in a weird beef now cause you're just looking at a dude in

95
00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:02.400
the eyes and look.
Yeah.
And it's in that,

96
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.230
and then it becomes a thing where you have to like look away.
Then you're,

97
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.340
you have this internal struggle where we're going like,
well no I don't,

98
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:11.280
I'm not going to look away because this guy's looking at me and then,

99
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.850
and then I looked at my kids right there and I'm going like,

100
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.560
what is even going on in my head right now?

101
00:05:15.561 --> 00:05:17.150
I need to just go to another subway car.

102
00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:22.151
Just avoid at all costs having to get into a confrontation in front of him

103
00:05:22.341 --> 00:05:26.060
because that's one of my biggest fears in the world is not knowing what to do.

104
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.020
This people

105
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.550
<v 1>in like Montana that are listening to this right now,
they're like,</v>

106
00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:31.140
what the fuck are you talking about?

107
00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:34.530
Like you look each other in the eye and some wants to fight for no reason.

108
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.250
This is the nature of being penned up.
Yeah,
that many people,

109
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:40.320
I was fucking does something cool about it.

110
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.250
The cool thing we talked about before that people are like,
you are exposed.

111
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:46.700
Even if you're a poor kid,
you're exposed to rich people.
They're,
they're,

112
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.490
they're normal.
They're like,
it doesn't seem unattainable or unreachable.

113
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.730
They're all around you.
The Path is there.
Well,
there are humans that are,

114
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.290
they're just like you.
You're around them.

115
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.810
But if you live in a place where there you're never around them,

116
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.980
you'll never get that.
So there's benefits to New York for sure.
Culturally,

117
00:06:01.981 --> 00:06:06.870
there's benefits.
The just the,
just the energy,
the city,
and so much creativity.

118
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.950
So much going on.
Yeah.
