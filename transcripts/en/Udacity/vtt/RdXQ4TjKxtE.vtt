&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We're going to continuing working with inequalities but before we, do let's

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:07.438
look at sets. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sets are going to help us understand the words and, and or. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:00:07.438 --> 00:00:11.404
And then, we can use these words to make sense of compound inequalities next. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:00:11.404 --> 00:00:14.837
C is going to be the set of the counting numbers from 1 to 7. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; A set is a

00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:18.696
collection of elements or items ... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it's usually denoted by curly braces

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:23.356

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:27.551
numbers between 1 and 9? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can enter your answer here. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Be sure you use

00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:31.345
the correct punctuation notation. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Commas separate the elements.
