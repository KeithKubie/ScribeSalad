00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000
Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.000
This is Crash Course mythology,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.580
and in the first episode of this series,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.440
we defined what we mean by myth.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.520
I also said that we weren't gonna get too theoretical

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.120
because the theory of mythology gets complicated quickly--

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.300
but you all have &lt;i&gt;asked&lt;/i&gt; for an episode on theories of mythology;

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.680
...and if you know me, and the other things that I make,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.620
you know how I feel.. about talking theory.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.940
So... that's what we're gonna do;

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.000
and, ok, that ask may have just been some strong-arming from Thoth,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.360
but who can say no to that face?!?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.500
[intro music]

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.040
So.. let's look at how people think about mythology

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.240
and give you some ideas about how to analyze

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.660
myths yourself.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.460
We're gonna start with the definition of

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.440
MYTH - OLOGY

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.800
Unlike myths themselves, which as we pointed out

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920
are difficult to define, mythology

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.320
is pretty straightforward--

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.300
since in english, "ology" means basically the study of--

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.320
"mythology" is the systematic study of myths...

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.360
...a thing you probably already figured out for yourself

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.960
at this point in the series.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.140
The real question is..

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.620
HOW are myths studied,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.060
and for that we're gonna jump in our time-machine

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.320
--courtesy of Zurvan the zoroastrian god of time--

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.400
check your divine flux capacitor and buckle up.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.700
So, we start in ancient Greece. In the first episode

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.300
I mentioned that critical analysis of myths has been around for a long time.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.240
As early as the mid 500's BCE

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.180
presocratic philosophers like Xenophanes were criticizing Hesiod and Homer

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.360
for attributing all of the evil and shameful aspects of humanity to the gods.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.260
Plato was among the first to equate myths with 'lying'

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.680
and, as we discussed in episode 1, that idea has stuck.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.200
But Plato further complicated this issue because he claimed that myths about

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.640
gods, heroes, and fantastic creatures were irrational and therefore, 'false.'

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.660
Yet philosophical myths like the ones he put forward in "The Republic"

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.320
served a rational purpose.. and were 'true.'

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.340
Sorry Thoth, you're gonna have to talk it over with Veritas, Roman goddess of truth.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.400
A little bit after Plato came the influential thinker Euhemeros.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.300
He assumed that people who lived before him were primitive, with no concept of science,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.500
so they created fanciful versions of historical events to explain things they didn't understand.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.060
In Euhemeros's opinion, Zeus was an early human king whose deeds became legendary and,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.300
as those legends were retold, he transformed into a god.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.500
Euhemerism has come to mean interpreting "Myths as primitive explanations of the natural world

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.000
or as time-distorted accounts of long-past historical events."

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.020
Although Euhemeros wasn't particularly influential in his own time, his ideas were picked up later by Roman thinkers--

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.120
--especially Christians.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.220
Early church-thinkers, like Tertullian and Clement of Alexanderia, took up the Platonic sense of myth as 'falsehood',

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.020
and upon it they based a new theory: that the Greek and Roman myths were influenced by demons

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.580
who wanted the stories to prepare their listeners for the story of Jesus, and to provide a contrast between him

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.700
and the pagan gods.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.460
..so, I mean, those are some pretty helpful demons.. I guess?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.480
These early mythologists set up a dichotomy between 'mythos,' associated with falsehood,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.300
and 'logos,' which Christian thinkers associated with transcendant truth.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.500
This synthesis of Plato and Christianity was the basis of Western mythology until the Renaissance.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.740
For many centuries European artists drew a great deal from classical Greek and Roman myths

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.000
but, mythology as a study didn't really take off until the 18th and 19th centuries,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.560
drawing on the linguistic discovery that the languages of India, SouthWest-Asia and Europe are all related--

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.740
they're all derived from a single language,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.040
now known as "Proto-Indo-Europian".

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.560
The discovery of Proto-Indo-Europian led some to posit that it was spoken by a group called "Aryans,"

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.220
whose myths were the basis for all European, Indian, and Southwest-Asian myths--

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.400
--a purported explanation for their similarities.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.160
In addition to the Aryan hypothesis, this discovery also gave way to a broadly comparative mythology

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.100
that focused much more on origin and content than function.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.200
There's no real evidence that these Aryans ever existed,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.700
but that didn't stop romantic thinkers like Johann Gottfried Herder

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.780
who believed that their myths, along with other things, embodied the simplicity and purity of the German 'volk.'

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.440
That sounds innocuous enough until we learn that the Nazis would later appropriate Herders pro-German ideas

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.780
to justify their atrocities and legitimize their hateful ideology.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.760
The study of myth changes again in the 20th century when it joins forces with the new discipline of anthropology.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.720
Anthropologists wouldn't just read about myths in libraries, they would conduct fieldwork

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.000
to discover how myths functioned in living societies.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.040
Although in the early days of anthropology the object of study was still societies considered 'primitive,'

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.980
...at least by those anthropologists.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.260
Let's go to the thought bubble--

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.720
One of the towering figures in this new way of studying myths was the Scottish anthropologist Sir James Frazer

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.640
who could really rock a beard.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.360
His twelve volume book, "The Golden Bough,"

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.200
centers on different versions of a myth in which sacred kings are slaughtered

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.600
in order to ensure a bountiful harvest.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.200
Frazer supported the concepts of myths as primitive science,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.620
which attributed to the will of deities, people or animals

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.000
that which modern science attributes to the impersonal functioning of

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.900
various physical laws and biological processes.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.780
That's another way of saying, "Hey, if you haven't quite mastered physics, blame a god."

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.900
To be honest, that's what I do.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.200
Ooooh! A GOD!

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.200
One of the mythologists to follow Frazer,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.600
BronisÅ‚aw Malinowski, did fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.000
and outlined the new anthropological view of myth that grew out of working with living peoples.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Studied alive, myth... is not symbolic, but a direct expression of its subject-matter;

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
... a narrative resurrection of a primeval reality,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
... Myth fulfills in primitive culture an indispensable function;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.500
it expresses, enhances and codifies belief;

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.000
it safeguards and enforces morality;

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.500
it vouches for the efficiency of ritual

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.500
and contains practical rules for the guidance of man.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.000
Yeah, that 'primitive peoples' part is a little hard to take. Early anthropology was pretty judgy.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But this new approach had the advantage of

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.500
focusing on what so-called primitive people know,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.000
rather than what they don't.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Building on the work of anthropologists, recent mythologists

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
have tried to connect their work to the lived experiences of actual human beings.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.220
--Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.000
At around the same time that anthropology was gaining prominence,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
the new field of psychology was also looking to myths

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.360
for an explanation of human experience.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.500
Two of the best known psychologists,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.500
Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.000
posit that the source of myths is the human unconscious,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.700
and that mythical characters are projections of that unconscious.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.060
We're gonna return to these thinkers in a later episode,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.540
but for now it's helpful to understand the fundamental difference between the two.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.720
For Freud, the unconscious is the true psychical reality;

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.200
but our conscious minds, like Tom Cruise,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.160
"CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!"

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.440
So we make these terrible realities palatable, by creating imaginative works,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.140
like myths,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:19.480
which are strategies for managing the internal forces that shape our thoughts, feelings and actions.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.520
Jung similarly saw myths as a projection of the unconscious,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.740
but for him.. the unconscious was collective and universal

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.520
--NOT individual.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.500
It's like a reservoir, from which we all drink.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.740
A reservoir with more dreams... and less flouride

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.160
They put that in the reservoir itself, right?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.200
Jung defined a number of archetypes that he saw as aspects of every person's psyche

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.200
and, in his estimation, the characters that appear in myths

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.800
are versions of these archetypes.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.200
The collective nature of human consciousness

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.000
may be one reason we can find similar mythic characters

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.800
from stories originating in many parts of the world.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.200
And of course, we couldn't do an episode on thoeries of mythology

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.200
without mentioning the best known mythologist of the twentieth century,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.200
Lets hear it for: Joseph Campbell.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.200
Campbell became famous in the 1980s for a television series,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.600
"The Power of Myth," also with Bill Moyers.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.000
And George Lucas also credited Campbell with influencing Star Wars.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.800
Luke, guess... he's your father.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.000
More on that later.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.800
Campbell's understanding of myth, and particularly of hero stories,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.000
is a reflection of the American valorization of rugged individuals.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.200
For Campbell, "Mythology is ultimately and always

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.600
the vehicle through which the individual

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.600
finds a sense of identity and place in the world."

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.800
Campbell synthesized the ideas of psychoanalysts,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.800
comparative mythologists, and literary and cultural critics

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.500
to create his own theory of a single "mono-myth"

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.500
that underlies all mythical stories.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.700
Meanwhile, French anthropologist, Claude Levi-Strauss

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.200
-- no relationship to the blue-jeans --

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.000
developed a theory for describing myths by looking at their structure.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.800
Structuralism holds that specific instances of culture,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.360
like myths, betray a much more complicated underlying structure.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.800
What that structure is, and how it works,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.000
depends upon which structuralist you're talking to.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.700
Levi-Strauss, arguably the first structuralist, was all about...

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.800
BINARIES.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.800
Culture is built a relationship between..

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.000
male and female,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.800
hero and villain,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.000
even cooked and raw, among many others.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.200
For him, myths, like all units of culture,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.600
sit atop these inescapable opposing binaries.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.200
And, since many students of mythology will have heard of him and his theories,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.000
we should also mention Romanian religious historian,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.200
Mircea Eliade.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.000
Even though his personal politics have overshadowed his scholarship in many circles.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.800
Eliade was a Romanian nationalist who associated with a proto-fascist group

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.200
and thus his reputation, like that of Herder and Nietzsche, has suffered.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.000
Hey!

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Mythologists!

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.800
No more chillin' with fascists, ok?

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.500
I feel like I shouldn't even have to ask this.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.500
Eliade was also a fan of binaries;

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.200
particularly the sacred and the profane,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.800
as well as the archaic and the modern.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.800
For Eliade, archaic people were more in-touch with the sacred.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.500
And today myths allow us to escape the profane,

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.000
to travel back to the past,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and re-encounter the sacred.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.500
Structuralist theory was very popular at the end of the twentieth century,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.800
but it also left a lot of people wondering, "so what?"

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.600
What do we gain by reducing all myths to a set of patterns,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.600
or even to one single pattern?

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.000
What does that really tell us about-

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.800
-why cultures use myth, or how myth reveals culture?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.000
Contemporary approaches have pioneered some new methods

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
of asking and answering these questions.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.200
William Doty proposes giving students of myth a toolkit

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.800
which includes a series of questions to ask when reading myths,

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.000
centering on several concerns:

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.800
the social,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800
the psychological,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.500
the literary,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.500
textual and performative,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.200
the structural and, finally, the political.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.200
These provide a broader way of looking at myths.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.800
Wendy Doniger provides an updated version of comparative mythology,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.000
asking myth readers to look also at the context in which the myth is told--

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.800
exploring difference.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.500
These more contemporary ways of looking at myths

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.800
fit well with the complex view of the world that we try to take here at Crash Course.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.200
but, we're not going to follow any one school of thought

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.200
when it comes to how we "-ology" these here "myths".

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.000
We like being eclectic,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.200
and have no interest in forcing you to see myths in one particular way.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.600
HadÃºr, Hungarian god of forests?

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.000
Got my eye on you!

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000

Thanks for watching and, you know what?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.800
I've been thinking about it, I think I'm going to come clean:

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.200
I don't feel great about that Star Wars joke earlier.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.200
I'm real sorry.
