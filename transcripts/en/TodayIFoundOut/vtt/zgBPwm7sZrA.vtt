00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:23.720
Now, to qualify that title, pure alcohol will
absolutely kill brain cells and many other

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.599
types of cells, which is why it is used as
a disinfectant.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.509
However, recent research has shown that the
quantity of alcohol you could possibly take

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.230
in, without killing yourself, does not introduce
enough alcohol into your bloodstream to kill

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.510
brain cells.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.059
This was proven by a study by Grethe Jensen
and co.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.550
(1993), who meticulously counted neurons in
matched samples of non-alcoholics and alcoholics.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.550
What they found was that there was no real
difference in the density or overall number

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.239
of neurons between the two groups.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.379
Various other research since has backed up
Jensen’s findings.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.489
Thus, even alcoholics who are continually
taking in unhealthy amounts of alcohol aren’t

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.830
going to see brain cells die because of their
drinking problem.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.000
However, alcohol does have other effects on
the brain, both positive and negative, that

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.340
have nothing to do with brain cells dying.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.880
First, the positive: drinking moderate amounts
of alcohol on a regular basis has been shown

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.229
to have various positive effects on your body.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.560
The one that pertains to this article’s
topic is that it has been shown to help protect

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.689
people from cognitive impairment as they age.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.299
According to a study done at the Catholic
University of the Sacred Heart, in Italy,

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.920
29% of people 65 years or older who almost
never drank alcohol throughout their life

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.950
had mental impairment issues.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.260
On the flip-side of that, only about 19% of
people 65 years or older who drank moderate

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.880
amounts of alcohol regularly had any mental
impairment.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.439
It was further discovered that, among the
various groups where other problems, such

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.820
as health problems or the like, might impair
them mentally, the same trend appeared.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.859
In every group, those who drank moderately
on a regular basis throughout their lives

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.400
always had a diminished chance of becoming
mentally impaired in their old age compared

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.099
to those who didn’t drink at all or almost
never drank.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.349
Now for the negative (there’s a lot when
it comes to intemperate alcohol consumption,

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.400
so I’ll only cover a few): while brain cells
aren’t being killed as the result of drinking

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.760
excessive amounts of alcohol, the ability
for your brain cells to communicate with one

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.580
another is being inhibited.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.800
What’s going on here is that the alcohol
ends up damaging dendrites, which are the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.900
things at the ends of neurons that conduct
electrochemical stimulation from another cell

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.629
to the cell body in question.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.989
Basically, with some of these dendrites damaged,
it inhibits the ability of your brain cells

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.430
to talk to one another.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.440
Luckily, you have an amazing number of connections
and neurons in your brain (about 100 billion

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.290
neurons, along with 10’s of billions of
glial cells, which support the neurons).

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.920
So this helps mask the problem.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.640
Also, even among long time alcoholics, it
has been shown that simply quitting drinking

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.820
copious amounts of alcohol is all that is
required for your body to be able to reverse

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.370
most of the damage to the dendrites and restore
the ability for your brain cells to communicate.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.650
So you can afford to damage some of the neurons
temporarily without any real lasting effect.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.871
Unfortunately, for the people who have an
extreme habit of excessively drinking, there

00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:21.230
are other side effects on your brain that
aren’t so easily completely fixed, such

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.819
as developing Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome,
which is characterized by: confusion, coordination

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.629
problems, hallucinations, memory problems,
eye problems, and even inducing a coma or

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.680
death, if it’s left untreated.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.560
What’s going on here is that excessive alcohol
consumption over a long period of time causes

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.980
a vitamin B1 deficiency (8 out of 10 alcoholics
are vitamin B1 deficient), due to the alcohol

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.650
inhibiting the body’s ability to absorb
thiamine (also many alcoholics are often malnourished

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.819
because of their own bad eating habits).

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.780
This, in turn, causes neuron death, among
other things.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.599
This is treatable, in most cases, but certain
effects stick around forever as your body

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.140
won’t be able to repair itself completely
from this particular brand of damage.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.910
Another brain-related side effect caused by
excessive drinking is that high doses of alcohol,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.959
while not killing your brain cells, inhibits
the growth of new brain cells.

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.710
However, recent research has shown, at least
with rats, that once the alcohol was no longer

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:23.560
given to the rats, new brain cell production
went into overdrive to try to compensate for

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.950
the previously inhibited brain cell production.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.820
Now, if you go for long enough without giving
your brain a chance to recover, drinking excessively

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.970
on a regular basis, it is thought there may
still be lasting effects due to this inhibited

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.130
new brain cell growth over extended periods,
but whether this is actually the case or not,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.360
isn’t yet known.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.390
There are also a variety of other known neurological
problems that are associated with intemperate

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.160
alcohol consumptions over long periods of
time and some that even show up in a short

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.880
amount of time in children and teens who abuse
alcohol, but this article is already too long.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.100
:-) Then of course, there are the myriad of
other problems, non-brain related that come

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.320
with alcoholism, such as liver problems, other
nervous system problems outside of how it

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320
affects your brain, and others.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320
Bottom line, alcohol consumed in moderation,
such as a small glass of wine a day, can be

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.320
very good for you.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.320
On the other hand, drinking excessively won’t
kill you brain cells directly, but is still

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.320
bad for your brain.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.320
Although, your body can compensate, to a certain
extent, and repair the damage caused in most

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.320
cases, at least as far as your brain is concerned,
so long as you don’t make a regular habit

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.320
of it.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.320
Bonus Facts:

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.320
Another myth concerning alcohol that was once
spread about, particularly during Prohibition,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.830
but to which I don’t think anyone actually
believes anymore (at least I hope not!), is

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.410
that drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
can lead to spontaneous combustion due to

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.320
alcohol being flammable and it coursing through
your veins.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.650
This is ridiculous on many levels, but nevertheless,
was a popular notion during Prohibition and

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.490
for a while afterwards.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:40.410
The myth that alcohol kills brain cells was
also widely popularized during Prohibition.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.970
There are several things that contribute to
hangovers, but principally what’s going

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.590
on here is simple dehydration.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.230
Alcohol has a dehydrating effect by inhibiting
the release of vasopressin, which is an anti-diuretic

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.230
hormone.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.660
So in layman’s terms, the result of alcohol
inhibiting the vasopressin is that your body

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.600
produces a lot more urine than normal with
the result that you become dehydrated easily.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.341
Scientists once believed that the number of
nerve cells you have in your brain, once you

00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:10.810
reach adulthood, was all you’d ever have.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.130
Thus, damaging these cells could be extremely
detrimental to the individual.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.300
However, this isn’t correct.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:27.880
New neurons are created all the time in the
adult brain, in a process that is 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:35.990
called neurogenesis.
