00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.120
- [Instructor] This is a print

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.850
showing the San Francisco Harbor in 1848.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.750
There's a little smattering of houses,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.480
and a few boats in the water.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.420
It looks pretty peaceful, and it was.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.160
San Francisco only had
about a thousand residents,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.500
and California had only
newly become a U.S. territory

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.730
at the close of the Mexican-American War.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.580
And this is a photograph of
San Francisco Harbor in 1850.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.490
The water is crowded with ships,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.740
and the land is crowded with houses.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.970
Less than two years later,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.250
San Francisco had 30-thousand residents,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.040
mainly young men who had
come from all over the world,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.100
making the city perhaps the
most culturally-diverse place

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.360
on earth at that time period.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.860
What happened?

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.340
The short answer is, gold.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.440
In January 1848, gold was
discovered in California,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.320
near the Sierra Nevada mountains,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.660
right about here.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.600
San Francisco was the
gateway to that gold.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.810
The nearest harbor where ships could land

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.040
with prospective gold
miners from the East Coast,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.020
Europe, South America, and Asia.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.550
Before the gold rush,
the non-Indian population

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.270
of the State of California
was about 15-thousand people.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.570
By 1860, it was more than 350-thousand.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.180
And, in the same time period,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.000
the Native-American population
decreased from 150-thousand

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.890
to only 30 thousand.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.330
The gold rush, and its
impact on California,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.700
is one very dramatic
illustration of the causes

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.720
and effects of westward migration

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260
in the years surrounding the Civil War.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.650
This drive to expand the United States

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.760
West to the Pacific is often
called manifest destiny,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.270
based on a phrase that was coined

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.750
by New York journalist John O'Sullivan,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.080
who wrote in 1845 that westward expansion

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.820
would be "The fulfillment
of our manifest destiny

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.370
"to overspread the continent
allotted by Providence

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.640
"for the free development

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.440
"of our yearly multiplying millions."

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.130
The word 'manifest,' in this sense,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.980
means clear, or obvious,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.220
and 'Providence' is another
word for God's help.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.840
So O'Sullivan was saying that
God had provided the continent

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.760
for the United States to expand,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.900
and it was obviously the destiny

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.750
of the United States to do so.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.120
But despite the prevailing idea

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.740
that the American West was an empty land

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.380
full of limitless resources,

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.680
there were in fact a lot of Native people

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.310
already living in the West.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.360
And the arrival of people
not only from the East Coast,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.100
but from all over the world

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.180
in the second half of the 19th Century,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.110
would have enormous effects
on both people and politics.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.010
So let's start by talking
about what drew immigrants

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.540
to the West in this era.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.800
First and foremost,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.940
they were drawn by economic opportunities

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.260
available in the West.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.230
Before there were gold miners
flooding San Francisco,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.090
most people who went to
the West were farmers.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.530
As land became scarcer in the East,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.750
a trickle of farming families headed

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.260
to the fertile Willamette
Valley of Oregon,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.890
through the Oregon Trail.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.300
After the discovery of gold in California,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.010
and later in Montana,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.930
westward migration
increased exponentially,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.230
but only a few miners
actually struck it rich,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.310
mainly those who were already in the area

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.100
before gold was discovered.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.890
Mining and farming weren't the
only economic opportunities

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.380
available in the west.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.340
Many people found work in the industries

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.690
that served the miners,
like hardware stores,

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.840
boarding houses, and restaurants.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.330
There was also the railroad.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.550
Between 1860 and 1880,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.400
the miles of railroad track
in the United States tripled.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.970
And, as the railroad expanded,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.110
so did opportunities for
work on the railroad.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.470
The expansion of the railroad was one way

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.990
that the Federal Government
facilitated westward migration.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.380
In 1862, in the midst of the Civil War,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.280
Congress passed the Pacific Railway Act,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.360
which granted railroad companies
more than 100-million acres

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.310
in order to complete a
transcontinental railroad,

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.660
which they did in 1869.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.140
The transcontinental
railroad reduced the time

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.590
it took to get across the
country from five months,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.200
so just six days, which made traveling,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.250
and transporting goods to and
from the West, much easier.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.660
In 1862, Congress also
passed the Homestead Act,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.760
which grated 160 acres of land, for free

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.160
to anyone over the age of 21

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.010
who had never taken up arms
against the U.S. Government,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.060
so no one who was affiliated
with the Confederacy,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.830
as long as they made improvements

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.640
to the land within five years.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.310
And this included women,
immigrants, and African-Americans.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.530
The Homestead Act was
the wartime extension

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.210
of the ideas of the free soil movement:

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.730
to populate Western lands with
small, independent farmers,

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.750
rather than slaveholders
on giant plantations.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.010
More than 1.5 million people
acquired land this way.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.700
The last reason that
Americans headed West,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.140
that I'll talk about here,

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.860
was cultural messaging of the time period.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.260
I mentioned earlier this
notion of manifest destiny,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.590
that the United States
had a divine mission

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.720
to spread across North America.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.700
Closely related to that
was a widespread belief

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.450
among whites that American civilization

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.580
was superior to other cultures,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.710
and that any barriers to U.S. expansion,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.850
like Native Americans
and Mexican Americans

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.790
who possessed the land onto
which settlers flooded,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.100
were obstacles to
progress and civilization.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.370
This painting, which was painted in 1872

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.640
by the artist John Gast,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.050
is called American Progress.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.510
In it, you can see an
allegorical figure of America

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.370
holding a schoolbook, and
helping to lay telegraph wire.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.470
She brings with her symbols
of American civilization:

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.010
railroads, and covered wagons,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.200
and farmers with log cabins.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.840
And she drives away
symbols of what the artist

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.850
portrays as wilderness, or savagery:

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.160
Native Americans, buffalo,
even an angry bear down here.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.020
You can even see how the artist painted

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.250
the right side of the painting
with a bright, clear sky,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.350
and the left side with
dark shadows and clouds

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.190
so that this central figure of America

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.930
seems to be driving out the darkness.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.620
I encourage you to pause the video

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.200
and see how many symbols of civilization,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.000
and symbols of wilderness,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.040
you can identify in this painting.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.480
Now that we've discussed the
causes of westward expansion,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.640
let's talk about some of its effects.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.480
A major one is an increase
in sectional conflict.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.490
As new Western states joined the union,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.190
it inflamed tensions
over the balance of power

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.090
between free and slave states in Congress,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.740
which ultimately would
lead to the Civil War.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.650
Another effect was an increase

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.890
in racial conflict in the West.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.860
As people from all over
the world came to the West,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.680
and competed for land and gold,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.340
there was a surge in racial violence.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.570
Before, and after the Civil War,

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.160
as white settlers crowded onto
the lands of Plains Indians,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.370
the U.S. Army sought to exterminate them,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.840
or confine them to reservations.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.400
In California, white miners
sought to expel foreign miners,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.500
and Native Americans,
from regions with gold.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.200
Vigilantes killed or expelled
80% of the Native population

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.340
of the region in just over a decade.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.670
Also, in California,

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.980
vigilante groups attacked
Chinese communities,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.460
and even tried to destroy Chinatown

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.900
in San Francisco in 1877.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.680
The State Government in California

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.460
also imposed high taxes on foreign miners,

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.040
especially the Chinese.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.060
These discriminatory laws
would lay the groundwork

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.180
for the first race-based
immigration restriction

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.190
in U.S. history, the Chinese
Exclusion Act of 1882.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.630
The enormous increase in
westward expansion in this era

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.250
led to unprecedented prosperity for some,

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.110
and unprecedented misery for others.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.140
But in 1877, at the end
of the Reconstruction Era,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.230
the process of westward
expansion was not yet complete.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.540
Many of the political, social,
and economic consequences

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.330
of the events in this time period

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.630
would become even more pronounced

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.880
in the last years of the 19th Century.
