Finally, what will our decision be? Do we fail to reject the

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.530
null, and therefore conclude that there is no significant difference between the

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.540
prices at each store? Or do we reject the null in favor

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.710
of the alternative, that at least

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.470
two stores have significantly different prices?
