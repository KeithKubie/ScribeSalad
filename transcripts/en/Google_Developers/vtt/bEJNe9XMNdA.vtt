00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.220
Hello game developers, and
welcome back to another thrill

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.070
a minute episode of Game On.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.585
So if you're paying attention
to Google I/O this year,

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:09.210
you might have noticed
that in addition

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.450
to all those Android powered
watches, and cars, and TVs,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.050
and blenders and stuff,
we launched a major update

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.457
to the Play Games service.

00:00:18.457 --> 00:00:20.290
In addition to exciting
features like quests

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.300
and save games-- which I will
talk about in future episodes

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.380
I promise-- every user now
has their very own game

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.122
profile which they
level up as they play.

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:31.330
This game profile will be
visible throughout the Play

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.187
Games experience.

00:00:32.187 --> 00:00:33.770
Players will see it
as soon as they're

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.170
signed in to any game
using game services.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.510
It's the first thing they
see in the Play Games app,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.960
and the players can
compare their game profile

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.470
with that of their friends.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.050
And at every point
along the way,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.740
we're showing players what
level their profile is at.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.780
Here I can see that
I'm at level 15,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.340
while my manager Rado
is only at level 7.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.541
Clearly my manager,
he's a bit of a slacker.

00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.040
And so with all the
work we're going

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.640
to be doing raising the
visibility of this game profile

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.270
level, I think
it's safe to assume

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.780
this is the metric by which
most people will start measuring

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.330
their contribution to society,
and overall value as a person.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.080
Or at the very least,
it's something a lot

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.210
of your players, particularly
the competitive ones,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.000
are going to care about.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.270
So how do players level
up their game profile?

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.590
By unlocking XP.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.830
And how to get this XP?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.360
By earning achievements.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.010
We convert achievement
points to XP

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.710
by using a fairly complicated
formula that I don't want

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.850
to get into right now,
because it's a lot of math.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.922
And uh, oh, actually
it's just this.

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:28.880
Every point you decide
an achievement is worth,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.660
it's roughly equal to 100
XP in the Play Games app.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.480
So as players start caring
about their game profile level,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.960
they're going to start caring
about how much XP they earn.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.807
And as players care
about the XP they earn,

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.640
they're going to care
about the achievements

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.540
you put in your game, and
how much they are worth.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.770
So use these achievements well,
and score them appropriately,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.850
and they can be a powerful
force to keep players

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.277
happy and engaged
within your game.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.360
So let's talk about making
sure these achievements

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.730
are scored correctly.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.570
And that starts by having a
decent number of achievements.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.140
We took a look at our
100 top performing games

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.180
with achievements, and
found that they average

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.230
about 30 or 40
achievements per title.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.690
So put in a good
assortment of achievements.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.919
Once you have that, you
then have the freedom

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.370
to add in a mix of achievement
difficulties, right?

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.730
Variety is the spice of
life, maybe after salt.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.990
So you want to add some
tough achievements that

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.130
might take players some
extra effort to earn,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.580
as well as a few easy ones
that players will earn just

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.814
in the natural course
of playing your game.

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:26.230
Once you've done
that, you can now

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.950
score these things
appropriately.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.300
We recommend make the easy ones
worth around 5 to 20 points,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.800
the medium ones about 25
to 45, and the hard to epic

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.970
ones in the 50 to
100 point range.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.940
Now remember, you have a maximum
of 1,000 achievement points

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.900
per game.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.474
So if you're making a game
with 100 achievements,

00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:45.890
you're going to
need to score them

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.130
a lower on average than
our recommendations.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.602
But that's OK, a lot of
achievements, that's fun too.

00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:54.060
Also keep in mind that if you've
got some future expansions

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.160
planned for your game, and you
have achievements to go along

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.230
with each of these new
expansions-- and you should--

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.270
don't use up all your
points right away.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.270
Keep a few in reserve,
so that you then

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.080
have some achievements
points to spend

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.100
on each of these new updates.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.560
But what do you do
if you've created

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.560
what you think is a
little one off project,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.510
and it becomes a surprise hit?

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.000
Well good problem
to have I guess,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.979
but now you want to
add more updates,

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:19.520
and you want to add
more achievements

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.440
with those updates.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.620
But you've already used
up your 1,000 points.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.010
So now what?

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.120
Well it turns out we
do give you the ability

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.360
to change point values
of your achievements

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.480
even after they
have been published.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.640
So you can reduce the
value of some of your older

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.780
achievements, and then
you have a few more points

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.580
to spend on the new ones.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.289
Now if you do this,
your current players,

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:40.246
they're going to get to
keep the points they've

00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:41.780
earned for their
older achievements.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.420
So that means your most loyal
fans, who maybe earned 1,000

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.071
points from your
original release,

00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:48.570
they're going to be able to
earn more than 1,000 achievement

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.450
points total.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.280
Which in the grand
scheme of things

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.870
isn't so bad-- you're rewarding
your most loyal players--

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.220
but don't do it
too often or it'll

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.340
start get confusing if
players notice that they're

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.010
getting scored differently
than their friends.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.820
Second, double check that
your achievements are, well,

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.940
achievable.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.950
Have you gone and made
five secret achievements

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.340
that nobody can actually earn?

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.450
Yes, we know who you are.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.920
And in fact, if
you've done this,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.170
you've probably seen that
we now hide the achievements

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.779
portion of your game
in the Play Games app.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.320
And maybe your players noticed
earlier, and didn't care much.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.390
Because it's a bummer
to not get achievements,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.970
but it's not the
end of the world.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.604
But now this means they can't
level up by playing your game.

00:04:25.604 --> 00:04:27.270
And maybe they decide
to ditch your game

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.122
in favor of something similar
that will increase their level.

00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:31.830
Maybe that's not a
risk you want to take.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.862
Just a thought.

00:04:32.862 --> 00:04:34.320
But on the flip
side, you also need

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.680
to watch out for giving away
too many achievements too early.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.080
Watch out for making
your achievements so easy

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.680
that they earned in the first
30 seconds of your game.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.130
Partly, this is a big missed
opportunity for you, the game

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.640
developer, because you've
used up all your achievements

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.580
before your player has
had a chance to really

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.370
become invested in your game.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.340
But also, if you give away
too many points too quickly,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.620
it may trigger some rate
limiting alarms on our end,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.870
and you might find that your
achievements aren't worth

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.410
as much as they ought to be.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.510
So remember, it's OK to
have easy achievements,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.176
but they should be
ones the players earn

00:05:06.176 --> 00:05:08.749
through the course of naturally
playing your game, not ones

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:10.540
they are just by pressing
the Start button,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.922
or finishing level one.

00:05:12.922 --> 00:05:15.130
Finally, you might have
noticed that we not only tell

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.090
each player the amount
of XP they've earned,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.477
but we break it down
by game category.

00:05:19.477 --> 00:05:21.560
Here you can see that I'm
clearly a puzzle player,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.640
as shown by my title Puzzler.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.120
While my friend
Damien, you can see

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.010
he's a little more
of a racing player.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.730
And our official
titles are based

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.930
on the games we've earned
the most points in.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.470
So my last piece
of advice for you

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.000
game developers is make sure
you have your games category

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.250
set correctly in two places.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.460
Yes, two.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.260
Both here in the
Play Store listing,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.980
which you've probably
already done,

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.350
but also here in the game
services detail page.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.780
Yes, you need to set it twice.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.860
Once is for the Play Store, and
the other is for game services

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.047
to use for the
user's game profile.

00:05:52.047 --> 00:05:54.630
So this will make sure we're not
recommending your match three

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.210
game to a bunch of racing
fans, and we'll also make sure

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.140
that players won't level up
as a music game aficionado

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.640
by playing your first
person zombie shooter.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.380
So there you have it, folks.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.960
The new game profile is on
an Android device near you,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.620
and is going to sweep
across the nation

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.380
like a stampede of
majestic wild ostriches.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.860
Now you can harness
this stampede

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.514
and ride it to fame and glory.

00:06:14.514 --> 00:06:16.680
or wind up with a bunch of
talon marks on your face.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.887
It's up to you, your
fate is in your hands.

00:06:18.887 --> 00:06:19.470
Just remember.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.460
One, create a varieties
of achievement

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.570
and set their scores
appropriately.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.490
Two, don't do the five
secret achievements

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.990
that nobody can
actually earn thing.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.870
That's not cool.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.590
And three, set your
games category correctly.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.696
So thanks for tuning in.

00:06:31.696 --> 00:06:34.070
You keep making great games,
and we'll keep playing them.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.361
Now if you'll excuse me, I've
got a "Flappy Bird" clone

00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:38.500
that I'm trying to port
to my Android blender.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.520
So I gotta get to work.
