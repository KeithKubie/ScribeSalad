at that time was on the drawing board
and<00:01:01.140><c> so</c><00:01:01.949><c> we</c><00:01:02.190><c> did</c><00:01:02.550><c> flight</c><00:01:02.820><c> test</c><00:01:03.149><c> to</c><00:01:03.390><c> see</c><00:01:03.600><c> how</c>

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
and so we did flight test to see how
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.620 align:start position:0%
and so we did flight test to see how

that would work strapped on the side of
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
that would work strapped on the side of
