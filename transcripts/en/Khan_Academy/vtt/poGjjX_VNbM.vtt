00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:04.160
- Let's see if we can figure
out with 3/4 minus 5/8 is.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.055
And we have 3/4 depicted right over here.

00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:11.980
You could view this entire bar

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.325
as a whole, and we see that it is divided

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:17.440
into four equal sections,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.990
and that three of them are shaded in.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.820
So those three that are shaded in,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.250
those represent 3/4 of the whole.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.840
So you see that right over there,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.030
and then this bar down
here, you could view this

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.540
as another whole.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.195
This is another whole right over here

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.830
and you could see this divided
into eight equal pieces,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.125
and five of them are shaded in.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.145
So that represents,
that represents the 5/8.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.685
So we want to have 3/4,
this green shaded area,

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:46.215
and we want to take away the 5/8.

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:47.190
So how could we do it?

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.385
And even when you look at it visually,

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:49.960
it might jump out at you.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.850
Whenever we add or subtract fractions,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.790
we like to think in terms of
having the same denominator.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.925
Are we going to deal in
fourths or eighths or 16s,

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.215
or whatever else?

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:01.585
So let's think about having
a common denominator.

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:03.685
And a good common denominator

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:06.595
is going to be a common
multiple of the two denominators

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:09.955
right over here, and ideally
their least common multiple.

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:11.830
And one way that I like to tackle that,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.360
there's many ways to do it,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.325
is look at the larger
of the two denominators,

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.250
look at eight, and then keep
looking at increasing multiples

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.795
of eight until you find one
that's also divisible by four,

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:22.925
perfectly divisible by four.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:24.515
But with eight, you immediately say,

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.450
"Well, eight is divisible by four,"

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.720
and that's clearly
divisible by itself as well,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.180
so eight is actually the
least common multiple

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.455
of four and eight.

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:34.495
So you can rewrite both of these,

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.260
both of these fractions
as something over eight.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.115
So the 3/4, you can write
it as something over eight,

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:43.620
and then subtracting from that,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.095
the 5/8, if you want to write
that as something over eight,

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:49.285
well, that's just going to be 5/8.

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:51.850
And then you can figure
out your actual answer.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.695
So how can we rewrite 3/4
to something over eight?

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:57.155
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about doing it.

00:01:57.155 --> 00:01:58.060
One way, look.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.470
I had four in the denominator,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.090
now I'm going to have twice
as many equal sections.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.475
I'm multiplied by two,
so I'm going to have

00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:07.850
twice as many of the
sections actually shaded in.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.045
So times two, 3/4 is
the same thing as 6/8.

00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:14.525
And we can also see that visually.

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.575
If we're going to have twice
as many equal sections,

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:18.720
here we have everything in fourths,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.350
but I'm going to divide,
I'm going to turn this

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.240
into twice as many equal
sections so I have eighths.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.845
So let's do that.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.550
So let me...

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.085
So you have this right here.

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:30.495
Let me divide that.

00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:32.430
Let me divide that.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.720
Let me divide that, and
then let me divide that,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.925
and now I went from fourths to eights.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:41.925
I have one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:44.010
seven, eight equal sections,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.755
and we see that six of them are shaded in,

00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:49.425
that 3/4 is the same thing as 6/8.

00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:51.660
But regardless, now we can subtract.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.055
We have 6/8 and we want to
take away five of the eighths.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:59.250
So we have 6/8, and we want to take away

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.025
one, two, three, four, five of them,

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:04.985
and those five of them
correspond to these purple five

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.290
right over here.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.665
We're taking away one,
two, three, four, five.

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:09.555
We're taking these away.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:11.445
So if you're just looking at the green,

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:14.020
we started with 6/8, we're taking away

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.020
one, two, three, four, five of them,

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:22.360
and you can see that
corresponds to the 5/8 down here

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.830
and what are you left with?

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.795
Well, you're just going to be left with,

00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:30.190
you're just going to be left
with this 1/8 right over there.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.850
So it's just going to be 1/8.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.350
And you could see that
numerically up here.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.185
If I have six of something,
in this case it's 6/8,

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:38.895
and I want to subtract
five of that something,

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:40.225
in this case 5/8,

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:45.001
I'm going to be left with one
of that something, or 1/8.
