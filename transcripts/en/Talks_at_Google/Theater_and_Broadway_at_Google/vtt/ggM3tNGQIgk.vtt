So, Steven, why don't
we start with you.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.021
You wrote the book.

00:05:59.021 --> 00:06:00.800
You won the Tony award, yes?

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:05.330
So you seem like a good
person to start with.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.490
How did you get
the idea for this?

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.220
And when did the writing start?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.290
STEVEN LEVENSON:
Yeah, well, this all

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.750
began actually with one of
our composers, Benj Pasek, who

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.530
had an experience in his high
school where a classmate of his

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.080
died of a drug overdose.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.630
And this was a kid who
didn't have a lot of friends,

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.120
who was sort of an outsider.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.020
Nobody really knew him at all.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.980
And in the aftermath of
his death, what was curious

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.510
was that everyone
in the school all

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.770
of a sudden had a connection
to him that they claimed.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.936
We were best friends
when we were six,

00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:46.560
or our lockers were
next to each other.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.230
Everyone sort of
wanted ownership

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.230
of this tragedy or just to
insert themselves into it.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.350
And this was was,
like, 1998 probably.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.950
So this was before social media.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.550
But Benj always
remembered that experience

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.450
as being sort of formative.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.730
And particularly
troubling to him

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.940
was the fact that he
too wanted to have

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.670
some kind of relationship
to the kid who died too.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.230
He felt that urge
at the same time

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.900
as he found it ridiculous
that other people did.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.130
And so Benj and Justin
Paul, the other composer,

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.527
they went to college together.

00:07:20.527 --> 00:07:21.860
And they began writing musicals.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.620
And they talked about this
weird experience together.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.740
And in the years that
followed, things like 9/11

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.710
happened and, obviously,
the rise of social media.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.000
And this idea of--

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.830
we always grope at
the word for it,

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.510
but it's like
grief exhibitionism

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.400
maybe or this idea of having
to put yourself into a tragedy.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.920
Or whenever a celebrity dies,
people are all of a sudden,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.461
like, oh, that was
my favorite actor.

00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:52.652
We shared an elevator
together once.

00:07:52.652 --> 00:07:54.860
And so that was sort of the
kernel of the idea, which

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.620
was kind of a very heady idea.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.920
And then, when they
came to me, basically,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.640
we had this incredible
producer, Stacey Mindich,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.130
who loved their music
and basically told them,

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.980
what's the idea
that you guys have

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.440
that nobody else wants to do?

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.940
And they had this crazy idea,
and they brought me on board.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.885
And as we started
to talk it over

00:08:18.885 --> 00:08:20.510
and to try to tease
out what we thought

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.450
was so interesting
thematically about this,

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.860
we quickly realized that we
didn't want to write a satire.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.020
That was the first impulse.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.910
The obvious story
here is to poke fun

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.169
at our false connections
and our attempts to fit in.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.220
And we were like, well, what's
the deeper human impulse

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:39.720
behind it?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.789
What is actually propelling
people to want to do this?

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.950
And it felt like it
had something to do

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.410
with a desperation to connect.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.270
And so the character
of Evan came out

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.180
of the idea of what would
happen if there was a kid who

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.550
was unable to connect?

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.560
And that's how the
story all came together.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.085
And that was in 2012 we
first started talking.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.480
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.310
That was 2011.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.450
So it took us, like, five years
before the show was on stage,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.560
I think.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.854
It was a long process.

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.270
BEN FRIED: And
just as a follow-up

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.070
question on the process,
how did the collaboration

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.880
with them work?

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.180
Did music and song lead the
thinking about the plot?

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.300
Did plot bring music together?

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.050
Were these things kind
of all intertwined?

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.716
STEVEN LEVENSON: What
ended up happening

00:09:28.716 --> 00:09:31.070
is we hashed out together
over several months

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.790
a basic rudimentary set
of characters and an idea.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.430
And then, I went off
and wrote the first act

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.770
as if it were just a play.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.250
And I left spaces where we
had discussed there possibly

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.250
being songs where I felt like,
oh, maybe this is a song.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.140
And I even would write
these monologues there

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.680
that felt lyrical, or I
would leave them blank.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.880
And then when I gave that
to them, they said, oh,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.010
this is a good place
for a song, this isn't.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:02.555
And then it began this
process where very soon, it

00:10:02.555 --> 00:10:05.900
became unclear where the
division began and ended.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.909
We were really back and forth.

00:10:07.909 --> 00:10:09.950
BEN FRIED: To continue
the theme of that question

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.837
about the evolution of
the show, four of you

00:10:13.837 --> 00:10:15.920
have been with it since
the very beginning, right?

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.550
And so how has it evolved
as you got attached to it?

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.600
To what degree have you shaped
the characters or the plot,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.711
or have you seen it
change over time?

00:10:25.766 --> 00:10:27.140
MICHAEL PARK: No
one else is here

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.680
that has been with the
show since the beginning.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.480
WILL ROLAND: Bragging.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.900
STEVEN LEVENSON: I remember--

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.108
WILL ROLAND: You stand alone.

00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:38.580
MICHAEL PARK: We were
talking at one point,

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.910
there was a song
called "Going Viral."

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.040
There were a lot of songs
that had come and gone

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.460
throughout that process.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.940
Obviously, the cast had changed.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.000
At one point, there
was a student body.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.940
There was an ensemble.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.380
And I don't know what the
decision was to diminish that.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.130
I think it was the
growth of the projections

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.360
and using them as that social
media engine and the student

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.770
body.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.900
But I also remember
one time we were

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.740
talking about this too, the
school shooter cheek line.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.414
And I don't want to start
something that you're probably

00:11:19.414 --> 00:11:20.330
going to finish later.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.820
But at one point,
it was basically

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.580
on the whole Columbine
thing that he was

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.882
wearing a long, black jacket.

00:11:31.882 --> 00:11:34.090
STEVEN LEVENSON: I think
that was a wardrobe decision

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.920
that we nixed.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.730
I think that was--

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.349
I'm trying to remember
where that came from.

00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:41.640
WILL ROLAND: The show is
peppered with stuff like that.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.223
Mike grew his hair
out, and so there's

00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:44.580
a line about his hair in there.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.900
I always like to say,
forever every sort of joke

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.650
that I have in the
play-- for those of you

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.600
that haven't seen it, it sounds
like a real bummer of a play.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.940
But there's lots of humor in it.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.720
I'm involved in a
lot of the humor.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.160
For every sort of funny thing
that I say, for every line,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.440
there's two other funny
things that Steven

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.934
wrote that I just couldn't do.

00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:09.600
They just weren't
funny when I did them.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.030
STEVEN LEVENSON: That's true.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.863
WILL ROLAND: And so
they're not in the play.

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:12.640
That's it.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.860
And that's true for
all of our material.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.750
The stuff that we
could make work--

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.940
there's a lot of times
where you would write

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.670
what you were
feeling, and then you

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.590
would say it very articulately.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:30.172
And then it all became like a,
yeah, and that's how we felt.

00:12:30.172 --> 00:12:31.880
LAURA DREYFUSS: The
show changed from DC.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.910
We had two songs change--

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.290
the opening number and
then the Act 1 finale,

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.350
which used to be a song
called "A Part Of Me."

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.270
And that song was
a little bit more

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.660
about people wanting to
connect to the tragedy.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.040
And I know that Benj and
Justin have spoken about this.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.415
And I'm sure you
can too as well.

00:12:47.415 --> 00:12:52.300
But they wanted to make it more
about a realization that Evan

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.300
has, and then, therefore,
a celebration, which

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.570
is now "You Will Be Found."

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.500
And so it became more
of an anthem at the end.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.670
STEVEN LEVENSON: Yeah, a lot of
our impulse in writing the show

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:08.320
was dealing with a lot of
complicated moral issues.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.960
And a lot of our
early impulses were

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.974
to shy away from
those things or to be

00:13:13.974 --> 00:13:15.140
a little bit afraid of them.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.580
And I think that is an
example of let's give Evan

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.010
the moment where he's really
enjoying what he's found.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.860
Let's live in that
complicated moment,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.620
instead of trying to
gloss over it and pretend

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.777
that it's not complicated.

00:13:29.777 --> 00:13:31.360
BEN FRIED: It's
amazing to me to think

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.090
that you might have thought of
the finality for the first act

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.180
differently, because it seems,
to me, so central to the play.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.090
It's a rebirth scene
among other things.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.840
And it's just so
gripping because of that.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.290
But that brings up another
question in my mind.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.750
Do each of you have
a most favorite thing

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.222
that's no longer in the play?

00:13:48.222 --> 00:13:50.680
What's the thing you miss the
most that was there and isn't

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.510
there anymore?

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.305
Sorry, is this a
terrible wording?

00:13:54.305 --> 00:13:55.430
LAURA DREYFUSS: I'll start.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.500
I had a line that I
used to love that we

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.200
had to cut at second stage.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.850
And it was basically
commenting on how

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.690
my mother is now
acting different

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.060
once Connor has passed away.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.970
And I said, she
likes you being here.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.000
You remind her what it's like.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.680
But it's different, it's
better than how it used to be.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.300
And then Evan says
this beautiful line

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.700
about how I think that's what
happens when people leave.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.720
You just remember them
how they used to be.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.782
And I just loved
that line so much.

00:14:22.782 --> 00:14:25.240
And that was one of my favorite
things, my favorite scenes.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.198
STEVEN LEVENSON: That
was my favorite scene too

00:14:27.198 --> 00:14:27.850
It really was.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.490
It was.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.630
That was the hardest--

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.296
I literally from the
beginning was like,

00:14:33.296 --> 00:14:35.463
I'll cut anything in the
show except for that scene.

00:14:35.463 --> 00:14:36.712
It was just this little scene.

00:14:36.712 --> 00:14:37.930
But it was really beautiful.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.116
But it just didn't really--

00:14:40.116 --> 00:14:41.740
you realize when you
work on a musical,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.490
there are so many
strange technical--

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.741
it had to go for a very
technical reason that was just

00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:50.198
basically like we needed to
get to the end of the first act

00:14:50.198 --> 00:14:50.760
sooner.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.380
And it's so crushing.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.740
By the end of five years
of working on something,

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.915
you've killed every one
of your darlings for sure.

00:15:01.915 --> 00:15:03.290
Because also, as
the book writer,

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.270
your job is sort of like,
if it's better in a song,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.110
it should be a song.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.450
So a lot of it is like
your favorite stuff

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.620
goes away or becomes a song.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.740
MICHAEL PARK: I missed
in the bedroom--

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.540
sorry, Kristolyn-- "In
the Bedroom Down the Hall"

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.880
was a song that the two
moms sang to each other.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.604
They were sitting in their
respective sons bedrooms

00:15:23.604 --> 00:15:24.520
and missing them both.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.420
And they had this
beautiful duet together.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.120
And it was a tear-jerker for me.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.382
That's what I miss.

00:15:31.382 --> 00:15:33.340
BEN FRIED: Kristolyn,
you were poised to speak.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.330
KRISTOLYN LLOYD:
I realized what I

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.790
was about to say isn't so
much about missing something

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.490
that's changed.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.010
So maybe you'll get
to the question of,

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.343
what do you like that's changed?

00:15:41.535 --> 00:15:44.554
BEN FRIED: Kristolyn, what
would you like that's changed?

00:15:44.554 --> 00:15:45.970
KRISTOLYN LLOYD:
Well, I, for one,

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.440
have not been with
it for five years.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.530
I was brought on after Irena, so
I like that they changed that.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.250
BEN FRIED: As do I.
It means you're here.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.000
KRISTOLYN LLOYD: I was
very happy to join.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.680
And they also brought some
stuff in for the character

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.910
and for the show that wasn't
there at second stage.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.920
They brought it to Broadway,
which was really exciting.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:14.020
For Alana, she was not as
essential to the revealing

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.500
of everything that happens
in the end as she is now.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.190
And so I really liked that
they gave her character not so

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.730
much of this ensemble feel,
that our characters kind of took

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.920
over when they got rid
of the student body.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:32.170
But they made her an essential
part of the storytelling,

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.781
which was exciting for me.

00:16:34.781 --> 00:16:36.280
BEN FRIED: No, but
at the same time,

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.850
your character has this amazing
arc, where super-achiever who

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.410
seems to have
everything behind her,

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.912
but reveals a depth
that's not obvious.

00:16:43.912 --> 00:16:46.120
KRISTOLYN LLOYD: I love that
you said super-achiever.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.870
I think in the beginning
I was very scared

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.960
of being this villain.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.620
And I have had a
lot of experiences

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.654
with being a villain in a show
and the writers being like,

00:16:53.654 --> 00:16:55.820
we don't really care about
the arc at the end of it.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.892
And I'm like, but every
character's arc matters.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.350
And that's one of
the things that I

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.780
love about working with
Steven, Benj, Justin, and Mike

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.980
[? Grief. ?] They
gave her an arc.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.790
They gave her a final thing in
the end that kind of exposed

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.170
why she does what she does.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.730
They did it with Jared as well.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.369
And not a lot of writers
will take the time

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.730
to put some kind of ending
or cap or understanding

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.099
on people that are
essential to this plot.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:22.630
Because then, you
walk away thinking

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.040
that they are the
villains, which

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.450
is not the case in the show.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.670
No one is.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.815
BEN FRIED: I completely
agree with you.

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:31.690
I'm lucky enough to have
seen the show twice.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.140
One of the most amazing things
is that there are no villains.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.160
Everyone is relatable.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.270
Everyone is real.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.740
Everyone is someone whose
shoes you could walk in.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.262
And that's so much better.

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:45.220
Villains are cartoon
characters, because no one

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.430
is purely unalloyed--
basically unalloyed evil.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.020
There might be some exceptions,
if you know what I mean.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.840
Anyway, so thank you
for bringing that up.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.130
While you have the mic,
I was curious about--

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.630
you came a little
later to the show,

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.100
as you pointed out as your
character was developed.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.390
What was that like joining?

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.320
Was the crew already
pretty tight?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.034
I'm not asking you to rat out
your colleagues or anything

00:18:08.034 --> 00:18:08.250
like that.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:08.680
KRISTOLYN LLOYD: Of course not.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.480
It's a really good
group of people.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.604
And you enter a project
with trepidation.

00:18:14.604 --> 00:18:16.270
Because you don't
know where you fit in.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.500
You don't know what role
you play amongst the group.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.000
It all kind of works
out in the end.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.820
And who's supposed to be
there is going to be there.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.861
And what's supposed to
happen is going to happen.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.420
The process was a lot.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.930
Because I had to do so much in
such a short amount of time.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.810
I don't know if I'm
speaking for you correctly,

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.890
but Stacey says at
one point that Alana

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.410
was one of the most rewritten
characters in the show.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.840
And so when I showed
up, it was really

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.690
great to collaborate
with the creative team

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.106
and to be able in rehearsals
to be like, OK, give me notes.

00:18:51.106 --> 00:18:52.730
And then in some
rehearsals to be like,

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.190
I need you to leave me
alone, so I can figure out

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.430
something for you.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.390
And so I found that
it was a lot of work.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.210
But I, at one point, was
able to completely trust

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.560
that they were going to let
the story serve the character

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.541
and the character
serve the story.

00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:10.790
BEN FRIED: On the subject
of joining the cast somewhat

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.140
later, Taylor, you're the
newest member of the cast.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.010
By the way, congratulations on
a great run in "Hello, Dolly!"

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.100
with Bette Midler.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.780
Absolutely awesome.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.300
So what has this transition
been like for you

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.180
and the onboarding, as we
would call it here, been like?

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.780
TAYLOR TRESNCH: Terrible.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.655
WILL ROLAND: We call it
a put in on Broadway.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.890
TAYLOR TRESNCH: It's
been truly magical.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.140
To be the-- as
Kristolyn experienced--

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.440
to be the one person who is sort
of thrown into this preexisting

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.930
machine is very scary.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.820
But everyone could
not have been more

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.594
open-hearted and
supportive and kind.

00:19:46.594 --> 00:19:49.010
And I just loved the show so
much the first time I saw it.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.460
So I feel very lucky to
be saying these words.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.040
BEN FRIED: So while
you have the mic,

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.450
you did take over from two--

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.640
from Ben and from Noah.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.640
And they each brought
their own style.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.250
What did you bring to
make Evan your own?

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.070
And how did you
think about that?

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.810
Can I share one
little observation?

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.440
Again, I might be a
terrible audience member.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.940
One small thing you did that
really touched me was, I think,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.176
when Connor pushes you
over in the beginning,

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:18.800
there was this bit where you go
and grab the back of your shirt

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.355
and pull it down.

00:20:20.355 --> 00:20:21.980
And maybe that was
just a natural thing

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.600
that you do because you'd been
pushed down on the ground,

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.770
and you don't want
people to see no Krakatoa

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.420
or anything like that.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.230
But I thought that
it was somehow

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.940
a bit of a tell into
the character that

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.820
kind of his awkwardness,
and his trying to hide,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.740
and just wanting to straighten
himself up, it seemed so real.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.380
And I don't know if that was
a conscious thing that you did

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.170
or something like that.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.740
But I thought that that was an
element of bringing something

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.450
to the character that
I hadn't seen before.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.750
TAYLOR TRESNCH: I would love
to take credit for that.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.050
But that's a very specific
note from our director

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:55.114
and our movement director.

00:20:55.114 --> 00:20:56.780
I kept not doing it,
and they were like,

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.710
pull your shirt down!

00:21:00.855 --> 00:21:02.650
So the praise goes to them.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.910
It is such a beautiful
detail of him just

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.670
trying to cover up and hide.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.377
So I don't bring
anything interesting.

00:21:10.377 --> 00:21:12.710
BEN FRIED: Sorry, I killed
my question, which was what--

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.835
TAYLOR TRESNCH: I would
say I bring gorgeous looks.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:22.419
No, I think we're all different
people and different actors.

00:21:22.419 --> 00:21:23.960
Without even having
to think about it

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.760
or make a conscious decision,
we all make it a different Evan.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.530
BEN FRIED: I had a
transitional question

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.410
on that same subject for which
I mentioned to you and Laura

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.630
a little earlier, which was that
the first time I saw the show--

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.170
am I allowed to give spoilers?

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.370
No, yes, a little?

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.860
I'll skirt the spoiler.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.260
So let's just say at the end of
the final scene, the first time

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.735
I saw it--

00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:51.860
WILL ROLAND: Everyone dies.

00:21:55.744 --> 00:21:57.160
BEN FRIED: You
don't need me here.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.180
So I left thinking it was
a very bittersweet moment.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.980
There is closure,
but these people

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.400
are done with each other.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.790
And when I saw it
Wednesday I thought-- well,

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.540
I didn't think, oh,
sunshine and unicorns.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.677
I did think maybe they'll
talk to each other again.

00:22:13.677 --> 00:22:15.260
And I felt like maybe
the relationship

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.850
isn't completely dead.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.320
And I was wondering
that could just

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.460
because I'm a terrible
audience member

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.790
and I got something wrong.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.760
But is that an
element of something

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.260
that is-- and
maybe for Laura, is

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.690
this a difference between
working with Taylor

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.040
and working with others.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.587
Is it just something else?

00:22:31.587 --> 00:22:33.920
LAURA DREYFUSS: Like I said,
it depends on show to show.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.330
But I think there's this really
sad, heartbreaking quality

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.430
to the scene no matter what.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.990
Just because for
her own self-worth,

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.760
there can be no continuation
of the relationship.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.810
But that doesn't mean that
there isn't a want for that.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.382
And I think that
it just reflects

00:22:50.382 --> 00:22:52.340
on the complicated nature
of their relationship

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.552
and how things worked out.

00:22:55.552 --> 00:22:57.260
But I think that the
most important thing

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.370
is that we know that they
are both OK, in a way,

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:02.510
and that there's hope.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:06.560
And yeah, I would like
to think that that's what

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.910
people take away at the end.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.632
BEN FRIED: Heavy stuff.

00:23:12.632 --> 00:23:13.840
LAURA DREYFUSS: And they die.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:25.310
BEN FRIED: On the subject
of heavy stuff, Will,

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.280
there's this line very
early in the play.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.140
You describe Connor as
very school-shooter chic.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.950
And obviously, given recent
events, there's an immediacy.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.950
I thought I heard a kind
of gasp in the audience

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:40.370
on Wednesday night
when you said that.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.990
Did you think about
changing the line?

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.899
Did you think about delivering
the line differently?

00:23:44.899 --> 00:23:46.940
STEVEN LEVENSON: Funny
that should bring that up.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.250
BEN FRIED: What is your process
been given what's happened?

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.666
WILL ROLAND: Well,
it's definitely

00:23:50.666 --> 00:23:52.244
been a sort of collaboration.

00:23:52.244 --> 00:23:53.660
It's been a
conversation, I should

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.634
say, between Steven, myself,
Stacey, our producer--

00:23:56.634 --> 00:23:58.550
STEVEN LEVENSON: And
that line has always been

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:03.440
in there, for four
years probably.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.056
WILL ROLAND: I think throughout
the course of the play,

00:24:06.056 --> 00:24:07.430
Jared, the character
that I play,

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:14.720
says a lot of coarse,
very honest dialogue.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.350
It reminds me of things that I
might have said when I was 17

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.260
and didn't really realize
the power of the speech.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.860
And so, yeah, that line at
the beginning has always--

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.270
certain folks have
come up to me,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.550
like, I don't know
if you can say that.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:32.520
Because it sort of gets under
people's skin a little bit,

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.450
and because we look at it
with so much more context

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.160
and from the sort of
world that we live in.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.790
But I think what we talked
about is what has changed.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.930
The play lives in
a different world

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.590
than it did eight weeks ago.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.510
And the play has not changed,
but the world has changed.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:03.290
And so we have to figure
out what does this say now.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.900
And I think in the
end, we decided

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.450
it's important to have this
dialogue be true and be

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.380
real and let this thing move
through time in that way

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.020
and let people have those
reactions when things are

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.860
raw and fresh, I think, so
that we can examine the way

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.780
that we speak and also create
the situation for Connor.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.620
Then the brief glimpses
we get of Connor's life--

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.820
people are awful to
him in different ways,

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:36.376
either through neglect
or sort of mean

00:25:36.376 --> 00:25:38.000
or somewhat abusive
things towards him.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.770
And then he isn't
understood by people.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:44.660
And so I think it's a really
valuable moment for us

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.650
to get inside of what
people think of this boy.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.630
And then when we,
as the audience,

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.730
try to imagine what he was like
after he has killed himself.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.730
Sorry, that's a spoiler,
but it's the first five

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.620
minutes of the play.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.900
And after he's killed
himself, everyone

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.520
starts to imagine
him their own way.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.880
And I think in a
brilliant way, we all

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.670
are already doing that
before he has taken his life.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.700
We're projecting onto him who
he is, what we think he is,

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.580
how he should act,
and what he should do.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.780
STEVEN LEVENSON: It's
a really tricky--

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.080
we had a lot of back and
forth last week about this.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.330
And it's interesting,
because from the very, very

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.720
first reading, people told
me to change the line.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.550
It's never not been disturbing.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.620
The character is
glib, but I don't

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.910
want the show to be glib,
if that makes sense.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:41.069
And the honesty of
that character, I

00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:42.860
think that is what the
character would say.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.200
And I went really back
and forth on this.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.699
Because part of me
just doesn't want

00:26:49.699 --> 00:26:53.840
to pull the audience too much
out of what they're watching.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.240
So they start to think,
oh, that's interesting

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.170
that they said that.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.249
Am I upset about that?

00:26:58.249 --> 00:27:00.290
I wonder if they wrote
that before this happened.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.165
You know what I mean?

00:27:01.165 --> 00:27:02.900
I don't want that to start.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.900
But I also feel like part
of what we're showing

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.700
is a generation that is
desensitized in a lot of ways

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.150
to these things and
also that uses humor

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.630
to try to cope with the trauma
of knowing how ubiquitous this

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.890
is.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.900
And like you said,
in high school,

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.690
people say crazy,
terrible things

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:28.335
that really are meant to cover
up their fear of these things.

00:27:28.335 --> 00:27:29.210
You know what I mean?

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.990
So I felt like it was
important partly as--

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.550
this sounds really
overblown-- but as

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:37.430
a document of our
time, which is what

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.710
all art is in some respect.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.320
That it was important to keep
this and show that this is

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.540
the time that we're living in.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.080
BEN FRIED: So on the subject
of how we communicate,

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.610
Michael, for you, a question.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.260
I thought that
your character has

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.080
this amazing moment in
the "To Break in a Glove"

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.930
song, where in
just one song, you

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.170
get such a view into his
character and the relationship

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.999
he didn't have with his
son, his need for it,

00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:05.790
and all the stuff that's
missing in someone

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.585
who's otherwise cut from the
image of the stoic father

00:28:09.585 --> 00:28:10.085
man-type.

00:28:12.414 --> 00:28:14.080
I'm trying to turn
this into a question.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.450
I understand you're
a father as well.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:24.630
And I'm wondering how you
think about parenting has been

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.239
influenced by the
role or what you

00:28:26.239 --> 00:28:28.530
bring to the role has and
influenced by your experience

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.030
as a parent.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.890
MICHAEL PARK: I talk to a lot
of kids, obviously, in the stage

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.260
door.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.682
The number one thing they say
is, this show and your role

00:28:40.682 --> 00:28:43.140
makes me want to have a better
relationship with my father.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.184
And I think that's
really important.

00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:47.100
I don't know if that's
what you set out to do.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.189
But it's reaching a lot of kids.

00:28:49.189 --> 00:28:50.730
But I'll tell you
for me personally--

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.339
and I say this a lot--

00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:53.130
I have three kids--

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.260
20-year-old, 18, 13, who's
right in the middle of it.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.450
And she's giving it to us.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.950
So I can honestly tell you--

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.406
BEN FRIED: I have a
15-year-old too, so, yeah.

00:29:04.406 --> 00:29:06.500
MICHAEL PARK: Whoo, it's tough.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.070
But I've got to
tell you, it really

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.230
has opened the door to
communication that I never

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.210
thought was possible.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.310
My dad wasn't the most overt
person in the world either.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:19.350
But it was interesting
kind of tiptoeing

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.760
around him and his moods.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.920
And now my kids know immediately
that they can come to me.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.070
And it's never been so good
really through this mire

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:33.660
that Larry Murphy
has to go through

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.070
to reach someone who
is actually looking

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.969
for the same exact thing that
he's looking for, in a way.

00:29:40.969 --> 00:29:42.510
And that's what "To
Break in a Glove"

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.280
is really about--
the fact that they

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.760
are meeting on the
same ground and not

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.180
really reaching each other,
but reaching each other.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:56.440
And I feel that every adolescent
is looking for that too.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.319
And what I tell the kids at
the stage door a lot of times,

00:29:59.319 --> 00:30:01.110
like, I have no idea
how to talk to my dad.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.810
I say, well, have you tried
to talk to him at his level?

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:04.560
I mean, seriously?

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.893
Hey, dad, what are you watching?

00:30:05.893 --> 00:30:06.450
Fox News.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.490
OK.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.490
Well, what's Hannity up to?

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.160
Just ask him a
question about him.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.230
As much as you
would like to think

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.540
you want him to be
in your life and ask

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.725
you questions about you.

00:30:19.725 --> 00:30:25.080
For sure, you should
be asking him maybe

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.250
what did you do today?

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.570
Those are great shoes.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:34.500
Anything to get into his world
for a little bit or his orbit.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.520
So that's basically
what it's all about.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.816
The communication is fantastic
with my children now.

00:30:39.816 --> 00:30:40.440
Thanks, Steven.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.540
BEN FRIED: Wow.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.420
Hey, so on the subject
of communication--

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.890
thank you for the segue--

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.620
social media is this fact.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.780
It's almost another
character in the play.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.710
And happy to see that YouTube
plays a part in that as well.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.210
Go YouTube.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.980
STEVEN LEVENSON: That
was a really good buy.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.646
That was a good buy
you guys made there.

00:31:06.122 --> 00:31:07.830
BEN FRIED: I know who
writes my paycheck.

00:31:11.425 --> 00:31:13.810
But also, the way
that the production

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.185
has used social media and
YouTube to bring fans together.

00:31:16.185 --> 00:31:17.893
And, Michael, you
talked about connecting

00:31:17.893 --> 00:31:19.204
with fans at the stage door.

00:31:19.204 --> 00:31:20.620
But it seems to
me like the things

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.990
that you've done through
YouTube and social media

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.270
to connect with fans opened
up a new chapter on what's

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:29.710
possible in theater in
terms of promoting things.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.430
I think we're going to
play a brief video from one

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:37.510
of these fan-sourced collages
that the production has

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:38.660
put together.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.160
Yes?

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.680
Are we going to do that?

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.030
[MUSIC - "YOU WILL BE FOUND"]

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.352
WILL ROLAND: It's the
virtual choir, everybody.

00:32:10.352 --> 00:32:12.810
BEN FRIED: The whole video is
about 5 and 1/2 minutes long.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.260
And I recommend it on YouTube.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.860
STEVEN LEVENSON:
Have you seen it?

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.960
BEN FRIED: You said it.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.360
I think we're going to have
a couple more of my questions

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.760
before we move to
audience questions.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.650
So maybe one or two
more questions of mine.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.620
And then for the audience,
please queue up behind the mics

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.640
that are here in the aisles.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.280
And if you start
queuing up now while I

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.696
give you cover time with a
question or two, we'll be good.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.210
So for all of you, do you
have a favorite moment

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.543
in the play for each one of you?

00:32:40.543 --> 00:32:44.170
Is there one favorite
moment scene, something?

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:44.670
Taylor?

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.490
TAYLOR TRESNCH: Gosh, it
changes every night certainly.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.400
I really love
"Anybody Have a Map?"

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.150
The song the moms
sing up the top.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:58.560
It's hard for me to
not just rock out.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.800
That's my final answer.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.000
LAURA DREYFUSS: I always go
between "If I Could Tell Her"

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.470
or probably the orchard scene.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.579
I just really love
those moments.

00:33:10.579 --> 00:33:12.620
KRISTOLYN LLOYD: I like
"Waving Through a Window"

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:17.270
because we all love to be
backstage riffing and doing

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.820
our own runs and
harmonies to it.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.620
And sometimes,
Evan has been like,

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.400
we can hear you backstage.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.980
Yeah, we can hear you backstage.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.840
That's fun.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.790
WILL ROLAND: My
favorite is Evan has

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.440
this line in the second act.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.360
He says something--

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.815
Connor was really lucky to
have a dad who-- what'd he say?

00:33:34.815 --> 00:33:37.190
TAYLOR TRESNCH: Cared so much
about taking care of stuff.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.357
WILL ROLAND: Who cared so much
about taking care of stuff.

00:33:41.357 --> 00:33:43.190
I think it's a really
revealing moment where

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.950
these two boys are so
similar and yet so different.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.860
And I loved that line a lot.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.620
It was very heavy.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.200
Good work, Steven.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.760
MICHAEL PARK: I like
playing air cello with Adele

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.080
during "Sincerely Me."

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.420
I play a mean air cello.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.450
"Sincerely Me" is really
one of my favorite songs.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.420
STEVEN LEVENSON: I
have two moments.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:10.070
I like all of it, and I like
everyone in the show so much.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.639
There's a scene in the second
act with Connor and Evan

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.469
that I love the design of it.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.610
It's sort of the lowest moment
for Evan or, up to that point,

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:23.480
the lowest moment for Evan.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.580
I love what the actors that
we have bring to that scene.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.344
And I always love "Words
Fail" in the second act.

00:34:31.344 --> 00:34:32.719
LAURA DREYFUSS:
It's my favorite.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:37.250
STEVEN LEVENSON: In DC, I would
leave the show for a while

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.070
in the second act, because I
was like, I know what happens.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.199
But then I would
always come back

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.929
at that moment,
because I just loved--

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.699
because every actor
that does it--

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.710
because we've seen
a couple now--

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.810
brings something new.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.449
It's just such a raw
and painful moment.

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:55.550
And Michael Greif's
staging of it

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:59.180
is so simple and
spare and perfect.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.190
BEN FRIED: I agree with
all of you, by the way,

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.322
not that that matters.

00:35:02.322 --> 00:35:03.530
Audience members are cued up.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.863
Why don't we start hearing them.

00:35:04.863 --> 00:35:07.195
We'll bounce back and forth
across mics with questions.

00:35:07.195 --> 00:35:09.320
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question for the entire cast.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.300
I know that throughout
the play, it

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.180
crosses a very large
emotional spectrum.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.930
There's highs, there's lows.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.569
Do you have a
process or something

00:35:17.569 --> 00:35:19.110
that you go through
before every show

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.040
to dig deep and be able to
hit all those every night?

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.020
WILL ROLAND: I'll
hop in on that.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.950
What's actually funny is I think
that we almost do the opposite.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:36.857
We try to get together and make
each other laugh a little bit

00:35:36.857 --> 00:35:38.190
and look each other in the eyes.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.920
Because there are
some moments where

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.410
we're terrible to
each other on stage.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.350
We're mean, we're
course, and uncaring.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.920
And those are the
things that Steven

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.030
has written so
beautifully that we

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.690
can have those moments onstage
and those take us there.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:58.060
Because as long as you can live
in that reality, it gets there.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.580
So I think most of
our prep time is

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:04.524
spent taking care of one another
and coming up from that place.

00:36:04.524 --> 00:36:05.940
MICHAEL PARK: It's
always when I'm

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:10.680
most desensitized to what I'm
about to go through that I

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.420
go through it the hardest.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.740
It's uncanny that way.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.826
Do you feel the same way?

00:36:15.826 --> 00:36:17.700
KRISTOLYN LLOYD: You
have to trick your body.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:22.080
I don't like to get into
my costume until places.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.040
And that's not fun for my
stage manager sometimes.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.360
But I like to trick my body.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.026
I don't want it to
know it's about to go

00:36:29.026 --> 00:36:30.660
through this emotional journey.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.830
And so we stand backstage.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:33.540
And we crack jokes.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.910
Because we have to be good
to each other offstage

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.325
as much as possible.

00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:39.780
One, because we're a tiny cast.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.030
And there's not a lot of
people to rotate through when

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.600
you're sick of each other.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.300
So it's like a family.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.430
It's like living in a
compound with your family.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.390
And you show up everyday
at the same time,

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.520
and you have to be really
cool to each other.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.880
LAURA DREYFUSS: And I think
also, emotionally, that's

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.340
why we're able to do so
much with each other because

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.800
of this deep love that we
all have for one another.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:04.230
And that inspires all of the
emotional requirements needed

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.930
for this show.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.200
TAYLOR TRESNCH: The writing
too does the heavy lifting.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.580
There's nothing
really to work up

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.925
for if you just listen to
what's going on onstage.

00:37:15.925 --> 00:37:16.800
BEN FRIED: I'm sorry.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.800
I'm not supposed to be
asking questions anymore.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.600
But I'd like to ask the mirror
image question, which is, how

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.820
do you come down off of that?

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.580
There are gallons of
tears in that theater

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.470
at the end of that show.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:30.910
I see what looked like
tears in the cast.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.550
It was such heavy stuff.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.400
How do you come down from that?

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.210
Or is it just I didn't
understand, someone

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.460
didn't tell me what acting is?

00:37:39.832 --> 00:37:41.790
LAURA DREYFUSS: We
literally crack jokes after.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:42.740
We get off stage
and immediately--

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:43.500
WILL ROLAND: Michael
and I like to share

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.910
a beer at the end of the play.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:46.770
And then I take the train home.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.270
I have about a 45 minute
ride to Park Slope.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.990
And it's very
calming and relaxing.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.980
I listen to a podcast sometimes.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.790
No, it is.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:00.670
It's very intense.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:01.890
It's very heavy.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:03.060
It's about decompressing.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.050
And personally, I don't like
to go out the stage door

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:07.740
and meet fans.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.590
Because I feel like I'm
too sensitive and raw.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.340
And someone's going
to say something to me

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.965
and I'm going to take
it the wrong way.

00:38:14.965 --> 00:38:17.130
So all I want to do is
put my big headphones on

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.945
and get on the
train and go home.

00:38:19.945 --> 00:38:20.820
BEN FRIED: Kristolyn.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.236
KRISTOLYN LLOYD:
I'm the opposite.

00:38:22.236 --> 00:38:23.220
I don't take the train.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.000
And I learned very
early on that I play 17.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.510
And when I get off that
stage, I don't want

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.640
to be seen as a 17-year-old.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.470
But I look very young.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.967
And I found that when I
would get on the train,

00:38:41.967 --> 00:38:44.300
there were a couple of times
I got in fights with people

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.110
on the train.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:48.450
I'm also a very
mouthy, tough girl.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:50.890
And so I find that I
need to take a car home.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.902
And I need to not
be around people

00:38:52.902 --> 00:38:54.110
after I'm done with the show.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.030
Because we did do a
lot of heavy lifting,

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.070
and it's not always
fun to watch somebody

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.770
go through that journey
of losing everything

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:03.624
that they had worked so hard to
get or not worked hard to get.

00:39:03.624 --> 00:39:04.790
It just fell into their lap.

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:06.470
TAYLOR TRESNCH: Ow.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.420
KRISTOLYN LLOYD: I
mean your character.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:16.360
After we finish, it's a muscle.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.200
You turn it off.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.020
Laura and I will
run around upstairs.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.030
We'll listen to rap
songs and Beyonce

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.380
and dance around in our
underwear with Jennifer Laura

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:24.880
Thompson.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.020
We just have to.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.190
It's necessary.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.540
And don't take the train home.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.230
You're welcome.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.197
BEN FRIED: I think we have
another audience question.

00:39:37.197 --> 00:39:39.030
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming to chat with us.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.960
I loved the show.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.280
My question is about process.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.079
And you mentioned that
you have a decision

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:46.370
to make around whether you
keep a line in the show that

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:48.410
could be sensitive,
whether you take it out.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.650
After opening night on Broadway
when previews are done,

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.900
how much can you change,
and in what context?

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.860
STEVEN LEVENSON: That's
actually a good question.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.480
We can change stuff.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.530
It's hard to rehearse.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.140
WILL ROLAND: You're
allowed to change anything.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.010
And because of the unions, it's
very expensive to rehearse.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.140
And I don't think you're
allowed to change things

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.340
without having rehearsal.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.710
So there is a financial
incentive not to,

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:14.929
but you could.

00:40:14.929 --> 00:40:16.470
STEVEN LEVENSON: I
changed something.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.280
Like two weeks ago,
I changed a line.

00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:22.380
MICHAEL PARK: When the
rhythm is screwed up

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.880
after you've been doing
something for four years,

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.950
and you come in, just take
a word out, just a word.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:27.825
STEVEN LEVENSON: That's
literally what it is.

00:40:27.991 --> 00:40:29.740
MICHAEL PARK: For about
a week and a half,

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.190
it ruined the
entire line for me.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.890
STEVEN LEVENSON: When I go, I
have a running list of things

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:37.110
I would like to change.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.490
It's terrible.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.260
That's why it's sometimes
hard to go back.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.110
Because it's like, I wish I
had-- you know what I mean?

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.720
I catch these things.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.720
WILL ROLAND: Look for
those changes on the tour.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.816
STEVEN LEVENSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:49.816 --> 00:40:50.940
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.130
STEVEN LEVENSON: Thanks.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.630
AUDIENCE: The preface
to my question

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.310
is going to sound
like a criticism,

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:57.747
but I promise it's not.

00:40:57.747 --> 00:40:59.080
STEVEN LEVENSON: I'm so excited.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.350
AUDIENCE: So my question
is about the balance

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:05.580
between what your vision
is and what you have

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.590
to work with with the actors.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.440
When I saw it, I was
sitting in the center

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.420
of the last row in the balcony.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.280
And there's one scene--

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.850
I don't know what it was--

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.750
and everyone is lined
up on the back in a row.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.590
And then like six foot five
tall Connor in the corner

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.620
is not lit up and
looks like Slender Man.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.576
And for me, it was
very distracting.

00:41:27.576 --> 00:41:29.700
But obviously, there's
nothing you can do about it.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.440
You can't shrink
him to the height

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.320
of the rest of the actors.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.900
So I was wondering, there's
nothing you can do about it,

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.730
but what is the balance
between, oh, there's

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.310
an actor that's more comfortable
doing this versus what

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.335
we had originally wanted?

00:41:46.335 --> 00:41:47.760
We wanted to block it this way.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.460
But we can't, because
these two people--

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.520
stuff like that.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.870
STEVEN LEVENSON: It's
a great question.

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.930
It's one of the great challenges
and also the joys, I think,

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.440
of dramatic writing
is that you have

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.150
these people that you have to--

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.920
you can't just write a
character and write a novel

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.050
and that's what it is.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.560
What you write is really just
the first part of the process.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:18.260
And I love writing with
actors and around actors.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.980
And I feel like a
lot of this show

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.980
is written around
these people on stage.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.870
And then hopefully, for me--
and I don't know if this answers

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:32.150
your question exactly-- but I
guess I think the more specific

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.819
you can be for those actors--

00:42:33.819 --> 00:42:35.360
And Benj and Justin
are very similar.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.943
There are vocal parts
in the show that

00:42:36.943 --> 00:42:39.560
are because the actors that
originated these roles could

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.020
sing those parts.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:46.280
And I hope that the specificity
of those characters,

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.650
because they're molded
onto that person,

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:52.280
are, therefore, that
much sharper and easier

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.530
to play for future actors.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.750
Because it's so specific.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:56.750
Do you know what I mean?

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.490
So much of the show
is written and thought

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:02.750
about around those actors.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.510
It's weird when I
realize that where

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.020
you sit in the theater matters.

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.080
And what night of the
week you come matters.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.572
And that's the kind of
thing that, as a writer,

00:43:14.572 --> 00:43:15.780
that can keep me up at night.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.960
You know what I mean?

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.240
There is something very
comforting about film and TV,

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.240
where you're in the editing
room, and it's like,

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.410
we are fixing this
moment, and it's there.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.320
You know what I mean?

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.422
So that's interesting.

00:43:27.422 --> 00:43:29.630
BEN FRIED: I think we have
time for two more audience

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.349
questions, just as an FYI.

00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:32.390
AUDIENCE: Made it, great.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:34.100
OK, huge fan.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.470
Saw the show four times,
changed a flight to be here.

00:43:39.336 --> 00:43:40.679
STEVEN LEVENSON: Welcome.

00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:42.470
AUDIENCE: And I'm
probably going to miss it

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:43.594
because it's raining a lot.

00:43:43.594 --> 00:43:45.650
But that's fine, worth it.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.160
So one thing that I think is
so wonderful about this show

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.600
that you guys
touched on before is

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.460
how all of the characters
in the ensemble

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.614
have a full narrative arc and
some really deep humanity.

00:43:55.614 --> 00:43:57.530
One of my favorite scenes
is when Larry Murphy

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.300
is looking around at
all the social media

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.210
and finally collapses under
the weight of his son's death.

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:05.690
What do you think are some
of those other more nuanced

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.680
moments that help inform your
character to any of the actors

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.480
or that you were thinking
of when you wrote the book?

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.720
STEVEN LEVENSON: Well, I do
know we were very careful.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.720
And a lot of the rewrites
that happened over the years

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.180
were about sharpening
everybody's arc

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.430
and making it clear.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:29.714
Like for instance, with
Larry, I think it was in DC,

00:44:29.714 --> 00:44:31.880
we realized we loved that
moment that you're talking

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.190
about where he breaks down.

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.850
And then you start
to think, well,

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.350
'are we earning that?' is it
exactly as powerful as it could

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:39.580
be?

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.079
And then we actually
started to work

00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:42.410
backwards from that moment.

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:44.600
And we were like, you know
what, we're setting up

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.240
the idea that Larry is having
a lot of trouble expressing

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:47.942
his grief.

00:44:47.942 --> 00:44:49.400
But in certain
moments, he actually

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.826
seems to be grieving openly.

00:44:51.826 --> 00:44:54.200
So we were like, we have to
sharpen it and make it really

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.090
clear that that's his dilemma.

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:58.700
And then the payoff
is that moment.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.100
Do you know what I mean?

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.660
As writers, it's
a lot about sort

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.260
of following your instincts
as far as they'll take you.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.360
And then putting on
your analytic brain

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:12.210
and being like, what's
the math of this moment?

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:15.620
Also Alana, we want
her to get to a moment

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.470
where she exposes the fact
that she's really lonely

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:20.659
and feels a kind
of invisibility.

00:45:20.659 --> 00:45:22.700
And then it was like,
well, let's work backwards.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.830
Where do you start
with that arc?

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:26.165
So it's a lot of that actually.

00:45:26.165 --> 00:45:28.040
LAURA DREYFUSS: We also
have a really great--

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.380
to the credit of
our creative team--

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.760
wonderful communication and
collaboration with them.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.400
And so we, as actors, felt like
we had the ability to speak up

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:42.860
and say, I'm not
getting from A to C.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.410
Just for example, when
I go from meeting--

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:50.690
basically, I kiss Evan at
this point in the show.

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:54.090
And it went from a place
of really not liking him.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.360
And so they were little
things in "You Will Be Found"

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.420
specifically, where the audience
might not even be noticing it.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.280
But it's stuff
where I'm clocking

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.540
a lot of the journey
of his beautiful speech

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.180
and then realizing what
he's actually giving me

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.660
and my family, which then
leads me to want to kiss him.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.734
And to be able to
communicate with Michael

00:46:13.734 --> 00:46:15.900
Greif, our director, and
Steven, and Benj and Justin

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.613
about what we can do to
help make that easier.

00:46:20.613 --> 00:46:22.820
AUDIENCE: Thanks, guys.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.710
BEN FRIED: Last
audience question, sir.

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:26.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys for being here.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.930
Steven, I have a
question for you.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:31.400
You talked about how
you wrote initially

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.060
as if this were a play.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:37.820
And I thought the show was
really beautifully structured.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.962
Can you talk a little
bit about-- you

00:46:39.962 --> 00:46:41.420
were kind of talking
about it now--

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.670
but how did you initially
think about the structure?

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:46.550
And then when you're
making these changes,

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:50.360
how do you trust those changes
when the show is actually up

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.430
and you need to
have a show tonight?

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:56.980
STEVEN LEVENSON: Yeah,
it's definitely a process.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.240
I've written plays before.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.730
And plays are really a
different animal than musicals.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.540
I feel like when I write
a play and I read it,

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.075
I kind of know what it is.

00:47:07.075 --> 00:47:09.200
And when we do it, it's
going to be basically that.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.010
But with a musical, what
you have on the page

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.890
and what comes out
on stage is radically

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.090
different for some reason.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:19.880
And you kind of never
know what you have

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.770
until it's on its feet.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.890
And that was certainly
true with this show.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.810
And the more readings
we did and the more

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:30.950
workshops, and
then productions--

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.440
the thing that we
learned could guide us

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.940
that we learned
somewhat early on

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:41.810
was the show works best when
we understand exactly why Evan

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:43.550
is doing what he's doing.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:47.419
That has to be our
guiding principle.

00:47:47.419 --> 00:47:48.710
Evan is making these decisions.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.190
Why is he making
those decisions?

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:53.660
And also allowing him
to make those decisions.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.740
In earlier drafts, we struggled
a lot with how likeable

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.340
to make Evan.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.710
And we were very
scared that if he

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:02.930
was too proactive in
trying to get what he

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:04.550
wanted that we would hate him.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.290
And so we we've
kind of pussyfooted

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.100
around a lot in some
of the earlier drafts

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.180
and had more things
happen to him.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.100
So for instance, in
really early drafts--

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.990
or not even that early--

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:18.360
Alana started the
Connor project.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.280
And then in another draft, Jared
released the email at the end.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.580
And we kind of kept upping
the ante for ourselves.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.350
We were like, what
can we get away with?

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:30.080
Because we learned
that audiences just

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:34.280
needed to understand the why
and the emotional why of what

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:34.910
Evan is doing.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:36.856
And if they did, they
were on the ride,

00:48:36.856 --> 00:48:37.980
and they were following it.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.400
And as soon as you
stop knowing why

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.530
Evan's doing what
he's doing, you

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:44.180
start to lose
track of the story.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.460
And it just becomes a muddle.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.850
So that became the
structuring principle.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:54.950
How is Evan moving this story
forward to get what he wants?

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.200
And what are the complications
that are coming up?

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:05.160
So the structure formed
in process, weirdly.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.120
And it became a lot about
getting rid of the things that

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.250
were in the way of that.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:13.070
BEN FRIED: From
each of you, I would

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:15.080
love to hear if
there's one thing you

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.300
want the audience to--

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.080
maybe there's not one
thing-- but is there

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.540
one thing you want the audience
to walk away with or hold

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:24.960
with after they've
seen the show?

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.290
TAYLOR TRESNCH:
Don't start with me.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:29.480
WILL ROLAND: I'll start.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:34.370
For me, I hope that
people will reconsider

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:38.120
the ways in which they allow
social media to affect them.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.591
I think it's really easy to
just glance at our phones.

00:49:40.591 --> 00:49:42.590
And you guys have heard
me say this 1,000 times.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:43.089
I'm sorry.

00:49:43.089 --> 00:49:46.120
But I feel like it's
the message of the show.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.120
We glance at our phones.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.453
And we scroll through Instagram.

00:49:48.453 --> 00:49:51.040
We see a picture of someone
looking beautiful and happy.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.090
We're like, oh, look how
beautiful and happy this person

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:53.589
is.

00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:54.860
Why isn't my life like that?

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.100
And then we'll put
something into the machine

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.410
that we've cleaned up and
doctored and taken away

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:01.520
all the ugly bits.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.920
And we know that our stuff
that we put out there is fixed.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.220
But somehow, we
can't immediately

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.260
believe that other people
did the same thing,

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.560
even though they did.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.350
And for me, that's
the big thing that I

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.444
hope people will consider
after seeing the play.

00:50:15.444 --> 00:50:17.860
STEVEN LEVENSON: I actually
think that for younger people,

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:22.991
I've learned that they're
not even necessarily aware.

00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:25.240
The way that we, who didn't
grow up with social media,

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.940
are aware of that fiction, I
feel like for younger people,

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:32.010
it's actually a discovery that
other people aren't happy.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:33.010
Do you know what I mean?

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:36.340
In a way that when I was a
teenager, I certainly believed

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.990
everybody else was happy.

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:40.300
But I didn't have the
pictures to prove it.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.990
And I feel like that's
part of the message that

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:46.540
resonates with people
is, oh, wait, really?

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.280
Those people aren't
living the life

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.780
that they say they're
living either?

00:50:54.982 --> 00:50:56.690
MICHAEL PARK: We
touched on this earlier.

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:59.130
I want everyone to
go call their father.

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:01.130
I want them to call their
father or their mother

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.330
and just tell them
you love them.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.556
That's all they want.

00:51:04.556 --> 00:51:06.680
LAURA DREYFUSS: I would
say I hope people walk away

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:11.990
with a greater sense
of empathy for others.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:15.380
To touch on what Will said,
realize that we don't know what

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.380
we see on the surface
is what's real

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.750
and to trust that we
don't know who's hurting,

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:23.982
and that you could be hurting
and other people field

00:51:23.982 --> 00:51:24.650
that way.

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:28.165
It's important to
talk and communicate.

00:51:28.165 --> 00:51:30.290
BEN FRIED: Kristolyn, you
have a mic in your hands.

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:31.870
KRISTOLYN LLOYD:
Yeah, I'm thinking

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:34.660
it's a tug between
empathy and comparison

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.340
being the thief of joy.

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.500
When you sit there and
see other people's lives,

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.730
it steals your
joy if you let it.

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:44.920
And that, in turn,
makes it really hard

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.820
for us to imagine that they
need something as well.

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:53.380
Empathy is a huge part of
today, especially since we're

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:58.030
inundated with so many
images and ideas of what

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:01.330
life should be, as
opposed to allowing

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.310
what life is to just be life.

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:04.240
It can be messy.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.479
It doesn't have to be
an Instagram filter.

00:52:07.479 --> 00:52:08.770
Am I allowed to say that word--

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.340
Instagram?

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.360
OK, I didn't know.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.330
But, yes, I am going to
leave it with comparison

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:19.590
is the thief of joy.

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:23.620
And that if you need to get
away from all of those things,

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.620
you should to take
care of yourself.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.870
STEVEN LEVENSON: I also
think, on a fundamental level,

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:32.530
it's about change
and forgiveness.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:37.750
And that by the end of the show,
Evan does change and become

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:39.340
a better person.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:43.136
And all these characters
do, even though it's a lie.

00:52:43.136 --> 00:52:44.510
And it's sort of
that complexity,

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.218
but also the fact that
change is possible

00:52:46.218 --> 00:52:47.862
and forgiveness is possible.

00:52:47.862 --> 00:52:50.320
BEN FRIED: Taylor, you get the
last words if you want them.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.270
TAYLOR TRESNCH: No.

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:53.570
I just hope people like it.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.530
BEN FRIED: Well done.

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:05.560
All right, so I think we're
going to show another video.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.060
And while we're
showing the video,

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.290
I think the cast will file out.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:12.230
And I've been asked to ask you
please not to swarm our guests,

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.020
but to allow them
to peacefully make

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.310
their way to the green room.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:19.124
But before we show the
video and say goodbye,

00:53:19.124 --> 00:53:21.040
can we thank them for
an amazing [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.515
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:32.425 --> 00:54:11.310
[MUSIC - BENJ PASEK AND JUSTIN
 PAUL, "UNTITLED PPL PROJECT"]

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:13.240
WHOOPI GOLDBERG:
Everyone is wonderful.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.360
And I loved it so much
because it was inclusive.

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.572
This is about all of us.

00:54:17.572 --> 00:54:19.030
And I think it's
an important show,

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:21.070
and I'm really proud
I got to see it.

00:54:23.902 --> 00:54:25.360
STEPHEN COLBERT:
I want you to know

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.130
this is a compliment
when I say I

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:31.190
started crying in the first
song and I did not stop.

00:54:45.166 --> 00:54:47.210
TINA FEY: I think a show
like "Dear Evan Hansen"

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:49.970
can start a great
dialogue about being

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:52.280
your authentic self, which
is a really hard thing

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.442
to find and to be.

00:54:53.442 --> 00:54:55.400
It can start conversations
about the importance

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.678
of actual human connection.
