Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, February 29th, 2016 happy leap year. Oh, happy leap year and a happy birthday to the poor said conch who only have a birthday once every four years, you know? Good Lord. Can you imagine going on that first day with that broad bitch and about that? I always feel left out. It was like everybody else had a birthday every single year. It was like I would zero than I was four then I was eight.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       You know she'd be in good shape though. Huh? He been fucking 75% less birth. Birthday, birthday cake every year, right? No. Wait. How does that math work out? If in four years you had four slices of cake, right? But you were born in the leap year. You only had one. Yeah. That percentage doesn't work because you know you have one. Somebody else says two, they got 100% more than you got. Right. They got all provided the there equals slices. Now Jesus Bill, you're going to do, you going to break out fractions. I think I'm gonna steal a little birthday cake. Fractions. All right, so they're getting fucking 300% more kick than you are, man. I be, you know something. I've been, anybody who's born on February 29th is either a miserable cunt or just one of the coolest laid back people like, you know, oh my God, another birthday. Aren't the years flying by? No. No, they're not. Actually, to be honest with you, that's kind of weird. So like when the fuck are you actually like, like say when you're 29 you know that doesn't work. Do you 28 it's gotta be forced, right? Wait, you're zero. Jesus Christ. It should be fucking annoying. Zero. If you had a baby born on the 29th right year, if you're zero the first year.

Speaker 2:          00:02:10       All right. One, two, three no, four be back again for right. I don't fucking know. All I know is it's somebody's birthday today and it hasn't been their birthday since 2012 so happy fucking birthday. What does that work out? 16 1514 1312 would be five years. I can't fucking do it. I don't know when it was. So once every three years

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:02:35       oh, Jesus. Anything that happens every four years usually sucks to people's birthdays on leap year of World Cup soccer, the Olympics. You know, I actually like Olympic hockey, but then I hate all those fucking do shit who never watch hockey. And they'd be like, see if it was like this, I would watch it all the time. What? Only two weeks long with no fighting. You fucking do shit. Beat it. Nobody cares whether you watch it or not. We stayed on. At least I don't. So, um, anyways, I apologize for the, uh, you know what? I don't apologize. Oh, I okay. I will, I will, I'll apologize for the podcast being this late. I was going to do it on Sunday when I was up in Foxwoods. Joe, this go to the fucking casino. Wild in the middle of words, you know. Um, I was going to record on Sunday, but uh, [inaudible] got some tickets to see the Yukon, uh, Houston cougars game up, uh, you know, big fucking program by the way, man.

Speaker 2:          00:03:29       How about the fight? You know, very quietly. I probably shouldn't say very quietly. I just don't pay attention to the sports ladies hopes. You know, I knew that fucking, uh, Tennessee with pat summit, right. Was fucking crushing it. And I know Yukon was, I thought they were doing all right, but I thought it was mainly fucking pat summit. And then I went to the Goddamn Yukon game. I got a picture of it here on my phone. You know, somebody sent me a picture of a friend of, uh, a hairless pit bull that had freckles. So most adorable thing you ever seen in your life, but the person said it look like me.

Speaker 3:          00:04:07       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:08       Ah, I like a good tweet. You know, I don't get, I didn't give a shit if you break my balls, if it makes me laugh. All right, so the fucking lady, the lady huskies. Well, let's do it in order here. Let's do the guys first. Considering they have way less. You know, you always want to build towards your closing bit. All right, the guys, the fellows have won four national championships since 1999. All right. The Yukon men's huskies have one 1999 2004 2011 2014 that's very fucking respectable. Is anybody want more than that? I don't know. I'm not going to look it up. Kentucky or Duke, I would guess. Maybe not Duke. Right. Do Go. All right. Um, but the ladies, they want at 95 they want it in 2000 2002 2003 2004 2009 then the fucking God damn poor excuse for speakers. Hang it from that fucking building that they have with it. Do the ceilings peeling is in the way. The next two banners, they want it. 2014 2015 now I've got to fucking look it up. Well, as far as what I can see here on the phone, that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and there's two other banners behind that. That's gotta be a championship one. Yeah. National Champions. What an asshole. What a fucked and I walked down and take it correctly or maybe look it up before I did this.

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       All right, hang on a second. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Oh, Jesus. No, I'm typing on my phone. This is gonna take for fucking ever. I looked at the up the most random women's huskies. Why would I write that? That's not going to get me there.

Speaker 3:          00:05:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       Yukon.

Speaker 3:          00:05:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:54       Huskies championships. All right. Give me the ladies. Give it the ladies, but to come up for us. Uh, the men's do you sexist motherfuckers national championships? Do you fucking hang on ladies, ladies?

Speaker 3:          00:06:15       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       there we go. Connecticut women's basketball. I apologize. I even know if I had an, if had any fucking decency, I would edit most of this out, but I'm not gonna all right. National Tournament champion [inaudible] Conference Championships. Jesus fucking Christ. Nobody cares about any of this elite age final four tournament champions. 95 2000 2002 2003 2004 2009 2010 2013 2014 2015 one, two, three, four, five. They wanted five out of the last six fucking years and since the year 2000 Kona bit, they've wanted one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine fucking times total domination. Fuck a dog snoring. You know my dog's getting fat. I don't know what's going on with that. He's changed his food. We started getting her an extra can cause she's always fucking coming over, licking the bowl there. You know, we felt bad for her and then I should say she looks like a fucking state worker. Right? Tennessee lady falls. Alright, here we go. Come on Wikipedia. Where the fuck are you

Speaker 2:          00:07:32       lady ball? Wait, what do you say? What do you think? Because we think guys more. Huh? I get it. Go was Connecticut at that point of dull? This might be the most boring podcast ever. Well what do you do? You get what you pay for. All right, fuck it. I'm not looking it up at the moment. My eyes are seeing, I'm seeing double here. I'm very impressed. But both of them, man, they're, they're quietly crushing. It's a nice small campus. They play in this little ass building with, with Shit Pale in from the ceiling. The student section was hilarious. You know when they introduce the other team, they sit there reading the newspaper. I thought that was funny. Now, I'm sure somebody going to say, well, L K oil cord fucking university used to do that. I don't give a shit. So first time I saw it, it was funny to me.

Speaker 2:          00:08:14       Um, dude, there was a guy sitting behind like classic New England Sports Fan. I never heard a guy like anytime the ball didn't go in for the Huskies, he, he had an a reason every fucking time down the court and this is what killed me. So I'm like, all right, this guy's a total hoop head. Right? And I turned around and Yaz on a red sox hat and tee shirt toe. He's basically a sports maniac, right? The guy missed a shot. He'd be like, Eh, didn't follow through. Next time they come down the court, the DBA guy, the guy, he should've been rotating around. It's the second day I the double JB should have been rotating around. Next time down the court, somebody slips. What? Is there something wrong with the floor? And I just kept nudging versa. He would, he would go on like, like the, like the fucking lady huskies here.

Speaker 2:          00:09:02       He would go on like four or five, four or five hour runs there, except instead of winning championships, he'd be like bitch moaning and complaining. And at one point he made a point, you know, they threw it to their big goof there and that guy fucking missed the ball. And uh, the guy goes, you know, if he had a pair of hands, he would've had two there in front as he turned around goes, you know what, you're right. And the guy just looked at him with like an angry look like he was, he was so pissed that Yukon was losing. And we actually, uh, you know, I know they're only having a mediocre year this year. I mean he can't fucking win it every year. But um, you could sense when you were in there the level, how seriously everybody was taking it. Cause [inaudible] he kept saying like, wow, these people take this shit really seriously here.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       And I just kept pointing up to all the banners. I'm like, uh, I would say at this point they kind of used to winning. So I guess they're having a disappointing year, I guess. I have no idea. I didn't look it up. I just started talking about it. It's what I did. But that's why the podcast, um, was not ready. Um, I had a great time up at a Fox Foxwoods, um, resort casinos, by the way. I want to thank them for having me. It was their 24th anniversary, right. So they say to me, um, before I get there, they said, is there any way before your first show if you could come down, um, there's a big dinner or something we'd love if you could meet the, uh, the tribal council and just stop by and say, hello. Right. These are my employers for the weekend.

Speaker 2:          00:10:24       What am I going to say? No. So I'm like, absolutely. I want to meet these native Americans that fucking beat the white man, you know, and got their own fucking casino. Right? So I go down there and I just thought I was going to swing by a table and say hello to somebody, thank them for the Gig. And next thing you know, they got this whole, this is like fucking eyes wide shut fucking dinner going on. You know, the shining kind of shit in the bowels of the casino. There's some band and there's a stage and it's like this Guy Smiley looking fucking political guy on stage and next thing you know he's, he's given me an intro. I had no fucking idea I was going on. I have no idea what these people are at. Furthermore, these people had no idea who I was and I just walk out and I go up.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       We have, we got a local 40 man. Yeah, this weekend please welcome comedian Bill Bern. I was standing there going, is he bringing me up? Is he bringing me up and I just fucking walk on stage. I'd take the mic and I was like, I'm looking out at all these old people and shit and they just stare at me. I was like, uh, the cardio had no idea. I was a, I was going to be brought up here, but um, you know, congratulations on 24 years. I'm sure most of you people here know who the next four presidents are going to be on behalf of regular people. If you could do something about the population problem. I really appreciate it and all of this shit is getting nothing. Right. I just started talking to them like they will run in the world and they're just looking at me like I got fucking 10 heads and I just said, I just sort petered out and I went and uh, onward and upward.

Speaker 2:          00:11:58       I just handed it back to Guy Smiley and that was just like a little smattering of plause and I just walked back into the hall with the promoters will walk away. I was like, what the f? What the fuck was it? And he's like, I don't know. That's how we talked. Sorry, I didn't, no one was around doctoral. True ORC. I won't [inaudible] you know, nobody knows anything. Right. And they just fucking wheel you around. Um, yeah. And then we just fucking, I think we got on a golf cart at that point. We, no, no. We walked through the halls and then they walked me by the crowd that was going into my show. So I looked like a complete jerk off. I fucking, I love seeing people after the show. I fucking hate seen people before the show. I don't know why. I don't if it's a superstition, it's just weird to me to be, for me to just be walking by like the first time you see me, I'm just walking down the fucking hall. Oh, there's that jerk off. And then you just start looking at why did I pay to see that look at him.

Speaker 2:          00:12:57       Okay. But anyways, we had a, um, we had a great fucking time. I had a bunch of family and friends coming out, people I hadn't seen in years. Do you don't mind. My first best friend and then I ever had in life actually came up to the Gig. And um, I hadn't seen him in 36 years. And um, I was actually thinking the last time I saw him, you know, the reason why I, my family, we moved away from the town that we had lived in. And um, I just remember we were both, how fucking old was I? I think we were like seven or eight. And you don't know how to say goodbye. You know, I'd probably been friends with the kids since I was like four. So basically half my life I was friends with this kid. So we loaded up the moving van the last time like we would do in the u hall thing, you know, we'll do it ourselves.

Speaker 2:          00:13:49       And we just made like 900 fucking trips in this thing and we were loading it up for the last time. And uh, he lived across the street from me. So I walked down my driveway and he was out there and he knew this was, he knew it was it, I knew it was it and we were just too young. Didn't know. Yeah, you know what to say. It's seven. So some kid rode by and had just written buying a bike. And I remember he just said something to me like, Oh yeah, that kid was trying to say that, blah, blah, blah, blah. I couldn't remember anything. I was like, Oh yeah, you okay? I was like, Oh, I, uh, and he just started to walk away and I walked away in the other direction. And then we both looked over our shoulder at the same time.

Speaker 2:          00:14:28       And then that was it. I got in the fucking u hall and that was it. He came back to the neighborhood like four years later. I saw him one of the Times. So yeah, 1980. Yes. Cause I left in 76 some in 80 and then I hadn't seen him since then. So, uh, we got caught up talking about the old fucking times. Man. We didn't even get into it either. Man. Jesus Christ, some of the shit we used to do, you know, we used to play with fucking matches. That's what you used to do back then when there was like, like playing with matches was like, I don't know, like having a game boy or whatever these fucking kids do nowadays. And His dad had these things we would, they would call them monkey matches. That was just a book of matches. And for some reason they, it just had a picture of a monkey like wearing like a hat.

Speaker 2:          00:15:11       Like, like that was like highbrow humor back then, like dress and monkeys up like human beings, you know. And also having pictures of dogs playing poker and Shit, passing cards underneath the table with their paws and shit, you know. So his dad for whatever reason, always had these matchbooks that had pictures of monkeys that would like, you know, dress like dentists, you know, like lab coats on and shit or just some stupid fucking hat, you know. And uh, so we would, this is what we would do. We would go over and we would like basically underneath the tree we would bunch up a bunch of pine needles and you would just light it on fire and just look at the fire and then try and put it out. And um, you know, sometimes you put it out, sometimes you didn't. Sometimes a neighbor would come run it over cars.

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       Let the fucking you kids though. Yo Dahlia don't. Um, I did that one time. I lit it and all of a sudden it just got completely out of control. And this guy came running over the giant trashcan. They had filled up with water. Thank fucking Christ and um, and then somebody else in the neighborhood, I remember fucking lit it on fire. Let the whole fucking woods on fire. And uh, I know, I know it was two because he rode down to the fire station and, and said that he didn't do it, but he knows that he knew that my friend did it and he fucking ratted out my friend. And I'm sure the fire department was looking at the kid looking at him like, listen, you little rat, we know you fucking did it. Right. Um, so whatever was cool to see him. And um, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       I, I hate doing this thing after I've been on a fucking plane, you know. Oh, you know, I watched on the plane for the second time, I saw the movie a black mask, you know, I know that that Kinda got mixed reviews. That's one of those movies. You got to see it more than once. See it the second time. The Johnny Depp is fucking unbelievable in that movie. He's unfucking believable. And, um, there's a couple of actors here. I got to get their fucking names. They were absolutely amazing, but, uh, I liked it the first time. I loved it the second time I saw it. So, um, you know, I know I, but most people I heard from were from Massachusetts. They're like, dude, fucking xs. You just shut the fuck up. You know, when I went to Fargo, they were bitching about the fucking accents in Fargo.

Speaker 2:          00:17:28       Does that mean Fargo is a bad movie? I want to, why don't we hire you, who's not an actor? We'll have you fucking do it and we'll see how that works out. But, um, I just felt, you know, the second time when I saw it, like the pacing of it, I felt like they tied it in to like the absolute sociopath main character that they will try, you're fucked up is I'm nervous about talking about this, the level of power that those fucking guys had. Um, his, he reminded me of the Shawshank redemption where a lot of people, I know the first time they saw that they didn't like that movie because they felt it was so long and was dragging on and on and on and on. But, um, my, my theory on that movie was they were giving you the sense of what it was like to do time where it becomes like this open ended thing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:14       No beginning, no middle, no end. It actually sounds like I'm shitting on the movie, but it just, the way it would fade down and then just fade up and every time in the crowd you'd like be anticipating that there'd be this major turn and it was just another day in prison. A few years later. Um, I kind of felt like they were trying to do that with the weighty bulgy character where, um, you know, they were saying like, he was a sociopath, like they, and how he slowly drew in the FBI guys to the point that they were entangled in his bullshit. Um, and he insulated himself that way. I really, I dunno, maybe I was too dumb to get all of that shit the first time, but the second time I watched it, like I said, I went from liking that movie to fucking loving that movie. So, um, whatever. Give it a shot if you haven't, but I'm speaking of which the fucking Oscars well, last night, huh? White guys fucking crushing it. Oh, we fucking sweet. Cleaned up last night. I'm just fucking with you man. That was a, a, I only got to see, I got to see Chris Rock's opening monologue, which I thought was great. I thought he handled the whole thing fucking perfectly.

Speaker 1:          00:19:35       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:36       and uh, what else did I see? I didn't see a lot cause right as it started, the show was starting. I think we had a nine o'clock show. We started a little bit after eight, but, um, I have no idea who won what. I know the Boston movie about the fucking pedophile priest. I heard that, that thing one,

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:57       that was it. Nobody fell down. Nothing else happened,

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       right.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       Oh, very quietly. The first, uh, Asian director, I believe ever fucking won something. Is that what I saw? I don't know. This is, you know, just a recurrent thing. I'm not going to look anything up. I'm just going to start talking about it and uh, you know, that's gonna be it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:20       You know what, I don't understand. Like I don't understand the weight that people put on the fucking Oscar. So I really got to tell you that though. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:29       I just don't, I don't fucking get it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:32       I was joking this weekend, like just sitting there watching a bunch of adults running around wanting to win a trophy. It's like, well, what are you fucking little league trophies are for kids, aren't they? You have ribbons and shit and it makes them feel good and you'd take them out for a fucking snow cone and then that's it. You know, you put them to bed, you get yourself a whiskey and you sit there and you stare at the wall and that's basically your life. I mean, why would he, how old are you? You need a fucking trophy. Um, yeah. I don't, I don't give a shit about like that type of stuff, but I, I definitely think that there should be opportunity for everybody. You know, I'd like to hear everybody's stories. Um, so I had no problem with any of that shit. Um, but I do just think it's funny that people fucking flip out and start crying about winning a goddamn trophy.

Speaker 2:          00:21:16       And this trophy means more than natural fee. This one's more prestigious. Um, alright, let's, I gotta do a couple reads here for this week.

Speaker 2:          00:26:51       Um, I don't know why. I mean, how fucking lazy are people going to get? I mean, it's going to be great for drinking and driving. It just be drinking and riding. You know, you, all of a sudden you'll always have that fucking thing, right? I don't, I don't like this man. I don't like how everything's becoming fucking automated. You know? I feel like rich people have gradually phasing us out, you know, cause you know God damn well the only reason why they allow us to exist is because they need us to farm, right? They need us to deliver shit. They need us to do a bunch of shit. And I guy could add another example. I don't know, dance around like a monkey at a fucking casino. Come downstairs to say a couple of words that your little fucking Illuminati party in the basement. They need us to do that. But once everything is automated and it just handles it, it's fucking self.

Speaker 3:          00:27:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:45       Do you think you could be a part of that group? What if you were part of a group that was just going to slowly fucking just phase everybody else out? You know, and some hours would happen in your lifetime.

Speaker 3:          00:27:57       All right

Speaker 2:          00:27:59       Mike, who would you keep these free Hitler s type questions. But this is the type of fucking madness that I think everybody's capable of. You know, especially, um, I don't know if you travel on the road, some of the dope should fucking meet out there. Watch people getting stirred up. You know, in all honesty, I can't stand like the choices that we have for president right now, you know, is it starts to go towards as a fucking torpedo, uh, that fucking St Bernard Looking Guy, Bernie Sanders, right? His javas. Um, as a torpedo, his fucking campaign and all democrats are walking around, he can't win. He can't win. I love that. I love it. Yeah. Cause you're too much of a pussy to fucking vote from. That's why, right? So you're going to vote for this fucking, this clammy fucking crook or this guy who isn't saying anything, but like, I really believe that, you know, you could talk people into fucking wiping out everybody on the planet. He very easily just listening to Donald Trump, his speeches where he just says absolutely nothing. Do you know, he said today he was talking to college graduates and he's literally go with [inaudible]. I'm going to bring jobs back to the United States. You wait, there's going to be more jobs here by the time I'm done. It's going to make your head spin. I'm going to have, I'm going to have apple bring manufacturing jobs back from China to here. Okay. And people clapped.

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       He never has to say how he's going to do all, I'm gonna plug up the hole in the ozone layer. Water's going to be clear. I'm going to get rid of all terrorism and that's going to be the first week.

Speaker 3:          00:29:32       Woo.

Speaker 2:          00:29:33       I like this guy. This guy makes sense. He's making it great again. You know, and then you got Hillary. I'll just, just talks through her fucking teeth. It's like she, you know, she looks like she should be doing like a ventriloquist act, but the puppet isn't. Um, that's cute. Fucking, I dunno. I have no, I don't know. I don't fucking know. No idea. And I don't even know who the other guys are. I just heard a couple of them talking, trying to trash Donald Trump and they just, they sounded pathetic. Just not good speakers. This is just a, this is a bad one is a bad one. Yeah. I've got bet people watching, you know, you know, if you've got a great college program and a bunch of seniors fucking graduate graduate and you just, you know, you just go through a bad four year period.

Speaker 2:          00:30:17       I think that's what we're coming through. We're coming out of right now. You know, like this one guy who was seen, he was going to get rid of Obamacare if he was elected. And people like applauding, like I, I just, I don't fucking get it. I don't get why I don't even, I don't have Obamacare. I guess my tax dollars paid for it, but I don't have any problem with somebody. Like, I don't want it. My fellow countrymen walking around with a fucking toothache, you know, they just spleen removed. Fuck you. Figure it out for yourself. Why don't we help each other out a little more? You know, why can we do that? And if felt like anybody needs this, split them out. Donald Trump, I bet I could run. I could run for president if that's all you gotta do is just say you're going to do all this awesome shit. You never fucking do it. Everyone will have healthcare and it will be free. All right. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:31:05       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:06       Oh, this weekend, by the way, all the self driving cars, let's get back to that fucking thing. So evidently some self driving car hit a bus, which is fucking tremendous for anybody who loves driving. That is such a tremendous fucking thing that happened today or yesterday or maybe last year. All I know is I just found the fucking story. I'm so fucking psyched. So the self driving car hit the fucking hit the fucking bus. I mean it even though it was only going like two miles an hour, it's just so fucking great because it hit a bus. So all you gotta say is just, you know, just be like, well what if, what if there was a bunch of kids on that bus? Right. And then that'll delay it a good 20 fucking years. Um, let me see if I can find this story. Self driving. Google says it bears some responsibility after self driving car hits bus.

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:01       Can you fucking believe that? What was there, was there a person driving the bus? I would say that you, you, you have all the fucking responsibility. Unless this guy literally drove into the fucking thing. Alphabet incorporate, incorporate a Google set on Monday. It bears some responsibility after one of its self driving cars struck a menu, municipal bus in a minor crash earlier this month, the crash may be the first case of one of its autumn autonomous cars hitting another vehicle and the fault of the self driving car. Dude, this is going to be a shit show. This is just one and had already hit a fucking bus. You know what I mean? That's fucking, that's lunacy. It's fucking lunacy man. I will tell you it. I mean I think it'll, it'll, it will cause people to drink like they've never drank before. I mean have most nights. I don't drink out of here because I, you know, I drive myself places, you know, I don't fucking Uber.

Speaker 2:          00:33:01       Well that'll put Uber out of business. Right? Well I guess if you don't have a fucking car, I dunno. Don't you guys like driving? I'll be at like the option, my thing is how is the Insurance gonna work? Cause you know God damn well there's no way the insurance company's going to take that fucking liability on and that they're claiming they're going to get rid of. There'll be no more deaths from car accidents. It's going to be no more accidents. It's just going to be, it's going to be like just accident free. This is amazing to me that this debt, it's gotten this fucking far considering, you know that like the amount of times they tried to kill the electric car, right? And you know, big oil companies, that type of thing. You mean you fucking with it. They have blue blood money going out.

Speaker 2:          00:33:52       Having that, let's go electrocute an elephant to show how fucking dangerous these cars are. Right? So like this is the only thing I can think of what these insurance companies, they're making enough money to go down there and whack somebody at ABC Inc. Right? You know, they fucking do shit like that. And you go to a diner and all of a sudden you stagger outgoing. They poisoned me and he'd do a face plant. Then your invention disappears. Oh I'm going down the rabbit hole. This is why I think they are letting this one go through cause they're eventually going to get rid of all of us and when they do that they're going to have no more limo drivers. So they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Speaker 4:          00:34:32       What are we going to do in the future if we want a Rudge somewhere? I mean I'm not going to drive my car and soil my wealthy hands Elmo.

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       And then somebody is like, well what if we just had, we'll just make the cars drive themselves.

Speaker 4:          00:34:46       Oh, okay then. Okay. Kill them all then. Yes, thank you. Poison them, remove them from the point on it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       Um, I wonder if they got rid of everybody, how long it would take for this phone, you know, to go back to, normally you have to take all the nuclear waste, right? Just send it out, you know, out in the fucking space. Right. Send it towards Mars. Just make sure you don't hit the moon and all you do is just fucking chill out. Nearly a little house. And when I along it would take to undo all Abbott. All is shit that people leave behind. You know, fucking going to deal with all of that. That's all going to go into the soil and take a, he ain't, I wouldn't happen in your lifetime.

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       Jesus Christ. I am all over the place, man. What the fuck am I talking about here? The murdering people, self driving cars used to see this fucking car. By the way, this fucking self driving car, it makes the Volkswagen beetle look like a Goddamn Lamborghini. People on the Simpsons drive a better looking car than that fucking thing. Oh, you know, they're all gonna be the exact same fucking one, right? You'll have your options of like three different colors, like white, black or beige. Oh Man, this is not uplifting. I'll tell you what's uplifting. March 5th, this weekend, UFC one 96. Conor McGregor, um, UFC one 96. What are they calling this one? Did they, did they stop naming them though, by the way? To have they come up with 196 adjectives that, that, that describe how fucking tremendous that sports, that sport is. You know, you have c 12, the redemption, the revenge or whatever. They always had like these cool fucking names up to once you get up to like one 96, they gotta be running out. Right. Let me see what they got here.

Speaker 2:          00:36:45       UFC one 96 Conor McGregor versus some Guy Dia's I wish I knew these guys names better. You know, there's only so much shit I can pay attention to. Um, these taking on late replacement, Nate DHEAS. Ah, Jesus. What happened? He was supposed to fight somebody else. Rafio I'm not going to fucking insulted Latinas by trying to pronounce it, although I could give you a good laugh here. Rafi el Dos anules Raphael sign yells. I'm was from his showdown against Connor with a broken foot out. F it the fuck. Do you know I was reading something on McGregor today? Do you know? I don't understand. I don't. Somebody in the fight game, please explain this to me. That guy walks around at one 70 and he shredded and then before his fight for whatever fucking reason, he's got to go down to one 45. Now I can understand if the other guy just walks around at one 45 or maybe one 55 and Connor for whatever reason, just wants to beat the fuck out of the guy.

Speaker 2:          00:37:51       So he's willing to starve himself down to one 45 for the love of God. Can anybody in the fight game that let that does this, why can't, you know, if Carter walks around at one 70 and the other guy's walking around at one 65, why don't they just fight it like one 60? Why do they got to bring everybody all the way the fuck down there? I, I, I just don't understand why they got to do that shit. Um, check out the sports illustrated article on, uh, on Conor McGregor. They got like this whole thing where the only briefly talk about it, uh, but they're talking about cutting weight and it actually sounds in a lot of ways, worse than the fight, like talking about the pain and the agony of it. And it's, I, I can't even, uh, I'm not going to be able to do it justice because I just read it.

Speaker 2:          00:38:37       I have a very poor memory and I've never gone through it. But, uh, Holly Holmes also fighting against, uh, Meesha tape and, uh, I'm taking the night off of stand up and I'm going to fucking hang it. You know what's great? This is the one sport that I can really watch my wife like, she likes going to live hoop too, but she loves the fucking UFC. She gets into it like at a crazy level. Like that time when that guy kicked, uh, kicked the other dude and he had the compound fracture, you know, and his fucking leg bent all the way back. I was just like, I walked out and my guy done done. I can't watch that. She, she was rewinding it, wanting to watch it again and was like, like literally interested in it. Um, which means she either should have been a serial killer or gotten into the medical field because if you can fucking stomach that, um, either way I can, I'm, I'm really excited to see this shit this weekend.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       I like it. Even if they're quick fights, even though if it's a bad thing, does it make you at least want to workout? You see those guys and fucking women getting in there, they're all fucking jacked. You look down at yourself, usually finishing off a pizza. You're like, what the fuck am I doing going down to Home Depot tomorrow? I'll get a sledgehammer and a big fucking tire, you know, and you know what you're doing for a couple of days and then you quit. And that's why you're not a champion. Like what you're going to see on fucking Saturday. There you go. There's my promo for the UFC. Um, all right, let's, uh, let's, let's read some fucking letters for this week. Shall We? Everybody, chances are because Cleo, you're losing your figure sweetheart.

Speaker 2:          00:40:11       Glad you didn't walk the red carpet at the, uh, at the fucking Oscars. They would've been all over you. All right. Leaving the country of Trump wins. Dear Billy elect, what's your take on people who say they're going to leave the comp country if Trump wins, uh, besides the potential for lanes to open up on the highway? I just hope the people that say they're going to leave leave, so I don't have to point out who's allying sec is shit. Um, they're obviously joking. No one's going to leave this country, but, uh, it's just, you know, he's a very extreme guy. You know. I think people said that when Obama, they definitely said it during George Bush with some famous stars set it. I remember, I thought it was like funny. Then of course Fox News is launch your league. Why don't you get the fuck Outta here?

Speaker 2:          00:40:58       You know, like fucking lunacy. Um, what do I think about people say that? I think it's kind of Hacky at this point. I think that's what everybody says. When there's somebody that's on the fringe on one side of the other, somebody always ends up going and you have to go, fucking went, I'm going to leave. Where are you going to go? This is what people forget. When you, uh, when you leave this country, you, you immediately become an immigrant who's taking somebody else's job in the country that you're going to and you get treated as such. You know, even if you white, they don't want, but they don't want Americans moving up to Canada fucking with their population, taking their jobs. You know, all of a sudden you're standing this drive and a spike into a tree to take out some maple syrup instead of the other guy. They don't want that. They don't want that at all. Um, all right. Yeah, I just think they're just the saying. I mean it's, it's fucking scary. I mean, it's supposed scary. I think Hillary is a fucking lion sack. A Shit, a totally dishonest. And I think a Donald Trump is a reality show star.

Speaker 2:          00:42:04       That's the best we can fucking do. I just don't fucking get it. It keeps getting worse.

Speaker 3:          00:42:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       Jay's is fucking the last guy.

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:18       The last guy that I thought was decent was the first George Bush. You know, I like when he went into Kuwait and then like he teach it. All right. That's enough. That's enough. He didn't go off fucking nuts and we got the fuck out of there.

Speaker 3:          00:42:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:33       You know, and then fucking Clinton came in. I, what the fuck down was a big frat party where he's getting his dick sucked. He's lying about shit. People got stuff on them, mysteriously die. I mean, it was fucking nuts. Then he bombed some people to get out of a fucking blow job accusation. The whole fucking thing was, I don't know. It's been crazy ever since. Um, I don't know shit about politics. Don't listen to me. All right. Boyfriends, smoking habit. Hey Mr Burr, love the podcast and the stand up. Come to Rochester, New York soon. Uh, I would love all, you know what, you know, what is a buffalo date and a Syracuse state in the works. Yes ma'am. Yes sir. Whatever. Wherever this is writing this shit. Um, uh, with the F I just scroll down, sorry. Love the podcast and the stand up. Come to Rochester, New York.

Speaker 2:          00:43:21       I would appreciate some advice from yourself and the lovely Nia if she's available. Uh, she ain't here today, man. All right. I've been with my boyfriend for almost two years and since day one, I knew of his daily weed smoking habit. He doesn't let her let it hinder his life. Still very social, faithful, going to, going to work every day. Uh, he scheduled, he eats healthy and he goes to the gym four to five days a week. I've tried getting used to it, um, since it's something that he does and it, it isn't a problem in his life, but I've never wanted to try drugs or alcohol. So I don't know what the feeling of being under the influence of something is like now because now, because of that, my problem is unless I see him during the day and even then he'll take a hit, he's not sober.

Speaker 2:          00:44:13       Is it wrong of me to be concerned that whenever he sees me, he's under the influence of something? Uh, whenever we go to the movies or a comedy show, he'll bring half a cookie so we can quote, enjoy the show more. And why don't I want him to relax after work by vaping a and hanging out with me. Considering this habit hasn't, hasn't hindered his life in any way. Do I have a reason to be uneasy about this? I understand why he does it. And he tells me it doesn't affect his feeling about feelings about me and about us being together, but it still makes me uneasy whenever I know he's high.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:44:51       yeah. Well, I mean if you don't like it, you don't like it. And if he enjoys it, he enjoys it. So you both know where you stand.

Speaker 1:          00:44:59       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:01       I gotta be honest. I mean, if someone was drinking every day, there would be probably an issue with that. Although there's no medicinal purposes for a alcohol is there, unless they're taking an arrow out of your back, don't think like rubbed some on your gums or some shit. I can't remember how it goes. You take a shot. Is that what it is? You bite down on a fucking garden hose? I don't remember.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       yeah. I mean if these getting fucking begged all the time and he always, you know, so he'll enjoy it more. Yeah, that's a little bit of a red flag, you know, honestly, if you fucking doing it every day and you're never really sober and you just sort of constantly just sorta hi, um, that's probably not a good way to go through life, but it is his choice. I would just tell him, just be like, look, I'm not saying you can't smoke, but like if you're high all the time and I'm sober, so I'm constantly talking to a buzzed you and, um, it bothers me.

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       I would just tell him that and I, I think that it's gonna bother him because when you fucking smoke weed like that, it's a religion, you know what I mean? It's not like, you know, every day he comes home and he does this one little thing, puts his shoes in the wrong spot or some shit. This is like you're talking about his state of consciousness when he's around you at all fucking times. Basically. You want him to alter that. So that's some kind of a major change.

Speaker 1:          00:46:26       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:46:27       you didn't tell me how old he was, but, um, I don't know. I don't know much about weed. I know some people say they get productive when, when they're, when they're using it and that type of stuff. But, uh, I dunno, I, I really feel that, you know, and this is somebody who's like, realized that his drinking is out of control again. So I just thought I've stopped for the last fucking three days.

Speaker 1:          00:46:51       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       I mean, I really have to watch it with myself. Okay. Because I have the kind of job where, you know, I can get fucked up every night basically, and then sleeping the next day. Now granted my career would suffer and I wouldn't get anywhere and eventually, you know, but I mean, I could do some stuff before, like I might career totally did a fucking nosedive provided I didn't like, you know, do something stupid like fucking, you know, get behind the wheel of a car, fucking assault somebody. If I was just getting drunk every day. Um, yeah, that would affect where I was in the business. But it'd be like a long seven year, like tapering off, you know, back to doing the comedy vault at Remington's in Boston, which doesn't exist anymore. But, um, you know, I, I don't know, I just personally, I know I really got to watch it in my, my, my finger about people who smoke weed is the fact that they could be on it and nobody really knows.

Speaker 2:          00:47:49       Like, you know, when once they're high all the time they're experienced being high and they can just go to work being high and, uh, you can't do that drunk. He can't go to work like, you know, shotgun a beer and walk in. People just know it just doesn't work. Um, but I'm not exactly a hundred percent exact against it the way I used to in the early days of this podcast when I didn't know a lot about it. Now I'm understanding that there's certain people, you don't have to have really active minds. They need to fucking chill out. It's actually a great thing, um, for them. But I, I really think if you're doing it all the fucking time like that, yeah. Like, this is probably cause for an issue there, you know, to bring it up like, hey, you kind of fucking basically wasted every time I talked to you. And then also, you know, that whole thing, you know, he brings half a cookie so he can enjoy the show. It's like you can't enjoy it sober. Like those are kind of some, um, red flags.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       I Dunno. And I also think that you can get addicted to that shit. You know, I think, I think it guy is, to be honest with you, people always say Nah, you're not really addicted to it. Oh yeah. You just do it every waking moment. You can't fucking enjoy something unless you're under the influence of it. There's something there. It's just because it's such a mellow thing and it's not like a, you know, I guy a bug and a buddy of mine from back in the day, dude, he's completely fucking addicted to that shit. He says, I love weed cause it turns my life into a movie. And um, no, basically been high since we were sophomores in high school. And, uh, without a doubt it's fucked with his memory. Without a doubt. Its, it's fucked with his drive, you know, I dunno, I understand. Wanting to get fucked up every day. Personally. It's fun.

Speaker 2:          00:49:50       It's think with weed, it's so easy, a couple of puffs and then boom, you're there, you know, drink. It takes it off. Gee, I've got to stop talking about this. I'm going to have a drink. I'd set up to take a week off here, so. All right, well good luck with that. I would just, I would just say how you're feeling and um, if it gives, you know, gives you shit back, I'd just be like, look, give me, I'm, I'm not being an asshole here. You just like, you high every day. Can you just like not be high a couple of days a week? Like how do you do that and not feel like you're infringing on this guy's fucking lifestyle? I mean, it's, I dunno, I would bring it up to him. As I said 20 minutes ago before I meandered my way through that. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2:          00:50:24       All right, I fucked up. Please advise. Dear Billy ginger cakes. I have a 26 year old fucking lady who is a tremendous fan of your work in all its glorious forms. Well, thank you very much. A that seen enough as for family with the dad balls when bill is stuck under the bed is the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen. Brilliant. Well thank you. I appreciate that. Um, I did. I did something really then. All capital's really dumb and I would greatly appreciate your insight because I know you will tell me the ever elusive truth. I won't tell you why I won't. I'll tell you what I think is the truth, whether it's the right answer. You got it. You got to decide that for yourself. I had been friends with this guy for about two years and now you're fucked them in. You ruin the friendship. That's what I'm, that's what I'm guessing here. We met through a larger group of friends. There was chemistry between us immediately. This guy, his Sophie's married, try and see where, how, how the, how this can go off the rails. This are, this is reading in the beginning, like one of those dating sites, you know, they play that stupid piano. Hulu do, but do, do that stupid

Speaker 5:          00:51:34       woo

Speaker 2:          00:51:35       dumb shit. Let's see. Area killer. This could be a sex offender. I don't know.

Speaker 5:          00:51:43       No. Whoa. Uh, we met through a larger, larger

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       group of friends. There was chemistry between us immediately. This guy is so funny and so smart and fun to be around. The problem is he has two penises. I'm kidding. She didn't write that. But he's also a complete and total whore. Oh, Jesus. Crushing it and good for him, but exactly the wrong guy to get hung up on. I knew I liked him too much. I couldn't help it, but I thought I could handle being friends, friends with him. And eventually, eventually the feelings would pass. Nah, Nah. You can't be around guys like that. This guy's a pussy getting son of a bitch. Right. Dracula would be like, God damn it. That guy's got game right. And all the, all the ladies Love Dracula. He'd come up and start knocking on their fucking necks and that was it. Tournament to lady bats. Right. Then he kicked him to the curb, get himself another chick the next day.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       Um, we started hanging out a lot, at least two or three nights a week. Sometimes. He said things that made me think maybe he liked me too. Then on my birthday we got drunk and had sex called it. Oh, Jesus. She says, let me be clear. He started it. I just didn't stop it even though I knew it was a bad idea. So like a little kid, he started it. Um, the worst part is when I woke up the next morning in his bed, in his bed, he was gone. Oh Man. He fled the fucking same bill. The dude shaped hole in the door. One told that he was freaked out.

Speaker 2:          00:53:30       The dude shaped hole in the door. He mean even like Lilly ran through the door. I think he left some words out or I'm too fucking old to understand, is that some new slang. Uh, told me he was too freaked out and decided and I decided to give him some space. He called me four days later. I don't remember the conversation or were you drunk, but he said he'd call me back. That was four months ago. Clearly he doesn't give a shit. I get that, but I cannot understand how we could be so much in my life and then just never fucking talk to me again. The fuck dude. The fuck you sound cool as hell. By the way. The more, the more immediate problem is that in a few weeks a mutual friend is having a birthday party and dude is going to be, is going to be there. What the fuck do I do, Bill? How do I face him? Do I confront him? Do I ignore him? I'm bugging out. Please help me. Thank you with any advice. Um, the has got a God, I wish she was here this week. Um, all right, here's the deal.

Speaker 3:          00:54:31       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       All right. This isn't about him. This is about you. All right. Be honest with yourself. He kind of said, you knew what this guy was. You knew who he was. All right? But he just had that fucking thing. All right. He just had that fucking charisma or whatever. And two years, two years into it, you'd drunk. He started it and you went through with whatever, you know. He got freaked out and confirmed what you knew all the time and he fucking left. All right. That'd be honest with me. Do you want to fight that fight before you met this guy and you fantasized about the man you were going to marry? Was this how it was going to play out? Was this, does this something that you want to fucking deal with? You realize you're going to have to like trying to bring this fucking fish in the amount of heartache, the amount of extracurricular activities and all that fucking shit that comes along with a guy like this? Well, why would you do that? Why would you do that to yourself? You don't need this shit. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:55:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:34       The problem is is you're trying to, like, you're trying to like figure out the sanity in somebody insane behavior. Okay? You knew what he was and then he confirmed it and now you're like, dude, does he mean this? He said, how could he just do that? Because he's a fucking load of tech. He's a load of tech. Who knows because his dad ran around on his mom because his mom took off on his dad. Who the fuck knows cause they his bullshit, his giant truck load of fucking bullshit. Okay. That he is still not even begun to deal with, which is why he's behaving like that around you. You don't fucking need that Jesus Christ. All the guys in the fucking world go to the party and have a good time.

Speaker 3:          00:56:25       Hm.

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       Just tell him just, you know, if you see him, just say what's up. No need to be weird. Okay. It's over. Whatever. Where we had a good time. It's fucking over. I knew you were nuts. Now you confirmed it. All right. Stop fucking looking at me like you've seen it go like I just, I would just go there and have a good time. I wouldn't ignore him. I wouldn't confront him. I would just say hello and then I would go on what's happening? If he wants to talk, talk to him. If he doesn't, just go on with having a good time. If you bumped into him again, say hello again, but don't let that fucking guy ruin your good time. All right. And quit fucking wasting mental time trying to figure out his bullshit. He's not worth it. Fuck them. All right. There you go. Fuck them. Hey, who knows? She might meet Mr Right at that place.

Speaker 6:          00:57:15       Ooh. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:57:18       Great everlasting love. A documentary suggestion. Dear Billy Boo, if you haven't seen the documentary on Netflix about the Ukraine revolution, you should definitely check it out. I would love to see that. Um, it's called winter on fire. That sounds like a really bad 80 song.

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:57:39       Where Gerrard Fi

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       what does that sell? Say it almost fire. How I can fight some fucking Russians. I don't like Vladimir Putin. I'm sorry. And the immortal words of Ron Burgundy. Wow. That escalated quickly. My singing or the Ja, the documentary. It starts with some activists deciding to congregate in one place, which started as an event sent out on Facebook and ended up replacing their president.

Speaker 3:          00:58:11       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       yeah. Every time I reached you like this, like I am amazed at the human spirit and also feel so fucking lucky that I haven't had to experience that in a country. You know, I I the country I live and we haven't gone through some shit like that. Hopefully it will never fucking happen because I don't think I could stomach it. You know, hearing when people running up and down the street, you're just sitting there in the house.

Speaker 3:          00:58:34       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:58:35       Who was in charge?

Speaker 2:          00:58:38       Um, the idea is so foreign to us and I think most people don't understand just how crazy it is. Yeah. I mean I don't, I'm trying to wrap my head around it, but you are really good at seeing crazy shit. No one notices that is right under our noses. So I think you'll be floored by this. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. What? Thank you for the a, the recommendation. I will definitely try to, uh, check that out as soon as I can. Is that all the shit? Is that all the fucking what am I up to here? 58 minutes and 56 seconds. I think I can bullshit for another minute and call this a God damn day. Was there something else that I had to talk about here on the podcast? Um, oh yeah. I decided, uh, I ran into a buddy of mine and he, uh, told me his new year's new year's resolution was, he wasn't going to argue with his wife this year and he's made it all the way to February.

Speaker 2:          00:59:27       I was like, you know what, that's a really cool resolution and I haven't made any this year. So, um, I'm not giving up arguing with my wife, uh, for two reasons. One, it would destroy my act into I'm a selfish son of a bitch. Um, at first I have no control of my fucking emotions. I don't, it's shameful, but I don't. Um, so I decided instead of I'm going to, I'm trying to get back into learning French. Uh, I feel like as I'm approaching, you know, the mid century mark here, if I don't fucking do it now, I'm going to be fucked. I'm never going to learn how to do it. Um, so I'm fucking, I'm back into it. I'm on duo lingo. I've done it three days in a fucking row. And the only reason why I'm announcing it to you guys is because, yeah, if you don't hear me talking about it, please break my balls and say that I fucking quit again.

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       I'm a loser. And all that type of Sheldon wonderful positive shit that you guys can see in knowledge anonymously on the Internet. Um, oh, by the way, you know, you know it's funny in this fucking business, like they never tell the performer shit. Right? So I'm on stage this weekend. I got to ask you if there's any doctors out there. I'm fucking onstage and I'm doing my act. I don't even know what night it was. It might've been the first show last night and the whole time I'm doing my act, everything I fucking say some guy in the crowd is just like repeating it or commenting on it, you know what I mean? Like not like heckling, it's more like, like black church, like call and response. I was like, yeah, you know, I was walking down the street the other day and he says like, yeah, well I mean down the street, you know, doing that shit the whole fucking time.

Speaker 2:          01:01:08       But he's not so loud that the rest of the crowd can hear it. Some hoping if I just ignore him, he's going to stop and he does it. And finally after like a half an hour, it's like, dude, will you shut the fuck up? You don't have to fucking comment on everything. He like, all right. All right. All right. He's just doing that shit, but I love you. It takes saying shit like that and you know I was trashing them and all that shit. So afterwards I ended up meeting him after the show and he ended up telling me that he had Tourette's and then somebody on the show go, yeah, yeah, you had Tourette's. We didn't know if you should throw them out. It's like, why don't you fucking tell me that before I make a fucking ass out of myself? I felt terrible. But here's my question, is that a form of Tourette's?

Speaker 2:          01:01:47       I thought Tourette's is either you're cursing your brains out or you make weird noises or you do some sort of physical tick. I didn't know that you fucking, all of a sudden we're doing that, you know, I'm in a Baptist church, you know, except doing it in a way that egs on the fucking speaker. It actually annoys the shit out of it. Well, maybe that's my temperament. I have no idea. Um, that's my question for somebody out there in the medical field, is that a form of Tourette's or was he just trying to make me feel bad? I'm literally yawning here like a fucking idiot. Um, all right. That's the podcast for this week. Oh, Biz Billy. No booze bag is back on the fucking wagon again. Um, I gotta tell you as much as I fucking go up and down with that shit, at least I, I do nip it in the bud, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:02:34       I, uh, I just drank too much. Was it Friday night? Woke up, fucking hung over, tired as shit. I was just like, what the fuck am I doing to myself? This is stupid. And, um, then I watched black mask and I was watching them drinking Budweisers in 1970s pull tab cans. And I was like, God, I miss that. I miss it already. All right. All right. That's a podcast for this week. Sorry. Uh, it was so late.
