00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.420
Let's walk through and pick the Q on which to place Ty, based on the scheduling

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.400
policy. Now if you ask the question, what is the minimum I

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.370
plus Q for PU for this particular thread Ty, that's

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.970
going to be the infinity that Ty has on PU.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.450
The affinity that T, Ty has on Pu is 2. But also we have to look

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.791
at the queue size. And the queue size of Pu is 1. There's only one thread

00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:37.250
sitting there. So the overall min of I plus Q for Ty with respect to Pu is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.174
3. Let's do the same thing for Ty on Pv. In the case of Pv, its

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:47.390
affinity apparently is higher because there's only one

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.900
intervening task that ran since the last time Ty

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.560
ran on it. That's good news, but we also have to look at the Q of Pv. When

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.510
Ty gets put on Pv's Q, it has to sit behind whatever they may be, and in the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.440
case of Pv, the Q already has four threads to run. So when Ty is put on Pv's

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.660
Q, it's going to be stuck at the end of

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.220
this Q. Which means that, in a sense, the amount

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.538
of intervention that is going to happen for Ty on

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:22.580
Pv, by the time it gets to run, is actually

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.990
the size of the, the affinity index for Py with

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.090
respect to Pv currently as well as the intervention that's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.200
going to happen by the time it actually gets to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.490
that. So that's four, so the overall I plus Q

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.970
is five for this guy, and three for this guy.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.275
Which means that the choice I am going to make

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:46.420
is to put Ty on Pu, because, that's the one that will result in the least

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.280
amount of intervention for polluting the cache of

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.870
Pu with respect to this particular thread Ty
