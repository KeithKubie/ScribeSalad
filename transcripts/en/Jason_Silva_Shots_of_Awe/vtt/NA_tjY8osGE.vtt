00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.790
So one of the prevailing
motifs here on "Shots of Awe"

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.780
is as human beings--
as conscious agents--

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.630
how do we resolve the inherent
tension between wanting

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.970
to realize-- to fully
realize-- our potential,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.310
to realize ourselves
as individuals

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.300
who stand with dignity and
resist the tug of conformity?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.480
How do we avoid succumbing
to a zombified trance

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.450
state of blindly following
others in a herd-- as sheep,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.896
as hamsters in a hamster wheel.

00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:45.300
And [LAUGHS] it's funny.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.750
Because I think that
the way we resolve that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.430
is by taking that
plunge-- by answering

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.690
that call that Joseph
Campbell talks about.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.690
There is no one map for
how to live our lives.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.435
Reality is just a word.

00:00:57.435 --> 00:00:58.810
And you're not
supposed to use it

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.320
without quotation
marks around it anyway,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.570
as Joseph Campbell says.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.890
We are all free to
create our own reality.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.540
But it's only when
we are bold enough

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.900
to decondition our thinking--
to transcend what Robert Anton

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.510
Wilson calls the reality
tunnel-- this linguistic,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.056
and conceptual, and symbolic
framework that constructs

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:21.600
your realities, and a matrix
pulled in front of your eyes,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.260
blinding you from
ecstatic visions of what

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.950
might be behind those walls.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.890
We are larvas who haven't turned
ourselves into butterflies yet.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.916
And there's that great line
by Nietzsche that says,

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:36.010
"those who were seen
dancing were called insane

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.950
by those who could
not hear the music."

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:52.180

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.702
Never forget the words of
Jack Kerouac. "The only people

00:01:55.702 --> 00:01:58.420
for me are the mad
ones-- mad to live,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.150
mad to talk, mad to be
saved, desirous of everything

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.080
at the same time.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.630
Those who would never yawn
or say a commonplace thing

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.490
but burn, burn, burn
like yellow Roman candles

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:21.330
exploding like spiders
across the sky."
