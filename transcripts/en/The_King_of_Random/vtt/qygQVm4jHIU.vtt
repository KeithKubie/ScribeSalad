Hey guys in this video

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.150
We're hanging out with stuart Edge Devin Graham, and we're gonna be teaching you how to take ordinary materials and turn it into Nunchucks

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.650
let's dive right in

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.140
okay so right now Devin Graham, and I are at the Home Depot

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.140
We're picking up some materials the materials for this are super super basic piece of wood a little bit of chain some electrical [tape]

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.100
And some Eye bolts over here

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.120
All right start off making your pair of Nunchucks

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.460
We need sticks that are 9 inches long take your doubt mark them off in 9 inch segments and cut as many moves

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.400
you can

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.080
We actually got five different nine-inch sticks out of this that means it will make two and a half pair of nunchucks

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.980
This all you are safety eye protection. [he's] on the waiver right never sign a waiver when you're working with Grant

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.620
So come down make sure it lines up just like that push backwards

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.360
I was holding my breath guys

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.489
Now if you cut them right they should be pretty much level these ones are level these ones are level that's our two-part Nunchucks

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.258
right there one for stuart one for Devin you don't have to worry too much if you got nicks and dents in the rod because

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.009
We're to cover up with electrical cable put your electrical tape with a little bit of an angle

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.169
[just] so that as you turn the dowel it overlaps the piece before it you want to get maybe like a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.430
[eighth] two quarter inch overlap like that. So now if you get somebody spin your dowel

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.970
You can essentially just hold your roll of tape [and] it will feed itself

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.869
But we want to make grant proud so we are going to do our best

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.119
The key here is [just] to keep the spacing about as even as you can you can see I'm overlapping about half the tape

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.289
You can feel probably a little bit more it further. I push away the more stuart turns

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.159
That's a good audience. [if] you don't have a friend to help you if you use an extra dough you can [actually]

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:52.089
Make it easier to wrap around oh, so low then once you get to the end here. We're just going to shout out and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:53.929
Do a couple of loops

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.589
do this around the tip to cover that piece of wood and then we're going to go back the other direction so angle

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.530
It back down the opposite way down the entire length of that Rod

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.270
And then just to keep it clean grab a pair of scissors and some dog

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.059
And now if you look really close, you can [see] they overlap each other

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.810
Problem is the ends are still white and that's where our sharpie comes in the magic happens right now

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.700
Ooh a casualty

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.330
[alright], so we got our sticks wrapped up and painted black the next step now is to attach the eye bolt and cut up the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.690
Chain, so this is the chain that we're looking for this is handy link chain

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.869
It's not too thick and it's got the nice long strands here

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.809
That tell stuff now [Devin] and I got a [two-foot] lengths of chain. We actually [need] four links per Min Chuck

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.429
So we're just going to use a hacksaw and cut off the fifth link to leave these four intact

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.640
So there we go got our link of four

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.330
We got our four links of chain and we need to connect them to these eye bolts

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.239
But the problem is they just don't go together very well

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.989
And not so much wait a minute. Are you getting that the eye bolts have a little bit of a gap in them?

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.479
But it's not nearly big enough to get the chain into we're going to grab opposite sides and just twist in opposite directions

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.079
And it's going to open up just enough of a gap

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.079
we can fit our length of chain into it and if we bite it with the pliers like this we can close that Gap and

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.229
[just] make it a little bit more solid a little bit more permanent and

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.029
[boo-yeah] one of our connections is made now. We just need to do that to the other side same thing

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.720
These eye bolts are number to 10 eye bolts and for them. I'm using a 3/32 inch bit

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.549
We're just going to use this to drill a pilot hole so to make it easier to screw this in without splitting the wood

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.108
You want to have it a little bit deeper than a little bit deeper you're from the math yourself

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.029
Try to get as close to the center as you can just doesn't have to be perfection just has to be close

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.429
We've got our handle made we've got our hole drill

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.840
We've got our chain and the screws connected now just put the two together and begin to twist

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.619
You might need a pair of pliers to help you out because it's going to start hurting your fingers

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.269
If you just keep twisting it'll get to the point where the head of that bolt

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.109
rests into the wood and

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.629
[now] that's in there nice and solid if you want to go one step further you could put a little wood glue into the hole

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.320
And then that will just help the threads the screw bite in a little bit better. and just like that

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.560
A ninja is born

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.840
There's one side done. Let's do the other make sure your nunchuck handles are the same size

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.570
With that final tweaking your set of nunchucks are done

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.619
Some people call these [numbnuts], but they're nunchucks

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.639
[I] haven't seen enough [shots] now black handle by itself looks pretty cool

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.379
But if you add a splash of color to the tops and the bottoms you can really dress it up now, just for fun

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.929
We pick up [four] different roles of colored electrical tape so devon is over here rocking a blue Nunchuck

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.770
This is actually pretty sweet Created By Sid

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.530
So heated blue wraps on the outside with black underneath and stuart did red on the inside with black on the outside

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.559
So you can see you can customize these just about any way

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.260
Yeah, so the electrical tape also doubles is wow that's really Clayton this cannot be good

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.890
Right now it's time to teach you how to use these things

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.860
going to one side and back the other way and

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.540
[just] back and Forth like this

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.499
And if you want to get really [fat] [see] you can start throwing it over our shoulder like this

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.659
And grab [it] with your hand behind the shoulder

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.630
So so one two [three] four and then back and grab [it] now if you want to go one step further you can whip it?

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.110
Around and catch it with the other hand and just people shooting that process for it

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.140
And then you can just use the combination of all those things there

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.630
It's all the rest guy at all the wrist. It's on the [hips] [to] [hahaha]

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.230
Hey, you're kidding

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.129
So here's the thing you gotta remember guys these are weapons. They're not toys, and they may be illegal

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.709
So you want to check your local laws if you make these they're for

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.250
[decoration] only and they got to stay inside your house, you can't take it outside

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.549
It could be considered concealed weapons, so be careful

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.860
Now if you'd [like] to make these at home

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.060
But you're a little bit nervous about chunks of wood flying around there is another option. That's very simple

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.060
Let me show you how they work

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.270
Here's what you're going to do

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.440
You're going to get yourself a piece of pipe insulation foam these cost about a dollar 50 from the [Home] [Depot]

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.959
It's nice and soft and squishy and then a three-quarter inch dowel will fit nicely right into the center

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.659
If you reinforce those with a little electrical tape you can turn your nunchucks into fun chucks. Oh

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.050
There's some pieces of wood oh

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.910
Okay, who do you think would win in a [bow] to [fit] [up]? I'm not talking just straight out fine

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.609
We're talking battle to the death [leave] in the comments below

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.010
So there you have a [guys] that's how to turn common materials from the hardware store [and] a really cool set of Nunchucks

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.430
You customize yourself

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.970
Huge thanks to democrat and the stuart edge for their brilliant ideas bringing this new fresh designs to the table

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:06.040
they have big YouTube channels if you're not prepare with these guys go check out the links in the [description] and give us a

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.140
Subscription love and go make yourself a pair of Nunchucks, but have fun be safe. We'll see in the next video. [Doc] you there

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.560
Grant's the best, so I'm going to actually put this in my office.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.060
Thanks for peace

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.120
