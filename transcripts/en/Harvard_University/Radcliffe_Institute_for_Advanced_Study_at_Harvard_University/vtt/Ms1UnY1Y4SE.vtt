00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.270
- Thank you very much, Judy,
for this warm introduction,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.340
and for pronouncing all
the Greek names right.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.880
That was very impressive.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.900
And thank you to the
Radcliffe Institute

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.370
for giving me the opportunity
to be here this year.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.080
And thank you to
all the Fellows that

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.570
make this year actually
remarkable intellectual

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.070
endeavor.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.870
I have really, really enjoyed
the first couple of months.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.880
I also enjoyed a lot the various
talks that I attended here

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.930
that other Fellows gave.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.971
And I must say that
listening to all these talks,

00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:38.110
I got very stressed preparing
mine, because they were superb.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.180
The second thing is,
because this is not really

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.641
a public talk-- if it
was just a public talk,

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:46.140
I would just show nice pictures,
and movies, and telescopes,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.160
and everybody will be happy.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.770
It is not a professional
talk, because then I

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.180
would show things that I really
do, which look like this.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.250
And this equation
number 56, mind you.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.280
And yet what I consider
this audience to be

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.430
is a group of highly intelligent
and educated intellectuals that

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.790
not only want to know
what we're doing,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.110
but also want to understand
why we're doing it,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.500
and what was the
process that let

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.780
us make the decisions
that we're making.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.760
So what I decided to do is that
the second part of the talk, I

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.810
will focus on this wonderful,
arrogant experiment that

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.220
will allow us to take
the first ever picture

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.990
of an astrophysical black
hole, and allow us to test

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.964
Einstein's theory of gravity.

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:35.380
But I will start the beginning
of the talk, the first part

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.210
of the talk,
effectively giving you

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.220
a history of how those
ideas were developed,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.450
because I want to
make two points.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
One is that some of these
ideas are truly revolutionary.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.100
And the second thing is
that, in order to make truly

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.890
revolutionary ideas in science,
you only have to make small

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.660
but very bold steps, that
you cannot do without.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.390
And this is the kind of point
that I will try to make.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.670
So let's start at
the very beginning--

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.980
a good place to start,
whatever it's called.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.830
And Einstein did most
of his important work

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.580
in the beginning of
the 20th century.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.060
So it's important
to discuss what

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.000
was the landscape of physics at
the end of the Victorian Age,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.080
the end of the 19th century.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.660
And it's fair to say that
most physicists preoccupied

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.620
themselves with
two general ideas.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.090
One is thermodynamics,
which is the physics of heat

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.180
and engines, and the other
is electricity and magnetism,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.750
which is the physics of
cables, electricity, magnetism

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.872
and light.

00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:30.700
And this was a wonderful
time to be a physicist, just

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.240
like today, because
people could actually

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.980
see immediate applications of
those fundamental theories that

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.850
since, remarkably, brought
the Industrial Age,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.100
transportation, quality of
light-- Edison's light bulb--

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.360
and telecommunications,
just like today.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.720
And people became more and
more arrogant by realizing

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.700
how that works.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.550
And the end of the
Victorian Age in physics

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.754
is actually marked by this very
famous speech by Lord Kelvin.

00:02:58.754 --> 00:03:00.420
And you might have
heard the name Kelvin

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.056
by the Kelvin degrees
and temperature scale.

00:03:03.056 --> 00:03:04.680
His name was actually
William Thompson,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.420
and he was the first
Baron of Kelvin.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.000
He gave this talk
in April, 1900,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.900
and he talked about
the status of physics

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.830
at the end of the 19th century.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.640
He called his talk
"Nineteenth Century Clouds

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.260
over the Dynamical Theory
of Heat and Light."

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.880
And he starts by saying that
the beauty and clearness

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.220
of the dynamical theory is at
present obscured by two clouds.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.160
What he really means
to say is that we

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.390
understand all the physical
experiments that we do.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.240
We have two theories that can
tell us absolutely everything.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.350
But there are two
little problems.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.222
And that ends up being a very
shortsighted remark, because it

00:03:39.222 --> 00:03:40.930
turns out that one of
those little clouds

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.689
was the beginning of special
and general relativity.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.980
The other was the beginning
of quantum mechanics, which

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.570
is, of course, the scientific
revolution of the 20th century.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.360
But let's give that to him.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.880
And I'm not going to talk at
all about the quantum mechanics

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.379
aspect.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.810
I'm going to talk about,
starting from this point, why

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.580
one of those clouds led
Einstein to his new theories

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.220
and to black holes.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.530
And that cloud, I would like to
call the relativity of speed.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.040
This is the very
intuitive concept

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.220
that what you assign as speed
to something that is moving

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.649
depends on how fast
you're moving yourself.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.220
This is something that comes
from common experience.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.339
And the easiest way to
demonstrate that is,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.750
I can be sitting on the
top of a mountain in Chile

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.760
looking at the sky
in the telescopes,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.530
and then I can take
a time-lapse movie.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.980
Of course, time is moving much
faster than it naturally does.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.780
You can see the
stars and the galaxy

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.179
coming around, and
moving from east to west.

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:38.970
Now, we don't really
believe that the stars

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.450
are moving from east to west.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.674
What's happening is that we,
ourselves, are taking part

00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:46.090
in the motion of the Earth,
which is the other way around.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.690
And we attribute this motion
as a speed for the stars,

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.900
like it seems as if
the stars are moving.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.130
So what you, yourself, defined
as motion from somebody else

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.500
depends on how much
you're moving yourself.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.530
That was fine.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.520
And all the way until the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.700
pretty much all
phenomena in physics

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.094
seemed to obey that rule.

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:09.260
What you measure as speed
depends on how fast you're

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.980
moving, with one little
cloud-- one little exception,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.070
and that little cloud was light.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.680
There was both
experimental evidence--

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.810
and for those of you who
understand what that is,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.580
I'm not going to say anything.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.050
And there was theoretical
interpretations

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.220
of those experiments by another
famous physicist, James Clerk

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.570
Maxwell, that demonstrated
that when you look at light

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.510
and you try to
measure its speed,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.760
it doesn't matter who
is measuring the speed.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.610
It doesn't matter how fast
you yourself are moving.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.107
You always get the
exact same speed.

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:43.940
And if you spend a
second to think about it,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.460
this is extremely ridiculous.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.240
It's like I'm driving-- the
Garden State is that way-- I'm

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.530
driving up Garden State towards
the hill, and I look outside,

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.680
and I look at the
clouds, and I measure

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.220
the speed with
which they're moving

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.670
backwards towards the square.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.670
I'm happy.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.670
I turn around.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.130
I start driving with the same
speed towards the square.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.370
I look out the window,
and guess what?

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.810
The trees are moving with
the same speed with me

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.406
towards the square.

00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:10.780
That's what it
means that I infer

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.120
the same speed of
an external object,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.000
no matter which way I'm moving.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.514
That clearly is
counter-intuitive.

00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:20.430
And this is something
that bothered scientists

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.670
for a very, very,
very long time--

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.870
several decades-- because
nobody could come up with a way

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.130
to look at science, to look
at the experimental results,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.890
and make sense out of it.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.510
And this is where Einstein came.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.790
In 1905-- what we call
"The Year of Miracles,"

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.520
because he wrote a number of
articles that actually changed,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.990
fundamentally, the course
of physics-- Einstein

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.010
introduced his Special
Theory of Relativity

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.260
to remove that paradox.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.670
A side product of that theory
is his famous equation-- here

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.850
from his manuscript-- E equals
Mc squared plus other terms

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.580
that people usually
don't think about.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.900
But I'm not going to talk
about this particular aspect.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.620
We're talking about the
relativity of speed here.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.930
And what he said is the
following, what is, really,

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.800
speed?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.640
Speed involves space and time.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.820
If I move 100 miles in an hour,
my speed is 100 miles per hour.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.920
Now I want somehow, as
I move as fast as light,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.470
the measurement of speed
and the measurement of time

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.310
to conspire in such a way
that when I take the ratio,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.240
I get the exact same number,
no matter how fast I move.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.050
That's the only way to
explain the problem.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.660
And what does that mean?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.430
It means the measurement of time
and the measurement of distance

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.540
depends on the speed
of the observer.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.880
So suddenly, he took the
relativity out of speed,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.740
and he turned it into the
relativity of space and time.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.980
And that's why he calls it the
Special Theory of Relativity.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.500
Now, that's a little
bit of a misnomer,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.607
because when we think
about theory of relativity,

00:07:56.607 --> 00:07:58.690
not thinking too hard, we
think that Einstein said

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.120
that everything is relative.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.790
Actually, Einstein did
exactly the opposite.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.600
He said, space and
time are relative,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.320
but there is
something absolute--

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.760
the speed of light [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.090
The speed of light is fixed.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.310
And more properly,
the theory should

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.954
have been called "Einstein's
Theory of the Absolute,"

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:18.870
as opposed to Einstein's
Theory of Relativity.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.860
That would have been a
lot more appropriate.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.000
And it turns out that
it's impossible to make

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.976
a physical theory where
everything is relative.

00:08:24.976 --> 00:08:26.350
You always have
to have an anchor

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.760
on which you base things.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.370
And this is the
anchor that he used

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.070
to make his Theory of
Special Relativity.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.280
OK, nothing so far complicated.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.690
But then Einstein realized
that this is a little weird,

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.559
because if everybody
measures a different space

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.650
and a different time, how
can we ever agree on what

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.231
is the result from experiment?

00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:50.480
If I ask you, and you give
me a result, and I ask you,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.146
and you give me a
different measurement,

00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:54.690
how can we ever compare?

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.550
So he actually
became very obsessed,

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.440
and you can see it
in his writings,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.830
making what became
famous, afterwards,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.300
a set of thought experiments--
Gedanken experiments--

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.210
where he would play out many,
many different possibilities

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.374
where he could come up with
a paradox in his ideas.

00:09:11.374 --> 00:09:13.290
And these are very famous
thought experiments,

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.665
because it turns out that
there's no paradox, because you

00:09:15.665 --> 00:09:18.450
can always come up with a very
unique way of communicating

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.770
to people, and comparing
results, and discussing

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.010
your relative difference
in time and space.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:28.160
And the big part of it
is, how do you incorporate

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.499
synchronization of clocks?

00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:31.040
If we have two
clocks, and our clocks

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.330
are moving at different
speed, at what point

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.940
do we share information and tell
each other what is the time?

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.926
So this was the whole idea
of his thought experiment.

00:09:39.926 --> 00:09:42.260
And when I was
reading that stuff,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.370
back when I was an
undergraduate student,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.870
I was always impressed
that Einstein

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.390
was so obsessed with time.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.210
Everything was about
time synchronization

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.210
of clocks in his writings.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.847
And apparently, I
was not the only one.

00:09:52.847 --> 00:09:54.930
Peter Galison, who is a
Professor here at Harvard,

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.550
wrote a beautiful article
in 2000-- many years

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.590
after I was a graduate student,
and I read it soon afterwards--

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.250
where he said he had
the same mission.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.332
He was sitting in
one of-- maybe it

00:10:05.332 --> 00:10:08.102
was Zurich-- one of the
stations in Switzerland.

00:10:08.102 --> 00:10:10.060
Einstein was living in
Switzerland at the time.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.184
And he was surprised that
Einstein was so impressed

00:10:12.184 --> 00:10:14.064
about time and synchronization.

00:10:14.064 --> 00:10:15.980
And then he looked up,
and what do you look up

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.040
when you are in Switzerland?

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.831
You just look at clocks
that are all moving

00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:20.820
at exactly the same time.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.070
And this is actually
from his article.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.297
This is a diagram
of the city of Bern.

00:10:25.297 --> 00:10:26.880
Actually, that's
where Einstein lived.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.250
And all these red
circles are clocks

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.880
on the city that are connected
with an underground electric

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.760
circuit, to make sure they
all show the exact same time.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.122
So it is actually
not that surprising

00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:42.580
that Einstein was obsessed with
clocks and synchronization,

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.477
because he woke up with them.

00:10:45.477 --> 00:10:46.560
He went to work with them.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.434
He went to sleep with
them, and it was always

00:10:48.434 --> 00:10:51.960
part of his life, which I
think is an interesting insight

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.620
about Einstein and his theory.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.450
So Einstein you solved one of
the clouds of the 19th century.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.680
But very soon, he
realized that he actually

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.640
introduced an even worse cloud.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.614
And that is the
fact that there is

00:11:05.614 --> 00:11:07.530
something that was not
working with his ideas,

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.770
and that was gravity.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.560
Why was that a problem?

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.150
Because his whole point of
making the speed of light

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.677
constant required, in
his whole framework,

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.760
that nothing moves faster
than the speed of light.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.800
This is one of the basic
principle of physics

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.547
that we believe in today.

00:11:23.547 --> 00:11:25.380
But there is something
that does move faster

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.710
than the speed of light,
and I would call it

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.700
the speed of gravity.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.360
And I will explain in a
second what that means.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.600
Remember what gravity is?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.520
We have the Earth.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.470
We have the Sun.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.607
And Newton told us the
Earth and the Sun feel

00:11:36.607 --> 00:11:37.820
a gravitational interaction.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.210
One goes around the other.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.400
But the Sun is not fixed.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.620
It is not staying constant.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.730
It's moving in the galaxy.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.180
So somehow, the Sun, with
its gravitational force,

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.980
communicates that
information to the Earth.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.820
And the Earth is
coming around with it.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.570
The Earth is not left
behind from the Sun

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.850
and the motion of the galaxy.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.790
And Newton told us that this
is done instantaneously.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.830
When the Sun moves a
little bit, the Earth

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.210
knows immediately, and
moves together with that.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.120
But that was impossible in
Einstein's new world theory--

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.270
nothing could be
communicated instantaneously.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:17.140
So he spent 11 years
between 1905 and 1916,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.970
very frustrated, working
with serious problems--

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.930
it was during the last two years
during the First World War,

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.130
and at the time he
had moved to Berlin--

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.530
trying to make a
theory of gravity that

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.580
had this finite
speed of propagation.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.590
And he just couldn't.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.830
And we know now why,
because it is impossible.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.150
It is impossible to make
a theory of gravity that

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.140
agrees with all the
experimental data,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.760
and yet to have a finite
speed of propagation.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.040
And that was a big problem.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.610
And Einstein solved it
in a very Einstein way.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.470
And I will explain
that in a second.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.010
He said, "To hell with gravity."

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.000
These are the small,
bold steps that you

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.530
need to make to make
scientific revolutions.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.820
He effectively said,
it doesn't exist.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.651
There's no such
thing as gravity.

00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:06.150
You're going to say
here, OK hold on

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.950
a second-- the whole
point of science

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.029
is experiments in the
world, and you look out,

00:13:10.029 --> 00:13:11.570
and make sure that
everything agrees.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.400
And I can make a
trivial experiment.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.480
I can take my keys,
and I can let them go.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.380
Why did it go down if there
is no such thing as gravity?

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.050
And of course,
this was Einstein,

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.690
so he had a few of those
wonderful thought experiments.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.144
And he said, this
is just an illusion.

00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:33.700
And let me explain what
do I mean by an illusion.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.580
He said, let's think
about it thoroughly.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.092
Let's assume that-- forget
the Earth, and the atmosphere,

00:13:39.092 --> 00:13:40.550
and all the other
potential forces.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:44.320
Let's take two stars, put
them far away from everywhere,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.800
and let them go.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.279
Now, you would
think that if there

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.820
is no such thing as gravity,
the only thing that would happen

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.850
is that they would go
down straight lines,

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.130
because nothing is there
to perturb their motion.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:00.490
And yet, what really happens
is one attracts the other,

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.940
and they eventually
crash to each other.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.060
So you and I would
have looked at that,

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.860
and interpreted that the
straight lines would have

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.420
gone up and down, but
the paths of the objects

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.230
are actually curved.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:19.810
What Einstein said is that
no, these are curved lines.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.170
And the paths of the objects
are actually straight.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.240
And it's just an illusion.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.270
But if they were indeed
straight and parallel,

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.340
how is it possible that
parallel lines cross?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.510
The whole definition of parallel
lines from the ancient Greeks

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.150
is that you send down two
parallel lines, like a railway,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.880
and they never cross.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.260
Is there any way to have two
parallel lines-- illusions

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.420
or no illusions--
that eventually cross?

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.460
And Einstein was very fortunate,
because it actually is true.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.220
That is possible.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.100
And with his friend,
Marcel Grossmann

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.050
that was back in
Switzerland, they actually

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.970
started reading the ideas of
a famous mathematician who

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.870
died extremely young,
Bernard Riemann, who

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.780
wrote an entire thesis
in the mid 1800s

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.500
called, "On the Hypothesis
which Underlies Geometry."

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.060
And Mr. Riemann asked
the simple question,

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.640
is there any way to make
two parallel lines cross?

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.640
Now, it doesn't get
more abstract than that.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.880
He didn't have much
luck explaining that

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.490
in cocktail parties and stuff.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.810
But it ended up being
extremely, extremely useful

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.850
for relativity.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.340
And it's actually
very easy to see why.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.000
I'm going to make a
little demonstration here,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.850
how is it possible to make
two parallel lines cross.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.190
So here's a blowup of
the map of the Earth.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.500
You can recognize the top
part of the North America.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.550
This is the equator.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.370
This is the country of Ecuador.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:47.560
And what I can do is, I can
take two straight parallel lines

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.100
coming out of the Equator.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.650
How do I know they are parallel?

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.450
Because they're both
perpendicular to the Equator.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.984
This is the definition, if
you want, of a parallel line.

00:15:55.984 --> 00:15:57.150
They look nice and parallel.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.040
They don't cross.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.130
But then if I zoom
out, they do cross.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.100
They do cross at the pole.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.150
All the lines that start
parallel in the Equator

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.670
do cross at the pole of the
Earth, and the other side

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.000
as well.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.220
And what that demonstrates--
which is actually

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.790
the whole idea of
Riemann's geometry--

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.700
is that the fact that
parallel lines do not cross

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.740
is true for flat space.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.590
If you draw two parallel
lines down there,

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.920
they will not cross, assuming
that this continues to be flat.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.640
But the minute the space--
or space-time, if you wish--

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.990
gets curved, then things
that start as parallel lines

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.010
eventually cross.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.050
And this was the
remarkable intuition

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.092
that Einstein had-- that
what gravity really is,

00:16:43.092 --> 00:16:45.420
is not a force--
an interaction--

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.030
between particles.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.980
But the minute you put a massive
object in the middle of space,

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.470
that massive object
curves space-time.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.930
It warps space-time
such that the future

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.550
of all the other
objects turn towards

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.910
that big, massive object.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.600
So the reason
gravity works is not

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.460
because things interact
with each other,

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.210
but because they have
turned their futures

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.579
towards each other.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:11.744
This was the fundamental
intuition that Einstein had.

00:17:11.744 --> 00:17:14.119
Now you're going to say we
had a little bit of discussion

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.750
of parallel ways of
interpreting the same reality.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.605
Is that any better,
than Newtonian gravity

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:21.480
other than the fact that
you can make it have

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.970
a finite propagation speed?

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.720
And there was an
obvious interpretation.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.230
If it is parallel
lines that appear bent,

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.120
then anything that follows
parallel lines is going

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.340
to appear attracted by
gravitational objects--

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.200
by anything else.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.500
And light, for
example-- light always

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.620
goes along straight
lines-- will also

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.710
appear as it gets attracted
by massive objects.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.390
Newton did not say
anything about light

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.224
would not even care
about massive objects.

00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:54.765
Light has nothing
to do with gravity.

00:17:54.765 --> 00:17:58.380
But Albert Einstein said, no,
light follows straight lines.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.480
And all straight
lines are curved.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.254
So in this particular
demonstration,

00:18:03.254 --> 00:18:05.170
if you put the Sun in
the middle of space-time

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.410
and you make a curve, and
you put a star behind it,

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.860
then the light from
the star gets bent

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.410
as it goes next to the Sun.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.470
And since we don't know
that this is happening,

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.130
we assume-- this is
our interpretation--

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.170
that the location of the
star has actually moved.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.460
So the central object acts
like a gravitational lens,

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.830
because it lenses the light
to move it in a different way.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.330
That was a prediction that was
written in the original paper

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.504
by Einstein in 1916.

00:18:31.504 --> 00:18:33.920
And very quickly, within three
years-- and the only reason

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.480
it took three years
is because people were

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.021
waiting for the
First World War to be

00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:41.030
over-- English astronomers,
British astronomers,

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.171
went out to a place
where they could have

00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:44.670
a solar eclipse--
because of course,

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.280
if you want to see stars
during the day behind the Sun,

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.220
you need to have
the Sun blocked.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.530
This is the negative from
one of those pictures.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.290
This is the Moon.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.810
This is the solar corona.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.555
And those circles--
you can probably not

00:18:56.555 --> 00:18:58.430
see them-- those are
the location of the four

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.320
stars that they
measured, their position.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.660
They compared with the
positions six months earlier

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.610
when the Sun was in a
very different place.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.160
And they show a displacement.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.680
Not only that, the
displacement was exactly what

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.370
Einstein predicted
in his theory,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.550
given the mass of the Sun.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.540
And that was remarkable news.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.920
Suddenly, we start talking
about curved space-times.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.950
We're talking about
space-times to begin with,

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.950
and Einstein
becomes very famous.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:26.010
And even New York Times reported
the wonderful discovery.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.570
"Lights All Askew
in the Heavens,"

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.490
The New York Times
title, "Stars not where

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.310
they seemed or were calculated
to be, but nobody need worry"--

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.526
whatever.

00:19:35.526 --> 00:19:39.480
"A Book for 12 Wise Men,"
and "No more in all the world

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.980
could comprehend
it," said Einstein,

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.570
when his daring
publisher accepted it.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.778
Of course, this is all bogus.

00:19:43.778 --> 00:19:45.030
None of that ever happened.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:45.750
He published it.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.290
He gave a talk,
and he published it

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.910
in the Proceedings of the
Prussian Academy of Sciences.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.560
But it made a better story.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.170
It's The New York Times.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.840
But the punchline is that
this is, of course, what

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.050
made Einstein a worldwide icon.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:05.700
And you can see his face,
and pretty much all countries

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.340
have one way or another of
demonstrating how much they

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.020
appreciate what he has done.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.380
And this is what I usually show
to talk about Einstein being

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.450
an international icon.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.760
But Halloween two days ago, I
was actually walking around,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.060
and I saw a crazy
scientist dressed up

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.670
with white hair going like that.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.870
And everybody said,
you're a crazy scientist.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:30.750
And Einstein is a household
name and household appearance.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.210
So this was where all
his ideas came from.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.240
And you see, there are
small steps, trying

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.000
to solve one problem at a time.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.130
And you're getting deeper
and deeper and deeper

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.030
down the drain, literally, by
making more and more bold moves

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.460
to make everything work.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.770
But fundamentally, then,
you look at experiments.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.730
And the experiments either
confirm or contradict you.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.230
And for the case of
Einstein, they confirmed it.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.190
But then very
quickly-- actually,

00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:00.500
two years after the discovery
of the development of General

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.470
Relativity-- people started
realizing that you can even

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.240
take that theory to
a higher extreme,

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.240
and say, what if I take a
star and I crunch in so much--

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.880
I make it so small
and dense-- that when

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.800
the light from the
star comes out,

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.880
it gets bent so quickly that
it turns back into the star?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.050
So not even light can escape.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.200
And this is the whole idea of
a black hole-- an object so

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.950
collapsed, so dense, so
gravitationally strong,

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.500
that it does not even
let light escape from it.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.640
And now I'm going
forward 80 years,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.050
because there was an
incredible amount of work--

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.770
both theoretical and
experimental-- people really

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.800
arguing and fighting
this notion,

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.280
because it's in the
extremely counter-intuitive.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.310
Do black holes exist?

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.910
Do black holes get formed?

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.360
How would we know
we see a black hole?

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.440
But with the advent
of modern telescopes

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.650
and modern technology,
there has been multiple ways

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.670
of finding circumstantial
evidence that black holes do

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.630
really exist in the universe.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.260
And in my mind, by far the best
one-- until very recently--

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.600
was the black hole in the
center of our own galaxy.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.732
And how do we know that
such an object exists?

00:22:08.732 --> 00:22:10.940
When you take a picture with
a very large telescope--

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.120
this is from the Caltech
telescope in Hawaii--

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.750
in a particular
wavelength all the way

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.420
at the center of the galaxy,
you see a number of stars.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.970
And don't worry
about the colors,

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.920
because those colors are meant
to demonstrate something else.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.760
And if you take the picture
in 1995, and then one picture

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.890
every now and then,
then what you see

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.420
is that all the stars-- all the
[INAUDIBLE] seven, eight, nine,

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.160
ten, and so on-- all the stars
orbit a very common center,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.720
that of course, has
an asterisk here,

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.570
but there's nothing there.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.736
No light comes out of there.

00:22:43.736 --> 00:22:46.870
This is just to demonstrate
what that common center is.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.179
And you can do the
usual physical exercise

00:22:49.179 --> 00:22:50.720
that an undergraduate
student can do,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.940
and infer how big is the mass of
that object in the center that

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.190
attracts all of them
and makes them orbit?

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.500
It turns out to be
equal to 4 million times

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.930
the mass of our Sun.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.280
Now, you have an object
here that is 4 million times

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.700
the mass of the Sun.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.350
And yet it's not as
luminous-- not as bright--

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.790
than any of those single stars.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.040
You want to confine 4
million stars in a place

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.480
and make them not
produce any light.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.110
And it turns out
that the only object

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.270
that we know astrophysically,
or physically,

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.470
or that we can envision, that
could do that is a black hole,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.150
and nothing else.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.901
So this has been,
until very recently

00:23:28.901 --> 00:23:30.900
with the discovery of
gravitational waves, which

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.100
I'm going to talk about, the
best evidence that there is

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.080
something very massive
and very black--

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.840
a black hole-- in the
center of our galaxy.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:48.140
So what we wanted to do is,
like Thomas from the Bible,

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.870
is we wanted to see
it to believe it.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.070
So several of us
decided that we really

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.230
want to take a picture of that--
an actual, real picture of that

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.940
empty space in the middle of
the galaxy, and see is it really

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.864
a black hole.

00:24:02.864 --> 00:24:04.780
And of course, the
question that you're asking

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.050
is, how big that
hole is meant to be?

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.450
What it will be like taking
a picture of a black hole?

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.180
And I can give you numbers, but
they're so small that I cannot

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.590
even understand what
these numbers really mean.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.230
And the simple similarity
that I can make

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.150
is, I can say it's equivalent of
taking a picture of a doughnut.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.330
So this is a hole, and
there's stuff around it.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.510
This is what [INAUDIBLE]
we expect the black hole

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.720
to look like.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.592
However that doughnut is
going to be extremely small,

00:24:29.592 --> 00:24:30.800
because it's really far away.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.400
It's at the center
of the galaxy.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.769
And how small would it be?

00:24:33.769 --> 00:24:35.810
It will be like taking a
picture of that doughnut

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.620
on the surface of the Moon.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.640
This is how small
it's going to look.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.160
Now, I'm sure you've all
seen pictures of the Moon.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.190
And I don't think you've
seen anything as small

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.630
as a doughnut in any of them.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.340
No current camera,
no current telescope,

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.620
has a resolution like that.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.900
And therefore, you
had to think way out

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.580
of the box of how
to make that happen.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.550
Keep that thought.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.500
The second thing is,
what does it really

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.590
mean to take a picture
of a black hole?

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.240
What is a hole?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.287
What would the hole look like
on an empty sky, on a black sky?

00:25:09.287 --> 00:25:10.370
It will look like nothing.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.240
You won't be able
to see anything.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.600
But the galaxy is
never really black.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.770
There's always clouds.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:16.770
There's always plasma.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.990
There's always hot matter
that is orbiting around.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.930
And all those stars that
orbit the black hole

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.299
spew out a lot of
that hot matter.

00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:25.590
So if you look at the right
part in the electromagnetic

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.600
spectrum, you might be
able to see the silhouette.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.940
You might be able to see
the shadow, the hole,

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.660
in the bright background
to the diffuse emission.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.340
And when I was talking before
about how would it look,

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.799
of course, nobody
had any intuition.

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:43.340
But I think a lot of you might
have a little intuition of how

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.050
a black hole would look, for
those-- I guess this is not

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.630
the right crowd for this joke.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.100
So in Interstellar is a movie.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.071
Movies are things
that you go and watch.

00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:51.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:57.960
We have a few movie
directors in this audience.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.940
But there was a movie that
became pretty well known

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.750
in the sci-fi genre a
couple of years ago.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.310
It's called Interstellar with
a couple of famous actors.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.284
And what they did is eventually,
they go into a black hole.

00:26:11.284 --> 00:26:12.700
And this is what
the black hole is

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.580
supposed to look in their case.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.350
There's a lot of
plasma material around,

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.010
and the shadow of the
black hole in the middle.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.510
Now, for some reason they wanted
to make it very realistic.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.260
And they asked one
of the, actually,

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.760
fathers of black
hole astrophysics--

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.680
his name is Kip Thorne
from Caltech-- to help them

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.400
out, write all the
various equations,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.090
and do the real calculation
with Einstein gravity

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.727
and lensing and everything
of how black hole looks like.

00:26:37.727 --> 00:26:39.810
I don't know why, because
when I go to the movies,

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.550
I don't care how
realistic it looks like.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.966
When I go to Harry
Potter, I'm not

00:26:42.966 --> 00:26:44.830
asking why a hippogriff works.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.250
Maybe Michelle
likes those things.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.690
I don't know, she gave a talk
about that the other day.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.520
But what I found
very fascinating,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.340
related to our work, is this
quote from a Wired Magazine

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.730
discussion about the
movie Interstellar,

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.820
where they say that some
individual frames took

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.620
up to 100 hours to render,
the computation overtaxed

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.440
by the bendy bits
of distortion caused

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.540
by the Einsteinian effect
called "gravitational lensing."

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.540
Each one of those frames
in the movie-- and this

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.780
is high frame rate-- took
them more than 100 hours

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.581
to render with the
correct physics.

00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:19.080
And that has actually
been a problem

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.150
that we've been dealing
with, because we want to know

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.420
what would the black hole
look like in order to train

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.260
our telescopes to look at them?

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.040
And we were always
confined by the fact

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.794
that computers were
not fast enough.

00:27:31.794 --> 00:27:33.210
Because what you
want is, you want

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.820
to send millions and millions
and millions of light rays

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.310
into a simulation, just like
a weather simulation of what

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.580
happens around the black hole,
and turn it into an image.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.080
And that was extremely
computationally complicated.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.810
So something that we did
that made a very, very

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.580
big difference at the University
of Arizona in our group

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.300
is, we realized that each
one of our computers--

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.440
and even each one
of our cellphones--

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.330
actually has a
specialized microchip that

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.660
allows you to do very, very
quickly rendering of images.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.960
It's called a graphics
processing card, a graphics

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.920
card.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.060
And because of
computer gaming, they

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.856
have actually been
developed so quickly

00:28:12.856 --> 00:28:15.230
that if you care to do nothing
else other than rendering,

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.480
they can do it remarkably fast.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.830
So what we did is,
we hacked into it.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.980
And we added a black hole.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.010
Why not?

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.950
And this is the
hand of our post-doc

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.520
who actually did
most of that work.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.500
And we let the graphics card of
the computer do the rendering.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.270
So we provided the information,
and had the graphics chip

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.140
of the computer to do it.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.600
And our code became--
our computer algorithms--

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.310
became so fast that now, we
don't show animations that

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.040
come out of our simulations.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.850
We actually show, running in
real time, the simulations.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:52.060
And not only that, but they're
so fast that [INAUDIBLE] who

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.430
does that cannot type fast
enough commands in order

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.710
to make them-- to stop it,
start it, and everything else.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:02.270
So he has a little interface
he has called a "leap pad."

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.080
It is like the X-Box
that you can actually

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.000
control the simulation
with his hands,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.710
like Minority Report style.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.270
And so you will see
what will happen.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.420
This is the black hole.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.774
It's on YouTube as
well, with some music,

00:29:13.774 --> 00:29:14.690
if you want to see it.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:15.900
So this is the black hole.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.705
And he's going to throw a
wall of 1,000 light rays.

00:29:19.705 --> 00:29:21.330
And as they go close
to the black hole,

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.900
they're going to
get scattered away.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.450
And he's going to stop it,
explore it, do various things

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:26.760
that he wants to do.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.060
So there he is.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.200
This motion says,
"Start the simulation."

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.580
There's the one--
million light rays.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.680
He stopped it.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.240
He you can turn it around, all
real time as the calculations

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.410
happen.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.390
He can zoom it in.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.702
These are all the lights.

00:29:44.702 --> 00:29:45.660
This is the black hole.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.326
It's about to cross
into the black hole.

00:29:47.326 --> 00:29:49.090
It turns very red,
gets scattered,

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.130
gets a particular structure.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.430
So he can move it all around.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.820
He can go forward in time.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.450
He can go backwards in time.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.010
This is the kind
of ways that we're

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.480
using this particular
interfaces,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.490
and the extreme rapid algorithms
that we developed to understand

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.380
what happens to light
close to a black hole,

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.050
and make appropriate
predictions.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:16.040
Now I think this goes
on for [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.880
He has forward in time,
backwards in time.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.530
It's mesmerizing, isn't it?

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:22.655
Imagine doing it yourself.

00:30:22.655 --> 00:30:25.170
So sometimes, I come
and do it here in front.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:27.916
But I usually fail, because
while you're talking,

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:29.540
you're [INAUDIBLE]
and it doesn't work.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.750
So I just thought the YouTube
video is a little better.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.596
And the joke that
we had-- we actually

00:30:34.596 --> 00:30:36.970
had a press release about
Interstellar when it came out--

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.040
is that it's great
with that movie,

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.890
but we can literally
do it faster just

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.930
by waving our hands.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.850
Waving your hands
in science means

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.830
without putting any effort.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.080
In any case, a
science, internal joke.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.790
So of course, we didn't want
to just use our laptops,

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.830
because if we can do
it so fast in a laptop,

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.560
imagine if you actually built
thousands of those graphics

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.430
cards, and make a supercomputer
out of those graphics cards.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:06.050
So we built a special-purpose
supercomputer just

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.630
for that project.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:09.672
And this is people
putting it together

00:31:09.672 --> 00:31:10.880
at the University of Arizona.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.810
And when we put it
together, we actually

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.790
became number seven in
the fastest supercomputing

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:20.300
per wattage of power used in the
world, which we were very, very

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:20.800
impressed.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.372
No other institution other
than Cambridge University,

00:31:23.372 --> 00:31:25.330
and definitely not an
institution in the United

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:29.870
States had, at the time, a
supercomputer that was so fast.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.100
And we were very
happy, because now we

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.249
can throw the plasma
into the black hole.

00:31:34.249 --> 00:31:36.040
We can throw the light
into the black hole.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.130
We can throw everything,
and the kitchen sink,

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.337
and calculate a truly
realistic simulation

00:31:42.337 --> 00:31:44.920
of what we think the black hole
in the center of the Milky Way

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.910
will look like.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.350
This is weather-like.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.310
This is turbulent.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.500
This is very variable.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.130
This is hydrodynamic.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.200
This is full of clouds
and everything else

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.727
that you can imagine.

00:31:56.727 --> 00:31:59.060
You see also, we change the
orientation of the observer,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.940
so you see it
moving up and down.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.710
You see primarily the motion
of the streaming of the plasma

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:04.461
as it goes around.

00:32:04.461 --> 00:32:05.960
You see the black
hole shadow, which

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.290
is right here in the middle.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.680
And you see those
two big-- that's

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.540
the black hole [INAUDIBLE]
because it is very rapidly

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.100
rotating.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.980
And it gets some of the matter,
and some of the matter blows

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.880
out.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.820
And these are the
kind of simulations

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.510
that we're looking at.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.860
It turns out that by looking
very carefully at what

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.280
that shape and the
size of that shadow is,

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.960
this is where we're doing all
the tests of Einstein's theory,

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.520
because that shadow tells you
what the gravitational field

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.820
around the black hole is.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.320
And by doing all
those measurements,

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.390
we can see whether Einstein
was really 100% right or not.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.990
But one of the
reasons that we did

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.100
all of those
numerical experiments

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.930
is because we
wanted to know what

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.310
is the optimal place in the
electromagnetic spectrum

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.230
to look at?

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.230
Because it's not enough
to have a big telescope.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.271
And I haven't told you
anything about telescopes.

00:32:54.271 --> 00:32:55.490
We're doing theory here.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.240
It's not enough to see what
the black hole will look like.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.722
You also need to look
at the right place.

00:33:00.722 --> 00:33:02.430
And there's a number
of coincidences that

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.565
need to happen, if you wish.

00:33:04.565 --> 00:33:06.190
The atmosphere needs
to be transparent.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:08.640
And the atmosphere is not
transparent in all parts

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.370
of electromagnetic
spectrum, otherwise

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.350
the x-rays from the Sun will
have completely evaporated us a

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:14.760
long, long time ago.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.420
The galaxy needs
to be transparent

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.770
all the way to the center.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.730
And again, that puts
a lot of constraints.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.720
And the plasma
around the black hole

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.080
needs to be very transparent.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.740
And if you look at a
slightly different part

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.050
of electromagnetic spectrum--
and this is, for example,

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.842
at 3 centimeters
wavelength-- then you

00:33:31.842 --> 00:33:33.550
wouldn't see the shadow
of the black hole

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.680
that I showed you before.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.950
But you see this fog
of plasma around it.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.970
And this is a result
of our simulation.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.650
But this turns out to be
the very first project

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.740
that I did as a post-doctoral
fellow here at Harvard,

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.130
when I came in 1997.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.914
This is a very dear
project to my heart.

00:33:51.914 --> 00:33:54.080
One reason-- because I love
black hole astrophysics.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.940
And the other reason is
because I did it together

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.330
with a graduate student
at the time, who

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.830
ended up being my future wife.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.602
So this is a very,
very wonderful project.

00:34:01.602 --> 00:34:03.810
And she is, actually, right
now giving a similar talk

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:08.540
at the University of
Chicago, across the country.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.719
But this is what you
would have gotten

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.912
if you made the observation
at 3 centimeters.

00:34:12.912 --> 00:34:14.370
But if you look at
a different part

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.420
of the electromagnetic
spectrum, what you see

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.940
is the fog becomes more,
and more, and more,

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.750
and more transparent.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.750
And if you pick the wavelength
of observation right,

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:27.139
you will see the black
hole shadow popping out.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:30.540
So the reason that we did all
those computational numerical

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.639
models is to actually
identify what

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:35.699
is the optimal place
to look at that shadow.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:38.860
But again, theory-- in
theory, everything is fine.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.969
In practice, it isn't.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.770
And what made the next
big technological leap,

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:50.790
or next big transition, is the
demonstration in 2008, using

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.969
only three telescopes--
one in Hawaii,

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.710
one California, and
one outside of Tucson,

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.670
combined together
as a big telescope,

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.030
the size of this
entire triangle--

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.070
by a number of people
led by Shep Doeleman,

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.270
who is the PI of the
project right now, who

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.450
turned those three
telescopes to the black hole

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.690
in the center of the galaxy.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:09.570
It was small enough.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.160
It was only through telescopes
very close together.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.950
They could not take
an image, but they

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.860
could measure the size.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.580
And they demonstrated
that the size

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.080
is comparable to the
black hole's shadow,

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.150
and everything in
between is transparent.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:25.810
And that has been a
remarkable demonstration,

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.800
that all these ideas, all
those theories, everything

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.970
that we all talked about,
is actually something that

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.060
has a possibility of working.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:33.900
Was I right?

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.990
Not "will work," "has a
possibility of working."

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.480
So a number of
people got together

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.824
at MIT Haystack
Observatory in 2010.

00:35:39.824 --> 00:35:41.490
Shep, in the meantime,
moved to Harvard.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.250
He is now at
Harvard Observatory.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.610
But of course, the more
people got excited,

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.880
the more and more people
joined the collaboration.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.010
So when something
becomes hot, everybody

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:51.990
likes to be part of it.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.550
So we hosted the inaugural
meeting in Tucson

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.280
in 2012-- nice,
beautiful weather.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.170
The next one was in November,
2015 in Canada-- horrible snow.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.260
The third meeting is actually
the week after Thanksgiving

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.410
here in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, down the river

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.100
someplace, where
we're all getting

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.020
ready for that experiment.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.059
Now of course, as
the group of people

00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:16.600
becomes bigger and
bigger-- and these

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.240
are people from all universities
all around the country--

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:24.330
I found that has been extremely
complicated and remarkable

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.510
to get different people
from different backgrounds,

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.250
ethnic backgrounds, social
backgrounds, and everything

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.720
else, agreeing on how to
do a single experiment.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.780
And to quote my
wife, I would say

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:39.570
that I don't mind dealing
with the complex mathematics

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.400
of the universe.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.230
It's people that I don't get.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.860
And if you actually work on
the sociology of science,

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.700
please come and
study us, and tell me

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.430
what the answer is at the end.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.960
But somehow, we manage to
make this whole thing work.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.160
Now, the reason that, of course,
it took some time since 2008

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.984
is because they used
only three telescopes.

00:36:57.984 --> 00:36:59.400
We're not building
new telescopes,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.520
because these are extremely
expensive processes,

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.200
and nobody has the money.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.980
But people go to every
single radio telescope that

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.780
exists around the
globe, and outfit it

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.090
with the proper equipment
to do that observation

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:12.710
in the proper wavelength.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.580
And this is one
of our colleagues,

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.560
Dan Marrone, his finger
pointing out the radio receiver.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.660
Everything is gold plated.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.630
Everything is highly
calibrated, highly put together.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:26.490
You build it at the
basement of the university.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:29.280
Then you transport
it to the telescope.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.339
This is the Large Millimeter
Telescope at Volcan in Mexico.

00:37:33.339 --> 00:37:35.380
And this is Shep Doeleman,
the PI of the project,

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.262
inserting something in one of
the mirrors in the telescope,

00:37:38.262 --> 00:37:39.220
trying to get it ready.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.960
This is from The New York Times.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.850
Some of the telescopes are
easier to reach than others.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.680
Judy talked about the
one, the ALMA in Chile,

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.694
which is almost at the
base camp level of Everest.

00:37:50.694 --> 00:37:52.110
It turns out that
there's one that

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.680
is even more difficult to reach,
and that is the South Pole

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.220
telescope, which is actually at
the very center of Antarctica.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.000
It's a wonderful place
to do observations,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.279
if you can make it there.

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.070
And this is our colleague,
Dan [? Maron, ?]

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.200
who shows that he is
really good with weather.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.380
He left his parka out, and
this is the South Pole.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.755
And this is the
little instrument

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:11.977
that he was building before.

00:38:11.977 --> 00:38:13.310
And that's his graduate student.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.518
And we were all joking that
he didn't leave him there

00:38:15.518 --> 00:38:16.630
at the end of the day.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:20.240
So what happened
in the last 8 years

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.910
is a remarkable convergence
of about 150 people

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.920
all around the world to
build all the telescopes that

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.390
are required, all
the instruments

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:32.567
that are acquired, literally
transformed them by hand,

00:38:32.567 --> 00:38:34.400
and installed them in
every single telescope

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.750
that is required.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.350
And that's how we got
together the Event Horizon

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.680
Telescope, which has telescopes
anywhere from Hawaii--

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:48.196
those two-- Northern California,
Tucson, Arizona, Mexico, ALMA

00:38:48.196 --> 00:38:50.500
in Chile, the South
Pole Telescope, which

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.410
is down here, APEX,
which is also in Chile,

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:58.950
and two telescopes in the
French Alps and in the Pyrenees.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.630
And all of those telescopes
are, as we speak,

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:04.190
completely outfitted
ready to turn.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:06.925
And the only thing that they're
waiting for is for the galactic

00:39:06.925 --> 00:39:09.550
center to come from the backside
of the sun, because right now,

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.790
the galactic center is behind
the sun, and you cannot see it.

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.660
And that will happen
this coming April.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.660
So we are at the point
where everything is ready.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.860
We're all keeping
our fingers crossed.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.330
We're hoping that
very soon, this

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.880
is a simulated image that will
come out of the Event Horizon

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.550
Telescope, given the best
that we know about how

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.100
the instruments
are going to work,

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.674
and how the weather
is going to work.

00:39:31.674 --> 00:39:33.090
We're keeping our
fingers crossed.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:34.792
And we're hoping
that very soon, this

00:39:34.792 --> 00:39:36.500
won't be a result of
simulation, but this

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.690
will be a real first
picture of a black hole

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:39.940
in the center of the galaxy.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.660
Thank you very much.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.660
