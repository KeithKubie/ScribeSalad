00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.221
- [Announcer] This UCSD-TV
program is presented by

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:06.599
University of California Television.

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:21.224
(piano music)

00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:25.709
- [Man] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:28.042
Bipedal, naked, large brain.

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:35.100
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.300
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.608
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:44.775
yet, filled with optimism.

00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:47.397
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:50.834
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.917
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.112
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:57.112 --> 00:00:58.112
of the past.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:03.566
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:07.733
to exchange insights on who
we are, and how we got here.

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:13.463
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans,

00:01:13.463 --> 00:01:14.296
like you.

00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:32.964
(soft piano music)

00:01:59.612 --> 00:02:01.652
- One out of every four deaths, basically,

00:02:01.652 --> 00:02:05.001
in the US and the UK,
are from heart disease,

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.180
so it's basically the number one killer,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.439
not just in the industrialized world,

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:13.522
and a major source of cost
burning our healthcare system,

00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:16.503
but also, around the world, including

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:19.300
in the developing world,
that heart disease

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.761
and its more insidious form
of it, atherosclerosis,

00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:25.671
is the source of every
three out of 10 deaths

00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:27.380
around the world today.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.841
So it's so familiar to us
that the obvious question is,

00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:35.008
well, is atherosclerosis
really a universal aspect

00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:39.032
of just human aging, it's
sort of an inevitable aspect,

00:02:39.032 --> 00:02:40.866
by the time you're 20,
you probably already have

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:43.146
some of the fatty streaks
that will later go on

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:45.513
to become more complicated lesions

00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:48.240
and create problems for us,
or is that not the case?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.317
And so, maybe atherosclerosis is some,

00:02:51.317 --> 00:02:54.998
the process is universal,
but maybe it does or does not

00:02:54.998 --> 00:02:57.264
always present clinical manifestations

00:02:57.264 --> 00:02:58.986
that will affect our morbidity,

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:00.678
and ultimately, mortality.

00:03:00.678 --> 00:03:03.929
So, a standard story is
that if we could zoom back

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.174
into the past and look
at hunter-gatherers,

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:09.199
that hunter-gatherers wouldn't have

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.247
these types of heart disease,
or other types of problems,

00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:15.392
and that it's modern
features of our lifestyle

00:03:15.392 --> 00:03:17.633
that is making us ill,
that there's a mismatch

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:20.165
between our genetic adaptions,

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.818
and modern features of lifestyle.

00:03:22.818 --> 00:03:26.068
So, changes in our nutrition, our diet,

00:03:26.988 --> 00:03:30.337
our physical activity, our
bad habits, as Barbara said,

00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:33.907
like cigarette smoking,
and alcohol consumption,

00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:36.251
that these are maybe
what create the problem,

00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.075
and that hunter-gatherers
would have little

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:40.889
or no coronary heart disease.

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.347
And the evidence for this is often

00:03:43.347 --> 00:03:45.334
focused on some risk factors, so,

00:03:45.334 --> 00:03:49.084
cholesterol, type 2
diabetes, low prevalence,

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:54.534
that their risk factors seem
to suggest a healthy heart.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.474
But there's some problems here, is that,

00:03:56.474 --> 00:04:00.826
we don't really know, that in
these types of populations,

00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:03.386
that heart disease is fairly
absent, there could be,

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:06.050
first of all, the
numbers are fairly small,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.726
and often, there'd be a
medical team like in the 1950s

00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:11.510
or '60s that would
sweep through a village,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.760
but fairly quickly, and so, it could be

00:04:15.947 --> 00:04:17.652
that people who have heart disease

00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:20.347
die fairly quickly from it,
and so unless you've spent

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:23.166
a long time in an area,
you might not actually see

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:26.604
the real cases, if the case
fatality rate is quite high,

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:28.761
and it could be that those people

00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:30.971
get weeded out of the population early,

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.393
and so if you looked at
people over the age of 60,

00:04:33.393 --> 00:04:35.641
no one has heart disease,
maybe because they died

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.289
earlier on in life.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.078
But also, the assessment
is fairly indirect,

00:04:40.078 --> 00:04:43.956
as I mentioned, it's easy to
take someone's blood pressure,

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:46.837
to measure how much cholesterol they have,

00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:49.167
to measure their BMI, but it's much harder

00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:51.479
to get a direct assessment, and of course,

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.487
if certain risk factors work differently

00:04:53.487 --> 00:04:55.134
in different human populations,

00:04:55.134 --> 00:04:57.314
then it might not be a 1:1 relationship

00:04:57.314 --> 00:04:58.850
that the risk factors tell you

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.299
about the actual underlying heart disease.

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:05.129
And one good example, from the '70s,

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.917
it became established fact, almost,

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:10.834
that the Inuit of the arctic north,

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.942
in Alaska and Greenland, in particular,

00:05:13.942 --> 00:05:16.633
that they don't have atherosclerosis,

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:18.038
and they don't have heart disease,

00:05:18.038 --> 00:05:20.826
and that, in particular,
their marine-rich diet,

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:25.167
and particularly omega-3s,
was one good reason why,

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:26.795
despite a very meat-based diet,

00:05:26.795 --> 00:05:29.204
that they would not have heart disease,

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.530
but it actually turns out, there was some

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.404
unreliable mortality statistics

00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:35.727
that some of those earlier
inferences were based on,

00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:38.090
and further x-ray and ultrasound studies

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.756
actually showed the
opposite, that there is

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.736
quite a decent amount of atherosclerosis,

00:05:42.736 --> 00:05:44.777
and that heart disease didn't
really look that different

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:47.197
from near surrounding populations,

00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:49.743
and that stroke might even be higher,

00:05:49.743 --> 00:05:52.433
and also, more recent meta-analyses show

00:05:52.433 --> 00:05:56.163
no effect of omega-3 fish
oils on heart-related deaths,

00:05:56.163 --> 00:05:59.128
heart attacks and strokes,
so the standard story

00:05:59.128 --> 00:06:00.156
is actually a little bit different

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:02.619
when you look into it in more detail.

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:05.614
And also, The Horus Group, which we'll see

00:06:05.614 --> 00:06:08.282
a little bit more further in the talk,

00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:11.573
looked at a unique sample of 137 mummies

00:06:11.573 --> 00:06:14.399
across four world regions, so,

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:19.154
Ancient Egypt, Ancient Peru,
the southwest of the US,

00:06:19.154 --> 00:06:23.753
and the Aleutian Islands, and
across 4,000 years of history,

00:06:23.753 --> 00:06:25.817
and they looked at different arterial beds

00:06:25.817 --> 00:06:28.246
for evidence of calcification,

00:06:28.246 --> 00:06:31.491
so a more direct measure, using CT scans,

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.870
whole-body CT scans of these mummies,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.202
so for example, here you've got,

00:06:36.202 --> 00:06:39.749
these are both two Unangan
women from the Aleutian Islands,

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.346
up here it's woman about
50, here, a woman about 30,

00:06:43.346 --> 00:06:46.071
and you can see some
evidence of calcification

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:47.716
in the aortic arch up on the top,

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:50.854
and in the carotid artery
down here on the bottom,

00:06:50.854 --> 00:06:54.628
and what they found was
evidence of calcification

00:06:54.628 --> 00:06:58.855
across all arterial beds,
across all four populations.

00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:02.231
And so they argued that,
their conclusion was that,

00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:05.227
"We found that heart
disease is a serial killer

00:07:05.227 --> 00:07:08.369
"that has been stalking
mankind for thousands of years.

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:11.087
"The presence of atherosclerosis
in premodern human beings

00:07:11.087 --> 00:07:13.992
"suggests that the disease
is an inherent component

00:07:13.992 --> 00:07:16.350
"of human aging, and not characteristic

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.887
"of any specific diet or lifestyle."

00:07:18.887 --> 00:07:21.276
So now, the paleo diet
people hated this, right?

00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:23.030
Because they were basically saying,

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.861
"Look, it's all over, it
doesn't matter what you eat,

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.833
"we find evidence of this everywhere."

00:07:27.833 --> 00:07:29.631
But of course, all the
mummies had been long dead,

00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:32.089
so it's hard to know what
they actually died of,

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:33.842
and whether that atherosclerosis

00:07:33.842 --> 00:07:36.804
might've been relevant
to their daily lives.

00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:40.102
Now, also, free-riding off of Ajit's talk,

00:07:40.102 --> 00:07:43.001
we now know that chimpanzees,
while the number one cause

00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:46.939
of death in captives is heart attacks,

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:49.981
it's not exactly coming
from the same ideology

00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:51.898
as human heart attacks.

00:07:53.095 --> 00:07:54.600
That chimpanzees do not seem to have

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.759
the same kind of atherosclerosis,

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:59.096
coronary artery disease is rare,

00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:02.535
but the heart failure instead
is diffused interstitial

00:08:02.535 --> 00:08:06.902
myocardial fibrosis, often
triggered by arrhythmias.

00:08:06.902 --> 00:08:11.069
You can see the fused
fibrosis in the heart tissue

00:08:12.168 --> 00:08:16.335
in chimpanzees, the kind
of subendothelial plaques

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:21.917
in the human interior lumen,
that this is very different,

00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:24.627
and in captive chimpanzees,
despite the fact

00:08:24.627 --> 00:08:26.483
that they have higher cholesterol levels,

00:08:26.483 --> 00:08:30.468
they're homozygous for
alleles in the ApoE4

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:34.393
that are higher risk of
atherosclerosis in humans,

00:08:34.393 --> 00:08:38.494
and less physical activity, so,
quite remarkable difference.

00:08:38.494 --> 00:08:42.376
So, now the standard evolutionary story

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:46.126
brought to us by some
evolutionary biologists

00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:51.840
made critical foundational
contributions, Medawar,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.507
as well as Haldane and Hamilton,

00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:57.538
that basically, that
the force of selection

00:08:57.538 --> 00:09:00.842
declines with age, as
fertility is dropping,

00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:02.884
so, the relative contributions

00:09:02.884 --> 00:09:05.559
for future generations are declining,

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:09.301
and so you can have
mutations that exert effects

00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:12.245
late in life, that might be somewhat blind

00:09:12.245 --> 00:09:14.400
to the effects of natural selection,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.961
especially if they have
beneficial effects early in life.

00:09:17.961 --> 00:09:21.309
So what that means is that
you've got deleterious effects

00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:24.334
that manifest, say, later in life,

00:09:24.334 --> 00:09:27.163
fall under the selection shadow,

00:09:27.163 --> 00:09:29.430
and it actually turns out,
when you actually look

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.659
at the cases, this is from US data,

00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:34.390
the actual incidence of heart attacks

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.612
and fatal coronary heart disease,

00:09:36.612 --> 00:09:41.502
that those cases do fall
into this selection shadow,

00:09:41.502 --> 00:09:44.790
so one knee-jerk response
is, well, maybe, again,

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.803
these things have always been with us,

00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:49.342
but in hunter-gatherers,
if you're not gonna live

00:09:49.342 --> 00:09:52.203
to this kind of age range,
then you're not gonna see

00:09:52.203 --> 00:09:55.106
these types of ailments,
and so death might be

00:09:55.106 --> 00:09:57.339
the end of story, and
that our longer lives

00:09:57.339 --> 00:10:00.641
in modern society's why we
see so much more of it today.

00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:02.359
But that doesn't really
seem to be the case.

00:10:02.359 --> 00:10:05.174
If we take some of the best
demographic data out there

00:10:05.174 --> 00:10:08.242
in hunter-gatherers, as kind of a key,

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:09.642
obviously, living hunter-gatherers

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:12.239
are not the same as our ancestors,

00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:14.248
but it's the closest thing we have

00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:18.307
to try to understand what life
and mortality might be like,

00:10:18.307 --> 00:10:20.511
without all the modern amenities.

00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:22.678
And so, in hunter-gatherers,
where the average

00:10:22.678 --> 00:10:26.334
life expectancy at birth
is in the either high 20s

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:29.478
or low 30s, compared to
what we're used to in the US

00:10:29.478 --> 00:10:33.488
and other first world countries,
is a dramatic difference!

00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:35.779
But if you notice, this is
the ratio of the mortality

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.066
in hunter-gatherers, to
say the American mortality,

00:10:39.066 --> 00:10:41.293
and it's quite high, the difference,

00:10:41.293 --> 00:10:44.197
but most of those differences
are early in life,

00:10:44.197 --> 00:10:47.474
and that by the time
you get to, say, age 15,

00:10:47.474 --> 00:10:50.726
the mortality differences drop
from, say, 200 early in life,

00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:53.635
to 14 times higher in hunter-gatherers,

00:10:53.635 --> 00:10:56.843
to about age 40, seven times
higher in hunter-gatherers,

00:10:56.843 --> 00:10:58.769
and by age 60, that mortality difference

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:00.919
is only three times higher.

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:04.777
Now, so if you live past this early period

00:11:04.777 --> 00:11:07.775
of high mortality, and
you survive to age 15,

00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:10.093
the modal age of adult death is actually,

00:11:10.093 --> 00:11:13.396
it ranges from 68 to 78,
in these hunter-gatherer

00:11:13.396 --> 00:11:15.043
populations.

00:11:15.043 --> 00:11:17.310
So, it's not probably the case

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.440
that the absence of older people

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.262
is why we don't see
these types of problems

00:11:22.262 --> 00:11:24.925
presenting these kinds of populations.

00:11:24.925 --> 00:11:26.509
So I wanted to move beyond mortality,

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:28.581
and actually look at living bodies to see,

00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:31.264
well, okay, do people actually have

00:11:31.264 --> 00:11:32.679
some more direct evidence?

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:35.894
And so since I mentioned, since 1999,

00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:39.471
we've been working in
central lowland Bolivia,

00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:43.307
with the Tsimane, so again,
a horticulturalist population

00:11:43.307 --> 00:11:46.011
that share many similarities
with hunter-gatherers,

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:48.821
their fertility's quite
high, they're fairly high

00:11:48.821 --> 00:11:51.795
pathogen load, most of their diet,

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:54.155
if not all their diet, is
basically coming from the land,

00:11:54.155 --> 00:11:58.322
from fish, from their fields,
and also, from wild game.

00:12:00.017 --> 00:12:03.345
And so, taking advantage
of the French government

00:12:03.345 --> 00:12:05.928
donating a 16-slice CT scanner,

00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:11.968
just a mere 10 hours and
several days in a canoe away,

00:12:14.577 --> 00:12:17.426
we brought people to the CT scanner

00:12:17.426 --> 00:12:21.774
to get a more direct
measure of atherosclerosis,

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:26.110
through looking at coronary
arterial calcification,

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.187
based on thoracic CT scans.

00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:34.083
And, what we found, so
using the exact same methods

00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:38.250
for scoring as in US studies,
when we compared Americans

00:12:39.722 --> 00:12:42.331
to the Tsimane, it
actually turns out that,

00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:44.855
well, the Tsimanes, these are here in red,

00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:48.376
there is evidence of
atherosclerosis, of calcification,

00:12:48.376 --> 00:12:52.695
but the levels are much lower
than what we see in the US.

00:12:52.695 --> 00:12:54.653
Now, the MESA, this is
the Multi-Ethnic Study

00:12:54.653 --> 00:12:57.383
of Atherosclerosis, these
are asymptomatic people

00:12:57.383 --> 00:13:01.145
without heart disease or
diabetes that are in the sample,

00:13:01.145 --> 00:13:04.985
so compared to those, the levels
of the percentage of people

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:09.089
with any calcification
is much, much lower,

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:11.112
and in fact, the Tsimane reach a level

00:13:11.112 --> 00:13:15.939
that the Americans have, that's
a gap of over 20, 25 years.

00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:18.307
And so, one easier way
of thinking about this

00:13:18.307 --> 00:13:22.290
than just kind of obscure
calcification scoring,

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.520
is what's called the arterial age,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.003
and this is basically what
age, based on the CAC score

00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:30.755
you have, what's that the equivalent

00:13:30.755 --> 00:13:32.604
of someone in the MESA study.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:36.289
And compared to what you would expect

00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:38.603
based on just the calcification score,

00:13:38.603 --> 00:13:41.657
that the Tsimane show
evidence that, basically,

00:13:41.657 --> 00:13:45.824
estimated arterial ages that
are about 20, 25 years younger

00:13:46.716 --> 00:13:49.677
than their chronological age.

00:13:49.677 --> 00:13:51.908
But the great thing about
working with living people,

00:13:51.908 --> 00:13:53.781
if the story ended there, we might say,

00:13:53.781 --> 00:13:55.691
well, look, just like we
found with the mummies,

00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:57.824
there's atherosclerosis in the Tsimane,

00:13:57.824 --> 00:14:00.618
but, here, the clinical
findings really suggest

00:14:00.618 --> 00:14:03.662
minimal manifestations of atherosclerosis,

00:14:03.662 --> 00:14:07.500
so, over the past decade,
we found minimal obesity,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.855
hypertension, cigarette smoking,

00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:13.127
moderate-high physical activity,

00:14:13.127 --> 00:14:15.877
low cholesterol levels, your bad,

00:14:16.947 --> 00:14:19.997
your low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,

00:14:19.997 --> 00:14:24.164
low blood glucose, so the risk
factors are fairly minimal,

00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:28.235
and then if we actually
look based on EKGs,

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:31.345
if we look for evidence of past infarcts,

00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:35.512
over 1,100 EKGs we've looked
at of people 40 and up,

00:14:37.316 --> 00:14:40.096
maybe one case of an infarct, looked at

00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:43.340
by our team of
cardiologists, and even that,

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.620
some people, a couple of the cardiologists

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.094
think it's dubious, and
also, based on other evidence

00:14:50.094 --> 00:14:53.094
with EKGs, and also with ultrasound,

00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:58.129
evidence of preserved systolic
and diastolic function,

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.800
and it's not the case
that the young people

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.049
that have these conditions,
then, are dying at early ages,

00:15:05.049 --> 00:15:08.008
or that these people have
high case fatality rates,

00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:11.658
so, based on verbal autopsies,
over the past 15 years,

00:15:11.658 --> 00:15:13.706
we don't see very much evidence at all,

00:15:13.706 --> 00:15:15.641
in fact, maybe one case of
someone who may have died

00:15:15.641 --> 00:15:17.497
of a heart attack, so
it really doesn't seem

00:15:17.497 --> 00:15:19.687
like there's evidence
of mortality selection

00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:22.077
that is explaining these differences away.

00:15:22.077 --> 00:15:23.737
Now, this is in spite of the fact,

00:15:23.737 --> 00:15:25.574
they have some protective factors,

00:15:25.574 --> 00:15:29.158
but they also have very
high levels of inflammation,

00:15:29.158 --> 00:15:31.692
and in the past 20 years or so,

00:15:31.692 --> 00:15:34.851
it's well known that inflammation
is a major risk factor,

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.621
in fact, it's a fundamental to the process

00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:38.741
of what we know about atherosclerosis,

00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:41.891
and by a number of
biomarkers, C-reactive protein

00:15:41.891 --> 00:15:44.145
is the one many of you
might be familiar with,

00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:47.749
because you often get it
done by your own clinician.

00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:50.001
They have very high levels
and cumulative levels

00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:52.970
over their life course, levels that would

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.829
basically associate with
having heart disease

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:57.780
amongst ourselves.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.556
They also have low levels of
the high-density lipoproteins,

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:03.223
or good cholesterol.

00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:08.658
So a few take-home messages for
the larger biomedical field,

00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:14.266
first of all, it doesn't seem
like the inflammation story

00:16:14.266 --> 00:16:17.249
is very complete, that the
same kind of risk factor

00:16:17.249 --> 00:16:20.633
might not exert the same
types of effects everywhere,

00:16:20.633 --> 00:16:22.464
and we probably would not have known that

00:16:22.464 --> 00:16:27.331
if we didn't look at
populations that are, I guess,

00:16:27.331 --> 00:16:31.414
as Katy brought up, looking
at non-weird populations,

00:16:31.414 --> 00:16:33.377
and particularly,
populations that experience

00:16:33.377 --> 00:16:37.298
lots of infection and have
very different lifestyles

00:16:37.298 --> 00:16:38.773
than we have.

00:16:38.773 --> 00:16:40.463
And in fact, not only do they have

00:16:40.463 --> 00:16:43.631
high levels of inflammation,
but biomarkers of inflammation

00:16:43.631 --> 00:16:45.735
are either unrelated, or in some ways,

00:16:45.735 --> 00:16:49.032
oppositely associated with our measures

00:16:49.032 --> 00:16:53.100
of arterial calcification,
and other indicators

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.366
of atherosclerosis, and it could be that

00:16:56.366 --> 00:16:59.738
inflammation that we experience
from cigarette smoking,

00:16:59.738 --> 00:17:03.175
from obesity, so-called
sterile inflammation,

00:17:03.175 --> 00:17:05.088
might have different effects than

00:17:05.088 --> 00:17:07.721
inflammation that is
induced under the conditions

00:17:07.721 --> 00:17:09.147
more representative of the past,

00:17:09.147 --> 00:17:11.956
which would be more from infection.

00:17:11.956 --> 00:17:14.149
But also that, that other
types of infections,

00:17:14.149 --> 00:17:17.816
particularly helminths, these
are our intestinal worms,

00:17:17.816 --> 00:17:20.423
our old friends that we've carried with us

00:17:20.423 --> 00:17:23.667
for long, long periods of
our evolutionary history,

00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:26.556
that they exert regulatory
effects on the immune system,

00:17:26.556 --> 00:17:31.054
and also, anti-inflammatory
effects that might perhaps

00:17:31.054 --> 00:17:33.849
protect against the
otherwise destructive effects

00:17:33.849 --> 00:17:35.182
of inflammation.

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:38.482
And the other take-home is that

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:42.330
what we consider average
might not be really normal.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.497
So, James O'Keefe, a physician
back in the early 2000s,

00:17:47.797 --> 00:17:51.229
argued the case, based on randomized

00:17:51.229 --> 00:17:54.185
placebo-controlled studies with statins

00:17:54.185 --> 00:17:58.032
that if you looked at
the chronic LDL levels,

00:17:58.032 --> 00:17:59.738
and you looked at a whole bunch of things,

00:17:59.738 --> 00:18:01.931
this is just a decrease over time

00:18:01.931 --> 00:18:06.098
in the luminal diameter, so
the interior of the artery,

00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:11.513
but you can change the y-axis
and make it heart attacks

00:18:11.513 --> 00:18:14.902
and other cardiac events,
that when you actually looked

00:18:14.902 --> 00:18:17.633
at how the occurrence of these things

00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:20.047
in relation to the chronic LDL levels,

00:18:20.047 --> 00:18:22.263
it seems to be a somewhat
linear relationship,

00:18:22.263 --> 00:18:25.316
to the point where, if you draw the line,

00:18:25.316 --> 00:18:28.354
that you would expect to
get almost zero events,

00:18:28.354 --> 00:18:30.968
in this particular graph,
it would mean, basically,

00:18:30.968 --> 00:18:34.236
a slowing of atherosclerosis
to the point of stopping,

00:18:34.236 --> 00:18:37.714
at a level of about 70,
or just less than 70,

00:18:37.714 --> 00:18:40.072
and so they were arguing
in a series of papers,

00:18:40.072 --> 00:18:44.239
that the optimal LDL should
be something between 50 to 70,

00:18:45.152 --> 00:18:47.260
whereas your typical recommendations,

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.010
at least up until 2013,
when the statin-based

00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:54.967
recommendations changed
so that we're not reaching

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:59.304
a target level, but it used
to be that 100 was a level,

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:00.984
but it actually turns out,
there's a decent amount

00:19:00.984 --> 00:19:05.230
of heart attacks in the
region between 70 to 100,

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.028
and this is just from the Tsimane,

00:19:07.028 --> 00:19:08.502
but if we looked at other populations,

00:19:08.502 --> 00:19:13.450
it would be a similar case, the
distribution of the LDL here

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.172
in the Tsimane, compared to Americans,

00:19:16.172 --> 00:19:19.213
and it might be a little hard,
sorry, to see the numbers,

00:19:19.213 --> 00:19:21.152
but the mode and the average there

00:19:21.152 --> 00:19:25.018
is about 70 for the
Tsimane, whereas about 85%

00:19:25.018 --> 00:19:28.204
of Americans have LDL higher than that,

00:19:28.204 --> 00:19:32.747
and that what's yellow there
is in that 70 to 100 region

00:19:32.747 --> 00:19:35.611
that basically, many of
Americans would fall into,

00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:38.727
even if they were taking statins.

00:19:38.727 --> 00:19:42.894
So, less than 70 is a
hunter-gatherer level of LDL

00:19:44.334 --> 00:19:47.300
that might be more extreme,
but probably very difficult

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.445
for us, as omnivores, to reach,

00:19:50.445 --> 00:19:54.295
unless, perhaps, you're taking statins.

00:19:54.295 --> 00:19:56.481
So, just to summarize and conclude,

00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:59.600
atherosclerosis is present, just like

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.337
we observed in the mummies,
but it's less pervasive than

00:20:03.337 --> 00:20:04.654
we see in the West.

00:20:04.654 --> 00:20:07.154
So, certain features
of cardiovascular aging

00:20:07.154 --> 00:20:10.024
may be universal, so you
might see some calcifications

00:20:10.024 --> 00:20:12.182
and stiffening of the arteries,

00:20:12.182 --> 00:20:15.258
there's some declines, even
though they might be delayed,

00:20:15.258 --> 00:20:18.286
in systolic and diastolic function,

00:20:18.286 --> 00:20:21.772
but they occur nonetheless,
yet the clinical manifestation,

00:20:21.772 --> 00:20:25.137
so whether it's heart
attacks, hypertension,

00:20:25.137 --> 00:20:27.609
peripheral arterial disease, strokes,

00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:29.701
that those themselves
may not be universal,

00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:31.900
and were likely very rare throughout

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.793
human evolutionary
history, despite the fact

00:20:34.793 --> 00:20:39.742
that we can observe
calcifications in these mummies.

00:20:39.742 --> 00:20:41.623
And also, I think it
behooves us to revisit

00:20:41.623 --> 00:20:45.663
the common risk factors, that
inflammation might be high

00:20:45.663 --> 00:20:47.784
in hunter-gatherer populations,

00:20:47.784 --> 00:20:50.847
but immune function
might be better regulated

00:20:50.847 --> 00:20:53.059
in a very different
environment, particularly

00:20:53.059 --> 00:20:57.360
in the presence of a more
diverse set of pathogens,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.807
and also, it raises the
question of what is normal?

00:20:59.807 --> 00:21:03.343
What are the target levels of
different biomarkers like LDL

00:21:03.343 --> 00:21:05.503
that we should be reaching,
and what might they

00:21:05.503 --> 00:21:09.289
have been like, over the
course of evolutionary history?

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:11.069
And to take advantage of the fact,

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:14.047
if we hadn't looked at a
population like she Tsimane,

00:21:14.047 --> 00:21:16.935
these non-weird populations,
that we can actually learn

00:21:16.935 --> 00:21:21.018
quite a bit about our own
health in, say, the US,

00:21:22.642 --> 00:21:26.042
by focusing on people that
are more likely to have

00:21:26.042 --> 00:21:30.252
certain types of infections
that could be cardioprotective,

00:21:30.252 --> 00:21:34.752
even a lot of our standard
model organisms in the lab

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:37.688
are infection-free, and so
there might be some limitations

00:21:37.688 --> 00:21:39.874
of what can be gained, and also,

00:21:39.874 --> 00:21:42.011
taking advantage of the fact, well,

00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:45.501
and the horror of the fact,
that all indigenous populations

00:21:45.501 --> 00:21:48.463
around the world are in
different states of flux,

00:21:48.463 --> 00:21:51.706
and so it's a kind of
quasi-natural laboratory

00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:55.484
for looking at the changes
in lifestyle and environment,

00:21:55.484 --> 00:21:59.454
on how that shapes increases
in type 2 diabetes risk,

00:21:59.454 --> 00:22:03.383
and in heart disease, and so
it's sort of untapped territory

00:22:03.383 --> 00:22:06.142
that very, in fact, I don't know any

00:22:06.142 --> 00:22:09.350
biomedically-oriented
folks that are working

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.877
in these populations, to
try to learn more about

00:22:12.877 --> 00:22:15.217
the underlying ideology.

00:22:15.217 --> 00:22:17.884
And so, for the future, I think,

00:22:18.744 --> 00:22:20.332
one thing that a take-home message,

00:22:20.332 --> 00:22:24.052
is if the story was just
that, look, exercise more,

00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:27.718
eat well, don't smoke, we already knew,

00:22:27.718 --> 00:22:31.980
those are your standard
Framingham study risk factors,

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.774
and I think those do
make a big difference,

00:22:34.774 --> 00:22:37.274
but also, regulated immune function

00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:38.880
in the presence of certain parasites

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.907
might also have some protective
aspects on the heart,

00:22:41.907 --> 00:22:43.589
and that maybe, in the
future, we might see

00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:47.488
that the hygiene
hypothesis, this idea that

00:22:47.488 --> 00:22:51.668
we are not exposed to
the same type of critters

00:22:51.668 --> 00:22:54.964
as we would've in the past,
that not only helps explains

00:22:54.964 --> 00:22:57.259
autoimmune-type disease currently,

00:22:57.259 --> 00:23:00.092
but also, maybe extend
it to heart disease.

00:23:00.092 --> 00:23:01.877
Thank you very much for your time.
