Good designers emphasize with the people they're designing for. That's what the

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.290
seven questions that you discovered with Chelsea are all about. Your

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.070
job is to make sure that the people using the product, can always find the

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.510
answers. Now, those seven questions complete the formal

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.000
course material. One thing left. To put it all together. That's what the final

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.490
project is about. It's a fun one. You get to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.600
put together all the things you've learned. Plus the design

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.380
skills from the other projects, into a real project. Something

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.750
you can actually build into a real, manufactured product. Have fun.
