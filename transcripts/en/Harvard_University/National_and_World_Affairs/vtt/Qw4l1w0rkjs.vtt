Additional funding provided by

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.360
When we finished last time,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.360
we were looking at John Stuart Mill's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.110
and his attempt

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.170
to reply

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.510
to the critics

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.850
of Bentham's utilitarianism

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.990
in his book Utilitarianism,  

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.790
Mill tries to show

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.550
that critics to the contrary, it is possible

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.170
within utilitarian framework to distinguish
between higher and lower

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.499
pleasures, it is possible to make

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.520
qualitative distinctions of worth,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.720
and we tested of that idea

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.390
with the Simpsons

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.370
in the Shakespeare excerpts

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.480
and the results of our experiment

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.440
seemed to call into question

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.760
Mill's distinctions

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.480
because a great many of you

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.520
reported

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.860
that you prefer the Simpsons

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.550
but that you still consider Shakespeare

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.270
to be the higher for the worthier pleasure

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.330
that's the dilemma

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.200
with which our experiment confronts Mill.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.749
what about Mill's

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:51.140
attempt to account

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.190
for especially weighty character

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.010
of individual rights and justice in chapter
five of utilitarianism?

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.810
he wants to say that individual rights

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.320
are worthy

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.729
of special respect

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.519
in fact he goes so far as to say that justice
is the most sacred part

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.629
and the most incomparably binding 
part of morality

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.189
but the same challenge

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.729
could be put

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:24.539
to this part of Mill's defense

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:25.749
why

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.549
is justice

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.249
the chief part

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:35.539
and the most binding part of our morality? well
he says because in the long run

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:39.369
if we do justice and if we respect rights,

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:40.769
society as a whole

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.879
will be better off in the long run.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.189
well what about that?

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.049
what if we have a case where making an exception
and violating individual rights actually will

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.729
make people

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.959
better off in the long run is it all right
then?

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.730
to use people?

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.659
and there's a further

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.100
objection

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.840
that could be raised against

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.289
Mill's case for justice and rights

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:13.389
suppose the utilitarian calculus in the long run
works out as he says it will

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.299
such that respecting people's rights

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.739
is a way of making everybody better off
in the long run

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.019
is that the right reason

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.150
is that the only reason

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.939
to respect people?

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.480
if the doctor goes in

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.719
and yanks the organs from the healthy patient
who came in for a checkup

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.749
to save five lives

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:41.510
there would be adverse effects in the long
run

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.159
eventually people would learn about this

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.099
and would stop going in for checkups

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.899
is it the right reason

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.589
is the only reason

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.359
that you as a doctor

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.239
won't yanked the organs out of a healthy
patient

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.410
that you think

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.309
well if I use

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.669
him in this way

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:03.939
in the long run

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.649
more lives will be lost?

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.329
or is there another reason

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.980
having to do with intrinsic respect for the
person as an individual

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.109
and if that reason matters

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.439
and it's not so clear

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.840
that even Mill's utilitarianism

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.110
can take account of it

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.889
fully to examine these two

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.879
worries or objections

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.900
to Mill's defense

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.280
we need to we need to push further

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.970
we need to ask

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.349
in the case of higher or worthier pleasures

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.249
are there theories of the good life

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.930
that can provide independent moral standards

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.449
for the worth of pleasures?

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.539
if so what do they look like?

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.180
that's one question

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.009
in the case of justice and rights

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:08.009
if we suspected that Mill is implicitly leaning
on notions of human dignity or respect for

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.509
persons that are not, strictly speaking,

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.030
utilitarian

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.770
we need to look to see whether there are some
stronger theories of rights

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.699
that can explain

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.000
the intuition

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.919
which even Mill shares

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.109
the intuition

00:05:24.109 --> 00:05:31.109
that the reason for respecting individuals
and not using them

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:32.939
goes beyond

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.429
even utility in the long run.

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:38.940
today we turn

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.950
to one

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.259
of those strong theories of rights

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.620
strong theories of rights say

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.669
individuals matter

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:55.559
not just as instruments to be used for a
larger social purpose

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:59.270
or for the sake of maximizing utility

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.009
individuals

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.150
are separate beings with

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.569
separate lives

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.819
worthy of respect

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.539
and so it's a mistake

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.879
according to strong theories rights, it's a mistake

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.449
to think about justice or law

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.039
by just getting up preferences

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.659
and values

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.829
the strong rights theory we turn to today

00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:28.079
is libertarianism

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:30.039
libertarianism 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.270
take individual rights seriously

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.149
it's called libertarianism because it says the
fundamental individual right

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:42.469
is the right to liberty

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:48.279
precisely because we are separate individual
beings

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:50.409
we're not available

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.389
to any use

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:54.439
that the society might

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:58.319
desire or devise. precisely because
we're individual

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.009
separate human beings

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.999
we have a fundamental right to liberty

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:07.310
and that means

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.089
a right

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.129
to choose freely

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.050
to live our lives as we please

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.470
provided we respect other people's rights

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.180
to do the same

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.369
that's the fundamental idea

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:21.930
Robert Nozick

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.559
one of the libertarian philosophers we read 

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.610
for this course puts it this way

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.509
individuals have rights

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:34.419
so strong and far-reaching are these rights

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.879
that they raise the question of what, if anything

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:43.389
the state may do.

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:47.090
so what does libertarianism say 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.699
about

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.599
the role of government

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:51.629
or of the state

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:54.409
well there are three things that most

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:58.029
modern states do

00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.789
that

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:01.680
on the libertarian theory of rights

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.699
are illegitimate

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:06.089
are unjust

00:08:06.089 --> 00:08:07.349
one of them

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:09.729
is paternalist legislation

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:13.799
that's passing laws that protect people from
themselves

00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:15.669
seat belt laws for example

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:18.550
or motorcycle helmet laws

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.520
the libertarian says

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.310
it may be a good thing if people wear seat belts,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.249
but that should be up to them

00:08:27.249 --> 00:08:28.459
and the state

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:29.610
the government

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.620
has no business coercing them, us 

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.410
to wear seat belts

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.520
by law

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.690
its coercion

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.820
so no paternalist legislation

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.810
number one. number two

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.550
no morals legislation

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.670
many laws

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.270
try to promote

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.059
the virtue of citizens

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:56.550
or try to give expression

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.830
to the moral

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.270
values

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.700
of the society as a whole.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.830
libertarians say that's also

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:10.360
a violation of the right to liberty

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.560
take the example of, well a classic example
of legislation offered in the name of promoting

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.830
morality traditionally,

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.770
have been laws that prevent

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.310
sexual intimacy

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.080
between

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.110
gays and lesbians

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.360
the libertarian says

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.110
nobody else is harmed

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.470
nobody else's rights are violated

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.130
so the state should get all of the business entirely

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.990
of trying to promote virtue

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:45.040
or to enact morals legislation.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.220
and the third kind of law

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.810
or policy

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.880
it is ruled out

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.460
on the libertarian philosophy

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.830
is any taxation

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.570
or other policy

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.120
that serves the purpose

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.170
of redistributing income or wealth

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.860
from the rich to the poor

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.369
redistribution

00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:10.780
is a kind of, if you think about it

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.080
says libertarianists, a kind of coercion

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.160
what it amounts to is theft

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.510
by the state

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.750
or by the majority

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.360
if we're talking about a democracy

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.360
from people who happen to do very well and
earn a lot of money

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.590
now Nozick and other libertarians allow that
there can be a minimal state

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.140
that taxes people for the sake of

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.900
what everybody needs

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.110
the national defense

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.360
police force

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.260
judicial system to enforce contracts and

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.920
property rights

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.880
but that's it.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.230
Now I want to get your reactions

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.360
to this third

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.610
feature

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:01.990
of the libertarian view

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.560
I want to see

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.490
who among you

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.060
agree with that idea and who disagree

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.710
and why

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.580
and just to make a concrete and to see what's at
stake

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.640
consider the distribution of wealth

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.170
in the united states.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.079
The united states is among the most

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:26.300
In-egalitarian societies as far as
distribution of wealth,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.780
of all the advanced democracies

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.320
now is this just

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.760
or unjust

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.590
well what is the libertarian say

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.200
the libertarian says

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.820
you can't know just from the facts

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.000
I just given you

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.260
you can't know whether that distribution

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.300
it's just or unjust. 

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:54.070
you can't know just by looking at a pattern
or a distribution or a result

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.340
whether it's just or unjust

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:02.030
you have to know how it came to be

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.170
you can't just look at the end  state or the
result

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.350
you have to look at two principles

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.640
the first he calls justice in acquisition

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.640
or in initial holdings

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.920
and what that means simply is

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.560
did people get the things they use

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.840
to make their money

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.060
fairly

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.770
so we need to know

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.280
was there justice in the initial holdings,
did they steal the land or the factory or the

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.580
goods that enabled them to make all that
money?

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.750
if not,

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.530
if they were entitled to whatever it was that
enabled them to

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.550
gather the wealth

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.390
the first principle is met.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.520
the second principle is 

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.520
did the distribution arise

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.200
from the operation of free consent

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.990
people buying and trading on the market

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.210
as you can see the libertarian idea of justice

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.210
corresponds to a free market

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.500
conception of justice

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.240
provided

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.390
people

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.940
got what they used 

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.529
fairly

00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:10.090
didn't steal it

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.840
and provided

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.780
the distribution results from the free choice
of individuals' buying and selling things

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.980
the distribution is just

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.890
and it's not

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:26.080
it's unjust.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.350
so let's, in order to fix

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:33.300
ideas for this discussion, take

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.570
an actual

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.130
example

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.900
who's wealthiest person

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:46.900
in the united states, wealthiest person in
the world

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.090
Bill Gates, it is, you're right. here he is.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.400
you'd be happy too

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.190
now, what's his net worth?

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.470
anybody have any idea?

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.120
that's a big number

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.600
during the Clinton years remember there was
a controversy, donors, big campaign contributors

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.360
were invited to stay overnight in the Lincoln
bedroom at the white house

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.300
I think if you contributed twenty five thousand
dollars or above

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.870
someone figured out

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.930
at the median contribution

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:27.130
that got you invited to stay a night
in the Lincoln bedroom

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:32.230
Bill Gates could afford to stay in the Lincoln
bedroom every night for the next sixty six

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:38.880
thousand years

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.460
somebody else figured out

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.960
how much does he get paid on an hourly basis

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.070
and

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.640
so they figured out since he began Microsoft

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.370
suppose the worked about fourteen hours per day

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.210
a reasonable guess

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.880
and you calculate

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.480
this is net wealth

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.100
it turns out

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.180
that his rate of

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.350
pay

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.240
is

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:06.950
over

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.220
a hundred and fifty dollars not

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.760
per hour,

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.870
not per minute

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:18.910
a hundred and fifty dollars, more than a hundred
and fifty dollars per second

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.890
which means

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.350
which means

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.210
that if on his way to the office

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.910
Gates noticed a hundred-dollar bill on the
street

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:36.910
it wouldn't be worth his time to stop and pick it up

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.160
now most of you would say

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.770
someone that wealthy

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.510
surely we can tax them

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.430
to meet

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.350
the pressing needs

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.469
of people who lack of education or lack enough to eat

00:15:53.469 --> 00:15:57.180
or lack decent housing

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.140
they need it more than he does

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.530
and if you were a utilitarian

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.530
what would you do? What tax policy would you have

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.480
you'd redistribute in a flash wouldn't you

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.560
because you would know

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.760
being a good utilitarian

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.310
that taking some, a small amount, he's scarcely going

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.260
to notice it, but it will make a

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:28.640
huge improvement in the lives and in the welfare
of those at the bottom

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.020
but remember

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.200
the libertarian theory says

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.410
we can't just add up

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.450
and aggregate preferences and satisfactions

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.680
that way

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.430
we have to respect

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.969
persons

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:46.770
and if he earned that money fairly

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.869
without violating anybody else's rights

00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:55.869
in accordance with the two principles of justice
in acquisition and justice in transfer, then

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.350
it would be wrong

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.240
it would be a form of coercion

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.550
to take it away

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.120
Michael Jordan is not as wealthy Bill Gates

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.770
but he did pretty well for himself

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.510
you want to see Michael Jordan?

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.300
there he is

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.530
his income alone

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.760
in one year was thirty one million dollars

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.670
and then he made another forty seven million
dollars in endorsements for Nike and other

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.459
companies

00:17:25.459 --> 00:17:26.890
so his income

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:27.970
was

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.710
in one year seventy eight million

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.880
the require him to pay

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.100
say a third of his earnings

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.780
to the government

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.080
to support good causes

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.280
like food and health care and housing and education
for the poor

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.770
that's coercion

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.299
that's unjust

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.700
that violates his

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.070
rights

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.230
and that's why

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.690
redistribution is wrong. 

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.610
Now, how many agree with that argument

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.740
agree with the libertarian argument that

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.670
redistribution for the sake of

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.320
trying to help the poor is wrong?

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.020
and how many disagree with that argument?

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.110
all right let's begin with those who disagree?

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:25.770
what's wrong with the libertarian case against

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.720
redistribution?

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.450
I think these people like Michael Jordan have
received, 

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.550
we're talking about working within the society

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.130
they received a larger

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.060
gift from the society and they have a larger
obligation

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.570
in return to give that through distribution

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.660
you know you can say that Michael Jordan may
work just as hard as someone who works

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.020
you know

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.920
doing laundry twelve hours, fourteen hours
a day

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.529
but he's receiving more

00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:55.330
I don't think it's fair to say that you
know

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.230
it's all on his 

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.070
inherent hard work. All right

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.920
let's hear from defenders of libertarianism

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.520
why would it be wrong in principle

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.799
to tax the rich to help the poor.

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:14.099
My name is Joe and I collect skateboards.

00:19:14.099 --> 00:19:18.440
I've since bought a hundred skate boards and
live in a society the hundred people

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.120
I'm the only one with skateboards suddenly
everyone decides they want skateboard they

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.780
come into the house to take my, they take ninety
nine of my skateboards. I think that is unjust

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.130
now I think in certain circumstances, it

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.330
becomes necessary to overlook injustice and perhaps
condone that injustice

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.150
as in the case of the cabin boy being killed

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.890
for food if people are on the verge of dying

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.170
perhaps it is necessary

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.190
to overlook that injustice but I think it's
important to keep in mind

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.200
they were still committing injustice

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.299
by taking people's belonging or assets. Are you saying
that taxing Michael Jordan say at thirty

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:54.980
three percent tax rate

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.640
for good causes

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.080
to feed the hungry

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.289
is theft

00:20:01.289 --> 00:20:05.470
I think it's unjust, yes I do believe it's theft,
but perhaps it is necessary

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.340
to condone that theft.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:14.340
But it's theft. Yes.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.120
why is it theft, Joe?

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.760
because

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.850
why is it like your collection of skateboards?

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.740
it's theft because

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.550
or at least

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.070
in my opinion and by the libertarian opinion

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.940
he earned that money fairly

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.360
and

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.590
it belongs to him and so take it from him

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:39.950
is by definition theft.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.430
alright let's see if there is 

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.070
who wants to reply to Joe?

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.220
yes go ahead

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.710
I don't think this necessarily a case in which you have
ninety nine skateboards and

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.630
the government, or you have a hundreds skateboards
and the government is taking ninety nine of them

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.539
it's like the

00:20:58.539 --> 00:21:00.629
it's like you have more skateboards than there are

00:21:00.629 --> 00:21:05.400
days in the year, you have more skateboards than
you're going to be able to use your entire lifetime

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.470
and the government is taking

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.299
part of those. And

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:11.330
I think that if you're operating in society

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.080
in which the government

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.840
in which the government doesn't redistribute
wealth

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.070
that that allows for people to amass 
so much wealth

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.130
that people who haven't started from

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.760
the equal footing in our hypothetical
situation,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.900
that doesn't exist in our real society,

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.740
get undercut for the rest of their lives.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:35.530
so you're worried that if there isn't some
degree of redistribution if some are left at

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.690
the bottom

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:42.880
there will be no genuine equality of opportunity

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.680
alright. the idea that taxation is theft,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.390
Nozick takes that point one step further

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.570
he agrees that it's theft

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.880
he's more demanding than Joe, Joe says it is
theft,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:02.070
maybe in an extreme case it's justified

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.580
maybe a parent

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.530
is justified in stealing a loaf of bread

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.490
to feed his or her hungry family

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:16.490
so Joe is a what? What would you call yourself
a compassionate quasi libertarian?

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.590
Nozick says, if you think about it

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.010
taxation

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.960
amounts

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.760
to the taking of earnings

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.960
in other words it means

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.720
taking

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.559
the fruits

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:39.370
of my labor

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.130
but if the state has the right

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.880
to take my earnings or the fruits of my labor,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.200
isn't that morally the same

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.410
as according to the state

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.690
the right

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.000
to claim

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.560
a portion of my labor?

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.720
So taxation actually

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.750
is morally equivalent

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.910
to forced labor

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.390
because forced labor

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.630
involves the taking

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:20.390
of my leisure, my time, my efforts

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:21.840
just as taxation

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.760
takes the earnings

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.850
that I make

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:30.380
with my labor.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.810
And so for Nozick

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.760
and for the libertarians

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.580
taxation for redistribution

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.020
is theft as Joe says,

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.240
but not only thing left

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.190
it is morally equivalent

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.059
to laying claim

00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:49.870
to certain hours

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.760
of a person's life

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.210
and labor

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.130
so it's morally equivalent to forced

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:56.609
labor

00:23:56.609 --> 00:23:59.809
if the state has a right to claim the fruits
of my labor

00:23:59.809 --> 00:24:02.390
that implies that it really

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.630
has an entitlement 

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.870
to my labor itself

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.850
and what is forced labor?

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.200
forced labor

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.320
Nozick points out

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.670
it's what? it's slavery

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.280
because

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.500
if I don't have the right, the sole right

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.610
to my own labor

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.680
then

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.660
that's really to say that the government
or the

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.820
political community

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.690
is a part owner in me

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:41.140
and what does it mean for the state to be
a part owner in me?

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.669
if you think about it

00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:44.570
it means

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:45.820
that I am a slave

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.059
that I don't own myself

00:24:49.059 --> 00:24:52.770
so what this line of reasoning brings us to

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.900
is the fundamental

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.120
principle

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.180
that underlies the libertarian case for rights

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.370
what is that principle?

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.740
it's the idea

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.020
that I own myself

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.860
it's the idea

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.880
of self-possession

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.660
if you want to take rights seriously

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.570
if you don't want to just regard people as 
collections of preferences

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:22.110
the fundamental moral idea

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.840
to which you will be lead

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.080
is the idea

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.580
that we are the owners or the proprietors
of our own person

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.120
and that's why

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.690
utilitarian goes wrong

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.770
and that's why it's wrong to yank the organs
from that healthy patient

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.159
you're acting as if

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:47.860
that patient belongs to you or to the community

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.060
but we belong to ourselves

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.540
and that's the same reason

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.740
that it's wrong to make laws to protect us from
ourselves

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.160
or to tell us how to live

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.100
to tell us what virtues

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.230
we should be governed by

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.310
and that's also why it's wrong

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.500
to tax

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:13.080
the rich to help the poor even for good causes
even to help those who are displaced by the

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:13.910
hurricane

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.710
Katrina

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.560
ask them to give charity

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.370
but if you tax them

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.270
it's like forcing them to labor

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.029
could you tell Michael Jordan he has to skip next

00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:28.760
week's games and go down to help the people

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.590
displaced by hurricane Katrina?

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:35.870
morally it's the same

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.650
so the stakes are very high

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:43.030
so far we've heard some objections

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.290
to the libertarian argument

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.380
but if you want to reject it

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:51.710
you have to break into this chain of reasoning
which goes

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.850
taking my earnings

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.250
is like

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.610
taking my labor

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.980
but taking my labor

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.240
is making me a slave

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.240
and if you

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.120
disagree with that

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.960
you must believe in the principle of self-possession

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.360
those who

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.040
disagree

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.940
gather your objections

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:18.940
and we'll begin with them next time.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.549
anyone like to take up that point? yes

00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:28.350
I feel like  when you live in a society

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.649
you give up that right, I mean technically, if I want to
personally 

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:35.600
and kill someone because they offend me, that is 
self-possession. Because

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.950
I live in a society I cannot do that

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.200
Victoria, are you questioning

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.890
the fundamental premise of self-possession? yes.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:49.550
I think that you don't really have self-possession 
if you choose to live in a society because

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.860
you cannot just discount the people around you.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.809
we were talking last time about libertarianism

00:27:57.809 --> 00:28:04.510
I want to go back to the arguments for and
against the redistribution of income

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.880
but before we do that

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.990
just one word about the  state

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.820
Milton Friedman the

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.060
libertarian economist

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.880
he points out

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.190
that many of the functions

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.240
that we take for granted

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:26.080
as properly belonging to government, don’t

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.210
they are paternalist. one example he gives is social
security 

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.570
he says it's a good idea

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.840
for people to save for their retirement

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.120
during their earning years

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.920
but it's wrong

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.310
it's a violation of people's liberty

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.350
for the government to force

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.940
everyone

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.600
whether they want to or not

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.220
to put aside some

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.150
earnings today

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:59.130
for the sake of their retirement. If people
want to take the chance

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.820
or if people want to live big today and live

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.570
a poor

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:05.590
retirement

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.679
that should be their choice they should be
free

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:12.130
to make those judgments and take those risks

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.640
so even social security

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.129
would still be at odds with the minimal state

00:29:17.129 --> 00:29:19.090
that Milton Friedman

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.910
argued for

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.910
it's sometimes thought that

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:29.360
collective goods like police protection and
fire protection

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:36.360
inevitably create the problem of free riders
unless their publicly provided

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:41.290
but there are ways to 

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.429
prevent free riders, there are ways to

00:29:44.429 --> 00:29:49.570
restrict even seemingly collective goods like
fire protection

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.059
I read an article

00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:57.960
a while back about a private fire company
the Salem Fire corporation in Arkansas

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.260
you can sign up with this Salem Fire Corporation

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.390
pay a yearly subscription fee,

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.110
and if your house catches on fire

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.180
they will come and put out the fire

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.320
but they won't put out

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.800
everybody's fire,

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.490
they will only put it out

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.290
if it's a fire

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.509
in the home of subscriber

00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:20.490
or if it starts to spread 

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:21.960
and to threaten 

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.790
the home of a subscriber

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:29.680
the newspaper article told the story of a
homeowner who had subscribed

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.620
to this company in the past

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.330
but failed to renew his subscription his house
caught on fire

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.650
the Salem Fire Corporation showed up with
its trucks

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.860
and watched the house burn.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.540
Just making sure that it didn't spread

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.010
the fire chief was asked

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:52.210
well he wasn't exactly the fire chief I guess 
he was the CEO

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.419
he was asked

00:30:53.419 --> 00:30:55.789
how can you stand by with fire equipment

00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:59.010
and allow a person's home to burn?

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:03.250
he replied once we verified there was no
danger to a member's property

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.870
we had no choice

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.419
but to back off

00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:10.839
according to our rules. If we responded to
all fires, he said, there would be no incentive

00:31:10.839 --> 00:31:13.170
to subscribe

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:19.660
the homeowner in this case tried to renew
his subscription at the scene of the fire

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.050
but the head of the company refused

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:27.700
you can't wreck your car, he said, and then
buy insurance for it later

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:33.049
so even public goods that we take for granted
as being within the proper province of government

00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:36.500
can, many of them, in principle

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.530
be isolated, made exclusive to those who pay.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:41.880
that's all to do with

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.230
the question of collective goods

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.010
and the libertarian's injunction against

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.059
paternalism

00:31:50.059 --> 00:31:52.539
let's go back now to the

00:31:52.539 --> 00:31:56.950
arguments about redistribution

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.440
now, underlying

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.899
the libertarian's case

00:32:00.899 --> 00:32:04.299
for the minimal states

00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:09.309
is a worry about coercion, but what's wrong
with coercion?

00:32:09.309 --> 00:32:14.100
libertarian offers this

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.690
answer to coerce someone

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:23.310
to use some person for the sake of the general welfare

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.290
is wrong

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:25.960
because

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.740
it calls into question the fundamental fact

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.809
that we own ourselves

00:32:32.809 --> 00:32:34.549
the fundamental moral fact

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:39.110
of self-possession or self ownership

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:44.679
the libertarian's argument against redistribution

00:32:44.679 --> 00:32:49.660
begins with this fundamental idea that we
own ourselves

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.350
Nozick says

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.830
that if

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.710
this is society as a whole

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.910
can go to Bill Gates

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.900
or go to Michael Jordan

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.260
and tax away a portion 

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.210
of their wealth,

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.669
what the society is really asserting

00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:11.830
is a collective property right

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.530
in Bill Gates

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:16.490
or in Michael Jordan

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.180
but that violates

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.870
the fundamental principle

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:23.350
that we belong to ourselves

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:27.490
now we've already heard a number of 
objections

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.890
to the libertarian argument

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.000
what I would like to do today

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.490
it's to give

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.660
the libertarians among us

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.990
a chance to answer the objections

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.620
that have been raised

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.890
and some have been some

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:49.429
have already identified themselves have agreed
to

00:33:49.429 --> 00:33:51.659
come and make the case

00:33:51.659 --> 00:33:56.230
for libertarianism to reply to the objections
that have been raised

00:33:56.230 --> 00:34:02.470
so raise your hand if you are among the libertarians
who's prepared to stand up

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:06.370
for the theory and response to the objections

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:09.649
you are? Alex Harris. Alex Harris who

00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:12.440
he's been a star on the web blog, alright Alex

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.519
come here stand-up 

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:19.509
we'll create a libertarian corner over
here

00:34:19.509 --> 00:34:22.999
and who else other libertarians

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:26.179
who will join

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:30.199
what's you're name? John.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:34.139
John Sheffield, John, and who else wants to join

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:36.819
other brave libertarians who are prepared

00:34:36.819 --> 00:34:38.759
to take on yes

00:34:38.759 --> 00:34:40.879
what's your name

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:43.539
Julia Roto, Julia come

00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:44.899
join us over there

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:46.379
now while the,

00:34:46.379 --> 00:34:53.059
team libertarian

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:54.959
Julia, John, Alex

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:58.779
while team libertarian is gathering
over there

00:34:58.779 --> 00:35:01.089
let me just summarize

00:35:01.089 --> 00:35:03.499
the main objections that I've heard

00:35:03.499 --> 00:35:07.239
in class and on the web site

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:11.489
objection number one

00:35:11.489 --> 00:35:15.699
and here I'll come down too, I want to talk
to team libertarian over here

00:35:15.699 --> 00:35:18.079
so objection number one

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:19.959
is that

00:35:19.959 --> 00:35:22.979
the poor need the money more

00:35:22.979 --> 00:35:24.819
that's an obvious objection

00:35:24.819 --> 00:35:26.189
a lot more

00:35:26.189 --> 00:35:27.709
than

00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:30.039
than do

00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:33.109
Bill Gates and Michael Jordan

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:35.599
objection number two

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:39.749
it's not really slavery to tax

00:35:39.749 --> 00:35:40.789
because

00:35:40.789 --> 00:35:44.329
at least in a democratic society

00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:48.059
there's not a slave holder

00:35:48.059 --> 00:35:49.539
it's congress

00:35:49.539 --> 00:35:54.039
it's a democratic, you're smiling Alex, you're
already a confident you can reply to all of

00:35:54.039 --> 00:35:57.390
these

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.930
so taxation by consent of the governed is not
coerced

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.019
third

00:36:02.019 --> 00:36:05.469
some people have said don't be successful

00:36:05.469 --> 00:36:06.599
like Gates

00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:11.289
owe a debt to society for their success that
they repay by paying taxes

00:36:11.289 --> 00:36:16.449
who wants to respond to the first one the
poor need the money more all right

00:36:16.449 --> 00:36:17.709
you're John

00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:19.230
John all right John

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.219
what's the answer, here I'll hold it.

00:36:22.219 --> 00:36:23.799
alright

00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:25.859
the poor need the money more,
that's quite obvious 

00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:29.809
I could use money you know I certainly wouldn't
mind if Bill Gates gave me a million dollars

00:36:29.809 --> 00:36:30.420
I mean

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.009
I'd take a thousand

00:36:33.009 --> 00:36:34.669
but at some point

00:36:34.669 --> 00:36:39.669
you have to understand that the benefits of
redistribution of wealth don't justify the

00:36:39.669 --> 00:36:42.009
initial violation of the property right

00:36:42.009 --> 00:36:44.130
if you look at the argument the poor need
the money

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:49.930
more at no point in that argument you contradict
the fact that we extrapolated from agreed

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.489
upon principles that people own themselves

00:36:52.489 --> 00:36:56.749
we've extrapolated that people have property
rights and so whether or not it would be a

00:36:56.749 --> 00:36:58.430
good thing or a nice thing

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.669
or even a necessary thing for the survival
of some people

00:37:01.669 --> 00:37:05.839
we don't see that that justifies the violation
of the right that we logically extrapolated

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:08.559
and so that also I mean

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:10.920
they're still exist this institution of

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.849
of individual philanthropy, Milton Freidman makes 
this argument

00:37:14.849 --> 00:37:19.749
alright so Bill gates can give to charity if he wants to

00:37:19.749 --> 00:37:22.699
but it would still be wrong to coerce him

00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:23.650
exactly

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:28.269
to meet the needs of the poor.

00:37:28.269 --> 00:37:30.420
are the two of you happy with that reply?

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.559
anything to add? alright

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:36.809
Go ahead, Julie? Julia, ya, I think I could also ass

00:37:36.809 --> 00:37:39.099
I guess I could add that

00:37:39.099 --> 00:37:43.489
there's a difference between needing something and deserving
something. I mean in an ideal society everyone's

00:37:43.489 --> 00:37:44.309
needs would be met

00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:48.200
but here we're arguing what do we deserve as a society

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.859
and the poor don't

00:37:50.859 --> 00:37:52.169
deserve

00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:57.439
the benefits that would flow from taxing Michael
Jordan to help

00:37:57.439 --> 00:38:00.079
them. Based on what we've come up with here, I don't think

00:38:00.079 --> 00:38:01.440
you deserve something

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.890
like that. Alright let me,

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.249
push you a little bit on that Julia

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:08.529
the victims of hurricane Katrina

00:38:08.529 --> 00:38:11.569
are in desperate need of help

00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:14.269
would you say that they don't

00:38:14.269 --> 00:38:16.609
deserve

00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:18.929
the help that would come

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:22.539
from the federal government through taxation.

00:38:22.539 --> 00:38:24.679
okay that's a, difficult question

00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:25.589
I think

00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:27.829
this is a case where they need help not

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:29.319
deserve it, but

00:38:29.319 --> 00:38:31.849
I think again if you hit a certain level of

00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:35.869
of requirements to reach sustenance, you're going to need
help, like if you don't have food or place

00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:36.630
to live

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.670
that's a case of need. So need is one
thing

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:44.419
and dessert is another. exactly

00:38:44.419 --> 00:38:51.419
who would like to reply?

00:38:53.059 --> 00:38:54.819
Come back to that first point

00:38:54.819 --> 00:38:57.829
that he made about the property rights of the
individual

00:38:57.829 --> 00:39:00.769
the property rights are established and enforced by
the government

00:39:00.769 --> 00:39:03.149
which is

00:39:03.149 --> 00:39:06.089
a democratic government and we have representatives

00:39:06.089 --> 00:39:07.730
who enforce those rights,

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:11.270
if you live in a society that operates under
those rules

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.669
then it should be up to the government

00:39:13.669 --> 00:39:15.969
to decide

00:39:15.969 --> 00:39:18.189
how 

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:23.409
those resources that come about through taxation are distributed
because it's through the consent of the governed

00:39:23.409 --> 00:39:24.490
and if  you disagree with it

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.499
you don't have to live in that society where

00:39:26.499 --> 00:39:29.379
that operate. Alright, good so, and tell me your name.

00:39:29.379 --> 00:39:30.220
Raul

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.430
Raul is pointing out actually Raul is invoking

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.349
point number two

00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:37.170
if the taxation is by

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.670
the consent of the governed

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.640
it's not coerced

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.019
it's legitimate

00:39:44.019 --> 00:39:44.969
Bill Gates

00:39:44.969 --> 00:39:49.479
and Michael Jordan are citizens of the United
States, they get to vote for congress and they

00:39:49.479 --> 00:39:50.659
get to

00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:51.559
vote

00:39:51.559 --> 00:39:53.590
their policy convictions

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.740
just like everybody else

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.999
who would like to take that one on? John?

00:39:58.999 --> 00:40:01.629
Basically what the libertarians are

00:40:01.629 --> 00:40:06.169
objecting to in this case is the middle
eighty percent deciding what the top ten percent

00:40:06.169 --> 00:40:08.939
are doing for the bottom ten percent with
wait wait wait,

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:12.449
John, majority, don't you believe in democracy?

00:40:12.449 --> 00:40:13.330
well right but at some point,

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:17.520
don't you believe in the, I mean, you say
eighty percent ten percent, majority, majority

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.749
rule is what? majority!

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:25.749
exactly but, in a democracy aren't you
for democracy? Yes I'm for democracy but, hang on,

00:40:26.639 --> 00:40:33.639
democracy and mob rule are not the same thing. Mob rule? mob rule.
But in an open society, you have recourse 

00:40:33.899 --> 00:40:35.749
to address that through your representatives

00:40:35.749 --> 00:40:37.599
and if the majority of the consent

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:42.479
of those who are govern doesn't agree with
you

00:40:42.479 --> 00:40:45.400
then you know, you're choosing to live in the society

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.289
and you have to operate under what

00:40:47.289 --> 00:40:50.820
the majority of the society concludes

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.939
Alright, Alex, on democracy, what about that? The fact

00:40:53.939 --> 00:40:58.769
I have, you know, one five hundred thousandth
of a vote for one representative in congress

00:40:58.769 --> 00:41:00.720
is not the same thing as my

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.809
having the ability to decide for myself

00:41:03.809 --> 00:41:06.170
how to use my property rights. I'm

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.900
a drop in the bucket 

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:12.009
and you know while.. You might lose the vote

00:41:12.009 --> 00:41:14.770
exactly and they might take? and I will, I mean I don't have

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:19.179
the decision right now of whether not to pay taxes
if I don't get locked in jail or

00:41:19.179 --> 00:41:24.499
they tell me to get out of the country. Now Alex,

00:41:24.499 --> 00:41:28.589
let me make a small case for democracy

00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:30.309
and see what you would say.

00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:31.509
why can't you

00:41:31.509 --> 00:41:34.799
we live in a democratic society with freedom
of speech

00:41:34.799 --> 00:41:38.629
why can't you take to the hustings,

00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:40.220
persuade your fellow citizens

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:44.449
that taxation is unjust and try to get a majority?

00:41:44.449 --> 00:41:49.119
I don't think that people should be, should have
to convince two hundred and eighty million others

00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:50.740
simply in order to exercise

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.830
their own rights, in order to not have their self
ownership violated. I think people should be

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.969
able to do that without having to convince

00:41:56.969 --> 00:42:00.769
two hundred eighty million people. Does that
mean you're against democracy as a whole? 

00:42:00.769 --> 00:42:05.709
No I just believe in a very limited from
democracy whereby we have a constitution that

00:42:05.709 --> 00:42:06.609
severely limits

00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:08.569
the scope of what decisions

00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:10.149
can be made democratically

00:42:10.149 --> 00:42:13.959
Alright so you're saying that democracy
is fine

00:42:13.959 --> 00:42:18.639
except where fundamental rights are involved, and

00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:21.230
I think you could win if you're going on the
hustings

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:26.009
let me add one element to the argument you
might make

00:42:26.009 --> 00:42:29.889
maybe you could say, put aside the economic
debates

00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:31.059
taxation

00:42:31.059 --> 00:42:35.019
suppose the individual right to religious liberty
were at stake

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:35.999
then

00:42:35.999 --> 00:42:38.809
Alex you could say on the hustings,

00:42:38.809 --> 00:42:40.660
surely you would all agree

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.489
that we shouldn't put the right to individual
liberty

00:42:43.489 --> 00:42:45.999
up to a vote

00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:48.130
yeah that's exactly right 

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:52.890
and that's why we have constitutional amendments
and why we make it so hard to amend our constitution.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.309
so you would say

00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:57.459
that the right to private property

00:42:57.459 --> 00:43:00.979
the right of Michael Jordan to keep all the
money he makes

00:43:00.979 --> 00:43:01.830
at least

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:04.339
to protect it from redistribution

00:43:04.339 --> 00:43:06.630
is that same kind of right

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.379
with the same kind of weight

00:43:09.379 --> 00:43:11.379
as the right to freedom of speech

00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:15.589
the right to religious liberty, rights that
should trump

00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:17.529
what the majority wants

00:43:17.529 --> 00:43:21.019
absolutely the reason why we have a right
to free speech is because we have a right

00:43:21.019 --> 00:43:24.229
to own ourselves, to exercise our voice 

00:43:24.229 --> 00:43:26.309
in any way that we choose.

00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:27.469
alright, good.

00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:32.789
alright who would like to respond
to that argument about

00:43:32.789 --> 00:43:37.069
democracy being, alright there stand up

00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:41.200
I think comparing religion and economics, it's not
the same thing

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.190
the reason why Bill Gates was able to make
so much money is because we live in an economically

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:47.319
and socially stable

00:43:47.319 --> 00:43:48.069
society

00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:51.179
and if the government didn't provide for the
poorest ten percent

00:43:51.179 --> 00:43:52.259
as you say,

00:43:52.259 --> 00:43:53.989
through taxation then

00:43:53.989 --> 00:43:57.619
we would need more money for police to prevent

00:43:57.619 --> 00:44:02.399
crime and so either way there would be more taxes
taken away to provide what you guys calling

00:44:02.399 --> 00:44:04.589
and then necessary things

00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:08.799
that the government provides. What's your name? Anna.

00:44:08.799 --> 00:44:10.569
Anna let me ask you this

00:44:10.569 --> 00:44:11.699
why

00:44:11.699 --> 00:44:16.559
is the fundamental right to religious liberty

00:44:16.559 --> 00:44:19.179
different

00:44:19.179 --> 00:44:21.289
the right Alex asserts

00:44:21.289 --> 00:44:24.099
as a fundamental right

00:44:24.099 --> 00:44:25.689
to private property

00:44:25.689 --> 00:44:27.339
and to keep what I earn

00:44:27.339 --> 00:44:29.529
what's the difference between the two?

00:44:29.529 --> 00:44:30.579
because you wouldn't

00:44:30.579 --> 00:44:31.440
have

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.230
you wouldn't be able

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:33.480
to make money, you wouldn't

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.039
be able to own property

00:44:36.039 --> 00:44:39.799
there wasn't socially like if society wasn't stable.

00:44:39.799 --> 00:44:44.049
and that's very different from religion that's
like something personal, something you can practice on your own

00:44:44.049 --> 00:44:46.170
in your own your own home

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:51.249
whereas like me practicing my religion isn't going to affect another  
person, whereas if I'm poor 

00:44:51.249 --> 00:44:52.979
and I'm desperate,

00:44:52.979 --> 00:44:55.469
I might commit a crime to feed my family

00:44:55.469 --> 00:44:59.859
and that can affect others. Okay thank
you

00:44:59.859 --> 00:45:02.469
would it be wrong for someone

00:45:02.469 --> 00:45:04.819
to steal a loaf of bread

00:45:04.819 --> 00:45:06.339
to feed

00:45:06.339 --> 00:45:08.219
his starting family

00:45:08.219 --> 00:45:09.219
is that wrong?

00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:14.719
I believe that it is. let's take let's take a quick
poll of the three of you, you say yes it is wrong.

00:45:14.719 --> 00:45:16.029
it violates

00:45:16.029 --> 00:45:18.569
 property rights it's wrong.

00:45:18.569 --> 00:45:24.230
even to save the starving family? I mean there
there definitely other ways around that

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:25.880
and by justifying

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:31.409
now hang on hang on before you laugh at me

00:45:31.409 --> 00:45:33.859
before

00:45:33.859 --> 00:45:35.989
justifying the act

00:45:35.989 --> 00:45:37.329
of stealing

00:45:37.329 --> 00:45:39.309
you have to look at

00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:43.749
violating the right that we've already agreed
exists, the right of self-possession and the

00:45:43.749 --> 00:45:44.520
possession of

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.790
I mean, your own things we agree on property
right. Alright, we agree it's stealing

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:54.160
so property rights are not the issue, alright so why
is it wrong to steal even to feed your starving family?

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.140
sort of the original argument that
I made in the very in the very first question

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.750
you asked, the benefits

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.449
of an action

00:46:01.449 --> 00:46:02.709
don't justify,

00:46:02.709 --> 00:46:04.369
don’t make the action just

00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:06.220
well what would you say Julia?

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.410
Is it right to

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:12.219
steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family or to steal
a drug that

00:46:12.219 --> 00:46:14.319
your child needs to

00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:18.329
to survive

00:46:18.329 --> 00:46:22.339
I think I'm okay with that honestly, even from the libertarian  
standpoint, I think that

00:46:22.339 --> 00:46:23.199
okay saying

00:46:23.199 --> 00:46:28.059
that you can just take money arbitrarily from people who have a lot
to go to this pool of people who need

00:46:28.059 --> 00:46:28.619
it

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:32.339
but you have an individual who's acting on
their own behalf

00:46:32.339 --> 00:46:34.999
to kind of save themselves

00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:36.789
I think you said 

00:46:36.789 --> 00:46:40.590
from the idea of self-possession they are also in charge of protecting  
themselves and keeping themselves alive

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.049
so therefore even from a libertarian standpoint that might
be okay

00:46:44.049 --> 00:46:46.589
Alright that's good, that's good. Alright

00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:48.559
what about number three up here

00:46:48.559 --> 00:46:50.329
isn't it the case

00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:51.730
that the

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.959
successful, the wealthy

00:46:53.959 --> 00:47:00.529
owe a debt, they did do that all by themselves
they had to cooperate with other people

00:47:00.529 --> 00:47:05.609
that they owe a debt to society and that that's expressed in
taxation. DO you want to take that on Julie?

00:47:05.609 --> 00:47:08.130
okay this one, I believe that

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:13.519
there is not a debt to society in a sense that how did people become
wealthy? they did something that society valued

00:47:13.519 --> 00:47:13.980
highly

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.680
I think that society has already been providing for them

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:23.220
if anything I think it's everything is cancelled out,
they provided a service to society

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:26.630
and society responded by somehow they got
their wealth

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:31.669
well be concrete, in the case of Michael
Jordan, some,

00:47:31.669 --> 00:47:33.859
I mean to illustrate your point

00:47:33.859 --> 00:47:37.129
there were people who helped him make money,
teammates

00:47:37.129 --> 00:47:38.869
the coach

00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:41.339
people taught him how to play,

00:47:41.339 --> 00:47:45.219
but those you're saying, but they've all
been paid for their services

00:47:45.219 --> 00:47:45.919
exactly

00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:49.809
and society derived a lot of benefit and pleasure
from watching Michael Jordan play

00:47:49.809 --> 00:47:53.949
and I think that that's how he paid his debt
to society

00:47:53.949 --> 00:47:59.039
good, who would, anyone like to take up that point?

00:47:59.039 --> 00:48:02.069
I think that there's a problem here

00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:06.429
that we're assuming that a person has self-possession
when they live in a society

00:48:06.429 --> 00:48:11.769
I feel like when you live in a society you give up that right. I mean  
if I wanted

00:48:11.769 --> 00:48:12.480
personally

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.939
to kill someone because they offend me that
is self-possession.

00:48:15.939 --> 00:48:17.909
Because I live in a society, I cannot do that

00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:19.890
I think it's kind of an equivalent to say,

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:24.289
because I have more money I have resources that
that could save people's lives

00:48:24.289 --> 00:48:26.670
is it not okay for the government to take that
from me?

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.490
it's self-possession only to a certain extent
because I'm living in a society where I have

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:34.939
to take account of people around me. so are
you questioning, what's your name? Victoria.

00:48:34.939 --> 00:48:38.209
Victoria, are you questioning

00:48:38.209 --> 00:48:41.879
the fundamental premise of self-possession?

00:48:41.879 --> 00:48:45.889
Yes. I think that you don't really have self-possession
if you choose to live in a society

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:48.759
because you cannot just discount the people
around you.

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:51.310
Alright I want to quickly get a response

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:53.459
of

00:48:53.459 --> 00:48:55.399
the libertarian team

00:48:55.399 --> 00:48:56.550
to the last point.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:58.880
the last point

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.489
builds on,

00:49:00.489 --> 00:49:05.249
well maybe it builds on Victoria's suggestion
that we don't own ourselves

00:49:05.249 --> 00:49:07.180
because it says

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.069
that Bill Gates is wealthy

00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:13.629
that Michael Jordan makes a huge income

00:49:13.629 --> 00:49:15.680
isn't wholly

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.950
their own doing

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:19.189
it's the product of a lot of luck

00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:21.410
and so we can't claim that they

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:22.959
morally deserve

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:24.169
all the money they make. 

00:49:24.169 --> 00:49:26.419
who wants to reply to that, Alex?

00:49:26.419 --> 00:49:29.380
You certainly could make the case that

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:34.049
it is not, that their wealth is not appropriate to the 
goodness of their hearts

00:49:34.049 --> 00:49:36.959
but that's not really the more the morally relevant issue.
the point is that

00:49:36.959 --> 00:49:42.499
they have received what they have through the
free exchange of people who have given them

00:49:42.499 --> 00:49:46.200
their holdings usually in exchange for providing
some other service.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:46.929
good enough

00:49:46.929 --> 00:49:52.219
I want to try to sum up what we've learned
from this discussion but first let's thank

00:49:52.219 --> 00:49:59.219
John Alex and Julia for a really wonderful job,

00:50:02.149 --> 00:50:05.880
toward the end of the discussion just now

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.319
Victoria challenged

00:50:07.319 --> 00:50:12.119
the premise of this line of reasoning this
libertarian logic

00:50:12.119 --> 00:50:15.729
maybe, she suggested, we don't own ourselves

00:50:15.729 --> 00:50:18.009
after all

00:50:18.009 --> 00:50:20.249
if you reject

00:50:20.249 --> 00:50:25.150
the libertarian case against redistribution

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:27.659
there would seem to be

00:50:27.659 --> 00:50:29.689
an incentive

00:50:29.689 --> 00:50:34.649
to break into the libertarian line of reasoning

00:50:34.649 --> 00:50:38.499
at the earliest, at the most modest level

00:50:38.499 --> 00:50:41.210
which is why a lot of people

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:41.739
disputed

00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:43.200
that taxation

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.210
is morally equivalent to forced labor

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:50.299
but what about

00:50:50.299 --> 00:50:52.979
the big claim

00:50:52.979 --> 00:50:55.270
the premise, the big idea

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:57.680
underlying the libertarian argument,

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.019
is it true that we own ourselves

00:51:01.019 --> 00:51:02.189
or

00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:05.129
can we do without that idea

00:51:05.129 --> 00:51:07.609
and still of avoid

00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:12.469
what libertarians want to avoid

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:15.979
creating a society and an account of Justice

00:51:15.979 --> 00:51:18.569
where some people

00:51:18.569 --> 00:51:19.499
can be

00:51:19.499 --> 00:51:21.649
just used

00:51:21.649 --> 00:51:22.819
for the sake

00:51:22.819 --> 00:51:25.159
of other people's welfare

00:51:25.159 --> 00:51:26.859
or even for the sake

00:51:26.859 --> 00:51:29.159
of the general good

00:51:29.159 --> 00:51:32.469
libertarians combat the

00:51:32.469 --> 00:51:33.519
utilitarian idea

00:51:33.519 --> 00:51:36.450
of using people

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:37.599
as means

00:51:37.599 --> 00:51:39.759
for the collective happiness

00:51:39.759 --> 00:51:46.619
by saying the way to put a stop to that utilitarian
logic of using persons

00:51:46.619 --> 00:51:50.309
is to resort to the intuitively  powerful
idea

00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:56.839
that we are the proprietors of our own person

00:51:56.839 --> 00:51:59.089
That's Alex and Julia and John,

00:51:59.089 --> 00:52:03.140
and Robert Nozick

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:06.139
what are the consequences

00:52:06.139 --> 00:52:07.789
for a theory of justice

00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:09.880
and an account of rights

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.440
of calling into question

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.289
the idea of self-possession

00:52:15.289 --> 00:52:18.069
does it mean that we're back to utilitarianism

00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:19.209
and using people

00:52:19.209 --> 00:52:20.859
and aggregating preferences

00:52:20.859 --> 00:52:27.609
and pushing the fat man off the bridge?

00:52:27.609 --> 00:52:31.519
Nozick doesn't

00:52:31.519 --> 00:52:33.189
himself,

00:52:33.189 --> 00:52:37.959
fully develop the idea of self-possession
he borrows it from an earlier philosopher

00:52:37.959 --> 00:52:40.229
John Locke

00:52:40.229 --> 00:52:41.949
John Locke

00:52:41.949 --> 00:52:44.209
accounted

00:52:44.209 --> 00:52:47.119
for the rise of private property

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:49.879
from the state of nature

00:52:49.879 --> 00:52:56.059
by a chain of reasoning very similar to the
one that Nozick and the libertarians use

00:52:56.059 --> 00:52:58.699
John Locke said

00:52:58.699 --> 00:53:01.509
private property arises

00:53:01.509 --> 00:53:02.619
because

00:53:02.619 --> 00:53:05.229
when we mix our labor

00:53:05.229 --> 00:53:06.390
with things

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:09.199
unowned things

00:53:09.199 --> 00:53:13.410
we come to acquire a property right in those
things

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:15.399
the reason?

00:53:15.399 --> 00:53:18.079
the reason is that we own our own labor

00:53:18.079 --> 00:53:20.910
and the reason for that

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:23.599
we're the proprietors the owners

00:53:23.599 --> 00:53:25.679
of our own person

00:53:25.679 --> 00:53:29.369
and so in order to examine

00:53:29.369 --> 00:53:34.639
the moral force of the libertarian claim
that that we own ourselves

00:53:34.639 --> 00:53:36.889
we need to turn

00:53:36.889 --> 00:53:40.359
to the English political philosopher John Locke

00:53:40.359 --> 00:53:43.939
and examine his account of private property

00:53:43.939 --> 00:53:45.579
and self ownership

00:53:45.579 --> 00:53:52.579
and that's what we'll do next time

00:53:55.479 --> 00:53:58.970
