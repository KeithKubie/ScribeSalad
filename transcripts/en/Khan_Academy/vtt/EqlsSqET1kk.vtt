00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:03.680
- [Voiceover] We're gonna
talk about the equations

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.180
that describe how a capacitor
works, and then I'll give you

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.764
an example of how these equations work.

00:00:10.764 --> 00:00:14.931
The basic equation of a capacitor,
says that the charge, Q,

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:19.611
on a capacitor, is equal
to the capacitance value,

00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:22.592
times the voltage across the capacitor.

00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:24.841
Here's our capacitor over here.

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:29.008
Let's say we have a voltage
on it, of plus or minus V.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:35.494
We say it has a capacitance value of C.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:38.457
That's a property of this device here.

00:00:38.457 --> 00:00:41.792
C is equal to, just looking
at the equation over there,

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.939
C is equal to the ratio of the charge,

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:45.967
stored in the capacitor, divided

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.799
by the voltage of the capacitor.

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.549
What we mean by stored charge is,

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.437
if a current flows into this capacitor,

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:57.521
it can leave some excess
charge on the top.

00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:59.524
I'll just mark that with plus signs.

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:03.680
There will be a corresponding
set of minus charges,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.680
on the other plate of the capacitor.

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:11.869
This collection of
excess charge will be Q ,

00:01:12.752 --> 00:01:15.067
and this down here will be Q-,

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:17.215
and they're gonna be the same value.

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:19.855
What we say here, is when the
capacitor's in this state,

00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:23.229
we say it's storing this much charge.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.303
We'll just name one of these numbers here.

00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:27.920
They're gonna be the
same, with opposite signs.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.087
That's what it means for a
capacitor to store charge.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.743
What I want to do now, is
develop some sort of expression

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:39.260
that relates the current
through a capacitor,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.255
to the voltage.

00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:43.588
We want to develop an IV characteristic,

00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:46.508
so this will correspond, sort of like,

00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:48.482
Ohm's Law for a capacitor.

00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:51.917
What relates the current to the voltage.

00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:55.114
The way I'm gonna do that,
is to exercise this equation,

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.842
by causing some changes.

00:01:56.842 --> 00:02:01.416
In particular, we'll change
the voltage on this capacitor,

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:04.244
and we'll see what happens over here.

00:02:04.244 --> 00:02:06.394
When we say we're gonna
change a voltage, that means

00:02:06.394 --> 00:02:10.561
we're gonna create something,
a condition of DV, DT.

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:15.295
A change in voltage per change in time.

00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:17.896
I can do that by taking the derivative

00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:21.087
of both sides of this equation here.

00:02:21.087 --> 00:02:23.208
I've already done it for this side.

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:26.208
Over here, what I'll have is DQ, DT.

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:31.950
I took the derivative of
both sides, just to be sure

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.271
I treated both sides of
the equation, the same.

00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:37.689
Let's look at this little
expression right here.

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.090
This is kind of interesting.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.521
This is change of charge,
with change of time.

00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:47.521
That's equal to, that's
what we mean by current.

00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:50.860
That is current.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.193
The symbol for current is I.

00:02:55.718 --> 00:03:00.126
DQ, DT is current, essentially,
by definition, we give

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:04.293
it the symbol I, and that's
gonna be equal to C DV, DT.

00:03:12.411 --> 00:03:14.610
This is an important equation.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.860
That's, basically, the IV relationship,

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.376
between current and
voltage, in a capacitor.

00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.395
What it tells us, that the current

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:27.345
is actually proportional to,

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:30.333
and the proportionality constant is C,

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:33.138
the current's proportional to
the rate of change of voltage.

00:03:33.138 --> 00:03:34.278
Not the voltage itself,

00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:38.112
but to the rate of change of voltage.

00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:41.482
Now, what I want to do
is find a expression

00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:44.026
that expresses V, in terms of I.

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:47.276
Here we have I, in terms of DV, DT.

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:49.362
Let's figure out if we can express V,

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:52.891
in terms of some expression containing I.

00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:53.724
The way I do that is, I need

00:03:53.724 --> 00:03:56.123
to eliminate this derivative here.

00:03:56.123 --> 00:03:59.505
I'm gonna do that by taking
the integral of this side

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.925
of the equation, and at
the same time, I'll take

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:03.117
the integral of the other side

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:05.817
of the equation, to keep everything equal.

00:04:05.817 --> 00:04:09.567
What that looks like
is, the integral of I...

00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:16.907
With respect to time,
is equal to the integral

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.976
of C DV, DT, with respect to time, DT.

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:32.556
On this side, I have basically,
I do something like this.

00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:35.522
I have the integral of DV.

00:04:35.522 --> 00:04:37.873
This looks like an anti-derivative.

00:04:37.873 --> 00:04:41.155
This is an integral, acting
like an anti-derivative.

00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:44.238
What function has a derivative of DV?

00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:48.553
That would be just plain V.

00:04:48.553 --> 00:04:50.357
I can rewrite this side of the equation,

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:53.013
constant C comes out of the expression,

00:04:53.013 --> 00:04:54.928
and we end up with V, on this side.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:56.406
Just plain V.

00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:59.156
That equals the integral of I DT.

00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:08.560
We're part way through,
we're developing what's gonna

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.362
be called an integral form
of the capacitor IV equation.

00:05:13.362 --> 00:05:14.602
What I need to look at next is,

00:05:14.602 --> 00:05:17.624
what are the bounds, on this integral?

00:05:17.624 --> 00:05:21.326
The bounds on this integral
are basically minus time,

00:05:21.326 --> 00:05:25.866
equals minus infinity, to
time equals sub-time T,

00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:28.272
which is sort of like the time now.

00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:31.367
That equals capacitance times voltage.

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:34.058
Let me take this C,
over on the other side,

00:05:34.058 --> 00:05:37.418
and actually, I'm gonna move
V over here, onto the left.

00:05:37.418 --> 00:05:40.335
Then, I can write this, one over C.

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:45.744
This is the normal looking
version of this equation.

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:48.411
I DT, minus infinity to time, T.

00:05:52.973 --> 00:05:55.556
Time, big T, is time right now.

00:05:56.807 --> 00:05:59.476
What this says, it says that
the voltage on a capacitor

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:01.726
has something to do with the summation,

00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:05.552
or the integral, of the
current, over its entire life,

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:09.154
all the way back to T
equals minus infinity.

00:06:09.154 --> 00:06:11.182
This is not so convenient.

00:06:11.182 --> 00:06:15.674
What we're gonna do instead,
is we're gonna pick a time.

00:06:15.674 --> 00:06:18.115
We'll pick a time called T equals zero,

00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:20.385
and we'll say that the
voltage on the capacitor

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:24.385
was equal to, let's say,
V not, with some value.

00:06:26.755 --> 00:06:28.690
Then, what we'll do, is we're gonna change

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.813
the limit on our integral here,

00:06:30.813 --> 00:06:34.141
from minus infinity, to
time, T, equals zero.

00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:37.301
Then, we'll use the
integral from, instead,

00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:40.184
zero to the time, we're interested in.

00:06:40.184 --> 00:06:41.369
That equation looks like this.

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:45.536
We're just gonna change
the limits on the integral.

00:06:55.385 --> 00:06:57.305
We have the integral now, but
we have to actually account

00:06:57.305 --> 00:07:00.543
for all the time, before T equals zero.

00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:05.139
What we do there, is we
just basically add V not.

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.316
Whatever V not is, that's
the starting point,

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:10.104
at time equals zero, and
then the integral takes us,

00:07:10.104 --> 00:07:12.604
from time zero until time now.

00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:17.976
This is the integral form
of the capacitor equation.

00:07:17.976 --> 00:07:21.893
I want to actually make
one more little change.

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:30.175
This is the current at
V, as a function of T.

00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:33.037
What we really want to write here,

00:07:33.037 --> 00:07:35.719
is we wanna write V of a little T.

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:38.152
This is just stylistically,
this is what we like

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:40.766
this equation to look like.

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:45.508
I want the limits on my
integral, to be zero to t.

00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:49.473
Now, I need to sort of
make a new replacement

00:07:49.473 --> 00:07:51.311
for this T that's inside here.

00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:52.992
I can call it something else.

00:07:52.992 --> 00:07:56.075
I can call it I of, I'll call it tau.

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:01.556
This is basically just
a little fake variable.

00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:02.973
D tau plus V not.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.518
This is, now, we finally have it,

00:08:09.518 --> 00:08:13.685
this is the integral form
of the capacitor equation.

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:17.914
We have the other form of the
equation that goes with this,

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:20.247
which was I equals C DV, DT.

00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:33.663
There's the two forms of
the capacitor equation.

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:36.417
Now, I want to do an
example with this one here,

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:40.495
just to see how it works, when
we have a capacitor circuit.
