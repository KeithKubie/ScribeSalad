00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.500
So, there's a lot of trends
in the Silicon Valley.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.703
Should I, as an entrepreneur,
look for an idea around the trend?

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:12.220
&gt;&gt; Again, I think it depends.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.890
There's a lot of people who can be very,
kind of like, trans centric.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.110
Social mobile local is hard,
so let's all go chase that.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.610
Or, everybody wants to,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.440
I don't know how many companies have
heard about shared economy, you know?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.100
Back in 2000s,
there was this wave about pets.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.820
So, I think that there's a lot of this,
I hate to use the word herd mentality,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.710
everybody wants to go do the same thing.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.370
But, having said that, I think it's
valuable to look at current disruptions,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.800
current dislocations,
like for example, mobile.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.530
Having a camera on the mobile phone, or

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.030
having your location
on the mobile phone.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.200
It's created businesses around
like Uber or Instagram.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.350
These are really mobile first companies.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.440
And this wasn't possible,
six, seven, eight years ago.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.860
So, I think studying, hey there is this
big movement from landlines to mobile.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.566
I think, people can consciously think
about down screen impacts of those

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.820
things, and
businesses then can then be created.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.850
Music is another great example.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.222
Music has been massively disrupted,
around how you produce it,

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:27.748
how do you distribute it,
and all of that.

00:01:27.748 --> 00:01:35.140
Companies like Spotify, or even device
makers, iPods and phones, and so on.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.910
So, I think there's a lot of benefit
in thinking about disruptions,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.420
and what does that mean three years
from now, six years from now.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.630
A cloud is a great example.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.762
All right.

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:49.310
AWSI are doing cloud, and now there
are numerous companies that got

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.330
created around that trend,
security, payments, and so on.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.780
So, I think it's valuable, but

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.360
having said that, I don't want to just
recommend that as the only approach.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.370
We can see companies that are created
in retail, in agriculture,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.410
in insurance, in data, and so on.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.250
So, just old-fashioned industries
that people are not looking at.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.850
But, there's a lot of opportunity,
because incumbents populate those,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.550
and it's not the sexy thing to do.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.240
But you can definitely
create businesses there.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.480
&gt;&gt; So, as an entrepreneur,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.190
how should I think about competition,
and how should it impact my product?

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.480
&gt;&gt; I think it's very important
to be aware of the competition.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.890
But, I think it also depends
on the state of the company.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.740
I've seen entrepreneurs
that get very distracted

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.020
by trying to follow and
copy every move off their competition.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.080
I think it's not very healthy.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.820
Especially, if you're trying
to go after a new market,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.030
if you're creating a new category.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.620
You let somebody else define
your moves and your product.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.070
And that's not healthy.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.810
But, I think as you start maturing,
and as you start optimizing

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.840
it's useful to think about even
small differences in the product

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.610
can create massive differences
in the mindset of consumers.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.030
So, I think if I were to simplify,
if you're just getting going,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.880
if you're in a new category,
don't let the competition define you.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.240
But if you're mature,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.840
I think you need to pay more
attention to the competition.
