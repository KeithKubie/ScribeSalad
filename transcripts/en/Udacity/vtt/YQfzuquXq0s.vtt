00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
And the answer here is that the length of the tour

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.180
is exactly 2  the weight of the spanning tree.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.320
That is because of the way that the walk was constructed,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.500
so you'll remember that when I just showed you how to walk along a spanning tree,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.270
or any tree for that matter, you use every edge exactly twice.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.220
So, if the weight of the tree is the sum of all the edges,

00:00:26.220 --> 99:59:59.000
then the length of the tour will be twice that number.
