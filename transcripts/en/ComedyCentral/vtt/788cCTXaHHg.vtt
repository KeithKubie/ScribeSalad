Nowadays, having Internet access
is just as important

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.506
as things like education
and free speech.

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:08.809
After all, it's how most of us
apply for jobs, do our jobs,

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.911
tweet things that cause us
to lose our jobs.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.313
That is why the United Nations
Human Rights Council

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:16.383
has passed a non-binding
resolution condemning countries

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.519
that disrupt citizens'
Internet access.

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:20.621
So now it's considered
a basic human right

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.189
to say stuff like this.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.325
"Y'all know that Atlanta spelled
backyards is Atlanta."

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.995
(laughter)

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.963
Mm...

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:34.701
I think there are other things

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:36.937
that Jay do not got
besides that juice.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.173
-Uh...
-FLEMING: No juice.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.807
MANDYAM:
Chris, he does not speak

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.843
for all Jays, all right?
I just want you to know.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.611
HARDWICK: Okay, he is
a one and only Jay.

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.981
-He does not speak for all Jays.
-Hashtag #notalljays.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.551
God bless America.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:53.353
Hopefully, this will lead
to some sort of Internet bill

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:54.755
of human rights guaranteeing

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.857
that everyone has high-speed
access to our dankest memes.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.192
Comedians,
what's something you might find

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.160
on an Internet bill of rights?

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:01.628
-Emily.
-The right to delete

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:03.263
your history
when your boyfriend gets home.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:05.199
-I mean... -All right,
I'll give you points.

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.400
(applause and cheering)

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.535
-Jay.
-The 34th amendment is

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.804
if it exists,
somebody's jerking off to it.

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:12.773
HARDWICK: Yeah, that's the 34th
amendment, I believe.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.341
(applause)

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.844
Uh, I think it was Ben Franklin
who said that.

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:18.812
Uh, John Ross Bowie.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.948
You have the right
to a speedy trial

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.650
of middle schoolers calling you
Hitler in the comment section.

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:23.750
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Points.
