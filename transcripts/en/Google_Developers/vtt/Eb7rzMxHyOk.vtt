COLT MCANLIS: You
know, compression

00:00:01.458 --> 00:00:03.680
has always had a warm
spot in my heart.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.620
It's kind of this weird
place where data algorithms,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.500
and information
analysis, and performance

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.340
all mix in the middle.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.630
In reality, a lot of programmers
have allowed compression

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.460
to pass them by.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.570
It's sort of a lost art.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.250
With most algorithms out there,
like JPEG, ZIP, and everything

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.129
else, people are
content to just let

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:23.920
data compression be
someone else's problem.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.760
But it's an amazing science,
an amazing suite of algorithms.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.750
And more people should
have compression

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.290
in their programming toolbox.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.690
There's 5 billion human
beings on the planet who

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.445
still don't have
broadband connectivity.

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.860
And for these individuals,
getting them on the internet

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.770
and having them have the
same sort of access to data,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.880
and the same abilities, and life
process that comes from that,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.760
is actually cost prohibitive.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.330
Man, if you want to look
at the next 10 to 15 years

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.330
of computing and
adoption in the world,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.270
compression's going
to be right there

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.770
at the middle of all this,
making it all happen.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.310
For something as complex
and as deep as compression,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.620
we got to find a different way
to teach people the problems.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.690
The audience for Compressor
Head is every programmer.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.410
It doesn't matter if you're
writing application software,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.650
web apps, mobile apps,
you care about data.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.360
And you need to know how
to manipulate, understand,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.770
and analyze your data
to make it as small

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.062
and cost efficient as possible.

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:23.270
It doesn't matter if you're
a beginner, intermediate,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.170
or a professional.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.450
There's something in this
video series just for you.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.800
