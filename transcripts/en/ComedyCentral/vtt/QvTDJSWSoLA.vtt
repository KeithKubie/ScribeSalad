00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.360
And then she slips into

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.820
like full on tantrum mode where
she like presses herself into

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.220
the wall and starts going, "You
owe me a major apology."

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:01.428
Thank you, everybody.
On this show here's what

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.797
happens, it's just a bunch of
comics telling true stories and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.799
that's all it is. Tonight it's
all about fights. He's

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.768
absolutely hilarious, you guys
love him. Give it up, Mr. Will

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.771
Weldon, everybody. Let him hear
it. I was out on a

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:15.442
second date with a lady. And our
first date had been fine, you

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.679
know like date where afterwards
you're like, "I still have no

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:22.616
opinion on this person." Like it
could still.. We had a nice

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.687
time, but then she slept in
until 11:30 the next morning,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.258
and that's a weird thing to do
in a stranger's bed. Like it's

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.927
just weird, it's weird to have
someone in your bed and you've

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:38.232
like written some e-mails and
read for a bit, and you've got

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.368
like a coffee and you're like,
"I don't know, is she dead? What

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:46.306
do I do now?" But, uh,
so we went out again. And I took

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.977
her to get dinner to pay her
back for the tickets to this

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.112
thing we did on the first date.
Also, we didn't sleep together,

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.449
in case she sees this and she's
like, "You lying piece of shit."

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.719
She just slept at my place, so I
didn't even like wear her out

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:02.256
with sex or anything. We were
like, "Good night." I don't do

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.760
that anyway. It's not my move.
But so we go out, we

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:10.831
get dinner and that's nice, it's
a nice time and she tells me I'm

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:13.767
like cute and funny. And I'm
like, "Yeah, sure, I don't know

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.371
how to feel good about myself in
appropriate ways, so that's

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:21.808
perfect. That's just what I need
outside validation." And we go

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:25.512
back to my apartment, we leave
my car and her purse there and

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:31.318
we go to a bar and we drink at a
bar 'cause you do. And we're

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.087
there and we're having like a
nice time. And she's like three

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:39.359
beers in and then I kinda just
see her face kinda start to

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:42.963
change. And earlier in the night
we walked by a bridal store,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.999
just like by happen stance. And
she had been like, "That's a

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.271
really nice dress." And I was
like, "Slow down, like.." 'Cause

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.741
I'm an asshole so I was like,
"Take it easy, lady."

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:59.112
She was like, "No no, I just
mean, it's nice, it's a

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.514
well-made dress." I was like,
"Well, I don't want to get

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.182
married again anyway, so it
doesn't matter to me 'cause I'm

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:06.887
an asshole." And she's sitting
there at the second bar and I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.790
kind of see her.. she's like
laughing and I like watch her

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:17.064
face get very serious and she's
just like, "You know, Will, I

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:21.134
think it's really sad that you
don't want to get married again.

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:25.472
You know, I think it's really
sad. I think it's sad, you don't

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:28.208
want to get married again
because you are basing that

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:34.515
decision not off of a marriage,
but off of a divorce. Because

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:38.719
you are divorced, Will. You're
divorced." First of

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:45.826
all, I know. I was there and it
was terrible. But also, I was

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:52.099
also married. Like I can't just
be divorced. You must be married

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.103
to get divorced. And I start to
explain to her that and then

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:58.138
I'll tell her like, "Oh it's
just not for me and I'm not

00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:00.674
insulting the institution." And
I start to say that and she

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:04.845
goes, "No! No! Do not interrupt
me, do not interrupt me or I

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:08.882
will leave!" And in my brain I'm
like, "I wonder if there is a

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:12.052
way for me to get her to just
leave now." 'Cause the date is

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:16.056
over at this point. No one is
ever like, "Well, she won me

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:20.794
over when she screamed in my
face not to interrupt her.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.163
That's when I knew, that's when
we really clicked, when she made

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:27.267
a scene on the second date."
And then she's like

00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:30.571
spiraling, she's getting so mad.
She's like, "It's pathetic, it

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:32.506
is pathetic you don't want to
get married again. It's

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.575
pathetic. You're just so
pathetic. It's pathetic you

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:37.644
don't want to get married again
because I have been through so

00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:41.415
much in my life and I will get
married. I would get married and

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.383
I have been through so much. I
had a fiancé who abused me

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:50.224
physically, emotionally, and
sexually. Yeah, I'm cool with

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:53.560
those things now, but at the
time I was not cool with what he

00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:56.597
wanted me to do in bed. Which I
love that she was like, "Yeah

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.834
I'm cool now, don't worry about
it, but back then, in case you

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:07.875
turn this around somehow, you're
in for a good time, buddy."

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.910
And she's like "It's
pathetic, I, you know, I was

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:12.779
anorexic, I weighed ninety five
pounds, and now I am one hundred

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:17.050
and ten and now I am healthy, I
am healthy. Okay?" And maybe

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.320
that seems like a lot of like
personal information to be

00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:23.423
throwing at someone on a second
date, but earlier in the night

00:05:23.457 --> 00:05:25.726
I'd been talking to her and she
had mentioned she and her and

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.395
mom donít get along and she was
like, "Yeah, I think my mom

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:32.332
resents me because when I get
pregnant at eighteen, I went and

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:35.302
got an abortion and like made
the decision that she didn't

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.505
have the courage to make." And
also knew that she was an only

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.675
child, so I was like, "Are you
ripping on your mom for not

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:47.247
aborting you right now?" I am
very pro-choice, but even to me

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:52.186
that seems crazy. "You
coward, you didn't abort me, you

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:58.425
piece of shit." Like, it's
insane behavior. And she's so

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.361
mad, she's like, "Pathetic, you
piece of shit, it's pathetic."

00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:04.831
And then she's like, "We are.. I
am calling an Uber and we are

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:07.768
going back to your place and you
are driving me home." And I was

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:12.906
like, "I've got a crazy idea,
why don't you call an Uber and

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.044
go home? Like, why don't we cut
out the middle man being me and

00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:20.180
you just go home? Because,
honestly, you've been really

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:24.084
rude to me tonight. I don't want
to drive you home." And she

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:37.798
goes, [gasps] "How dare you?
First of all, my purse is at

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:40.934
your apartment and I do not know
where you live." And I filed

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:44.738
that away in the good news pile,
for sure. Checkmark.

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:49.076
And then she's like, "But, also,
how are you talk to me like

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:52.646
that? No one has ever spoken to
me that way." Which means she

00:06:52.679 --> 00:07:00.888
had the world's most polite
abusive fiancé. Like, he'd just

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:07.628
be like, "Time for a walloping,
Madame." So I'm like, "Yeah,

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:10.564
sure, fine, just get out of my
life." So we go out and she

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:14.034
calls the Uber, it shows up, we
get in. I open the door for her

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:18.539
and as she gets in she goes,
"Fuck you," like under.. like

00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:21.542
she's like, "Now is not the time
for chivalry." So we

00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:24.578
take the car back to her house
and I'm talking with the driver

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:28.382
as if nothing's going on 'cause
I know it is making her so mad

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:32.753
that I am not acknowledging the
reality of the situation.. That

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.655
I'm just like, "Oh yeah, crazy
night. Nah, we were just having

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:37.524
drinks and heading back now."
She's like, "I'm gonna.. this

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:43.630
piece of shit.. I just wanna.."
So we get back and we go up to

00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:46.166
my apartment. I go and splash
like cold water on my face

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.769
'cause that's like what people
do in movies during really

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.472
stressful situations. And I go
into my bedroom and she's like,

00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:56.310
"I looked it up, a taxi home is
twenty five dollars, you owe me

00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:59.413
twenty five dollars."
And I'm like, "No, no, I'll

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:02.683
drive you home. It's not.. I
will drive you home, like I want

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:05.118
to make sure you get home safe."
And she's like, "I'm not getting

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:11.825
in a car with you after you have
spoken to me like this. You have

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:14.862
called me rude and a bitch." And
I was like, "I did not call you

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:17.464
a bitch, I don't call people
that. I don't use that word, I

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.167
did not call you that." So she's
like, "Well, calling me rude is

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.839
the same thing." It's
really not the same thing at

00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:29.943
all, at all, at all, at all.
Like if you look up "rude" in

00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:33.146
the dictionary, it's not gonna
be like, "See also: bitch,"

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:39.786
like. So I'm like, "No, I'm not
giving you money." And she's

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.357
like, "Give me twenty dollars."
I go, "No." She goes, "Give me

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.394
fifteen." I go, "No!" And she's
like, "Okay, ten." And I'm like,

00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:50.898
"This is not a Bazaar in
Calcutta, alright? We're not

00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:56.403
bartering over your.. you're
getting a ride home or you're

00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:58.071
paying for your own way home,
but I'm not giving you any

00:08:58.071 --> 00:09:02.009
money." And then she
starts to cry and she's like,

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:07.748
"Well, apologize to me then.
Apologize. You owe me a major

00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:11.552
apology." That is going to
become a key phrase over the

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:15.689
course of the night: "a major
apology". She's like, "You owe

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:21.562
me a major apology." And in my
brain I go, "Hey, now might be a

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:27.134
good time for me to take the
world's stupidest and most

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:29.169
pointless stand." And I go, "No,
I will not apologize to you. I'm

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:32.039
not apologizing to you." And
she's like, "Apologize,

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:36.043
apologize!" And she's like
crying and she storms out, slams

00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:40.447
my front door. I go to my
roommate's room, uh, and he's

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.850
like, "What was that?" And I'm
like, "I have a story for you,

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:46.420
sir." And as soon as I
finished it, there's like a

00:09:46.453 --> 00:09:51.191
pounding on the front door. And
I go, "For sure, that's her."

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:52.860
Um, absolutely, one hundred
percent. There's no way it's

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:55.329
not, it's not Rahad downstairs
like, "Just reminder about the

00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:58.165
rent. Just wanted to pound on
your door at one thirty in the

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:01.468
morning." So I go down and she's
staying there and she's crying

00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:04.938
and she's like, "You asshole.
Why didn't you answer your

00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:09.476
phone? I just want a ride home."
And I'm like, "Well, my phone's

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.880
on silent because if I, I don't
know if you remember this, but

00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:16.650
at one point tonight we were on
a date with each other." Like I

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:19.520
know it seems like a long time
ago.. And I'm like, "Okay, I

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:24.358
will drive you home." And she's
like, "No, apologize,

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:28.328
apologize!" And then
she slips into like full on

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:33.033
tantrum mode where she like
presses herself against the wall

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:42.075
and she starts going, "You owe
me a major apology. You owe me a

00:10:42.109 --> 00:10:43.977
major apology." Like you know
how kids get out an impossible

00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:46.847
number of words in one breath
and you're like, "How are you

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.385
saying these many words so
forcefully with one intake of

00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:56.190
breath?" So then she migrates to
my front yard and sits down and

00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:59.459
is still crying and she's
calling.. She calls me and I

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:03.297
hang up on her and I'm like,
"I'm still over here, you know."

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.732
So I go over and she's
still freaking out and finally I

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:11.972
go, "Listen, if you will not let
me drive you home, I'm gonna go

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:14.575
back inside. I'm not doing this
all night." And she's like, "If

00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:21.215
you go inside, I will pound on
your door all night." I go,

00:11:21.248 --> 00:11:27.120
"Well, if you do that I'm going
to have to call the police." And

00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:35.562
she goes, "You fucking psycho!
What the fuck? You're going to

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:40.234
call the police on me? What the
fuck is wrong with you?" And

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:42.769
then she flips, and she's like,
"You piece of shit, I'm fucking

00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:46.139
glad you're divorced. You
deserve to be divorced; you

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:48.876
don't deserve anything in life!"
And I'm like, "So you

00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:53.347
don't want the ride home then?
Is what I'm taking from this."

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.250
So I start to go back upstairs
and she's like following me like

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:59.586
cursing me out like a reverse
hype man.. I'm like a rap..

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.056
like, "You piece of shit, you're
nothing and I hope you don't

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.527
ever get anything and you're a
fucking garbage to me." So I go

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.930
and I close the door behind me
in her face and my roommate is

00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:13.133
standing at the top of the
stairs and he goes, "I thought

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:19.339
you were exaggerating!"
So she's like pounding on the

00:12:19.373 --> 00:12:21.275
door and then she starts calling
me and she's like, "You fucking

00:12:21.308 --> 00:12:25.179
piece of shit. You piece of
shit. Face me! Come down here

00:12:25.212 --> 00:12:32.119
and face me!" Like, like she's
Achilles in Troy, like I

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:33.754
murdered her brother and she's
like, "Face me in one-on-one

00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:36.890
combat, you coward! Come down
from your battlement, Eric

00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:42.596
Banner." So she's pounding on
the door and she's calling me,

00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:44.598
and then she's like, "You
fucking cunt, you fucking

00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:48.468
coward." And then she goes, "Be
a man and face me! Why don't you

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:53.874
be a man and grow a cunt?"
Well, like, the best

00:12:53.907 --> 00:12:57.644
insult of all time. Like that's
so good. Like in her brain she

00:12:57.678 --> 00:13:00.380
was like, "Yeah I'm mad but I'm
still going to strike a blow

00:13:00.414 --> 00:13:07.688
against society's binary notions
of gender. Okay?" So finally she

00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:11.058
figures out the magic sentence
which is, "Get down here or I'm

00:13:11.058 --> 00:13:13.393
going to destroy your car." And
I'm like, "Fair enough, I will

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:17.197
see you in a few moments. Very
good, you found the magic

00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:21.468
phrase." So I go down and I show
her on my phone I've dialed 911

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:27.307
and I press call and then she is
like [gasps], ìYou called the

00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:31.645
police on me? I just want a ride
home. Hang up!" So I hang up

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:36.683
because why wouldn't I trust
her? Like, has she acted

00:13:36.717 --> 00:13:39.753
irrationally at any point
tonight? No, no! Oh, the most

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:41.955
trustworthy source of the world.
So I hang up, and it's

00:13:41.989 --> 00:13:45.959
her. And I'm like, "Okay, let's
go. Why don't we.." And as soon

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:49.296
as I put my hand on her shoulder
she's like, "You piece of shit.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:52.266
You don't fucking touch me! You
don't touch me!" She slaps me in

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:56.103
the face and then she tries to
kick me, but like I.. for some

00:13:56.103 --> 00:14:00.340
reason, I throw up like an MMA
style shin block. Not a thing I

00:14:00.374 --> 00:14:03.777
have ever tried before. I was
like, "As long as I am embracing

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:09.716
new experiences, why don't I
give this one for a spin?"

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:18.859
And so I press redial
'cause that's a thing you can do

00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:20.294
on a phone, that's like the flaw
in her plan to get me not to

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:21.862
call the police and then to
attack me is I can be like, "Oh,

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:23.163
right, I should have not hung up
in the first place." So I press

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:26.600
redial and the dispatcher comes
on and Iím like, "There is a

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.102
woman I was on a date with
attacking me in my front yard

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:33.307
right now." Like as I say the
words out loud I'm like, "Hold

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.744
on, is this really what's
happening right now?" And also

00:14:37.778 --> 00:14:40.881
I'm being very casual on the
phone 'cause I'm not scared. She

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:43.550
is like so tiny. Like I'm not
scared of her, worst case

00:14:43.584 --> 00:14:47.087
scenario I just have to like
destroy her in a fist fight.

00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:51.091
Like that is, she's not gonna
beat me. I'm just gonna

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:54.728
take her, it's like that fight
Zdeno Chara of the Boston Bruins

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:58.298
got in where he was just like
waving a guy around from his

00:14:58.332 --> 00:15:00.901
jersey. So I'm.. I tell the
dispatcher what's happening and

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:06.073
then this lady runs away. She
runs off into the night like the

00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:10.244
world's shittiest mystical
creature. Like she was like, "My

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:17.918
terrible work here is done." I
don't.. I still don't know what

00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:20.721
that work was. And
she.. so she's running off and

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:26.193
I'm talking to the dispatcher
and then the cops come and I'm

00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:29.496
like, "A woman was here." I was
like, "She ran off." I'm like,

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.132
"I don't want to file charges or
anything, I just don't know how

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:34.234
she's going to get home." I was
like, "I'm sorry this is like

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:36.136
such a stupid call." And the
cops were like, "No, this is

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.605
great, we love the easy ones."
I'm like, "That's always great

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.707
to hear cops be like, "No, no,
we hate working, this is

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:43.810
perfect." That was..the most,
the second most reassuring

00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:46.513
moment of the evening.
And then they leave and then she

00:15:46.547 --> 00:15:48.949
calls me twice and I send her to
voicemail, she does not leave

00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:54.221
one. One of my life's great
regrets. And then after that,

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:58.091
she texts me a, "You know, it's
really rude to not answer my

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:03.597
phone calls." Like, the most
serious de-escalation of all

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.465
time. But the best.. and I never
hear from her again, that is it

00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:08.836
for our interaction. She blocks
me on Tinder and Instagram,

00:16:08.869 --> 00:16:11.839
that's fine. There's a lot of
selfies of her bedroom, that's

00:16:11.872 --> 00:16:14.241
fine. While I'm talking to the
dispatcher, the best part is I'm

00:16:14.274 --> 00:16:18.412
telling her what happened and
I'm like, "Yeah, she attacked me

00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:23.116
and she just ran off, she's run
up the street toward Sunset. I

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.720
don't know how she's going to
get home." And the lady goes,

00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:31.291
"Are you still seeing her, sir?"
And I'm like, "No, I'm not gonna

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:36.129
keep seeing her!" And then the
dispatcher goes, "No, sir, I'm

00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:41.702
asking if she's still visible to
you." Like I think she's so bad

00:16:41.735 --> 00:16:45.072
at her job she going to be like,
"Are you going to see her again?

00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:50.077
'Cause this bitch sounds crazy."
Alright I'm done. Thanks, guys.
