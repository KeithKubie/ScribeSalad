00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.020
LYNNE MURPHY: I am from
upstate New York.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.360
CGP GREY: I'm from downstate
New York.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.060
LYNNE MURPHY: I live now
in Brighton, England.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.450
CGP GREY: And I live
in London now.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.050
BRADY HARAN: So how long have
you been in the UK?

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.910
LYNNE MURPHY: 13 years.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.830
CGP GREY: So I've been living
here for 10 years.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.130
And I've spent a lot of that
time working as a physics

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.675
teacher in secondary schools.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.580
LYNNE MURPHY: So if you're
giving somebody your phone

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.480
number or your credit card
number, and you've got two

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.110
numbers in a row that
are the same.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.700
So my number is 8844
in my office.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.240
The British way to say that
would be double 8, double 4.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.955
And it would have never
occurred to me

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:37.350
to say it that way.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650
CGP GREY: I don't know about
Americans in general.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.240
But I can say that for me, when
I moved to London, I was

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.250
really thrown by the
double numbers

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.710
thing for quite a while.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.280
LYNNE MURPHY: I would
say 8, 8, 4, 4.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.980
I might say 88, 44.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.500
But I wouldn't say double
8, double 4.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.880
CGP GREY: When I moved here,
there were two problems.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.560
One is the double
numbers thing.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.080
And the second thing is that
people say the telephone

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.170
numbers in a different pattern
than they do US numbers.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.200
So it was that different
pattern, plus people saying

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.530
things like double
5, double 9.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.690
I had such a hard time getting
those numbers the first time.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.850
And maybe I'm just particularly
slow.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.300
LYNNE MURPHY: The thing that
always trips me up is I don't

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.500
know whether to say triple
when I get three of those

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.245
things in a row.

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:23.460
So if I had a credit card that
had three 0's in a row, do I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.700
say triple 0?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.750
Do I say double 0, 0?

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.360
Do I say 0, double 0?

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.010
Do I say 0, 0, 0?

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.410
I don't know what to say.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.680
I'd love to hear from British
people, some instruction on

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.730
how to read my credit
card number.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.990
CGP GREY: Off the top of my
head, I can't think of having

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.020
ever heard triple, but I
wouldn't rule it out.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.210
I don't actually know.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.570
Perhaps your commenters
can let us

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.810
know if they say triple.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.980
LYNNE MURPHY: Another example
is what happens when you use

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.010
numbers in the thousands, or
numbers with four digits.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.320
The president's address--

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.980
that's called 1600

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.570
Pennsylvania Avenue in American.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.420
And I think most British people
would be comfortable

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.590
with that being sixteen
hundred.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.370
But when you get to a bigger
number, Americans are happy to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.760
say that is fifty-three
hundred.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.065
A British person would probably
call this five

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:10.520
thousand three hundred here.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.650
CGP GREY: Where I grew up on
downstate New York, pretty

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.370
much everybody around me would
say fifty-three hundred.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.510
Like for example, I know that
my parents will say

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.510
fifty-three hundred.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.870
But for me as a kid, I always
found that a confusing way to

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.800
phrase that.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.670
There's something about
it that just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.690
doesn't jell in my mind.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.160
And honestly, it took me years
and years to really get that.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.680
And so in my mind, when I hear
someone say something like

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.040
seventy-two hundred, I have to
kind of think about it in

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.590
terms of $100 bills.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.800
So again, if someone says
fifty-three hundred, I have to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.250
visualize 53 $100 bills
on a table.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.755
For me, I always consciously
made an effort to say five

00:02:55.755 --> 00:02:58.250
thousand three hundred instead
of fifty-three hundred.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.280
BRADY HARAN: Which do you
think is more elegant?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.360
Fifty-three hundred or five
thousand three hundred?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.470
LYNNE MURPHY: Well, five
thousand three hundred is

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.100
easier to understand.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.000
I mean, when I say fifty-three
hundred, I get confused myself

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.940
whether I mean 5,300
or 53,000.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.350
CGP GREY: Even though I think
that fifty-three hundred is

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.690
linguistically nicer--

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.290
it sort of rolls off the
tongue more easily--

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.812
but I like the precision
in saying five

00:03:21.812 --> 00:03:23.890
thousand three hundred.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.810
But I was definitely going
against the tide of people

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.700
that I lived around.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.720
LYNNE MURPHY: Nevertheless,
I find it easy to say.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.500
When I'm thinking of numbers,
when I want to say how much

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.840
something costs.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.145
CGP GREY: You deal with
$100 bills in America.

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:40.930
Like, it's not rare to come
across $100 bills.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.230
Whereas I don't think
there are--

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.500
now, I'm not 100% sure.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.900
But I don't think that there are
100-pound notes that are

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.920
actually produced.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.440
I think it stops at 50.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.090
And I have only incredibly
rarely in my life, ever seen

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.050
someone actually use
a 50-pound note.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.990
And it's always remarkable.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.080
Like at a bank, I'll see
someone pull out a 50.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.210
So maybe that's why as an
American, it's easier to think

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.430
in terms of amounts of
$100 bills, right?

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.240
I have 12 $100 bills.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.900
So that's twelve hundred.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.780
I don't know if that has
anything to do with it.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.149
But that might be why British
people are not as comfortable

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.240
with that kind of phrasing.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.161
LYNNE MURPHY: The second year of
the 2000s was two thousand

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.800
one, in American speech,
generally.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.665
But in British speech,
that sounds weird.

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.000
That sounds American.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.490
You'd say two thousand
and one.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.320
So two thousand one, two
thousand and one.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.210
CGP GREY: This is one of those
cases where, having lived in

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.470
London for 10 years, and in
particular, having taught in

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.440
front of classes and being
very used to speaking to

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.230
British people all the time, I
can sometimes kind of forget

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.430
these little phrases,
and which way have

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.160
I always said it.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.446
And just naturally thinking
about it, the two thousand and

00:04:50.446 --> 00:04:53.150
one or two thousand one--

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.780
which way would I have said
it when I was in New York?

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.150
I'm not 100% sure.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.470
I think I would've said two
thousand one, but it's one of

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.010
those things that gets kind of
lost when you move from one

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.810
country to another.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.255
Sometimes those little things
can just kind of--

00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:10.830
you just become uncertain
about how it was.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.630
And then you feel like a
crazy person, right?

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.920
You feel like, I should know how
I used to say things, but

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.070
you just lose it.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.112
But I did look up, after you
mentioned that the two

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:20.720
thousand and one--

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.290
I wanted to see how
Arthur C. Clarke

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.720
actually says that number.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.980
ARTHUR C. CLARKE: Of course,
"Two Thousand and One"--

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.450
CGP GREY: He's British, and he
says in interviews-- he says

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.940
"Two Thousand and One" as the
title for his book is the way

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.040
he always phrased it.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.520
I tried to find some audio of
Stanley Kubrick saying the

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.330
title of the movie.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.400
But he's an incredibly secretive
kind of guy and

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.100
didn't do very many interviews
about it.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.860
And so I was unable to find any
clip of Stanley Kubrick

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.110
actually speaking aloud the
name of perhaps his most

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.190
famous movie.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.070
LYNNE MURPHY: If you want to
count out seconds, which

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.180
people sometimes need to do, a
typical way of doing this is

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.680
to have a word that you put in
between your numbers to make

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.290
it long enough that you've
got a full second

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.500
between the two numbers.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.150
And the typical way to do this
in American English, or a

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.810
typical way to do it is to
use the word Mississippi.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.860
So 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi,
3 Mississippi.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.390
CGP GREY: 4 Mississippi, 5
Mississippi, 6 Mississippi.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.870
LYNNE MURPHY: Hopefully,
it's about a second.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.630
I've never actually tested it.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.720
CGP GREY: I have no idea where
it comes from, except that

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.530
it's a fun word to say.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.240
And it's long, so that seems
like an obvious choice to go

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.780
in the middle.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.060
LYNNE MURPHY: Another way to do
it is 1, one thousand, 2,

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.430
one thousand, which you'll
notice has a different number

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.770
of syllables.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.090
The 1, one thousand, 2, one
thousand I think is found in

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.560
both America and Britain.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.070
But then in Britain, you've
got other ones, like 1

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.760
Piccadilly, 2 Piccadilly, 3
Piccadilly, or 1 elephant, 2

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.470
elephant, 3 elephant.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.280
CGP GREY: I was trying to think
about this, and I don't

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.640
think I've ever had the
opportunity to hear any of my

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.385
students count in this kind of
way that you would do, where

00:07:01.385 --> 00:07:02.600
you're intentionally
doing seconds.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.310
So I don't know what any of
them would have said.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.750
But you asking me about this
is basically the first time

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.930
I've ever heard about Piccadilly
or elephant.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.030
LYNNE MURPHY: When I said 1
Mississippi, 2 Mississippi,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.960
that's how I learned it, with
that very specific, sing-song

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.870
kind of rhythm to help you
count out the seconds.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.090
And because I've only done this
on the blog, I've not

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.900
actually heard people say 1
Piccadilly, 2 Piccadilly.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.460
I'm not quite sure how
they're singing it.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.610
CGP GREY: Piccadilly
I think is OK.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.370
It has that same kind of rhythm
as Mississippi, right?

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.050
So 1 Mississippi, 2 Piccadilly,
3 elephant.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.330
Elephant does not work.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.510
I don't think that
works at all.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.675
1 elephant, 2 elephant--

00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:45.770
it's so clunky.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.720
It's no good at all.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.200
I have to veto that one, but
Piccadilly, Piccadilly seems

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.720
incredibly similar
to Mississippi.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.640
So I'm perfectly happy with
that as a difference.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.060
LYNNE MURPHY: But it's also the
kind of thing that I've

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.790
found people have family
versions of that aren't used

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.870
anywhere outside their
extended families.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.890
There's room for lots
of variation.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.810
BRADY HARAN: We want to hear
what word you put in between

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.420
numbers when you count,
to make sure

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.350
there's a second spacing.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.570
So put comments under
the video.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.220
Mississippi, elephant,
Piccadilly, thousand,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.420
something different?

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.210
We want to know.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.590
LYNNE MURPHY: People often ask
me, or express astonishment

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.840
when they get American addresses
that they need to

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.660
send something to.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.390
And the address might be four
or five digits long, the

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.820
number before the street.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:35.370
So to live at 2787
Main Street, or

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.309
something like that.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.710
Whereas the last place I lived
here was number 7, and my

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.630
mother always found
that strange.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.240
She often wrote it as 70.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.770
She just couldn't imagine that I
really lived at a place that

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.570
was only number 7 in the
great scheme of things.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.080
CGP GREY: It's funny, because I
never really tuned into the

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.710
low house numbers thing.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.930
I mean, now that you have
mentioned it, it seems

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.750
incredibly obvious.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.940
And yes, I can think of a bunch
of addresses in my life

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.070
here that were low numbers.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.300
And it's definitely the case--
well, at least it's the case

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.600
in New York growing up that I
don't think there was ever a

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.460
house number that was
less than 100.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:18.740
So I knew people who lived in
100, or 107, or 109 houses,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.960
but I don't think there was ever
a single address that was

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.280
below that number.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.090
LYNNE MURPHY: Where I'm from,
you never have a single digit.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.940
You rarely have a two-digit
street address.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:37.330
So my family is on the first
block of Miller Street, and

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.100
the first number is 100.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.110
Well, it's about the grid
road system in America.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.210
In England, you don't talk about
blocks the same way you

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.980
do in America, because
the roads are all

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.310
higgledy-piggledy and don't
necessarily make nice squares.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.540
But since American ones
typically do make nice

00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.050
squares, what you want in the
system is to have the numbers

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.640
all match within each block.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.780
You talk about the 100 block
of Miller Street.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.705
Once you cross the road that
intersects with Miller Street

00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:14.110
and go on to the next block,
it'll be the 200 block.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:20.250
So my block of my street where
I grew up goes up to 131.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.770
And then it starts over at 200
once you cross the road.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.750
BRADY HARAN: So your numbers
get higher quicker.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.160
LYNNE MURPHY: Yeah.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.300
CGP GREY: It is almost
unbelievable to me that the

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.070
numbers on one side of the
street don't have anything to

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.790
do with the numbers on the
other side of the street.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.850
And I still come across this,
and it's just appalling--

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.180
right?

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.990
That you're walking across the
street, and the numbers on one

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.070
side are going 3, 5, 7, 9.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.730
And you look across the other
side of the street, and the

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.740
numbers will be 50,
48, 46, right?

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.240
They're even, they're not
aligned, and they're going in

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.460
the opposite direction and
it's just maddening.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.280
I don't understand how this came
to be, why anybody has

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.240
let it stand for as
long as it has.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.490
It is just baffling to me.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.740
And the first few times that I
ran across this, that I didn't

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.880
realize, like, you have to check
the numbers on the other

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.090
side of the street, I got
severely lost in London a

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.640
couple of times, trying
to find places.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.370
Because I'm walking down very
long streets in the completely

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.980
opposite direction, thinking,
oh, I'll just cross the street

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.360
when I need those even
numbers, right?

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.840
And then you get to wherever
you're supposed to be, you

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.610
cross the street.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.750
And you're hundreds off from
wherever you were actually

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.290
trying to get.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.350
But you're still on
the same street.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.160
It's just unbelievable to me.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.320
It's like, I refuse to believe
that humans ever decided to do

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.980
this on purpose.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.850
This isn't exactly number
related, but I can tell you

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.760
the thing that I did notice,
that I find is just charming,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:58.610
is the habit of naming buildings
"houses." So even

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.600
like, a giant office building
will sometimes have a name.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.860
And it'll be like,
70 Darwin House.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.170
But this house suffix, or this
house label for, like, big

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:14.770
corporate buildings, or just
council flats, I find is kind

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.180
of remarkable and very charming
in and of itself.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.900
That strikes me as being very
British, where someone could

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.680
say, oh, I live at
50 Feinman House.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.070
But 50 Feinman House is a
gigantic tower block, right?

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.130
It's not like a little cottage,
like it sounds.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.390
So I do quite like that.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.600
I love to explore the city and
just kind of wander around.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.690
And there's always a ton of
construction going on.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.130
And in particular, in the past
few years and right now,

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.500
there's a bunch of big, luxury
buildings going up, or that

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.720
have been recently
constructed.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.780
And I can't help but notice that
all of them want to be

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.550
number one at whatever
they are.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.055
So for example, there's 1 London
Bridge, and there's 1

00:12:59.055 --> 00:13:02.290
Blackfriar's, there's
1 Tower Bridge.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.660
And these are luxury
buildings.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.660
And they always write it
really big on the sign.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.950
It'll say 1 Blackfriar's.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.700
And the other thing that I can't
help but notice is they

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.230
always like to write
out the one.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.990
It's O-N-E. It's never
the number 1.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.090
I find that interesting.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.520
I assume that somewhere, some
architecture firm decided that

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.780
this is a kind of luxury
statement.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.860
I'd be curious to know
if this happens

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.770
elsewhere in the world.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.380
Because as we discussed, I don't
think that it can happen

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.340
in New York, because
the buildings

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.410
can't start at 1, right?

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.500
They have to start at 100.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.590
But I've noticed that some of
these buildings that label

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.560
themselves as 1 whatever--

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.570
they're in suspicious spots.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.040
Where I look around and I think,
I'm not sure that you

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.210
can really claim that you
are 1 Tower Bridge.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.810
There are numerous buildings
here, any of which looks like

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.750
they could be number
1 Tower Bridge.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.770
So I have my doubts
about the accuracy

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:02.650
of this number system.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.660
Although with the street
numbers, who knows, right?

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.860
The numbers don't have anything
to do with anything,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.660
so they could just be
all over the place.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.890
-So a man walks into a bar.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.940
He asks for 10 times more drinks
than everyone else.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.870
The barman says, now that is
an order of magnitude.
