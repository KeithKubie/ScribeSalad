JOHN: Good morning,
and welcome to Talks

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.520
at Google in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.105
Today, it is my great pleasure
to introduce Marc Abrahams.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960
It's not every day
that we get to welcome

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.120
the man "The Washington
Post" has called the nation's

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.700
guru of academic grunge,
who's also a manga hero,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.630
but here we are.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.210
Mark's CV is far too
long to list here,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.250
but we know and love him
as Co-founder and Editor

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.020
of "The Annals of Improbable
Research and the author

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.280
of "This is Improbable"
and the book,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.910
which we're
expecting imminently,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.300
"This is Improbable Too."

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.130
Not to mention Co-author of "The
Ig Nobel Cookbook, Volume One,"

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.003
which frankly sounds terrifying.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.300
And of course, he's
the Founder and MC

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.175
of the Ignoble Prize Ceremony.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.650
Little known fact, he's married
to psychologist Robin Abrahams,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.200
who writes the "Miss
Conduct" advice

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.850
column in the Sunday
"Boston Globe" magazine.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.195
I love that column.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.510
Maybe you do, too.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.040
If any of you has
a friend who has

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.850
a personal problem
or a social issue,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.280
I'm told that Robin
would welcome your input.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.670
All the questions that come
to the column are from readers

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.380
and she's always
looking for those.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.570
So without further
ado, please join me

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.757
in welcoming Marc Abrahams.

00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:34.691
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:36.092
MARC ABRAHAMS: Thank you, John.

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:38.880
Thanks very much, John.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.740
My name is Marc Abrahams.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.980
I am editor of this magazine.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.210
It's Called "The Annals
of Improbable Research."

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.310
Some of you are very
familiar with it.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.430
Some of you probably
have never heard of it

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.200
and are even on
the verge of being

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.760
offended at what it might be.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.280
I'll distribute a couple copies
in our most traditional manner

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.780
here.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.050
I've got a couple more later
on if anybody would like some.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.870
I collect things.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.850
I collect research.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.630
And I define that in the
broadest possible way.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.540
I collect research that makes
people laugh, and then think.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.780
These are real things
that are documented

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.650
that when you first
encounter them are funny.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.230
There's something about
them that just is funny.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.170
But also, there's
something about them

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.150
that a week later you find
it's still rattling around

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.300
in your head, the
kind of thing that you

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.150
want to tell your friends
about and argue about.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.710
So if it has both qualities,
it makes people laugh

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.240
and then think, I want
to get a hold of it,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.210
put it in our magazine.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.870
I also write a
newspaper column in one

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.230
of the British newspapers
with similar things.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.290
And I write other places.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.360
And then, every
year we give prizes.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.320
And that's mostly what I'm
going to show you about here.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.660
This research, I
hope you will agree,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.300
deserves to get
some kind of prize.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.160
Let me show you another.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.610
This is a piece of a patent that
was granted in 1965 to George

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.820
and Charlotte Blonsky.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.770
The Blonskys were
a married couple.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.420
They lived in New
York City at the time.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.880
They invented what they call
a device to assist women

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.950
in giving birth.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.470
This is what it looks like.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.860
It's a large, round table with
some machinery underneath.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.570
When the woman is ready
to deliver her child,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.450
she lies on her
back on the table.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.690
They strap her down
to the table and then

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.680
the table is rotated
at high speed

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.570
and the child comes flying
out through centrifugal force.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.430
If you look closely at
this engineering diagram,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.519
you may decide that there is
at least one suboptimal thing

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.730
in the design.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.400
I would point you especially
toward the part of it that's

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.500
designed to catch the
child when it emerges.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.430
You may feel that
that's not quite

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.342
adequate to the task,
what they've got there.

00:04:30.342 --> 00:04:32.680
And I'll show you
a third thing here.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.091
This is a biology paper.

00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:36.465
It was published in a biology
journal in the Netherlands.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.280
And it is the first
scientifically documented case

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.986
of homosexual necrophilia
in the mallard duck.

00:04:49.662 --> 00:04:52.930
This won an Ig Nobel
Prize for this.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.012
This was completely
unknown to ornithologists

00:04:57.012 --> 00:04:57.720
when it happened.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.510
Each of those things I just
told you a little bit about

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.585
has been awarded
an Ig Nobel Prize.

00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:08.960
And the prizes have that same
criterion that I described.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.880
If we've chosen well on
these things, each of them

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.680
makes people laugh
and then think.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.560
We have been doing this
every year since 1991.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.840
We just had the 24th First
Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.820
two weeks ago.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.820
You work with at
least one person

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.160
who is vital to our-- let's
call it an enterprise.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.836
Quentin Smith, who I
think some of you know,

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:40.080
has been our broadcast engineer
on the webcast for the past six

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.230
or seven years.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.000
When he began, he was
an undergrad at MIT.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.330
And we've been webcasting
that ceremony since 1995.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.540
We were, I'm pretty sure, one
of the very first things ever

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.260
to webcast anything.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.440
Robert T. Morris, who some
of you know that name,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.920
was our first
broadcast engineer.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.620
He was also I believe
the first person

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.480
convicted on federal charges
of doing something that

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.575
caused the entire
internet to collapse.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.650
It was not something
he was trying to do.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.660
He's a very nice guy.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.385
We have a nice history of good
and interesting engineers.

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:22.570
I'll tell you a little
about the Ig Nobel Prizes.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.860
First of all, this
word "hiccups."

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.170
You may see it repeated here.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.510
I hope you do.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.715
Otherwise, you have maybe some
kind of problem not related

00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:34.560
to hiccups.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.750
But hiccups, hiccups, hiccups.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.180
There is form of hiccups
that lasts a long time.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.560
Not just for a few
minutes or a few hours,

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.020
but it goes on for
days, weeks, and months.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.300
It's rare, but it does happen.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.020
The medical profession calls
it intractable hiccups.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.110
They have names-- nice official
names for pretty much anything

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.860
you can imagine
and lots of things

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.430
you probably couldn't imagine.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.725
Doctors have never known how
to treat intractable hiccups.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.650
They've tried lots of things.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.770
Finally, a few years
ago, somebody-- a doctor

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.840
in Tennessee came
up with what seems

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.710
to be a reliable cure
for intractable hiccups.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.830
He tried it and he
published a medical report.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.450
Here it is.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.590
He calls it "Termination
of Intractable Hiccups

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:34.060
with Digital Rectal Massage."

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.850
Are there any questions about
any of the technical terms

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:39.850
that I'm using here?

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.770
Francis Fesmire is the
doctor who did this.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.210
We awarded him an Ig Nobel
Prize in Medicine for this.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.150
Here he is giving
his acceptance speech

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.750
at the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.580
Since that time,
other doctors have

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.630
seen his report,
other doctors who

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:05.580
had similar patients that
they were trying to treat.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.980
And they have tried his
method and so far every case

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.060
we've heard about-- a
small number of cases,

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.060
but every one we've heard about,
the method has worked reliably.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:19.290
I have some unhappy, some
very sad news to report.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.480
Dr. Fesmire died a few
months ago unexpectedly.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.910
He worked at a large
medical center in Tennessee.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.050
And we've seen the
obituaries, and his colleagues

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.230
are very sad.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.471
He was, obviously, a
beloved, in many ways, man.

00:08:34.471 --> 00:08:35.929
I'd gotten to know
him fairly well.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.799
He liked to come back every few
years to the Ig Nobel Ceremony

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.159
and do what you see here.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.700
And he told me that
one of his dreams

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.610
was that someday he would be
able to travel around with me,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.130
especially when I go
to Europe and do events

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.680
with some of the Ig
Nobel Prize Winners,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.140
that he would come
along and he'd

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.840
be able to explain his
technique to people

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.015
around the world as part
of an Ig Nobel event.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.570
But he died and that's
never going to happen.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.140
So I would like to
ask a little favor,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.800
even though you don't know
me and I don't know you.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.960
Would you please join me just
for a moment in a small tribute

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.180
to Dr. Fesmire?

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.900
Could you raise a finger
in honor of Dr. Fesmire?

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.890
Thank you.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.390
Thank you.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:22.830
All right.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.100
So this again is the
criterion for things.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.280
And it's just this.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.460
It's got to be real and it's
got to make people laugh.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.150
People anywhere.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.070
People who aren't
familiar with it at all.

00:09:36.065 --> 00:09:37.690
If it's going to win
an Ig Nobel Prize,

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.860
make people laugh
and then think.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.690
We get something like 9,000
new nominations every year.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.130
And we-- and we is
a lot of us, mostly

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.810
volunteers-- are always
looking for things, too.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.330
But we get floods of things.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.310
Little floods
coming in every day.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.440
And we give just
10 prizes a year.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.180
And they're not necessarily
restricted to recent things.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.080
We can, by our own
rules, go back up

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.390
to about 50 years or so.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.140
As long as there's somebody
still alive who knew the person

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.790
and could come and
talk about that, then

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.740
it's OK to give that a prize.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.710
The oldest we've ever given,
or the farthest back we went

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.810
was about 15 years ago.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.050
We gave a prize to
the three people

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.875
who were responsible
for naming Murphy's law.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.660
You know Murphy's law, that
great engineering principle

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.990
that if something can
go wrong, it will.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.750
And that was born in an
engineering project that

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.210
happened at Edwards
Air Force Base, which

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.220
had a slightly different
name back in the late 1940s.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.750
An incident that happened there.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.990
And it involved Captain
Murphy of the US Army Air

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.060
Corps, whose name ended
up in Murphy's law,

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.610
and several other people.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.850
Murphy's son came
to our ceremony.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.620
One of the co-winners
was the leader

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.560
of the project which led to the
birth of the name Murphy's law.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.040
And it's somebody
who hated Murphy.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.050
And it's somebody who devoted
the rest of his life trying

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.850
to convince the world
that Murphy gets

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.010
too much credit
for Murphy's law.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.930
If you win an Ig Nobel
Prize-- first of all,

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.550
before I explain
this, in most cases

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:28.460
we will get in touch
quietly and offer the prize.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.580
And if somebody declines the
honor, if somebody says no,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.540
that's fine.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.890
And that's the end of it
and we never tell anybody.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.260
Happily for us, almost everybody
who's offered an Ig Nobel Prize

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.810
decides to accept.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:43.825
And here's what they.

00:11:43.825 --> 00:11:45.362
They get an Ig Nobel Prize.

00:11:45.362 --> 00:11:46.820
That's what you're
looking at here.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.920
It's a different
design every year.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.000
They're always made of
extremely cheap materials.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.680
This is from last year, 2013.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.780
And the design that year was
a frame with a glass front.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.190
And under the glass, there
was a hammer and an indication

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.130
there-- a statement,
"In case of emergency,

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.790
use hammer to break glass."

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.300
So you get that.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.080
You also get a
piece of paper that

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.240
says you've won
an Ig Nobel Prize.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.750
And the piece of paper is
signed by several people

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.560
who have Nobel Prizes.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.530
So it's a nice piece of paper.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.220
And there is a tradition that
a lot of the winners follow.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.730
And they seem to keep inventing
it independently, too.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.340
They'll take this piece
of paper home with them

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.710
to whatever country they'd come
from to come to the ceremony

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.390
and put it in a
nice frame and then

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.310
hang it in their home
right above the toilet.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.340
We don't have any money, so
we can't offer cash, alas,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.580
to the winners.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.210
Just because we don't
have cash to offer.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.111
But we did finally figure
out a way, even on that,

00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.735
that we could overcome
that limitation.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:07.075
This past year each of the
winners received $10 trillion.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.920
Each of the winners,
each of the winning teams

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.765
received a $10 trillion
bill from Zimbabwe.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.820
You may remember Zimbabwe
had a little incident lasted

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.445
about a year and a
half with inflation.

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:21.180
And they were--
by the end of it,

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.210
they were printing bills with
a face value of $100 million.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.880
The government
official in Zimbabwe

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.855
responsible for doing that
was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.360
He, at the same time,
was having a government

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.880
print some bills that had a
face value of $100 trillion

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.520
and other bills that
had a face value $0.01.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.910
And he published
a book to explain

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.540
to the public in Zimbabwe
and the rest of the world

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.590
why he was doing this.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.550
And he said that when you're
spending these large amounts

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.400
of money, you still
have to make change.

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:06.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.254
If you win and decide
to accept the prize,

00:14:09.254 --> 00:14:10.670
you are also-- the
other thing you

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.940
get is an invitation to join us
at the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.750
This happens in the
building you're seeing.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.510
That's Sanders Theatre, which
is about two miles down the road

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.120
here at Harvard.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.240
It's the oldest and biggest
meeting place at Harvard.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.620
It fits 1,100 people.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.950
It's always completely
jammed up on Ig Nobel night.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.030
The tickets sell
out very quickly.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.239
And as I mentioned before,
we webcast it live.

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.780
Have been doing that
for a long time.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.660
And you can see videos of
many of the past ceremonies

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.400
on our website, improbable.com.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.320
The very best thing about that
is you get to see these people.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.660
And you get to see the
heart of the matter, too.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.080
The winners are kept very
secret until we introduce them

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.790
on stage.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.940
They come, many of them
from quite literally

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.860
around the world.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.545
And at their own expense.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.880
We defray it with the
$10 trillion bill,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.370
but that's all we can do.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.490
And when we introduce
each of them,

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.900
they step out through
a curtain and waiting

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.450
to greet them is a
Nobel laureate who

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.480
will shake their hand and hand
them their Ig Nobel Prize.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.420
And one of my colleagues is
with me today, one of the people

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.720
who helps all of that work
on stage, Eliza Kosoy.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.169
Eliza, if you wouldn't mind
standing and taking a bow.

00:15:26.169 --> 00:15:27.210
ELIZA KOSOY: I'll curtsy.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.210
MARC ABRAHAMS: A curtsy.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:28.990
A bow, whatever.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.390
So Eliza is one of
the people who's

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.200
in charge of making
sure that the winners

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.521
and the famous scientists
and all don't panic on stage.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.520
That they have every
reason to feel comfortable,

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.040
and in good hands, and
that they have a good time.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.160
And will go where
they're supposed

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.225
to go without having
to worry about that.

00:15:47.225 --> 00:15:48.940
And it usually
works out just fine.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.520
This year's prizes
were two weeks ago.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.060
I haven't had too
much chance to do

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.617
a proper gathering of
materials from that.

00:16:00.617 --> 00:16:03.200
So what I'm going to show you
is a little bit of what happened

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.380
there, and then I'll show
you a little more detail

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.436
about the prizes we
gave out last year.

00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:10.560
This is a little piece of
video from two weeks ago,

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.760
from the ceremony.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.050
This will show you one
of the winners finishing

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.230
his acceptance speech.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.240
And it will also
show you the method

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.540
that we invented to ensure that
speeches are kept fairly brief.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.780
This winner is from
the Czech Republic.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.250
He and his colleagues shared
a prize, an Ig Nobel Prize,

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.920
with another team that's
based in the US and India.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.570
And the two of them
each were awarded

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:44.380
because they were
gathering evidence

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.200
to answer the question,
is it mentally hazardous

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.485
to own a cat?

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.730
Here is Jaroslav Flagr.

00:16:55.288 --> 00:16:56.720
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.790

general and scientific public

-Please stop.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.510
I'm getting bored.

Please stop.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.350
I'm bored.

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:12.754
-Therefore.

00:17:12.754 --> 00:17:14.158
-Please stop.

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:15.670
I'm bored.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.104
-My really important discovery--

00:17:17.104 --> 00:17:18.450
-Please stop.

-The theory of frozen evolution.

00:17:20.328 --> 00:17:22.634
Therefore, thank you.

00:17:22.634 --> 00:17:23.622
-Please stop.

00:17:23.622 --> 00:17:25.294

-[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:28.652

-I'm bored.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.876
Please stop.

00:17:31.876 --> 00:17:32.854
I'm bored.

00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:34.810
-Very, very much.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.277
-Please stop.

00:17:36.277 --> 00:17:38.233
I'm bored.

[END VIDEO  PLAYBACK]

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.990
MARC ABRAHAMS: We came up
with that device 13 years ago.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:49.840
And the first year we did that,
the entire Ig Nobel Ceremony

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.956
was one hour shorter than
it had been the year before.

00:17:55.354 --> 00:17:58.300
And every year, we
have kept pretty

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.290
close to finishing on time.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.660
Mostly, thanks to that device.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.910
Here's a quick
look at the winners

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.340
that we gave out last year.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:17.070
The Medicine Prize was awarded
to a team from Japan, China,

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.610
and the US for assessing
the effects of listening

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:28.706
to opera on heart transplant
patients who are mice.

00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:30.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.140
They describe their work in this
paper, "Auditory Stimulation

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.140
of Opera Music Induced
Prolongation--."

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.640
All of the things
I'm showing you,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.470
you can easily obtain copies.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.600
Or if you can't, email me
and I'll send you a copy.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.850
On our website on
improbable.com,

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.319
there's one page that
lists all of the winners,

00:18:50.319 --> 00:18:52.110
going back to the very
beginning with links

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.080
to most of their
work and all that.

00:18:55.957 --> 00:18:57.540
It's usually worth
looking at the work

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.930
because we're just giving you
a little, little, tiny summary.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.010
Often, the details
are far better.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.620
And most of these people have
done a lot of other things.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.600
And most of them
who are still alive

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.750
are still working on things.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.860
And you know from your own
experience with your colleagues

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.090
and-- most of you, quite
probably, with yourself.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.180
People can be very clever
and they don't always

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.810
trumpet the news of the best and
worst things that they've done.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.900
So follow some
links if you like.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.480
Here is that team.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.890
They flew in from Japan.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.400
We were not exactly
aware that they

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.285
planned to show up
wearing mouse costumes.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.740
And we were not at
all aware that they

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.035
planed to then sing their
speech in the form of an opera.

00:19:46.274 --> 00:19:49.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.720
The Ig Nobel Prize for
Psychology went to a large team

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.755
from France, the US, the UK,
the Netherlands, and Poland.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.130
They confirmed by
experiment that people

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:08.355
who think they are drunk also
think they are attractive.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.260
This is their paper.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.420
The title, "Beauty is in the Eye
of the Beer Holder-- People Who

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.550
Think They are Drunk also
Think They are Attractive."

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.180
This experiment
was done in France.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.020
So it's not firmly known that
this effect happens outside

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.100
of France, but they
believe it does.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.900
And here is that
team at the moment

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.360
that they were
awarded the prize.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.400
And it's being handed
to them right here.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.560
And then, they, too,
showed up planning

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.517
to sing their acceptance
speech, which they did.

00:20:42.517 --> 00:20:44.100
You can see-- this
in the Miss Sweetie

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.600
Poo, that's what
we call our device.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.090
She's a charming
eight-year-old child

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.465
who happens to have
ice water in her veins.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.250
We choose very carefully.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.920
And we need-- since
they tend to grow up,

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.670
we need to get a new Miss
Sweetie Poo every year or two.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.450
This is Miss Sweetie
Poo from last year.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.575
We gave a prize in the
field of Safety Engineering.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.280
It went to Gustano Pizzo,
the late Gustano Pizzo,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.850
who lived in New York City.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.080
He won for inventing--
in about 1972 he invented

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.130
an electromechanical system
to trap airplane hijackers.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.530
Mr. Pizzo's system worked
by dropping a hijacker

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.330
through trapped doors
inside the plane.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.740
And then there
was some machinery

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.793
that would seal the
hijacker up into a package.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.980
That package would then
drop through the airplane's

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.090
specially-installed
bomb bay doors

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.980
and would be
parachuted to earth,

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.680
where police, who
were alerted by radio,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.420
would await the arrival of this
packaged hijacker by parachute.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.635
This is the patent
that Mr. Pizzo has.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.570
And you can see more of
his device and his thinking

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:03.980
if you look up the patent.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.100
As far as we know,
this was never

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.020
adopted by any of
the major airlines.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.710
At least partially because
it's very expensive

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.820
to refit an airplane to have
all these bomb bay doors,

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:20.210
and hijacker encapsulation
devices, and trap doors,

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.430
and other things.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.930
The Ig Nobel Prize for
Physics was awarded to a team

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.030
from Italy, Russia, and
several other countries.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.670
The work was mostly
done in Italy.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.890
They discovered that
some people would

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:42.810
be physically capable of running
across the surface of a pond

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.650
if those people and that
pond were on the moon.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.130
Here's their paper about
it called "Humans Running

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.225
in Place on Water at
Simulated Reduced Gravity."

00:22:56.225 --> 00:22:59.410
It was published in "PLOS
ONE," a very good journal.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.510
Many of the things that
have won Ig Nobel Prizes

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.009
have been published
in top journals.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.790
Many have been published
in bottom journals

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.540
and many not published at all.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.020
By the way, it's
not just science.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:15.000
We can give and do give Ig Nobel
Prizes in pretty much anything.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.240
Most years we give
out a Peace Prize.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.650
We a couple times have
given out an Art Prize.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.030
The first time we gave out
an Ig Nobel Prize in Art,

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.690
it went to a man named
Don Featherstone.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.180
He's the creator of the
plastic pink flamingo.

00:23:30.499 --> 00:23:32.290
And if you'd come to
the Ig Nobel Ceremony,

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:33.248
you could have met him.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:38.330
This is some of the work done
about-- what they were trying

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:42.510
to figure out was if
you were to somehow make

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.390
the force of gravity
weaker on earth,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.400
how much weaker
would it have to be

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.710
before an ordinary
person could walk

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.804
across the surface of water?

00:23:51.804 --> 00:23:53.470
There are some animals
that can do that.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.390
There are a few lizards
and some insects that

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.960
are able to walk across the
surface of water, but not many.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.590
And as it worked out in
the calculations and then

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.970
when they did some
experiments, it

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.240
turned out that the
surface of the moon

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.150
just happens to be
right at the level

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.230
where if there were water there,
and you can walk and breathe

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.340
and all, you could walk
across that surface.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.490
Here's a little
video they gave us

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.593
of how they did that research.

00:24:22.593 --> 00:24:27.369
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:27.369 --> 00:24:31.201
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:36.825
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:36.825 --> 00:24:38.324
MARC ABRAHAMS: Being
here at Google,

00:24:38.324 --> 00:24:41.290
I imagine you have dozens of
labs filled with people doing

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:45.290
things like this spread across
a hundred different countries.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.860
But maybe that's just my desire.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.450
And here is part
of the team flew in

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.370
from Italy to accept the prize.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.320
And you can see them
here finishing up

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.712
their acceptance speech.

00:24:58.712 --> 00:25:00.545
We give a prize in the
field of Archaeology.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.650
Went to a team from
Canada and the US.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.925
They were awarded their prize
for parboiling a dead shrew.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.830
A shrew, you probably
know, is a small animal

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.350
about the size of a mouse.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.040
And it looks fairly
like a mouse.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.360
They parboiled a
dead shrew and then

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.280
swallowed that shrew
without chewing it.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.580
They were careful
not to chew it.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.230
And then they carefully
examined everything

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.450
excreted by the test
subject who ate that

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.590
during the next several days.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.000
They did this so they could
see which bones would dissolve

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.910
inside the human
digestive system

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.380
and which bones would not.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.080
They published a paper on it.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.210
The paper's called
"Human Digestive Effects

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.680
on a Micromammalian Skeleton."

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.668
It's got details and
photographs of the work.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.750
And they got a big surprise.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.900
They had expected that the
smallest bones, many of them

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.340
would be dissolved.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.150
Some of the medium-sized
bones might suffer some damage

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.030
from the digestive juices.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.780
And that the big bones
would be largely intact.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.490
That's not what happened.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.460
What happened was
even the biggest bones

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.290
were substantially dissolved.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.830
And they were kind of
shocked to see this.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.175
This was completely against
anybody's expectation.

00:26:27.217 --> 00:26:29.050
They don't discuss it
too much in the paper,

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.970
but this also could be
a very shocking thing

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.660
to an awful lot
of people who are

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.285
archaeologists because there
are an awful lot of papers that

00:26:37.285 --> 00:26:41.570
have been published for decades
interpreting collections

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:42.580
of bones.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.740
Typically, of some small
animal and some large animal

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.820
in the same place,
where it seems evident

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.340
that the large animal
ate the small animal.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.810
And an awful lot
of the explanation

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.470
that the archaeologists
came up with

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.280
had to do with because there
are only these bones left

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.840
and these ones are damaged,
the large animal must

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.770
have had massive jaws and
a certain kind of teeth.

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.140
This paper says that
is not necessarily so.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.227
So it might be
kind of interesting

00:27:13.227 --> 00:27:14.810
over the next few
years to see if this

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.559
gets noticed in the
archaeology community.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.510
This is the winner at the
moment he was introduced.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.630
And you can see Eliza
Kosoy there helping

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.892
to shepherd him through
the sacred curtain.

00:27:24.892 --> 00:27:26.350
And if you'd like
to shake her hand

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.410
and try to bribe her later,
I'm sure Eliza wouldn't

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.440
mind shaking your hand
and trying to be bribed.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.530
For the next one--
the next prize

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.470
that I'm going to describe,
if you are tempted

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:42.740
to for any reason, to applaud
this achievement, please

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.360
do not.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.780
Please just hold your
applause on this one

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.900
no matter how much you
approve, or whatever,

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.830
of what this person did.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.420
The Ig Nobel Peace
Prize was awarded

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.657
to Alexander Lukashenko,
the President

00:27:57.657 --> 00:27:58.740
of the country of Belarus.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.540
He won the Ig Nobel
Peace Prize for making

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.325
it illegal to applaud in public.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:12.430
He shared the Peace Prize
with the Belarus State Police,

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.775
who were arrested a
one-armed man for applauding.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:22.040
Here are some of President
Lukashenko's press clippings

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.010
from around the world.

00:28:25.577 --> 00:28:27.410
We gave a prize in the
field of Probability.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.350
That Ig Nobel Prize
was awarded to a team

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.420
from the UK, the
Netherlands, and Canada.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.410
They're based in
Edinburgh in Scotland.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.560
They won for making two
related discoveries.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:47.310
First, that the longer a
cow has been lying down,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.790
the more likely that
cow will soon stand up.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:56.570
And second, that
once a cow stands up,

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.236
you cannot easily predict how
soon the cow will lie down

00:28:59.236 --> 00:28:59.735
again.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.640
They published a paper called
"Are Cows More Likely to Lie

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.256
Down the Longer They Stand?"

00:29:09.256 --> 00:29:11.860
They sent us this
photo of the research.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.710
And this is Bert Tolkamp,
one of the researchers

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.310
who flew from
Edinburgh to Cambridge

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.470
here to hastily finish
up his acceptance speech

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.220
as you can see.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.690
And the Ig Nobel Prize
for Public Health

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.760
was awarded to a large team
of doctors in Thailand.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.850
They're all based
at the same hospital

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.090
in the city of
Bangkok, Thailand.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.930
They were honored for
the medical techniques

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.850
they described in a
report they published.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.760
Their report is called
"Surgical Management

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:50.586
of an Epidemic of Penile
Amputations in Siam."

00:29:50.586 --> 00:29:52.830
A "Surgical Management
of an Epidemic

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.410
of Penile Amputations in Siam."

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.220
They were honored for
those techniques which

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:05.230
they recommend, except in cases
where the amputated penis has

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.550
been partially eaten by a duck.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.406
Here is the beginning of their
paper, which, as you can see,

00:30:15.406 --> 00:30:17.780
sure enough is called "Surgical
Management of an Epidemic

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.920
of Penile Amputations in Siam."

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.110
I would be happy to explain
the duck part if you like.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.650
And if you already
know, that's fine

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.810
and I won't waste your time.

00:30:30.665 --> 00:30:31.165
Anybody?

00:30:32.332 --> 00:30:33.364
AUDIENCE: Do tell.

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:34.405
MARC ABRAHAMS: All right.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.270
There's always one person
who somehow has not

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.340
heard the details.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.710
As they explain,
I think lovingly

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:48.480
in this paper for the benefit
of readers outside Thailand,

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.170
in Thailand many
people live in houses

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.720
that are built on stilts.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.720
And many of those houses--
underneath the house,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.835
the family keeps the farm
animals-- chickens, ducks,

00:31:03.835 --> 00:31:04.335
whatever.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:09.430
There was during the
1970s a true epidemic.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:14.390
Apparently the first one or
two were publicized heavily

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.200
in the newspapers
and this somehow led

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:21.070
to many other people doing
it of angry wives severing

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:22.030
their husband's penis.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.840
Usually, after the
husband had done

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:31.210
much provoking of some sort
the wife would sever the penis.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.445
And then sometimes,
throw it out the window.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.900
And occasionally,
the severed penis,

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.430
in its journey
outside the window,

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.510
would land down amidst
the farm animals, which

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.040
wasn't necessarily
a terrible problem

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.670
as far as the surgeons
were concerned.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:49.150
They were usually able
to reattach the pieces

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.770
and get everything working.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:55.390
Except, they said, in cases
where the piece of meat

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.900
had been chewed by a duck.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.120
So was that clear?

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.900
So that's a quick look at last
year's Ig Nobel Prize winners.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.100
And we're starting to prepare
for next year's, which

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:13.720
will be the 25th First Annual
Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.840
And I have collected a bunch
of things I've written.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.774
Much of these writings
stemming from the things

00:32:21.774 --> 00:32:23.190
that I did in the
newspaper column

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:27.380
in "The Guardian" in this
lovely and delightful book,

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.670
which has just come out, called
"This is Improbable Too."

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.200
And I had a previous collection
called "This is Improbable,"

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.760
thus the "Too."

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.950
It got some nice reviews.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.040
It came out in England
a few months ago

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.680
and it's come out here
in the US just now.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.690
And in England,
it got one review

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.600
that I especially am proud of.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.370
It was a very long review.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.770
And if you write a
book, you're always

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.540
grateful when you
get a long review

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.910
because there's not that
much space in newspapers.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:57.390
This was in the biggest
of the London newspapers,

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.370
"The Daily Mail,"
which you may know

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:04.170
has a peculiar attitude towards
scientists and technology

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.180
and many other things.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.190
But they gave it a long review.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.630
And what I'm proud of
is that they summed up

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.030
the book in the midst of
that review in this phrase.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.867
They said that this book
is almost dementedly

00:33:16.867 --> 00:33:17.533
inconsequential.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.080
So I hope you enjoy the
book and the other things

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.630
I'll be writing about.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.790
I've brought a couple other
issues of the magazine for you,

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:32.290
too.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.890
Should I distribute
them the same way?

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:36.190
OK.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.940
This direction and over here.

00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:46.230
Normally, we do distribute
them through the mail.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.580
Or also, in the form of ebooks.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.530
And I should mention we became
one of the first magazines

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:57.330
to publish also in the form
of ebooks, not just paper.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.840
And we did it with
some assistance

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.350
from you guys, which I
want to thank you for.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.130
Specifically, Dave [INAUDIBLE]
was very, very helpful.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.440
When we were trying to overcome
some of the limitations

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.190
that Amazon for some reason put
into ebooks, making it nearly

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:16.550
impossible to have nicely
formatted documents

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.429
in the form of ebooks that
could be sold by ebook vendors,

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.422
I was looking around
for several years

00:34:22.422 --> 00:34:23.880
trying to find
other publishers who

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.330
were trying to find a way
to solve that problem.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.185
And one of the few
people I found,

00:34:29.185 --> 00:34:30.892
and one of the
few groups I found

00:34:30.892 --> 00:34:32.600
that had been working
on the same problem

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.290
was here at Google, Dave
[INAUDIBLE] and his gang.

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.250
So they were tremendously
helpful to us

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.810
in coming up with this new way.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.409
And if you see
Dave in the halls,

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.510
please pass on my
hello and thanks.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:49.679
That's another picture of
another issue of the magazine.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.550
One issue every year
is a special issue

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:54.550
devoted to the Ig Nobel Winners.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.900
The opera mouse researchers
ended up on the cover.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.170
I want to finish with one
other little piece of video

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.487
from the ceremony
a couple weeks ago.

00:35:06.487 --> 00:35:08.070
And I'll introduce
it because it, too,

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.960
has a connection to you.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.180
You may recognize this
man, Ray Kurzweil.

00:35:14.945 --> 00:35:17.130
Ray's title is,
I think, Director

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.070
of Engineering,
something like that?

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.320
And I worked for Ray
a long time ago back

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.800
at Ray's first company,
Kurzweil Computer Products.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.170
I was a programmer.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.210
We were working on optical
character recognition

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.480
things and a machine that
read printed things allowed

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.350
for blind people and
other related stuff.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.790
But Ray has many
sides, as you may know.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:39.650
And one of them has
to do with nutrition.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:44.930
Ray, for decades, has been
working on ideas about people

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.990
stopping for the most part
eating what they're eating now

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.860
and having a diet
heavily based on hundreds

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.480
of carefully selected pills.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.580
And he believes and
has written extensively

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.715
that if you follow
the diet properly,

00:35:58.715 --> 00:36:01.950
you stand a good chance
of living for, perhaps,

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.090
many hundreds of years.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.330
Maybe even beyond that.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:10.950
So every year in our--
well, not so at that point.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.450
Every year in the Ig Nobel
Ceremony, the heart of it

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.360
is when we introduce
the 10 Ig Nobel Winners.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.891
But between those announcements,
we do other things.

00:36:19.891 --> 00:36:22.140
And one of the things we do,
the grandest thing we do,

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.010
is every year we
write a little opera

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:25.900
about something in science.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.730
We steal music from dead
composers-- Mozart this year--

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.200
and we write a story
and lyrics that

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.730
explain or don't
explain something going

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:39.150
on now in science
and technology.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:43.770
This year, it was about--
I took the idea of Ray,

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.620
or somebody, subsisting
on nothing but pills

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.830
and I twisted that
and extended it

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.960
way off into other directions.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.150
And I told Ray.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.590
Invited him to
the ceremony, too.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.280
Although, he didn't come.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.790
And what I'm going to
show you is the very end

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:02.320
of the opera, the last
minute or so of the opera.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.910
The plot, it's two people.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.440
It's two wealthy
entrepreneurs who

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.420
follow the idea--
the same one Ray did.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.130
They stop eating
regular food and they

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:17.270
decide to get all their
nourishment entirely

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.410
from hundreds and
hundreds of pills.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.240
And they are very greedy
people in this opera.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:24.560
This is very fictional people.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.920
They are very greedy people.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.860
And they end up buying all
the farmland in the world

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.610
because they want to ensure
that they're going to survive.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.040
They do.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.870
After 600 years,
they're still around,

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:36.220
but there are no other people.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.000
It's just them and
their microbes.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.960
And then something goes wrong.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.269
All of their pills have been
stored in their basement

00:37:43.269 --> 00:37:44.810
and they've neglected
their plumbing.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.240
And the plumbing broke and
flooded the basement and all

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.190
of their pills, all their
food supply is gone.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.830
And they have no skills about
raising food or making pills,

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.500
so they're doomed
and they know it.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.350
What you're going to see is the
last minute or so of the opera

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.152
when they know they're doomed.

00:38:00.152 --> 00:38:01.860
They're still desperately
trying to think

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.870
of some way to survive.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:06.980
And their microbes, who
you will see as a chorus

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.450
all around them, are
not at all unhappy

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:12.360
because their microbes are
probably going to survive.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.680
So you're going to see the
two people doomed, panicked,

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.040
and their microbes.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.660
A chorus of microbes, which
includes four people who

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:25.690
have Nobel Prizes, who
were kind enough to let us

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.940
stick them in the chorus,
all coming together

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.790
in this glorious
conclusion to the opera.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:35.160
The opera is called,
"What's Eating You."

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.160
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:03.354 --> 00:40:04.404
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:04.404 --> 00:40:05.320
MARC ABRAHAMS: Ta-dah.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.900
So if you happen
to run into Ray,

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:14.840
you might say hi and offer
him some lunch or something.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.250
That's everything I
brought to show you.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.820
I want to thank you
for inviting me.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.830
And if you have
any questions, I'd

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.520
be happy to try to answer them.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:29.850
So thanks.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:36.106
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:36.106 --> 00:40:39.339
AUDIENCE: What caused you
to decide to do all this?

00:40:39.339 --> 00:40:41.630
MARC ABRAHAMS: What caused
me to decide to do all this?

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.140
I was a peculiar little kid.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:50.437
And most of the pieces
of what I'm doing now I

00:40:50.437 --> 00:40:51.520
was doing as a little kid.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.850
I liked to read lots
of science stuff.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:57.420
And I liked to write what I
thought were funny things.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.590
And I also very early on
started reading newspapers.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:03.430
And I especially liked
the odd, little stories

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:06.415
that I would see tucked away
in the corners of pages.

00:41:06.415 --> 00:41:09.720
Because newspapers
have always had a--

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.430
Before the internet, where
space stopped mattering so much,

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.960
they always had the problem
that you have to fill the page.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.841
And if you got a corner, you
fill it with something short.

00:41:17.841 --> 00:41:19.340
And if you had a
taste for that, you

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.860
could notice that
newspapers all the time

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.940
would have these odd,
little stories that

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.556
were very short and
memorable to me.

00:41:26.556 --> 00:41:28.430
So I used to cut those
out and collect those.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.990
And I'm still sort
of doing that.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.770
And then I went off
and studied math

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.579
and got involved
with computer stuff

00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:37.870
and was doing that because
I didn't think as a grown up

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:41.790
you could get paid or make a
living doing this other stuff.

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:44.602
But I kept doing it
and just giving it

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:45.560
to a couple of friends.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.590
You know, writing things,
collecting things.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.650
And then one day,
I-- by this time,

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:53.380
I had started a little
software company of my own.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.450
But one day I just
started wondering,

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.820
could I get some of my
stuff published someplace?

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.690
If I send it in to some journal,
can I get something published?

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:04.870
So I sent some of my
stuff off to a journal

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.080
with a little cover letter.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.410
And a few weeks later I got
a phone call from somebody

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.530
saying, hi, I'm the
publisher of the journal.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:13.930
Got your articles.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:15.760
Would you be the
editor of the journal?

00:42:17.188 --> 00:42:21.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.310
So I went and talked to him.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.890
And I couldn't resist this.

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:27.680
This was the chance
to do all this.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.030
And there was a long
history leading up to then.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.480
That journal had been started
by a couple of scientists

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.150
in the 1950s, and it had
gone through tremendous highs

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:36.840
and lows and been
kind of wrecked,

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.770
then bought by a big
British science publisher

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:40.940
just at this time.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.146
So it was a kind of
happy conjunction.

00:42:43.146 --> 00:42:44.520
So I started doing
that at night.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.895
For the next four years, I
was running my little software

00:42:46.895 --> 00:42:48.310
company, doing this at night.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.920
I started the Ig Nobel
Ceremony and all kinds

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:55.410
of mostly good things and many
wonderful things happened.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.950
I've been very happy.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:58.970
It's been growing and
infecting the world.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:02.450
And now we have a
big gang of people

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.000
all around the world
who seem to devote,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.840
I think in some
cases, maybe too much

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.120
of their lives to
being part of this.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.470
But I'm very happy at
the way it's working out.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.590
And I invite all of
you to be part of this.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:17.350
If you run across
something that you

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.070
think people should
know about, just

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.160
something that makes
you laugh and makes you

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.260
think, then the
favor I ask of you,

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.640
in addition to-- thank you
for the favor you granted

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.070
of celebrating Dr. Fesmire,
is the next time you

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:36.500
run across something that
really hits you that way,

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.681
after you tell your three
best friends about it,

00:43:38.681 --> 00:43:40.430
if you want the rest
of the world to know,

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.860
just drop me a line.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.357
And I always give people
credit for discovering it,

00:43:45.357 --> 00:43:46.440
unless they don't want it.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:50.760
If you want your name to not
appear, that's absolutely fine.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.740
Just say something.

00:43:53.472 --> 00:43:54.305
Any other questions?

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.870
AUDIENCE: So I find what you're
doing to be pretty hilarious.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.400
That said, there's
kind of view or culture

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.150
right now where it's
sort of anti-science.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:09.660
And a lot of views that research
funding is a waste in science.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.420
Do you have any
thoughts about if this

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.447
impacts that either way?

00:44:12.447 --> 00:44:13.405
MARC ABRAHAMS: Oh, yes.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:19.070
When we started doing this
stuff, a lot of people

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.760
assumed, and they
still-- people new to it

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.350
will assume from the
name or something else

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:31.496
that we must be out to trash
scientists, and technology,

00:44:31.496 --> 00:44:32.870
and medicine, and
all that stuff.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.890
And no, not at all.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.440
What we're about, at least
what I think we're about,

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:46.430
is trying to tempt people
into being a little more

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.360
curious about things.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:52.180
And also, maybe to
my grand ambition,

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:57.320
to get people a little more
in the habit of when you hear

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.280
something, when somebody
important tells you something--

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.310
this is great.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.430
This is wonderful,
this discovery.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:10.050
Or, that medicine is bad or that
video games are bad, whatever.

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:11.520
Or this person is terrible.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.030
That when some important
person tells you something,

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.280
you can accept that if you want.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.280
But you can also look at it
and make your own decision.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:24.020
So the general thing
that I really love--

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.390
and I hope this is
what is at work here--

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:31.410
is things that are right on
the edge, where at first glance

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.020
it's not possible for
anybody at first glance

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.480
to know whether this is a good
or a bad thing, or valuable,

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.080
or worthless.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.250
It's just not possible.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.770
You have to look into
it in more detail.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:44.765
And then it may not
be possible even then.

00:45:44.765 --> 00:45:46.450
It may play out over years.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.490
so trying to promote
things in both ends.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.110
For bad stuff--
yeah, I would love

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:56.560
people to look harder at the
bad stuff and realize it's bad.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.360
But on the other
end, I really want

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.077
people to look at
everything else

00:46:01.077 --> 00:46:02.660
and think that what
you're looking at,

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.743
you may be laughing at it.

00:46:03.743 --> 00:46:06.500
But that may turn out to
be something you decide

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.160
is one of the best parts of
your life a few years from now.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.275
So don't be hasty in
making those judgments.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.916
It's a tough kind of-- and maybe
a crazy thing to want to do,

00:46:16.916 --> 00:46:19.290
but that's what I want to do
and that's what we're doing.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.720
So did that answer the question?

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.520
Thanks.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.069
OK, well, I won't keep you
from lunch and whatever.

00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:28.110
Again, thank you very,
very much for inviting me.

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:31.230
I feel very honored and very
proud and happy to be here.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.910
Thank you.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.460
[APPLAUSE]
