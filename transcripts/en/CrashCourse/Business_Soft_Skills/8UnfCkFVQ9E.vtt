Hi, I’m Evelyn From the Internets and I’m
here to talk to you about business.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.290
I’m sure a lot of things just popped into
your head: Suits, meetings, skyscrapers, handshakes,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.900
big cities, money, graphs, slide decks…
or the immediate UGH

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.539
when you think of “business”?

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.130
But we use business skills all the time.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.830
Maybe you’re great at planning parties.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.260
Or you’re always the peacemaker when your
roommates argue about dishes.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.100
Or you’re basically a pro at making YouTube
videos that say something meaningful and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.100
make people laugh.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.440
Even though that just sounds like living your
life, all those skills can translate to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.739
the workplace.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.359
It's easier than you might think.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.199
Plus, you know... kind of important.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.339
Gotta pay those bills.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.100
So, for the next 17 weeks, I’m gonna be
your host for the first half of Crash Course

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.119
Business, which is sponsored by Google.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.510
We’re doing business too, you guys.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.499
We’re gonna talk about Soft Skills, and
help you use what you’ve already got to

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.940
stand out and make moves in the business world.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.280
Soft Skills is a kind of catch-all term for
buzzwords like Communication, Teamwork, Negotiations,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280
and Conflict Resolution.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.920
We’ll cover big-picture ideas like leadership,
how to have a tough professional conversation,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.810
and how to take care of yourself.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.340
Because everyone’s talking about burnout
these days, and you can be good at business

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.460
and set boundaries.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.580
And we’ll also give you plenty of concrete
tips about resume writing, interviewing, and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.469
how to turn your lofty dreams into achievable
goals.

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.609
We’re here to help you hone your day-to-day
business skills, look for a job, get along

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.619
with your coworkers, and really take your
career to the next level.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.909
Even if that next level is just getting started.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.290
But, don’t worry, we’re not going to turn
you into a corporate robot.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.929
Companies will want to hire YOU, not just
some weird carbon copy of what someone thinks

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.740
an employee should look and act like.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.760
We’ll kick off the course with an episode
about trust, because it’s the key to working

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.389
with people and building your reputation as
both an employee and as a manager.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.330
I’m Evelyn from the Internets, this is Crash
Course Business: Soft Skills, and I’ll see

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.820
you next week.
