00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.320
A short while ago we made a Numberphile video about a problem to do with Diophantine equations

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.400
when a number can be written as a sum of three cubes

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.200
[REWIND] We still don't know the answer to that one so we've not yet been able to find any integers which when

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.260
we summed their cubes you get 33.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.900
Since then we've had some breaking news! There's a paper that appeared and someone has actually

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.160
gone away and this guy's Sander Huisman, he's gone away and he calculated a new solution to one

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.460
integer that was previously unknown whether it was a sum of three cubes or not.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.580
Well indeed he credits the Numberphile video, he sort of found that it was kind of interesting enough to just

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.960
have a go at pushing the boundaries of knowledge a little bit further and he managed to sort of get this going on.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.920
A computer search, and I think he was searching for something like 12.5 CPU years on a bank of computers in

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.120
Lyon and he was able to find a new solution for the number 74.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.960
So we are interested in, suppose that we're given an integer k. Can you find integers x,  y and z, and these can

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.320
be both positive and negative such that x³ + y³ + z³  is equal to k?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.620
If we just look at all of the integers between 1 and 99, as of last time there were only three integers on that list

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.620
for which we didn't have an answer about whether they can be written as a sum of three cubes or not.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.620
And those were 33, 42 and 74.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.720
Now we know that this last number here, 74 is actually represented as a sum of three cubes.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.220
Do you want me to write it down for you?

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.840
Of course.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.340
So here we go.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:50.320
So 74 is now known to be equal to minus 284 650 292 555 885 cubed

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:59.500
plus 6 229 832 190 556 cubed

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:08.600
plus 283 450 105 697 727 cubed.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.700
And there's the new solution, he also found some new solutions for larger values of k, but kind of the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.200
interesting thing is that for for k less than a hundred we now only have two more numbers to worry about here.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.080
The number 33 and the number 42.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.040
And are they solvable? Are they out there? Should other people be firing up their computers?

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.460
Well absolutely, so far, thanks to Sander we now know that if we're interested in the number 33,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:44.220
there are certainly no solutions which the size of x, y and z are bounded by 10 to the 15, so that's a pretty big

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.040
range, so you're gonna have to look further than that.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.800
Who knows, it may will be that if you just look up 10 to the 16 you'll find a solution.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.420
And 42? Do we know any more about that or

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.440
No, nothing about that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.260
It's not earth-shattering news, I mean if we thought for a long time that these things do have solutions in fact we

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.560
think that there are infinitely many solutions for each of these values of k. Our expectation is that they are very

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.940
very sparse, so you might come across one and then the next time you come across another one

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.720
might be many many years down the line before you've got computers big enough to find them

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.260
So I mean it's gratifying that this kind of coinciding with our belief that these things do indeed have

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.980
solutions, but in terms of sort of fundamental mathematics, I would say that's not the case

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.640
it's kind of just a more extensive computer search.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.100
Not every Numberphile viewer is going to make a contribution like Sander,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.160
but the people you see listed on the screen have helped us out.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.020
They're among our Patreon supporters and we really appreciate it.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.460
If you'd like to join their ranks with no matter how small a contribution,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.320
You can go to patreon.com/numberphile

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.580
I'll put a link in the video description.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.980
And by the way, you can see on the screen at the moment

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.020
a link to our original video, which inspired Sander's investigation.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.420
But we've also got a new video, and that's all about those values of k

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.360
for which it's impossible to find a solution. Not even Sander's gonna find one for that.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.080
And if you'd like to see the proof,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.540
We've just put it on Numberphile2.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.760
And by the way, while you're over on Numberphile2,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.240
Why not subscribe to the channel? Because I don't always mention it here,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.160
and you might occasionally stumble over something you didn't even know existed.
