00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.620
Oh nice! Well I'll call you when I got a kidney stone

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.920
and you can call me next time the bulb breaks.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.320

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.220

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.780
Okay, well...

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.320
I'll leave you to it then.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.320
Well good to meet you mate!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.900
Evan, something's blocking the door honey.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.580
Is everything alright in there?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.600

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.580
Did-- Something happened at work?

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.580
[Sigh] Yes, something happened at work.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.000
It's something I did isn't it?

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.540
Darling just...

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.600
Tell me what it is and then let's fix it. Right?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.820
Just fuck off darling!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.580
Come on, Evan, you're being ridiculous.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.480
Is this because of the electrician?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.200
Why don't you fucking get him to change

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.980
the batteries in your vibrator while you're at it?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.900
