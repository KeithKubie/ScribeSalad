00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.050
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm
the Library in Congress.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.610
And as you could tell I'm a little
excited about our program today

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.940
because we have a very,
very special guest.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.240
Many of you have met him

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.120
and you notice he has a
medal around his neck.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.810
A gold medal because
he is the Librarian

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.610
of Congress's Youth Ambassador
for Young People's Literature.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.920
And that's very similar to
being an Olympic medal winner.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.590
He won what's something that's
called the MacArthur Genius Award.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.190
Which is really like that.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.210
I know. [laughs] Yes.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.890
Yes. Now can anybody,
and I know some

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.260
of you have read his graphic books.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.170
Tell me his name.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.690
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.990
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.460
Say it loud.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.760
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.850
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Give her the --

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.150
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.450
[laughs]

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.750
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Louder.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.760
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.060
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yay.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.360
[ Applause ]

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.660
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And there he is.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.220
As you know he's gotten lots
of awards as I just mentioned.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.920
He's even had a chance
to draw Superman.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.600
And if you don't know his story,
he started drawing comic books

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.200
when he was right around your age.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.950
And he has traveled around the
country talking about books

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.120
and reading and reading
without walls.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.420
And he wants everyone and
that's where we're going to talk

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.730
about today to read a book that
you normally wouldn't read.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.520
How many of you read
something not just for school,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.940
but a book that you look
at and you say I don't know

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.050
if I really want to read this?

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.900
Ooh. Quite a few.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.380
Well we're going to
take the challenge.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.640
So I want to thank some people
for making this possible.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.410
And I had to write it down
to make sure I didn't forget.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.480 position:56%
And it's the Children's Book Council
and Every Child or Reader Foundation

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.920
for their support of us being here.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.840
And also McMillan for a second
publishing for their help.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.510 position:56%
So now I'm going to bring up our
award winning ambassador, Gene Yang.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.160
[ Applause ]

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.460
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank you.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.240
Thank you, Dr. Hayden.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.540
Good morning.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.840
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Good morning.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank
you all for being here.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.970
It's such a thrill
to be in this room

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.310
with all these people
who love books.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.130
It's like one of my
favorite kinds of settings.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.900
Well the way we're going to start
this morning off is Dr. Hayden

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.430
and I are going to ask each other
questions, mostly about books

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.210
and then towards the end we'd like
to get some questions from you.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.840
So if questions pop up in your head

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.560
in the beginning, save
those questions.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.370
File them away in the
back of your head.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.140
At the end we want to
hear those questions.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.340
What I'd like to first hear about
is how you fell in love with books.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.120
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well, I
had the wonderful experience

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.040
of having people around
me who loved to read.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.740
And one of the first things
they would do when I would go

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.110
and visit my grandparents
in the summer

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.040 position:56%
and things is they would read to me.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.590
And the first thing I wanted to
do though was learn how to read.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.650
Read my own stuff.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.160
It was nice being read to.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.300 position:56%
I loved it, but I couldn't wait to
start reading myself, so I could get

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.250
into it and read whatever
I wanted to.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.640
I liked crime books.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.530
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
You liked crime books?

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.820
Like books about people
doing bad things?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.120
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.640
So [laughs] I found this book,
my grandmother, nice little lady

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.670
and everything, but she kinda liked
mysteries and things like that.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.400
And so she had this book that I
knew I wasn't supposed to look at.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.260
It was called Hollywood Babylon.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.120
How many of you all
know what Babylon is?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.880
It was a wild place.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.610
Back in the ancient days.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.120
[laughs] And Hollywood,
you know where that is.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.100
And it was a true crime thing.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.650
Right. With all these
gruesome pictures.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.110
Fatty Armbuckle.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.450
Just murders and stuff.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.750
And when I would come, you know,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.690
she'd make sure she
would put it away

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.010
and of course I've spent
most of my summer finding it.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.310
[ Laughs ]

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.150
And that's how I got
hooked and I said, boy.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.760
So at first I could just look at
the pictures that were really,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.510
really gruesome, and then I
want to know what it said.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.700
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And that's
what got you at true crime.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.070
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: True crime.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.370
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: True
crime what's got Dr. Hayden.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.670
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That's
what got me going.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.970
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's great.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.270
That's great.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.570
Well for me I grew up
in a house of stories.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.870
My parents were both immigrants.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.860
My mom was born in Meiman, China.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.160
My dad in Taiwan.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.610
They both came to the United
States for college and met,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.200
fell in love, got married, had me.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.190
I grew up listening
to their stories.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.410
Both my mom and my dad
loved to tell stories.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.360
I think this is actually true
of a lot of immigrant families.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.320
A lot of parents who are from
another country or another culture,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.330
they'll want to tell their kids
stories, from that country,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.620
from that culture as a way
of building that connection.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.940
So I heard lots of stories from
Chinese cultural when I was a kid.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.000
But reading for me was
actually kind of hard.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.780
I remember in early elementary
school my teachers would divide us

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.080
into these two groups, right.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.380
And they would name them.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.680
I think they're named
after like colors.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.280
I think one of them was
like a red group or one

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.580
of them was a blue group.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.000
But really they were the
fast and slow readers.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.450
Everybody knew, the colors
weren't fooling anybody.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.160
And I was definitely
always on the slow side.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.340
At the very end of every month
our teacher would make us line

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.670
up by how many pages
we'd read that month.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.970
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Awe.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.390
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And I was always
either last or second to last.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.650
It was like me and my best
friend would trade places.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.670
But and eventually
the way I kind of got

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.960
through that was my mom would
sit down and read to me.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.260
She would read with me.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.760
Even now though, I'm
not a fast reader,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.290
but I do realize you
don't have to read fast

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.690
in order to love books, right?

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.990
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.290
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
You just have to read.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.590
It doesn't matter how
quickly or slowly you do it.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.890
You could still enjoy the book.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.190
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.920
And sometimes you want to read
slow so you can get what you want

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.270
out of it or everything like that.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.570
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.450
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And it pains
me sometimes to hear people

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.050
of your age group and
certainly in my age group

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.370
where it made reading not fun.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.670
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.970
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
that's what the cool thing

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.630
about reading is it's fun,
but to have to go through all

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.710
that it takes a little bit from it.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.170
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Yeah, yeah, it does.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:12.290
It does. I think there are ways
in which learning to enjoy reading

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.240 position:56%
in the beginning can make it so
that you can get through some things

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.790
that are more difficult
to read later right?

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.090
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.390
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Because
you remember the fun

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.690
and that'll push you through some
of the harder stuff that you have

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.990
to read as you get older.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That's why when
people say, "Oh, we're going to read

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.900
to babies and little
kids and everything,"

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.710
that's to get them ready because
they know there's something good

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.090
if you figure out what
all this text is.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.390
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.690
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: If you figured out
you know there's a secret in there.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.670 position:56%
There's something that's really
cool in there and it gives you that.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.970
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.830
Yeah. So you love that
true crime book as a kid.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.130
Were there any other favorites?

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.430
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I still have it.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.730
[ Laughs ]

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.030
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Were
there any other favorites?

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, Little Women.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.770
I liked that, Louisa May Alcott.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.220
And the one that I brought up
here today is my all time favorite

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.580
when I was a little girl
called, Bright April.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.680 position:56%
It was the first book that I learned
about and you see I have my Reading

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.510
Without Walls bookmark,
so take that when you get.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.570
The first one -- oh,
the Walter Award too.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.590
The first book that I checked out
over and over and over to the point

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.750
that I had library fines.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.050
And didn't even realize it

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.250
because this book was the first
book that I saw myself in.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.830
It was a little girl who had
pigtails, who was a Brownie,

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.420
and she brown just like
me and when I'm, you know,

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.660
I'm quite a bit older
than you, Gene.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:40.320
And when I was coming up
there weren't many books

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.150
that portrayed people
that looked like me.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.360
Much less talked about my
history or anything like that.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.030
And I just to this day
I just love this book,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.350
because I could see
myself in something

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.370
that was important, like books.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.540
If books are important,
but you don't see yourself

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.200
in them, what does that say?

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.790
I had a I had a similar issue.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.960 position:56%
It was very hard when I was a kid to
find characters who looked like me

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.460
in the books that I was reading

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.580
and in the television
shows that I was watching.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.880
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, yeah.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.180
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And I wonder

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.820
if that's why I drifted
towards superhero comics.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.160
I started reading superhero
comics when I was in fifth grade.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.060
The very first superhero comic that
I bought was an issue of Superman.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.730
It was with Superman
and the atomic knights.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.160
Do you all know who
the atomic knights are?

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.750
They're a little bit more
obscure, but they're these dudes --

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.050
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: There's
an older gentleman.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.350
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes, yes.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.890
[laughs] The nerds have
just outted themselves.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.190
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That's right.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.490
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: If you know
who the atomic knights are,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.790
you're definitely a nerd.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.180
But there are these dudes who
dressed up in medieval style armor,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.030
and they ride around on
these giant mutated dogs.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Ooh.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.630
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.930
It was kind of awesome.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.230 position:56%
I got to say it was kind of awesome.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.530
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.830
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: But I wonder
if I drifted towards superheroes

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.880
because I had a hard time finding
characters who looked like me.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.180
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.480
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Because superheroes,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.530
people don't realize this, but
almost every major superhero

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:05.240
out there, you know, Superman,
Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.400
they're all created by
children of immigrants.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.020
They're all created by the sons
of Jewish immigrants from Europe.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.830
And I think that's why
every superhero has

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.430
like these two identities.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.240
You know, I had two
identities when I was a kid.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.550
I had one name, a Chinese
name that I used at home.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.990
I had an English name
that I used at school.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.150
I spoke one language at
home, another one at school.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.450
It was almost like that.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.150
It was like how Superman is
both Superman and Clark Kent,

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.080
so I don't even know if I
was conscious of it as a kid,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.300
but that definitely felt
really familiar to me.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.960
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That idea of
two cultures and how you speak

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.920
and how you are at home
and how you are outside

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.430
of the home is a common theme
I think with a lot of cultures.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.730
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah
I think that's true.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.570
I think, you know, I actually
think that's one of the best things

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.510
about being an American is that you
can be an American without giving

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.270
up that core piece of yourself.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.740
You know, because America is a
collection of diverse communities.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.570
And that's one of our strengths.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Someone once told
me when we were talking about having

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.170
and being in this country
where there is

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.690
so many people looking all types
of ways and just this variety,

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:19.120
is what if you only had one
type of ice cream flavor

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.480
and you could never
have anything else.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.780
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.080
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Think about that.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.380
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
It would be terrible.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.680
It would be terrible.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.980
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You may think it's
good now to just have chocolate.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.280
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
It would be punishment.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.580
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: But it
would be a punishment.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.540
And how exciting it is to
take, that's how I feel

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.360
about different types of books too.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.660
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.980
So was it your love of books that
led to you becoming a librarian?

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.280
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, sure.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.410
Sure. I had musical parents and
I didn't have musical talent.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.350
[laughs] So I learned early
on, but I always loved to read.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.440
And when I found out that
there was a profession,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.380
something that you
could do toto introduce

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.580
and really get the excitement.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.880
I mean look, we're right
here, we're stomping our feet.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.690
We're talking about Superman, and
we're doing all this cool stuff.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.780 position:56%
And so when I find out about being a
librarian I was hooked on that too.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.080
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Was there a moment

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.140
when you knew you were
going to be a librarian?

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.440
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.550
There was a moment
when I was working

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:20.900
in a storefront library similar
to the one when I found out about.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.200
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.500
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.800
Bright April back in
New York in Queens.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.060
And I was working with a
young man named Leonard.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.400
He was ten, and he
would come in every day

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.710
and I was a kind of apprentice.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.620
I wasn't a librarian yet.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.730
I hadn't even started library
school and he would come

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.170
in every day and just
sit next to me.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.040
And I would give him stuff, and
he would draw, because of a lot

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.460
of the kids made fun of him.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.800 position:56%
And that and so just knowing and
putting the right book with Leonard,

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.650
and getting him to
draw and stuff was

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.850
when I said okay this
is this is cool stuff.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.150
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's great.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.450
That's great.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.750
I do think that maybe
that's the thing too.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.800 position:56%
Maybe kids who other kids might make
fun of often drift towards books.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.480
I was definitely one of those kids.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.040 position:56%
I was a kid where other kids would
make fun of me, but I was also a kid

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.470
who would make fun of other
kids, so I was on both sides.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.770
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh,
you were a bull.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.070
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I was a jerk.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.370
I was definitely a jerk.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.510
People were jerks to me
and I was also a jerk back.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: See they were jerks
to me and I was one of those kids

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.960
that all the -- I was wasn't one
of the cool ones and everything

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.850
and at the last day of
school I'd have to run home,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:37.550
because all the cool girls would
say they were going to beat me up.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.780
But I could run fast.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.240
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That sounds
[laughs] -- I couldn't run fast.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: See, so
you had to fight back.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.630
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: [laughs] Yeah.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.930
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You
had to be a jerk too.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.230
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
I had to be a jerk too.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.890
But I do think like working on
books, writing and drawing is a way

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.190
of working that stuff out.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.950
Like if you if you have, you
know, problems in your life,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.030
I think all of us do, writing
and drawing is a great way

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.900
of just figuring that
out for yourself.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.380
I have a friend who's
an art teacher.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.960
He teaches art at a high school,
and he says that out of all

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.010
of the classes that a
kid takes in high school,

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.320
the art class is the only one
where the subject is themselves.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.780
They're trying to figure
themself out by making art.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.050
I think that's true,
not just in drawing,

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.350
but also of any kind of art.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.650
Including writing.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.950
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
what about music too?

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.250
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, music too.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.550
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
stuff like that?

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.850
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.150
Yeah. Yeah.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.450
And I think that's why sometimes
if you have things that are painful

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.980
in your life, you can find
a little bit of healing

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.660
by writing and by drawing.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.610
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So did you
and I have to ask you this,

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:40.080 position:56%
so in growing superheroes and things
like that, did you get any revenge?

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: [laughs] Like did
I make up bad guys based on -- not.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.480
I don't think I ever did it
consciously because I was worried

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.160
about getting in trouble.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.180
But the very first superhero
comic I did was in fifth grade.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.560
I did it with my friend, Jimmy
Kiniyoshi, who was half Jewish

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.180
and half Japanese and we were both
the comic book kids in our class.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.430
So during lunch when our
more athletic friends were

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.730
playing tetherball.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.310
Do you all still play tetherball?

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.610
It's awesome, right.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.160
Except that I was terrible at it.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.020
The ball would always
hit me in the head.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.320
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: [laughs] God.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.620
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So instead
of playing tetherball Jeremy

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.730
and I would sit at the tables and
we would draw comics together.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.570
Then when we give our originals to
his mom who would take them to work

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.060
with her, and wait until all
of her coworkers went home

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.360
and sneak photocopies for us.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.660
[ Laughs ]

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.190
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: We would take
these photocopies and staple them

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.520
by hand to make our own comics

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.100
and we sold our comics
to our classmates.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.400
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Ooh, nice.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.700
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
For 50 cents apiece.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.000
It was awesome.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.300
We made $8.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.600
It was the best.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.900
Now a days if you want
to do the same thing,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.200
you cannot sell for 50 cents.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.500
Prices have gone up.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.320
You've got to charge
at least a $1.50.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.620
But it was great, it was great.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.910
I think working on that comic
taught me how to tell stories.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.840
Working on that comic
gave me a way of --

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.410
I was also a pretty shy kid too.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.130
It was weird, right,
being shy and also a jerk.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.200
But I was a pretty shy kid, so
working on that comic gave me a way

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.150
of expressing myself in ways
that I couldn't with my,

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.630
you know, by just talking.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.170
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: How did
the stories come to you?

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.120
I mean did you just wake up and --

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.420
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.860
When I was in fifth grade I thought
I was kind of like a, you know,

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.720
I thought I was like
super creative and stuff.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.190
And so I thought, "Oh,
man, I just woke up

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.230
and this character formed
fully formed in my head."

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.420
But then as an adult I look
back on the character we made up

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.660
and I realized, no, he was
actually just a rip off.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:30.250
He was a rip off character of Robin
Hood, because he was all green,

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.660
and he lived in the woods and he
had a band of friends that he used

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.430
to call his merry men
just like Robin Hood.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.730

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.030
[ Laughs ]

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah, I
think that's pretty close.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.630
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes, isn't it?

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.930
[laughs]

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.230
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.530
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's real close.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.830
But we there was one difference.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.130
The difference was our character
instead of fighting with a bow

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.430
and arrow he actually
had a discus of death

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.730
that he would throw
at people's heads.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.810
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You work
around a true crime fantasy.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.110
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
[laughs] A little bit.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.410
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.710
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: A little bit.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.010
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.310
There's a little bit.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.610
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: But you know
I actually think now as an adult,

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.910
even though that one
character was terrible,

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.470
I do think that sometimes
kids think creativity is just

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.860
like when you make
stuff up out of nothing.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.400
But that's almost never true.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.700
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: No.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.000
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: You know, you
can't make stuff up out of nothing.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.480
What real creativity is I think
is combining things together

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.390
that were never combined before.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.010 position:56%
You know, so if you love superheroes

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.310
and you take something
else that you love.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.090
I don't know maybe like chocolate
cake, and you figure out a way

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.890
to make a superhero
based on chocolate cake,

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.190 position:56%
that will be a really creative idea.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.530
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Let's
work on that one.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.830
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.130
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I mean --

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.430
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I agree.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.730
[laughs]

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.030
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's something
though when you think about.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.330
So what are you working on now?

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.630
What is the reading without walls?

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.930
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.480
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Don't forget
the bookmarks and everything.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.780
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's right.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.080
That's right.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.480
Two Januarys ago I was in this
very room in January of 2016,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.580
and the Library of Congress,
Every Child the Reader,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.960
and the Children's Book Council
they gave me this fancy medal.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.010
To this day this is the
fanciest thing I own.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.310
[ Laughs ]

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.610
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: This is as
bling, bling as Jianlian gets.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.910
Right.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.210
[ Laughs ]

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.510
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: If you want
to touch this, come up later.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.810
I'll let you touch it.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.110
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.410
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's got
your name engraved too.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:10.710
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.010
It's got my name on the back.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.310
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I see.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.610
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's
got my name on the back

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:15.910
and they named me the
Fifth National Ambassador

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.210
for Young People Literature,
which just means

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:18.620
that for my two year
term, 2016 and 2017,

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:23.070
my job is to get both more kids
reading and kids reading more.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.810
The way I'm doing that
is I have been going

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.730
around the country issuing
what I call the reading

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.380
without walls challenge.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.300
You know, one of the
best things about growing

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.430
up is you all get to
explore the world.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.770
That's like your primary job
right now is to figure out --

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.070
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.370
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: --
how the world works.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.090
And books are a great way
of exploring the world.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:44.850
So I want us all to read books
outside of our comfort zones.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.500
Read books that are
actually exploring books.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.630
You know, books that are not the
normal books that we would read.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.930
So the challenge works like this.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.760
You could either do
this as a community

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.590
or you can do this just
as an individual reader.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.090
You set yourself a due date.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.900
By that due date just
do one of three things.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.950
Number one, you can read a book
about a character who doesn't look

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.250
like you or live like you.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.990
Someone who's very
different from you.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.920
Two, you could read
a book about a topic

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.060
that you might not
know anything about.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.840
Something that you might even
find intimidating or three,

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.720 position:56%
you can read a book in a format that
you normally wouldn't read for fun.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.790
So normally all you
read are chapter books.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.960
I want you to give a
graphic novel a try.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.260
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.560
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: If normally
all you read are graphic novels

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.120
and comic books, then I want you to
try a chapter book or a collection

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.070
of poetry or an audio book.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.070
Just try lots of different kinds
of stories in different formats.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.370
If you really want to
go for the gold star,

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.430
find a book that fits all
three of those categories.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.730
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.980
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So I've been
talking about this all over America

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.440
to different communities, and I've
really been shocked by the ways

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.710
in which readers and
librarians and teachers

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.580
and bookstore owners have really
come up and met this challenge.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.880
It's been great.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.480
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: When I thought
about you being here and talking

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.160
about reading without walls
and books that I've read

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.040
that at first I thought,
"Oh, I don't know."

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.710 position:56%
I thought about the book Seabiscuit.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.010
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.310
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.130
It's about a horse and
I'm like I've only seen

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.290
in person maybe two
horses in my life, right.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.900
A city kid all of this.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.200
That wasn't it.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.220
And it's all about this horse
who is an underdog and he was

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.760
like a half mule and a half this.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.700
And nobody thought he could win.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.360
And when I got into the book
though, I learned all about horses,

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.280
and that, but also the
spirit of the underdog.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.580
And that's --

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.880
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.180
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: --
theme came through

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.480
and I turned into a Seabiscuit fan.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.780
[ Laughs ]

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.030
And watched horse races.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's great.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.630
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Because now
I know a little bit about it.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Something similar
happened to me with basketball.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.840
As a kid I hated basketball,
because I was terrible at it.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.640
I had these friends
were really good at it.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.840
And when we played -- it
was just like tetherball.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.200
The basketball would find a
way of hitting me in the head.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.500
So I hated it.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.800
I didn't follow basketball.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.710
I remember in college
I lived with these guys

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.200
who were huge basketball fans.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.070
And we would watch movies,
you know, at home on our VCR.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.330
You all know what that is, a VCR?

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.630
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You do.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.930
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
It's like Netflix,

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.460
except you have to
have like these --

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.760
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: A VCR?

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.060
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
That you stick in.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.360
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So watched movies
on our VCR and then when like 10:30,

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.700
10:45 came around they would
force us to pause the movie,

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.730
so that they could watch
sports highlights on the news.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.780
And I was always so mad about it.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.690
But a few years ago I started
reading books about basketball.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.130
I read one called Outside the
Paint about the basketball scene

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.440
in 1940s San Francisco Chinatown.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.740
I read Slam Dunk.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.040
Have you read Slam Dunk?

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.340
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I've heard of it.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.640
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's amazing.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.940
It's awesome.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.240
One of the best manga
series out there.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.540
I read Matt de la Pena's,
Ball Don't Lie.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.840
I read a bunch of books
about basketball

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.140
and that got me really interested.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.020
And now I'm still not an expert.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.420
I'm still no basketball expert.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.730
Like when I watch a basketball
game now, there'll still be times

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.330 position:56%
when all the action will stop on the
court and I'll have no understanding

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.710
of why, but at least I feel it.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.010
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.310
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
You know what I mean?

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.610
I can feel the thrill
of the game now.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.910
And it's because of
books and [inaudible]

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.210
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.510
And things that you
never experienced.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.810
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.110
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: But
really getting into it

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.410
and saying okay I'm
going to try this.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.710
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.010
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm going to try.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.310
Now, I noticed something here.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.610
This easel with nothing on it.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.910
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.210
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Were you
going to put something on it?

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.510
[ Laughs ]

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.810
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I mean
were we going to actually --

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.110
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: We
could put something on it.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.410
We could put something on it.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.710
So what I was thinking --

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.010
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.310
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: -- we could
do is maybe we could design a

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.610
superhero together.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:32.910
Does that sound okay?

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.510
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: We can
design a superhero together.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:36.810
Okay. We'll start from the
head and we'll move down.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.110
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Don't
forget the chocolate.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.410
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.710
Yes, maybe a chocolate
cake superhero.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.010
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You don't have to.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.310
It's okay.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.610
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.350
So I'm going to start by
giving them a big round head.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.520
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Does the
head have to be -- okay round.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.820
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: All right.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.120
Big round head.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.790
Now somebody tell me what's
on the superhero's face?

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.710
What do you think is on
the superheroes face?

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.110
Yes, that lady right there.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.410
&gt;&gt; A moustache.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.710
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: A moustache.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.460
Okay. A mustache.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.760
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.060
Now, all right.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.930
I have a little mustache so.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.230
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.530
A mustache and what else?

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.830
What else is on his face?

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.130
Go ahead.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.430
&gt;&gt; A round top hat.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.730
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: A round top hat.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.190
You all are going with some really
nontraditional [laughs] superhero

gear, which is fine.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.890
Okay. So a round top hat.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Are
they pulling our legs?

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.290
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: A
round top hat, what else?

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.590
What else.

Tell me about this character's ears.

Tell me about this character's ears.

&gt;&gt; He used to have like
little candles like sticking

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.190
out the side of his head.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.490
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Candles?

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:37.790
[laughs] Candle instead of ears.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.090
Okay.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.470
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, you don't
have to go with the chocolate cake.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.770
It's okay.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.050
Don't worry, we'll just have
some chocolate cake later.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.350
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:51.830
So candles sticking out of the
side of his head instead of ears.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:59.770
Okay. We still haven't gotten to
-- someone tell me about his eyes.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.350
Somebody tell about his eyes.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.650
Yes.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:04.950

colleagues might remember Mr. Magoo.

&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Kind
of have a Mr. Magoo.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.260
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: All right.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.560
How about -- okay, let's
start moving down now.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.860 position:56%
Tell me about this character's body.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.160 position:56%
Tell me about this character's body.

Yes, young lady.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.110
&gt;&gt; A jumpsuit.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.410
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: A jumpsuit.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:29.710
What kind of jumpsuit?

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:31.820
Give me a little bit more
information about his jumpsuit.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.120
&gt;&gt; It's orange.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.420
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.720
So I don't have orange.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.020
Oh, I do. I do have orange.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.320
Okay. An orange jumpsuit.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.970
Like a tracksuit.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.740
Is that what you're thinking?

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.340
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Like old
school, Run DMC style tracksuit.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.650
Okay. Let's do this.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:51.190
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Orange.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.490
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.870
A jumpsuit.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:03.540
I have actually never
personally worn a jumpsuit.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.920
So I'm not entirely
positive what one looks like.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.220
Tell me if I do it right, okay?

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.760
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So don't
jump shoes normally have like --

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.450
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, yeah,
coming out of the side.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.870
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Stripes on the side?.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.170
Is that true.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.230
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Am I making that up?

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.300
And you want an orange?

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.600
We have red up here.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.900
Is red close enough?

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: All right, red.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.800
So we'll do red.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.400
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Looking
kinda spiffy.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.700
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: All right.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.030
Then somebody told
me about his hands.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Ooh.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.630
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Somebody
tell me about his hands.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.230
Somebody tell me about his hands.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.170
Yes. Yes.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.470
&gt;&gt; Tentacles.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.770
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: What's that?

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.070
&gt;&gt; Tentacles.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.370
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Tentacles.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.670
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Ooh.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.970
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: You
sound like somebody

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.270
who reads a lot of Japanese comics.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.570
Is that true?

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:02.990
There are a lot of
tentacles in Japanese comics.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.790
Okay. All right, let's do that.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.120
We'll do tentacles.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.840
So I feel like we're
losing out on the --

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.150
&gt;&gt; Chocolate cake.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.540
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: -- the
chocolate cake theme here.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.100
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: But that's okay.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.450
They can do something else.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.820
We'll have chocolate cake later.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.300
Because I want you to --

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.600
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.920
Let's do tentacles on one side.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.450
Somebody told me about
the other side.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.650
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: They can
have two different, okay.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:27.950
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.250
We can -- there are no rules.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.550
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: No rules.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.850
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
When it comes to this.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.150
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: This is good.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.450
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:35.750
Okay. Yes.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.050
&gt;&gt; Wait, where is the
cake residue in his face?

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.350
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Face
cake residue on his face.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.650
Okay. We can do that.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.950
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Getting
personal people.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.250
&gt;&gt; And they're like browns.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.550
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Cake residue.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.850
&gt;&gt; And then he has like a brown --

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.150
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Cake residue.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.450
&gt;&gt; -- sparkle [inaudible]
to the face.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:48.750
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Does
that look like cake residue?

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.050
That looks like he just
has a fungus on his face.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.350
[ Laughs ]

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.650
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Excuse me.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.950
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.250
Face residue on his face and
then what was the other thing?

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.130
&gt;&gt; His hand is like
a sparkle shooter.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.800
But it's brown like
sparkle shooters.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.180
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
A sparkle shooter?

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.030
&gt;&gt; A brown sparkle shooter.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.640
So I'm going to guess as to what
a sparkle shooter looks like,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.940
all right.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.240
&gt;&gt; A cake shooter.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.540
The cake shooter.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.040
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Is this what
a sparkle shooter looks like?

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.340
&gt;&gt; No.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.120
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That
actually looks like dandelions.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.420
Maybe I'll add more color.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.660
It will look more like
a sparkle shooter.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.410
Okay. All right.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:27.980
So somebody tell me about his feet.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.250
Somebody tell me about his feet.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.690
All the way over there.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.000

the other is really small.

and the other really small, good.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.060
Good, we'll do that.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.010
And then how about his shoes.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.810
What do his shoes look like?

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.110
What does his shoes look like?

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.410
Yes, young lady here.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:49.830
&gt;&gt; It's one pink and one red.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.460
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
One pink and one red.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.780
One foot is really big and
one foot's really small.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.580
All right.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.040

here's a really big foot.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.810
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.020
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
It's like a clown foot.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.260
And here's this really small foot.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:13.600
And we'll do some laces.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:19.680
And one is pink and
one is red, you said?

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.980
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.280
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.920
So all I have are red, blue,
green, and purple up here.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:33.130
Is there an alternative to
pink that we could choose?

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.430
&gt;&gt; Purple.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.730
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Purple.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.250
Got it. Got it.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.750
Anything else you want to add?

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:44.610
How about a little animal sidekick.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.650
Who would his animal sidekick be?

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:48.950
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Whoa.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:50.250
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Who would
his animal sidekick be?

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.550
Yes, young lady right here.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.850
&gt;&gt; A talking cheery.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:55.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: A talking cherry?

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.380
All right.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.280
Okay. We'll do that.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:09.220
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: A cherry?

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.520
Okay.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.450
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.320
And I think we're pretty
close to being done.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.300
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, I
think there's some more.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.600
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.900
Let's do one more thing.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.200
One more thing.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.500
Okay. Let's --

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.800
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Can they
have another sidekick

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.100
to go with the [inaudible]?

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.490
&gt;&gt; On his shoes add
cupcake boosters.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:39.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Cupcake boosters.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.040
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's amazing.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.730
Okay. So what would a cupcake
booster even look like?

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.230
It would look like?

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:52.400
&gt;&gt; A cake with jets in it.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It would be like --

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.730
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: All right.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.740
I think we need one last thing.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.420
We need one last thing and that is?

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.720
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Hair.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: What is his name?

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.410
What is his name?

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.710
What is his name?

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.580
Yes, young lady, right there.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:16.180
&gt;&gt; It should be Jeff the Weirdo.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.480
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Jack.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.780
&gt;&gt; Jess.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.080
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Jeff the Weirdo.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.380
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I think that fits.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.680
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Are you mad
at somebody named Jeff right now?

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.980
&gt;&gt; Huh?

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.280
&gt;&gt; Are you mad at somebody
named Jeff right now?

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.580
&gt;&gt; No.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.880
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.180
Jeff the Weirdo.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.480
&gt;&gt; Can we have icing cake?

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.780
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Jeff the Weirdo.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.080
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Superhero.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.380
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Who is a superhero.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.520
&gt;&gt; Jeff the Weirdo.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.210
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Jeff
would attract attention.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.440
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Weirdo is
"E," before "I,", I right?

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.740
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.040
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's
one of the few words

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.340
that doesn't follow that rule.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.640
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Who said --

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:52.140
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And how about
them having a cherry sidekick.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.070
What's the cherry sidekick's name?

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.370
Yes.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.140
&gt;&gt; Mr. Cherry.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.100
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Peep peep?

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.400
&gt;&gt; No.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.700
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Peep peep.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.640
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm not
sure if this is going

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.710
to get optioned for television.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.010
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: All right.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.310
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm not sure.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.610
It might.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So I will talk to
DC Comics to see if Jeff the Weirdo

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:25.090
and his talking peep peep character
could actually make their way

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.390
into the DC Universe.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.580
No guarantees, no guarantees,
I but like you all

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.510
to give yourselves
a round of applause.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:37.690
[ Applause ]

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.750
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That
is truly a super hero

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.290
like I have never seen before.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.800
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Never seen before.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.100
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.400
&gt;&gt; Icing cake.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.700
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: What's that?

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.000
&gt;&gt; An icing cake.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.300
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: An icing cake.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.300
We'll have to add that
in the second issue.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.060
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Uh,
the second issue.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.060
&gt;&gt; And a symbol.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.110
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Oh,
yeah, and he needs a symbol.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:01.410
You're right.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.710
And he needs a symbol.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:06.430
So those are all things that you
have to earn in issue number two.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.970
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And that's how you
develop different issues, right.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.270
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's how
you develop different issues.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.380
Yeah. Well, you know, I written
in two different environments.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.610
I've written for graphic novels
where you kind of just make

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.390
up a story and you
tell it from beginning

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.370
to end all in one shot usually.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:22.730
And I've also worked on series.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.390 position:56%
So right now I'm working on a series
called Secret Coders and I'm working

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:28.600
on a series for DC Comics
called new Superman,

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.920 position:56%
about this brand new character, a
Chinese Superman in the DC Universe.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.360
But when you're working on --

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.030
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, you
want to give him a hand.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.040
[ Applause ]

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.340
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: But
when you're working

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.760 position:56%
on a series there is this element
of making things up as you go along.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.550
It's kind of like when you're,
you know, when I was your age

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.850
and I would tell stories.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.150
I would just make it
up as I went along.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.090 position:56%
So working on a series is like that.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.390
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.320
The Secret Coders,
tell me about that one.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.490
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Secret Coders
is a graphic novel series I'm doing

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.470
with a friend of mine
named Mike Holmes.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.870
Before becoming a full time
cartoonist I taught high school

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.170
computer science.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.160
I taught kids how to code
computers for 17 years.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.460
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.760
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And I've
always wanted to take what I did

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.330
in my classroom and stick it
into a graphic novel series.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.030
So that's exactly what
Secret Coders is.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.760
Mike and I are trying to teach
kids how to code computers

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.260
through this comic book series.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.130
There'll be six volumes in all.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:21.910
Volume of three just came out.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.400
We're really excited about it.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.700
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.000
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: We're
super excited about it.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.990
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: How many of you
know how to code or what coding is?

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.290
All right.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.590
Very good.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.890
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: A
number of u. That's great.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.190
That's good.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.490
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Good.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:35.790
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Now
speaking of computers,

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.250
how do you think things are
changing for the library?

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.140
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, the library
and the Library of Congress

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.020
for instance right now you can go

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.080
up on the website, and
we just revamped it.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:51.710
So it looks much, much cooler and
you can download from thousands

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.910
and thousands of photographs in
the collection of the library

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.720
and use them however you want to.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.020
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Wow.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.320
It's for free?

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.620
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's
really something.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:02.920
For free.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.220
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Download.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.520
And where are these photos from?

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.820
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh,
they're from everywhere.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.120
We have photographs that
tell you about history.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.370
We have photographs that
other people have taken

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.280
to show different cultures.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.770
And you can just about
type any subject in.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.260
And photographs will come so that
you can then download and use

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.360
in any report, in any art, in
any way you want to use them.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.850
So that's what makes it cool.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.150
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's great.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.450
That's great.

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:29.170
You don't have a favorite
photo in your question, do you?

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:30.470
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Not yet.

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:31.770
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.070
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Not yet.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.900
I'm six months in and I'm
discovering, so I'm Tweeting.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:42.380
And every day that I'm here I put
up something cool that I found

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.070
and I've seen, like Thomas
Jefferson's handwriting

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.030
in his own hand when
he was writing the --

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:53.230
working on the Declaration of
Independence and seeing him

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.220
and what he put in
and what he took out.

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.560
I think people don't realize
there are drafts of certain things

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:03.150
that you hear about, but
they did a lot of cross outs

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.930
and thought about things.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:10.020
And it's really nice to see okay,
this didn't come up just perfect

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.320
that they had to work on it.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.620
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.610
Yeah. I actually think that that
was something that I had to learn,

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.580
you know, as I grew up and
started making stories as an adult.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.440
When I was a kid and I read
books I always thought, man,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.790
this came into that author's
head perfectly formed.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.720
And they just wrote it down
and sent it to the publisher

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.370
and the publisher made
it into a book.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.250
After I got it the books I realized
that is not the case at all,

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.860
that there's so much
revision that happens.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.090
There's so much stuff where
you write something down

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.470
and you're not super satisfied
with it, you just change it,

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.680
and change it, and tweak it,
and tweak it until it gets

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.520
to where you want it to be.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.680
I would say maybe even
half of writing,

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.470
half of making stories is that.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:49.990
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Is
changing and making.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.290
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:52.590
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So when you
see that even the Declaration

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:55.430
of Independence there were cross
outs and there were thoughts

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:56.830
and there were things like that.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.130
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.920
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And Abraham
Lincoln, the Gettysburg Address

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.840
to see his whole handwriting
and what he thought.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.140
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So even somebody

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.140
like Abraham Lincoln couldn't
get it right the first time.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.500
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Couldn't
get it right the first time.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.800
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Had to [crosstalk]

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.100
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: But
he worked on it.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.850
And the thing about Abraham
Lincoln that wonderful speech

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.710
that he gave was the
shortest speech that day.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:21.750
One guy gave a speech
for three hours.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.050
Can you imagine?

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.620
One speech, three hours.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.550
And Abraham Lincoln got up and
it was five minutes and they said

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.380 position:56%
that was the best speech of the day,

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.490
because it was short
and to the point.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.790
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:37.260
Yeah. Another thing that I had to
learn as a professional writer is

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.300
that often longer doesn't
mean better.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.800 position:56%
I remember when I was in high school

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.660
and I would write things
for my English class.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:51.030
I would always try to make by my
sentences as long as possible,

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.740
and I would put in as
many big words as I could.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.120
Like words where I barely even
understand what they meant.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.420
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.720
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Right.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.740 position:56%
And I wanted to do it because I felt
like it would make me sound smarter.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.800
But now as an adult,

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.100
as a professional writer I realize
what makes you sound smart is

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.820
actually just being clear.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.790
If you can say something as clearly
as possible, as simply as possible,

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.810
that is the best and
smartest way of saying it.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.530
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Have you
ever and a book that I read

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.150
that in a different format,

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.270
the Reading Without
Words is a graphic novel.

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.150
A Graphic March by John Lewis.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.450
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.750
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: About
the civil right.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.050
Oh, you've read it.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.350
Oh, good. Because I had never read.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:33.870
Sorry, Gene.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:35.170
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: [laughs] No.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.110
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I really
read a graphic book.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:42.150
And I thought, oh, and then I got
into it and then I was like wow.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.630
I want volume two and volume three.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.850
And we were thinking and I talk
to you about a graphic book

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.730
about the Library of Congress.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.210
What do you think about that?

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:57.210
Okay. Telling the story of
the Library of Congress.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.890
In graphic format.

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.450
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, I think
that's an amazing book series.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:05.560
March. How many of
you ever read March?

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.560
Awesome. So if you haven't read
it yet, you're in for a treat.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.860
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.160
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Go and
find it at your local library.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.460
I'm sure they'll have it.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.790
Read it. It's a nonfiction
book, so it's about real events.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:17.090
It's an autobiography.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:21.910
It's Congressman John Lewis
writing about his life.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:27.100
I recently visited a museum,
it's called the Tombseum.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.780
It's out of Pittsburgh.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:34.160
And there they have a
focus on comics art.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.980
So it's all these pages
of comic book stories.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.420
It's pages from graphic novels, and
you can see -- it's the originals,

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.190
so you could see how the
artist actually draws.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:47.920
They had an exhibit there,
an old comic book that most

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.710
of us don't remember, but it
was about Martin Luther King Jr.

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:54.860
And it was it was a 22 page comic.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:59.720
John Lewis, Congressman John
Lewis when he was a kid he read

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.440
that comic book, and that comic
book was so influential on him

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.910
that when it came time for
him to tell his own story

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.230
about his own life,
he wanted to tell it

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.670
as a comic book as a comic book.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.670
As a thick comic, as
a graphic novel.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:15.320
So it just goes to show that
even things that seem forgotten

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.830
like that old comic book

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:20.120
about Martin Luther King
Jr., they're not forgotten.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.220
When you tell stories, when
you release your own stories

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.090
into the world, you have
no idea how they're going

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.740
to affect people years
down the road.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And one thing that
you might not know about the Library

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.250
of Congress is that we
have the largest collection

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:39.260
of comic books in the
world right here.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.560
Did you know that?

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.030
The first edition of
Batman, Luke Cage.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:45.330
All of that.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.770
Right here at the Library
of Congress.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:51.400
And we are going to display some
of those things during Awesomecom.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.700
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.000
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's going to be
here in Washington D.C. with movies

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.290
and comics and all of these
types of things, and the Library

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.720
of Congress is going to
be part of Awesomecom.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.020
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's so great.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.320
That's so great.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.620
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So [crosstalk]

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.920
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: There are

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.270
so many reasons why the
Library of Congress is awesome.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.770
Yet another reason, the
largest comic book collection

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.140
in the entire world.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.910
It looks like we're winding
down, so we would like now

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.860
to take questions from all of you.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.490
We have a whole bunch of
students joining us from all

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.080
over the country, and unfortunately
those students are not going

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.380
to be able to ask us questions.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.250
So I want to acknowledge
that they're with us first,

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.010
and then we'll take some questions
from the kids in the room.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:35.790
Okay. So right now we're being
joined by Alderman Elementary,

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:40.230
by Valley Springs Middle School
by Saint Steven's Elementary,

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:45.130
Hopewell Elementary of Trinity,
Jacobs Fork Middle School,

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:51.410
Triad Math and Science Academy,
Saint Ambrose School, Norton High,

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.210
North Columbus Elementary,
The College of Education

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.440
at Governor State University.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.120
And students from D.C. public
schools all around the city.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.420
So thank you all.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.720
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.520
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank
you for joining us.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.110
[ Applause ]

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.410
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
So kids in the room.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:13.120
What kind of questions
can we answer for you?

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.570
Yes.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:19.740
&gt;&gt; Okay. So this question might
sound weird, but is DC Comics is it

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.220
like a building in DC, or
is it just called DC Comics?

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That is not a
weird question at all, because DC --

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.980
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Good.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.280
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: -- name
is super confusing, right.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.580
It's a weird name.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.490
Marvel makes sense, I think.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.690
DC Comics is a little bit weird.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:37.270
DC Comics office building
used to be in New York City.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.690
It was in New York City
for decades and decades.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.660 position:56%
And now it's in Burbank, California,
which is just outside of Hollywood.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.290
I got to visit the DC
Comics office a couple

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:49.310
of times now, and it's
pretty awesome.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.910
You walk into their waiting area.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:55.480
They have giant statues of
Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.780
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.080
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Wearing the
costumes that they'll be wearing

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.030
in the upcoming Justice
League movie.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:04.840 position:56%
They have a chess set in the middle
of the waiting room that has instead

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.870
of the traditional chess pieces,
it's like Superman and Wonder Woman

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:10.660
and Batman and Joker on the
other side, really cool.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.940 position:56%
The name DC Comics it actually comes

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.040
from the very first
comic book series

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.300
that DC Comics ever published.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.590
It was called Detective
Comics that came out in 1939,

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:25.850
so the DC of DC Comics is actually
short for Detective Comics.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.830
Which makes it a really
weird name, right,

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:32.010
because DC Comics then it just
means it's Detective Comics Comics.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:33.310
[ Laughs ]

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.610
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: But
that's just the way it is.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:39.490
DC is as our oldest surviving
comic book company in America.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:44.850
You know, like sometimes stuff from
the olden days a little bit weird.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:47.550
Yes, young lady.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.060
&gt;&gt; Were your comic books --

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:55.940
do you have like a person who
helps you have ideas for them

00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.380
or is it you just by yourself
having the ideas for your books?

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.920
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So the question
is do I just have ideas on my own

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.070
or do I have somebody
helping me with ideas.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.730
And I would say it
depends on the book.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.970
So when I'm writing for DC Comics,

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.060
the stories that I'm writing
are part of a bigger universe.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.600
You know, right now I'm writing
about a character named Ken Enchong

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.080
who is the Chinese Superman.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:24.190
Ken Enchong is in the same universe
as Clark Kent, as Bruce Wayne

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:25.890
as all the other superheroes.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:29.260
So in that case I can't
just have ideas on my own.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.570
I actually have to collaborate

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.860
with other artists and
with other writers.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.980
But then when I write books for my
other publisher for second books,

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.000
most of those are standalone
graphic novels, so they're a story

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.050
with a beginning, middle, and end.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:44.550
And for those I generally
just have ideas out of my own.

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:45.850
Sometimes I'll work with a partner,

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:49.160
but often they'll start
off as just in my own head.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.460
All right.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.050
That sounds like a
question from somebody

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.460
who might be wondering
where ideas come from.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.280
Is that true for you?

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.530
Okay, so I get this question a lot.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:02.500
Kids will sometimes ask me
where my ideas come from.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.690
Often my ideas come
from my own life.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:08.240
You know sometimes if you feel
like you have a creative assignment

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.810
and you don't have any ideas for
it, just think about your own life.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:13.380
Even if your own life seems boring.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.280
I guarantee if you think about
it long enough, it is not.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.270
So for instance the very
first comic I ever did

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:20.790
as an adult is called Gordon
Yamamoto and the Team of the Geeks.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:24.300
It's about a young man who gets a
spaceship stuck inside of his nose,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.370
and becomes friends with the alien
that's living inside of the ship.

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.010
That book is from my own life.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:30.520
[ Laughs ]

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.820
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
I've always had --

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.120
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Too
much [inaudible]

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.420
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
-- sinus problems.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.720
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, okay.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.020
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I've
always had sinus problems

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.320
and one day I thought
what if what was plugging

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.620
up my nose was a spaceship.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.920
Think about your life long enough,

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.610
I guarantee you ideas
are going to come out.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:43.910
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I need them now.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:45.210
Sinus.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.510
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: [laughs] Yes.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:51.720
&gt;&gt; How did you feel when
you released you first book?

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.870
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: How did I feel?

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:58.140
Like the very first book that
I released was in fifth grade.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.440
It was amazing.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.820
&gt;&gt; Like when you were a grown up.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.120
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: As a
grown up the first book

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.330
that I released was Gordon
Yamamoto and the Team of Geeks.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:08.840
I actually self-published that.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.140 position:56%
So I didn't even go for a publisher.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.870
I just got it printed it up
myself and I tried to go to stores

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:16.090
and local comic book
conventions to sell it by hand.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:17.640
And it was great.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.940
It was a lot of work.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.060
It's a lot of work to publish your
own comics, but I remember being

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:27.200
at a comic book convention and
handing that book to somebody

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.270
and having them hand
me a few dollars.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.570
It felt great.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.750
It felt great that somebody
wanted to read my book so much

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.100
that they were willing to
part with $3 bills for it.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.060
It was awesome.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.490
Yes. Young man in the front.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:49.590
&gt;&gt; When did you first make
your first comic book?

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:53.520
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: When
did I make my first comic?

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.770
The very first comic I remember
making was in fifth grade.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.740
The main character was
a rip off of Robin Hood.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:03.930
It was a terrible comic, but
it was still fun to make.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.950
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: [inaudible]
in the middle.

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:11.770
&gt;&gt; Do you have any more copies
of the books that you have

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:13.360
from when you were younger?

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.920
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Do
I have any more copies?

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.270
I'm sure if I went back to
my parents house and I dug

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.120
around I'd be able to find one.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.160
Yeah. Of that fifth grade comic.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.780
I also when I was in
sixth grade I made a comic

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.860
about somebody who sold shoes.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.160
I didn't even know
what I was thinking.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.110
I mean [inaudible] a comic
by somebody who sold shoes,

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:34.640
and I made a comic about do
you know what the Smurfs are?

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.780
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And you
know what the Transformers are?

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.920
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I made a
comic called the Transmurfers

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:46.010
where all the Smurfs would
transform into a robotic fruit.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.500
[ Laughs ]

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.640
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That
was fun to work on.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.000
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.300
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.650
Yes.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:58.320
&gt;&gt; So this isn't really
related to your book,

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.920
but what's your favorite basketball
team, if you like basketball?

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.220
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.680
So the question is what is
my favorite basketball team?

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.100
I want to hear yours.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.400

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.700
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I
want to hear yours.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.000
I come from the Bay Area.

is only one answer, right.

There's only one answer.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.830
I have to go with the Warriors.

Oh, that's foot ball.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.080
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: All right.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.310
How about the young
lady right there.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:32.610
Yeah.

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:34.970
&gt;&gt; What materials do you
use to make your comics?

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.270
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I'm sorry.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:37.570
What was that?

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:38.870
&gt;&gt; What materials do you use?

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:40.170
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: What material.

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:41.470
That's great.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:42.770
Okay. So when I was your age
I read this book called How

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:44.430
to Make Comics The Marvel Way.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:48.000
It was written by Stan Lee
and Stan Lee told me how

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.510
to use a certain set of materials.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.820
Told me I had to use Bristol board.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:57.070
Which is it's like this super thick
white paper, really, really thick.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:59.800
So he told me I had to use
a certain kind of pencil.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.580
He told me I had to use a
brush and a bottle of ink.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.460
So I did. That's how I
started off making comics.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:12.430
Then after I became an adult, after
I started going to conventions

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:14.390
and hanging out with
other cartoonists,

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:18.180
I realized that not everybody
makes comics the Marvel way.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.290
Almost every cartoonist you
talk to they will have figured

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.730
out their own set of materials.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:25.670
So if you want to make
comics, if you want to make art

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.200
in general, you should experiment.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.290
You should figure out what
materials feel best for you.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:34.880
Right now I am using a regular
number two pencil to draw.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.330
I'm using what's called a blue
pencil to do my sketching.

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:41.270
It's a certain shade of blue called
non-photo blue and I no longer ink

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:43.170
with a brush and a ball of ink.

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:45.910
I actually ink with
a Japanese brush pen.

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:50.430
So I don't need that
bottle of ink anymore.

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:52.860
Yes, young lady with the headband.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:56.990
&gt;&gt; What is your Chinese name?

00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:59.030
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: My Chinese name.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:03.890
So my Chinese name is my
American name is a transliteration

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.190
of my Chinese name.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.650
Meaning my parents
picked my American name

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:08.350
because it sounded kind
of like my Chinese name.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:11.860
So my American name
is Gene Luan Yang.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.140
My Chinese name is Young Gene Luan.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:20.210
Now that middle character Gene has
an interesting story behind it.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:25.700
You know, it's a it's a Chinese
tradition to give the gift of gold

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.850
to babies when they're first born.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:31.570
So when I was first born I got
all this gold from my relatives.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:36.160
And then after I became an
adult my mom gave me this gold.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.320
So when I got this gold as
an adult I looked through it.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.940
And on one of these little
plates it had my name.

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.430
It had Yang Gene Luan,

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:45.400
but the middle character Gene
was a different character.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.970
It sounded the same, but it
was a totally different word.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:50.930
And I was like, I was like,
you know, my aunt who gave this

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:52.230
to me she didn't even know my name.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.150
She got my name wrong.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:56.890
And my mom said, "No,
she didn't get it wrong.

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.140
That was your actual name
when you were first born."

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:00.440
So I said, "Okay.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.740
So what does this Gene mean?"

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.850
And she says, "That
Gene means splendid."

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:06.210
And I said, "It means splendid?

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:08.010
You named me Splendid,
why did you change that?"

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.380
[ Laughs ]

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.070
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And she
said, "Well, after you turn one

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:16.560
and you started walking around
you kept hitting your head.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.840
So we changed it to another
Gene, which means careful."

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:26.060
So that's what my name
means now [laughs].

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.400
It means careful.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.700
Yes.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.000
&gt;&gt; How many comics have
you made since you started?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.300
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
So the question is,

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.160
how many comics have I
made since I started?

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.890
I have made a lot.

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:38.050 position:56%
It's actually kind of hard to count.

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:39.590
I did ten issues of Superman.

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:42.770
I'm working on issue number
13 of the new Superman,

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.270
so right there I've done 23
issues for DC Comics and then

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.120
for a first second I've done a lot.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:52.430
I may be done I don't
know 12, 12 books now.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:56.980
And then I've also worked on the
Avatar last air bender comics.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:00.120
I did 15 volumes of that so far.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.730
So I've done a lot.

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:03.030
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I've done a lot.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:11.890
Yes, the man in the -- oh, yeah.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:14.790
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
book, comic book?

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:16.090
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:17.620
So my favorite book
when I was a kid.

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:22.600
I'm really sad that it's
been a little bit forgotten.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.900
So I want you all to try
to read this book today.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:29.150
Okay. I love the book of three.

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.440
It's a series of books
by Lloyd Alexander.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.740
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.040
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
They were my favorite.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.340
As a librarian.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.550
You must have seen that
go out a lot, right?

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:38.850
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Lord.

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:40.150
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Like my
generation loved that book.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:41.510
It seems like --

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:42.810
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's been lost.

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:44.110
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's
been a little bit lost.

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:45.410
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Really.

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.710
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I'm
trying to bring it back.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:48.010
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Good.

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.310
[ Laughs ]

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:50.610
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: [Inaudible]
Alexander, classic.

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:51.910
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah
I love [inaudible].

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:53.210
And then in terms of
comic books, you know,

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.520
March is a really great comic book.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.570
You all ought to read that.

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:58.700
There's just a ton of
comic books that I love.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.770
I don't know if I can
pick one favorite.

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:03.050
I really do love Mouse though.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.590
It's a little bit older.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.010
It's a nonfiction book
about the Holocaust.

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:10.070
It's a really sad and
heart wrenching book,

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:12.120
but I think it's really
[inaudible] done.

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.190
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
then I have a question.

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:17.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Oh, go ahead.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.220
Yeah.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:24.340
&gt;&gt; What was the first
book that the Library

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.680
of Congress had in their library?

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.980
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
That's a great question.

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.280
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.580
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
I want to know too.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.010
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I don't know.

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.310
[ Laughs ]

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:34.610
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The
first book there were

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:40.490
about two or 300 books in 1800.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:45.150
And they were, the library was
actually part of the capital.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.170
And they had books like the
Bible, and some other books

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:51.520
that they thought that it would
be good in dictionaries and things

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.150
that they thought it would
be good for Congress.

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:56.030
But thank you for asking that,
because I'm going to find

00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:58.810
out what was the very first book

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:00.940
that someone purchased
for the library.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.240
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's great.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.810
Well, can you give
us some highlights,

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:05.580
some of the highlights
of the collection?

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:06.880
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, my goodness.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.180
Highlights.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:13.010
Well, you have books that
go back to the 12th century.

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:16.380
You have the first
Bible right outside here

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:20.420
that was ever printed with type.

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:24.560
So the Gutenberg Bible,
that was something 1500.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:30.190
And then you have books that are
you would call them graphic now.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:35.540
Audubon books with the beautiful
birds and all types of things.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:39.420 position:56%
It's just there's so many things
that's what's so wonderful about it.

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.720
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.020
It's a magical place.

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.320
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.620
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Turning
lane feel the magic,

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.920
right, sitting in this room?

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.320
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well,
we were stomping around.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.420
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:52.050
[laughs] So, young man in the red.

00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:56.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, so earlier you were
telling me my friends about Frogman.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:57.450
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Oh, yeah.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:58.750
&gt;&gt; So [inaudible] about Frogman.

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:00.050
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Frogman.

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:01.350
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:02.650
So earlier we were hanging out

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:03.950
and they were asking me what
my favorite superhero was

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:05.290
and Frogmen is definitely one
of my favorite superheroes is.

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:09.250
He's an obscure character
from the Marvel Universe.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.470
And he doesn't have
any super powers.

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:15.700
He just wears a costume that
makes him look like a frog.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:19.590
So his whole thing is this,
his whole thing is this.

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:25.240
He is the son of a super
villain named the Leap Frog.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:29.390
Who use his frog suit to go and
rob banks, and then he finds

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:32.060
out that his dad is this criminal
and he feels really bad about it.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.130
So he steals the suit from his dad

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:37.430
and becomes a superhero
called frogmen.

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:39.140
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
these super powers are?

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:41.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: His super power
is at the bottom of his suit on each

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:46.630
of his feet are giant springs,
so he could just jump around,

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:48.510
and that's his whole power.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.140
[ Laughs ]

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.440
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm learning a lot.

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.240
[ Laughs ]

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.210
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's true.

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:58.510
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:02.840
&gt;&gt; Do you write and illustrate your
books or does somebody else do it?

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.140
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Do I write
and illustrate my books?

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.440
It depends on the book.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.220
So there are some books where I do
both the writing and the drawing

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.560
and there are other books
where I only do the writing

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.860
and somebody else does the drawing.

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.130
I work with a friend of
mine who does the drawing.

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:15.920
So it depends on the book.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.590
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So we have time
for a couple more questions.

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:19.890
One more question.

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:21.190
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
One more question.

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:22.490
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh my.

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:23.790
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
One more question.

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:26.140
Okay. So how about the gentlemen
in the glasses, sunglasses.

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.940
&gt;&gt; Do you prefer Marvel
or DC Comics?

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.470
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I want to
hear -- I like to hear your.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:33.260
Do you have any answer to this.

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.560
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: No.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.860
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Dr. Hayden.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:37.870
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm just
getting into it between Frog Man,

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:44.160
Jeff the Weirdo and some of the
others I have to start reading

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.300
and this is going to be
my reading without walls.

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.840
I'm going to get into
real comic books.

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.140
That's my pledge.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:52.440
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I'm going
to have to send [inaudible]

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:55.760
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm going to read
and this is my reading challenge.

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.990
I'm going to and it's going
to be fun, because I'm going

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:00.170
to in the comic store
and they're going to say,

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.010
"What is she doing in here."

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:03.310
[ Laughs ]

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:04.760
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And I'm going to
go in the comic store and I'm going

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.460
to pick out some Marvel Comics.

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:08.280
Any suggestions besides --

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.540
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: For
Marvel Comics, Ms Marvel.

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:14.030
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Ms Marvel.

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:15.830
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Ms. Marvel is great.

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:17.130
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Cool.

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:18.430
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:19.730
It's a Muslim American young girl.

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:21.030
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Who has the
power to make any part of her body

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:23.630
as big or small she wants.

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:24.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, I can use that.

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:26.230
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's
super big, it's awesome.

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:27.530
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Or super small.

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:28.830
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And
then totally awesome hulk.

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.130
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:31.430
And then DC Comics.

00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:34.950
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And then
DC, Batgirl is amazing.

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:36.250
It's awesome.

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:38.720
Batgirl, a wonderful comic and
Supergirl is also one of them.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.020
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.660
So do they have any
librarian comic characters?

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:43.620
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Are there
any librarian comic characters.

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:48.860
There was one called the answer,
which is about a librarian

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.590
who becomes best friends
with a superhero.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:53.280
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm going
to look for that one too.

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.580
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.880
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So that's
my reading without walls.

00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:59.890
I pledge that I will go
and get some real comics.

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:01.190
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's great.

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:02.490
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: My
questions for you --

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:03.790
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's great.

00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:05.090
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: -- you talked --

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:06.390
when we talk graphic novels,
what about nonfiction.

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.900
What do you call them, because
the novel seems to be fiction.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.200
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.500
I [inaudible]

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.870
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So a book
like March is graphic book?

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:16.170
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, I agree.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:20.420
I agree. So to answer that young
lady's question for me now a days

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.140
because I write for DC,
I'm kind of a DC guy.

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.940
But when I was a kid,
when I was your age,

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.120
I read more Marvel than DC.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.780
But the term graphic novel is
a little bit clumsy, right.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.350 position:56%
Because we use it to describe things

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:35.190
that actually aren't
novels at all, like March.

00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:36.490
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:37.790
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: March is --

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:39.090
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Is real.

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:40.390
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: -- not a novel.

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:41.690
It's nonfiction, it's
an autobiography.

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:42.990
The New York Times deals with this

00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:44.290
by calling them graphic books
instead of gothic novels.

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:45.590
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:46.890
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: But I do think
that the term "graphic novel,"

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:49.580
even though it's a little
bit, it's a little bit weird.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.670
It refers to a publishing format.

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.970
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.270
