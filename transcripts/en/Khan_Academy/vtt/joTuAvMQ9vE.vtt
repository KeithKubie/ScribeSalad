00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:01.665
- [Instructor] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:04.935
Today, we're gonna talk about
the confusion that happens

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:06.992
between these three homophones,

00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:10.367
these three words that
sound exactly the same.

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:14.534
The preposition to, the
number two and the adverb too.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.668
Now these words all sound very similar.

00:00:18.668 --> 00:00:20.535
In fact, they sound exactly the same.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.511
If I were to write this out phonetically,

00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:24.939
here is what I would do.

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:25.905
That's how you'd write it

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:27.561
in the international phonetic alphabet

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:28.774
for every pronunciation.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.023
You say that word, tu.

00:00:30.023 --> 00:00:31.287
You say that word, tu.

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:32.905
You say that word, tu.

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:35.385
If you were looking
this up in a dictionary,

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.313
that's how you would render
this spelling phonetically.

00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:40.063
That's the sound of those words.

00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:41.588
They all sound exactly the same.

00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:44.229
So what we need to do
is come up with a way

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.436
to keep them all separate.

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:47.812
And the way I'm going to do that

00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:51.697
is with the prince of foods, the pizza.

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:53.636
Let's just call that a pizza.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:56.136
Now, to, T-O, is a preposition

00:00:57.414 --> 00:00:59.303
and so that means that it's expressing

00:00:59.303 --> 00:01:03.722
some kind of relationship
in time and space.

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:04.976
In this case we can say,

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:06.708
one of its many, many meanings

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:09.853
is that it means it's
moving towards something.

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:11.103
So for example,

00:01:12.047 --> 00:01:15.739
I am headed to Frank Cerisano's Pizzeria.

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:18.587
Right, so we can see in
context this is intentional,

00:01:18.587 --> 00:01:22.927
it's in motion and that's why
we'd wanna use a preposition.

00:01:22.927 --> 00:01:23.989
Where am I going?

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:26.755
To Frank Cerisano's Pizzeria.

00:01:26.755 --> 00:01:30.654
Next, T-W-O, also pronounced
tu, you're welcome,

00:01:30.654 --> 00:01:32.393
is a number.

00:01:32.393 --> 00:01:33.886
It's this thing

00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:35.612
so we'd use this mostly as an adjective

00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:37.517
to describe how many things there are.

00:01:37.517 --> 00:01:40.286
So I would say, at the pizzeria,

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:44.711
I ordered two pizzas
and ate them by myself.

00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:47.218
Right, so when we're talking
about the number of things,

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:50.441
you wanna use T-W-O.

00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:54.443
And finally we have T-O-O,
too, which is an adverb

00:01:54.443 --> 00:01:56.204
and they can either mean

00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:59.454
an over abundance of something or also.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.426
Let me give you examples
for both of those cases.

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:09.147
So example case number
one, the excessive amount.

00:02:09.147 --> 00:02:12.064
I ate too much pizza, I feel awful.

00:02:13.315 --> 00:02:14.814
Now some of you may take issue with that

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:16.682
because you don't believe
that there is such a thing

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:19.289
as too much pizza, I understand.

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.392
So that's our excessive amount,

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:24.189
that's just mountains
and mountains of pizza

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.120
more than one person can
or should reasonably eat.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.006
That's that definition.

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.138
And then there is the in
addition or also meaning

00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:36.374
so my sister wanted pizza too,

00:02:36.374 --> 00:02:37.843
but because of my greed,

00:02:37.843 --> 00:02:40.233
she did not get any, sorry Julie.

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:41.816
Oh, I made her cry.

00:02:42.903 --> 00:02:45.767
So in order to keep these three

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:47.456
very similar sounding words straight,

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:48.947
here's what you need to remember.

00:02:48.947 --> 00:02:52.861
To, T-O, is a preposition
that means towards something.

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:55.739
I am headed to Frank Cerisano's Pizzeria.

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.822
T-W-O, the number two, is a number

00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:01.363
so you'd say I ordered two pizzas.

00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:03.784
Finally, T-O-O the adverb

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:07.532
means either there's an over
abundance, there's too much,

00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:11.115
or in addition, my
sister wanted pizza too.

00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:15.742
So grammarians, I say unto
you, remember the pizza.

00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:17.007
You can learn anything.

00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:17.840
David out.
