00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.260
[whip cracks four times]

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.320
The really surprising thing about a whip,
the first time you hear one cracking,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.150
is just how incredibly loud it is.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.240
And what's more spectacular is the fact that

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.640
all of the noise comes from the very tip of
the cracker on the whip.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.060
This little bit of fluffy string here.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.760
You'd think that it wouldn't be able to do
anything

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.360
but that's where all the noise comes from.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.320
And the key to how a whip works is all down
to something called

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.969
the conservation of energy.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.920
So OK, this is how you crack a whip.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
This is your basic overhead cattleman's crack.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.620
You start with the whip held loosely in your
hand

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.859
with the length of the whip behind you.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.420
And then you bring the arm up. You pause momentarily.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.709
Go back. And then you flip it forward and
that's when you get the crack.

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:56.089
And the point is that what you've done is,
you've put a u-bend into the whip.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.519
So when your arm comes forward like this

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.170
your arms is stationary. OK?

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.850
So I've done that. The bottom is stationary.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.570
And all of the top of the whip is moving forwards.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.970
So because it's moving it's got movement energy.
It's got kinetic energy.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.690
And kinetic energy depends on two things -

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.510
the mass of the thing moving and the velocity
it's moving at.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.120
Now the interesting thing about the top of
the whip is that

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.550
as the whip sort of uncoils itself like this,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.890
the bit that's moving, because this bit is
now all stationary,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.420
gets shorter and shorter.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.640
So the mass of the moving part of the whip
right until you get to the end

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.020
and this tiny little bit of string at the
end, which weighs virtually nothing,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.200
flips over.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.580
So the mass gets less and less, but the kinetic
energy stays the same

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.820
because of the laws of conservation of energy.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.940
So if the mass gets less the velocity has
to go up.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.640
As you crack the whip, like this, you start
out,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.450
and my arm is moving at about 10 metres per
second. I've measured it.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.959
And you end up with the tip of the whip moving
at over 900mph.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.790
Now to explain that I need the aid of an assistant
- a rubber duck.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.540
In this case called Quack.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.260
So imagine that Quack is sitting in a pond.
And for this thought experiment,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.240
your viewpoint is way up there vertically
above him looking down at the duck.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.460
So when Quack goes bob, and makes a little
ripple,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.799
that ripple is a ring that spreads out around
the duck in a circle.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.159
And Quack the duck goes bob once a second.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.590
So every second it makes a ripple which spreads
out.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.100
So what you see from above is a series of
concentric circles.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.080
Now imagine that Quack the duck starts to
swim forwards.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.620
And it swims forwards at the same speed

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.700
as the ripples move across the surface of
the water.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.939
So that it goes bob, makes a ripple,

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.389
and then swims forward at the same speed as
the ripple.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.200
So it keeps up with the ripple and then it
goes bob again and makes a second ripple.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.870
So now you have two ripples in front of the
duck. On top of each other.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.209
And behind they get spaced out more and more.

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.800
And it keeps swimming and each time it goes
bob,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.360
the ripple in front of it gets bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.160
And if the duck actually swims faster than
the ripple,

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.999
it goes through that big sort of super-ripple
in front of it

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:33.790
and you get what's known as a wake behind
it.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.500
Sort of a V-shaped wave behind it.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.860
Now exactly the same thing happens with the
tip of the whip.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.960
Because the whip makes a little bit of noise
as it goes through the air.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.760
[soft whistly noise]

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.600
Just a little sort of whiftly noise.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.280
[soft whistly noise]

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.040
And that whifly noise is a sound wave.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.880
So that sound wave is coming from here and
it's travelling at 730 odd miles an hour.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.360
But because this whip tip is moving at 900mph
it's moving faster.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.980
So the same thing happens as happened with
Quack the duck.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.280
The sound wave in front of the whip tip builds
up and up and gets louder and louder

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.010
and bigger and bigger and louder.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.440
So what you're actually listening to when
you hear a whip crack is a sonic boom.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.240
There is in fact something else going on.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.660
When it's moving at 900mph what you actually
get to hear is a cavitation bubble collapse.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.750
Woah!

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.370
So what's happening is the whip tip is now
moving so fast through the air

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.400
that the air doesn't have time to go back
round

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.070
and fill in the gap behind the moving whip
tip.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.380
So you get a little bubble of vacuum forming,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.100
And the sound you're hearing, a very faint
sound,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.200
but magnified because it's going faster than
the speed of sound,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.260
is the sound of that tiny bubble, plop, collapsing
back on itself.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.540
This is a wonderful piece of science all down
to the conservation of energy.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.520
[whip crack]

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.200
So knowing how a whip works and understanding
the physics and the science behind it

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.980
doesn't make it any less terrifying when you're
on the business end of it.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.680
You ready? 
- Yep.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.580
You'd say that.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.360
Here we go.
