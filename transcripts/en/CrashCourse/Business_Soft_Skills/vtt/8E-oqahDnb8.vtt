00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.091
Back before telegraphs, telephones, or the
Internet, the handwritten word was where it

00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:11.091
was at.

00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:16.040
Letters took weeks to arrive, and people wrote
pages and pages to one another in flowery

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.850
language. They used to describe EVERYTHING.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.200
Today, we have more rapid communication, but
we’re still flooded with writing. Texts.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.779
Emails. Memos. We even cut out words with
emojis.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.960
With this constant flow of information, it’s
easy for people to get overwhelmed.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.021
So, how do you make sure that your email doesn’t
get lost in the morning sludge pile? That

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:42.790
your memo gets its point across to the right
people? That your report tells the story you

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.280
intended?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.000
I’m Evelyn from the Internets. And this
is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:56.540
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.330
Writing plays a big part in building your
professional reputation.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.790
Whether it’s a quick message asking for
a sick day, a letter to a client, or a report

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.880
that could fast-track you for a promotion,
you want to make sure that what you’ve written

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.170
is persuasive.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.110
Before you type a single word, remember that
the content and structure of your writing

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.670
all depends on who you’re writing for.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.240
This goes back to influence. You can’t expect
to convince anyone of anything if you don’t

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.310
understand what their needs are.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.840
That’s why it’s important to conduct an
audience analysis.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.880
You want to tailor your main message to who
they are and how much they’re going to critique

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.880
your work.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.240
If your audience is more involved, they’ll
need more evidence and logic. If your audience

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.000
is less involved, they’ll respond more to
emotional appeal.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.530
Crafting a persuasive argument goes back to
the foundations of rhetoric. Logos, ethos,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.060
and pathos. We could do a whole episode on
these, but we don’t have that kind of time.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.150
So, boiled down, logos is an appeal to knowledge,
or facts.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.080
Ethos is an appeal to the character, authority,
or reputation of the speaker.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.310
And pathos is an appeal to emotion, or humanity.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.300
If The Doctor were trying to convince aliens
not to destroy Earth, she could use logos

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.280
by explaining factual reasons why Earth isn’t
a threat, ethos by using the power of her

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.819
name to inspire awe, and pathos by talking
about the human spirit and the power of kindness.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.940
By connecting to your audience, you draw them
into your message. So it’s important to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.760
figure out how involved they are to know which
elements you should use.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.010
And there are three questions you can ask
to figure it out.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.250
First, does your audience think you’re credible?

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.540
This has to do with your reputation -- remember
how trust is the foundation for business skills?

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.650
It matters whether people think you know what
you’re talking about.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.580
If someone already trusts you, they’ll be
less involved and you won’t need to justify

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.860
your message as much.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.120
Say you’re trying to convince a client to
reassess their social media marketing strategy.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.550
If you’re a fifth year associate with a
killer Instagram and YouTube channel, you’ll

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.180
make a case much more easily than a summer
intern in the accounting department.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.900
Next, how important is the decision to them?

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.840
If your message is going to directly impact
someone, or if there’s risk, they’ll probably

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.970
be more involved.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.040
A suggestion about where your company should
open a second office would need way more detail

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.460
than where your coworkers should go for happy
hour. [Gotta keep your enthusiasm for tex-mex

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.460
casual and brief!]

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.460
Finally, are they hostile or resistant to
what you’re saying?

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.660
A hostile audience doesn’t mean they’re
out to get you.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.230
It just means that they may be more involved
and less receptive to your idea, because it

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.410
might conflict with their current beliefs.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.480
Think about the trust you have with someone,
and frame your message around it.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.670
Like, say you were trying to convince two
roommates to let you get a cat.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.980
One likes cats, so you could straight-up tell
her how happy a cat would make both of you.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.610
But the other isn't an animal person. So it
might make sense to describe problems a cat

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.730
could help with, like, "I know you’ve been
worried about rats in our apartment building.”

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.550
And you might need to address concerns, like,
"don't worry, you wouldn't have to take care

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.489
of it, and I'd get one that's hypoallergenic."

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.610
Considering your audience is clearly important
for the message, but it can also help you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.870
figure out the type of thing to write.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.959
Every workplace is a little different, so
we can’t tell you exactly what to expect.

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.020
But generally, many offices use some messaging
app, like Slack, to communicate quickly.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.849
An email can be used to get across day-to-day
stuff or request further information.

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:21.880
Memos are generally one page or less. And
they’re used to convey important or official

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.289
information to internal sources -- like
other departments.

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.259
Letters are similar to memos, but they’re
used with external sources, like other companies

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:31.860
or potential investors.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.889
Reports are generally thicker and usually
contain a summary page, discussion, and charts

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.069
or graphs. [If you want to have a really wild
weekend, you can browse through hundreds of

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.559
reports on pretty much any government website.]

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:48.440
But no matter what you’re writing, you want
to give your audience the essential details.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.620
To see what I mean, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.900
Imagine you were a freelance food blogger
writing about a new restaurant in town that

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.529
claims to make a mean burger.

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:02.259
You’d start by sharing when you went -- last
Tuesday, on a quiet night out. You’d describe

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.900
the cozy diner vibe with retro booths. You
might list the most mouthwatering menu items,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.560
including the special burger of the day and
creamy shake you ordered. And then you’d

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.759
wrap it up with a solid four-star rating.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.300
You’re probably dealing with foodies searching
for up-and-coming hotspots, or fellow millennials

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.509
looking for a cheap meal and a killer ‘gram.
So weaving a detailed narrative gives your

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.589
audience everything they might want to know!

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:28.969
But let’s say you were managing a small
chain restaurant and needed to let your boss

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.580
know about a new competitor. That’s a different
story.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.870
Would you write up your elaborate personal
experience? No.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.449
General managers only spend anywhere from
10 to 25% of their day working alone at their

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.939
desks. Which means they might not have time
to read all those details.

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:52.229
In corporate writing, the name of the game
is: Efficiency. Efficiency. Efficiency. So…

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.580
watch for redundancy.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.629
You can also try to answer the 5W’s and
the H.

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.379
Who does this information affect?

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.460
What is your main point?

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.789
When does this information matter?

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:06.139
Where should you pass it on?

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:07.740
Why is it important?

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.620
And How should you move forward?

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.330
So, this new burger place is pretty important
news, but it’s more casual than official

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.520
information. So maybe not a memo.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.759
You don’t need graphs of sauce ratios or
delivery speeds, so a report would be overkill.

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.789
But you could write a concise email sharing
that a competing burger restaurant with an

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.520
extensive menu opened one week ago. They pose
a threat because your repeat sales have been

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.719
declining. And you recommend talking about
sending coupons in weekly mailers to increase

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:37.719
business.

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.250
Clear, concise writing ensures that your boss
has time to read it, and your effort doesn’t

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.120
go to waste.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.360
Thanks, Thought Bubble! Writing directly is
often trickier than it sounds. Thankfully,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.669
there are a few easy things you can work on
to limit your word count, but not your impact.

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.099
First, identify your argument.

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:59.979
Your argument is your main point. What are
you trying to say or get people to do?

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:05.669
If I wanted someone to invest in my cute cupcakery,
an argument might be that small cakes make

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.149
people happy, and everyone deserves a little
more joy in their lives.

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:13.300
You can try jotting down 2 or 3 of your key
points before you start writing to stay

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.300
on track.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.059
That can also help you make sure that what
you’re sending has a purpose. No one wants

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:21.389
to read an email that really has no point.
This is not a vent session, okay?

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.060
Second, don’t bury your lede.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.849
If I’m trying to make some quick blueberry
muffins to start my day, I want that recipe

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.009
in front
of me. Some of us do not have the time to

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:36.199
read about your journey to find free-range
eggs and pick blueberries on a farm, Karen!

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.830
So whether you’re writing a one-page memo
or a ten-page report, be sure to emphasize

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:46.199
your key points up front. It will save your
readers valuable time. And in the business

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.809
world, time is money.

00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:53.050
But again! Here’s the tricky thing about
this series. This advice isn’t one-size-fits-all.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.000
Remember when we mentioned how your audience
can be hostile? If what you’re saying might

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.330
not be taken well, you might want to share
supporting facts before your main conclusion.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.999
So, if you were trying to convince zombies
to stop eating brains, you wouldn’t start

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:10.310
off your letter by saying it’s bad for humans.
[They don’t care!]

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.759
Instead, you could start by listing the benefits
of another food source, like pizza.

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:19.780
It’s quick and delicious.
95% of surveyed zombies like pepperoni.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.379
And making pizza involves less time and risk
than attacking people.

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:28.159
Then, you can end with your logical conclusion
that eating humans is, in fact, not worth

00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:29.220
the effort.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:35.110
Third, avoid uncertain language like ‘maybe,
‘I think,’ ‘in my opinion,’ ‘it

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.060
seems like,’ or ‘it might be.’

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:42.570
Remember what we said about emotional influence:
confidence is key. Confidently explaining

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.780
your point will make your business writing
more persuasive.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:51.310
You can also do this by using active voice.
Put your subject before your verb and limit

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.870
your use of ‘to be’s’.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.780
Instead of saying, ‘A new dietary choice
of freshly prepared pizza will be preferred

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:03.180
to human material,’ you would say ‘Zombies
prefer deliveries from Tony’s, over actually

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.250
eating Tony.’

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.990
Fourth, what you write is always more important
than how you format, but it’s worth mentioning.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.380
You know in Star Wars movies, how they have
that super long wall of text at the beginning?

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.560
It’s cool in theaters. Not the workplace.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.560
At some point, we’ve all seen long, bulky
paragraphs and thought, “Ugh. I have to

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.570
read THAT?!” So use headers to divide your
writing into smaller, manageable chunks.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.770
And finally, check for typos.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:35.000
Proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation
show that you’re competent and can be trusted.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.470
Typos and grammatical errors don’t. Especially
if you mess up someone’s name.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.320
And don’t just rely on word processing software.
It doesn’t always catch common errors like

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.490
they’re, there, and their.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.410
Plus, it can’t check for meaning. So a
sentence like “I read thorough our paste

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.100
budget reports.” might get through, even
though it’s not coherent.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:59.450
So read your work at least twice! Even better,
give it to someone else to proofread.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:04.611
When checking for typos, it’s also important
to look for acronyms or initialisms. Just

00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:09.170
because your company uses something all the
time, it doesn’t mean everyone else understands

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.170
it.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.820
Think about the number of times The Doctor
has explained the T.A.R.D.I.S. [Time and Relative

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.050
Dimension in Space. Just like a deceptively
small .zip file, it’s bigger on the inside.]

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.910
And now. W. C. E. F. T. [*pause*]

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.740
That means We’ve Covered Everything For
Today. [See what I did there? Explaining acronyms?

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.390
That’s why I’m the host.]

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.500
We’ve talked about a lot of ways to make
sure your writing packs a punch. So, if you

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.060
remember nothing else from this episode:

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.520
Your audience is the key to what you write
and how you write it.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.620
Substance matters more than formatting. It
doesn’t matter how nice your work looks

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.190
if it doesn’t make a point.
Double check your work for spelling, grammar,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.610
and miscommunications.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:56.630
Writing is just part of communication, though.
Next time, we’ll get into verbal communication

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.820
to help you nail public speeches and morning
meetings, so you’re not just the person
