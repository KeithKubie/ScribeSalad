00:00:13.897 --> 00:00:16.961
To me, social justice is a simple concept.

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:19.422
It's the notion
that all people in a society

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:24.794
deserve fair and equitable rights,
opportunities and access to resources.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.311
But it's become
controversial and nebulous,

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:29.768
because we've stopped talking

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:33.438
about what working
for social justice actually looks like.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.692
Working for social justice
can look like this ...

00:00:37.592 --> 00:00:38.742
or this.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:40.723
It can look like this ...

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:43.194
or it can look like this ...

00:00:43.218 --> 00:00:45.117
or my favorite ...

00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:46.981
it can look like that.

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:48.782
Those are my students,

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:53.037
and whenever I'm asked to articulate
my work or my priorities as a teacher,

00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:58.167
I explain that I believe education
can be a tool for social justice.

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:02.925
But a few months ago, I logged
onto Twitter -- as I do --

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.947
and I saw that a fellow teacher
had taken issue with that belief.

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:11.939
"Teachers," he said,
"should not be social justice warriors,

00:01:11.963 --> 00:01:14.942
because the purpose
of education is to educate."

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.965
And he ended his argument by saying,

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:20.024
"I teach my subject."

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:23.689
But I reject that simplification,

00:01:23.713 --> 00:01:26.958
because teachers
don't just teach subjects,

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:28.213
we teach people.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.433
When our students
walk into our classrooms,

00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:34.631
they bring their identities with them.

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:39.060
Everything they experience in our rooms
is bound up in historical context,

00:01:39.084 --> 00:01:42.613
and so if we insist that education
happens in a vacuum,

00:01:42.637 --> 00:01:44.621
we do our students a disservice.

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:48.281
We teach them that education
doesn't really matter,

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:51.411
because it's not relevant
to what's happening all around them.

00:01:52.468 --> 00:01:54.240
And what's happening all around them?

00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.942
Well, racism for one.

00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:00.347
According to results
of the Implicit Association Test,

00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:06.655
fully 88 percent of white people harbored
subconscious biases against black people,

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.461
believing them to be less intelligent,
lazier and more dangerous than whites.

00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:16.302
And that's just one concrete example
of the insidious effects

00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:19.462
of historic and systemic racism
on our country.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.309
For more evidence,
we could look at incarceration rates;

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.631
we could look at statistics on police
violence against black people;

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:29.091
we could look at the opportunity
gap in education --

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:33.216
so yeah, social justice
belongs in our schools.

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.856
Social justice should be a part
of the mission of every school

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.025
and every teacher in America,

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.882
if we want "liberty and justice for all"
to be more than a slogan ...

00:02:45.176 --> 00:02:50.213
because schools are crucial places
for children to become active citizens

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:54.410
and to learn the skills and the tools
that they need to change the world.

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:56.121
So what are those skills?

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.103
OK, here's a secret:

00:02:58.127 --> 00:02:59.927
many of the skills that people need

00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.029
to orchestrate the kinds of change
that will lead to justice

00:03:03.053 --> 00:03:05.515
are already built
into the work of schools.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.854
Things like problem-solving,

00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:10.195
critical thinking,
collaboration, perseverance --

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.769
none of that should be
revolutionary on its own.

00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:16.578
Combine that with the ability
to understand history

00:03:16.602 --> 00:03:21.548
not as one static and objective narrative
on which we all agree,

00:03:21.572 --> 00:03:24.272
but as a series of intertwined events

00:03:24.296 --> 00:03:26.998
about which there can be
countless interpretations.

00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:30.852
If we deliberately choose
to explore history with our students

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.666
rather than just teach it,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.456
we help them understand
that history is ongoing

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.892
and that it's connected
to current movements for justice.

00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:41.666
And we help them see themselves
as potential players

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.444
within a living history.

00:03:44.694 --> 00:03:46.655
So those are the skills I'm talking about

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:48.791
when I say that education can be a place

00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:51.211
to help kids learn
how to work for justice.

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:53.862
But maybe the reason

00:03:53.886 --> 00:03:57.033
that my Twitter critic
wasn't happy with that idea

00:03:57.057 --> 00:03:59.925
is because he doesn't agree
with my definition of justice.

00:04:00.496 --> 00:04:01.672
Fair enough.

00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:04.064
Maybe he and I don't see
eye to eye, politically.

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:06.373
But here's the thing:

00:04:06.397 --> 00:04:11.194
our aim is to encourage students
to articulate their own opinions,

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:13.661
not to coerce them into agreeing with us,

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:16.700
so it actually doesn't matter
if he and I agree.

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:20.464
What matters is that we're helping
students have those conversations

00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:21.638
with each other.

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:23.456
And that means that as adults,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.542
we need to learn how to become
effective facilitators

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.187
of our students' activism.

00:04:28.576 --> 00:04:32.084
We've got to help them learn
how to have really tricky conversations,

00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:35.300
we have to expose them
to different opinions,

00:04:35.324 --> 00:04:37.301
and we have to help them see

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:40.490
how what they're learning in school
connects to the world outside.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.758
So here's an example of that.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:46.275
Every year, my students study
the history of apartheid in South Africa

00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:48.169
as a case study of injustice.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.465
Now for those of you who don't know,

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.586
apartheid was a brutally racist system,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.030
and the white-ruled government
in South Africa imposed racist laws

00:04:56.054 --> 00:04:57.853
to oppress people of color,

00:04:57.877 --> 00:05:01.883
and if you resisted those laws,
you risked jail time, violence or death.

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:06.393
And around the world,
other countries' governments,

00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:08.502
including ours in the United States,

00:05:08.526 --> 00:05:11.623
hesitated to sanction
South Africa, because ...

00:05:11.647 --> 00:05:12.798
well ...

00:05:12.822 --> 00:05:14.554
we benefited from its resources.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:19.539
So in 1976, the South African
government passed a new law

00:05:19.563 --> 00:05:22.032
which required that all students
in South Africa

00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:24.204
learn in the language Afrikaans,

00:05:24.228 --> 00:05:25.606
which was a white language,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.202
and many black South Africans
referred to that language

00:05:28.226 --> 00:05:30.176
as the language of the oppressor.

00:05:30.784 --> 00:05:31.935
So not surprisingly,

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.096
students of color
were outraged at this law.

00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:37.217
They already attended segregated schools

00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:39.296
with overcrowded classrooms,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.684
a lack of resources

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:42.791
and a frankly racist curriculum,

00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:44.584
and now they were being told to learn

00:05:44.608 --> 00:05:47.696
in a language neither they
nor their teachers spoke.

00:05:48.652 --> 00:05:52.270
So on the morning of June 16, 1976,

00:05:52.294 --> 00:05:55.281
thousands of kids
from the township of Soweto

00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:56.863
walked out of schools.

00:05:56.887 --> 00:06:00.402
And they marched peacefully
through the streets to protest the law.

00:06:01.384 --> 00:06:04.193
At an intersection,
they met up with the police,

00:06:04.217 --> 00:06:06.371
and when the kids refused to turn back,

00:06:06.395 --> 00:06:08.767
the police officers set dogs on them ...

00:06:09.888 --> 00:06:11.426
and then they opened fire ...

00:06:12.818 --> 00:06:15.168
and the Soweto uprising ended in tragedy.

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:19.938
Apartheid itself didn't end
until almost 20 years later,

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.334
but the activism of those kids
in Soweto profoundly changed

00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:28.962
the way the world viewed
what was happening in South Africa.

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:33.095
News outlets all around the world
published this photo

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.283
of 13-year-old Hector Pieterson,

00:06:35.307 --> 00:06:38.972
who was one of the first people
killed by police in Soweto,

00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:42.060
and it became nearly impossible
to ignore the brutality

00:06:42.084 --> 00:06:43.818
of the apartheid regime.

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:47.097
In the months and the years
that followed the Soweto uprising,

00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:50.391
more and more countries
exerted political and economic pressure

00:06:50.415 --> 00:06:53.295
on the South African government
to end apartheid,

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:57.783
and it was largely due to the activism
of those kids in Soweto.

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:02.563
So every year my kids learn about this.

00:07:02.587 --> 00:07:05.585
And invariably, they start
to draw connections

00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:07.968
between those kids
in Soweto and themselves.

00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:10.243
And they start to ask themselves

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:13.608
what kind of political power
and agency they have.

00:07:14.345 --> 00:07:17.121
They ask themselves whether
there would ever be a reason

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.071
they would risk their lives

00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:22.271
so that a future generation
could live in a more just world.

00:07:22.813 --> 00:07:26.013
And most profoundly for me,
every single year,

00:07:26.037 --> 00:07:31.349
they ask themselves whether adults
will ever listen to their voices.

00:07:32.788 --> 00:07:33.939
A few years ago,

00:07:33.963 --> 00:07:37.296
my principal got an anonymous email
from one of our students.

00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:39.553
It informed him that the following day,

00:07:39.577 --> 00:07:41.807
the students planned
to walk out of school.

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:44.459
This was in the wake
of Michael Brown's death

00:07:44.483 --> 00:07:45.633
in Ferguson, Missouri,

00:07:45.657 --> 00:07:48.780
and the students were planning
to join a walkout and march

00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:51.170
in support of the Black Lives
Matter movement.

00:07:51.622 --> 00:07:52.773
So at this point,

00:07:52.797 --> 00:07:54.995
the staff at the school
had a decision to make.

00:07:55.363 --> 00:07:59.464
Would we use our authority and our power
to try to control the students

00:07:59.488 --> 00:08:01.155
and prevent them from leaving,

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:03.357
or would we support them

00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:06.497
as they put into practice
the principles of social justice

00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:09.639
that we had taught them about
since the ninth-grade year?

00:08:10.412 --> 00:08:13.134
So the next morning,
the kids left school en masse

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:14.713
and they gathered on the lawn.

00:08:14.737 --> 00:08:17.341
And one of the seniors
jumped up on a picnic table

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:19.309
and went over safety expectations.

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:20.341
(Laughter)

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:22.612
And the younger kids
took it very seriously.

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:25.166
And as teachers and as staff we told them,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.482
"OK, be safe,"

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.439
and we watched as they marched off.

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:32.388
The kids who chose to stay
spent that afternoon in class.

00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:34.593
They debated the merits of protest,

00:08:34.617 --> 00:08:37.717
they talked about the history
of the Black Lives Matter movement,

00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:39.750
and they went on
with classes as scheduled.

00:08:39.774 --> 00:08:44.071
And those who chose to leave
participated in a citywide student walkout

00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:46.732
and raised their collective
voice for justice.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.812
But no matter where they chose
to spend the afternoon,

00:08:50.836 --> 00:08:53.456
our kids learned
valuable lessons that day.

00:08:54.521 --> 00:08:57.454
They learned that the adults
in their lives would support them

00:08:57.478 --> 00:08:59.767
even as we worried for their safety.

00:09:00.395 --> 00:09:03.590
And they learned that they didn't need us
to tell them how or when

00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:05.352
or even why to protest.

00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:09.007
They learned that they were members
of a community of young people

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:12.079
with a shared vision
of a more equitable society,

00:09:12.103 --> 00:09:14.913
and they learned that they had power
within that society.

00:09:15.893 --> 00:09:18.211
They learned that events
like the Soweto uprising

00:09:18.235 --> 00:09:20.454
are not ancient history,

00:09:20.478 --> 00:09:22.746
and they don't have to end in tragedy.

00:09:23.882 --> 00:09:28.153
And that's what education as a tool
for social justice can look like.

00:09:29.349 --> 00:09:30.500
And here's the thing:

00:09:30.524 --> 00:09:32.577
our kids are ready for this kind of work.

00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:33.772
So in 2015,

00:09:33.796 --> 00:09:36.043
incoming college freshmen were surveyed,

00:09:36.067 --> 00:09:38.418
and 8.5 percent of them said

00:09:38.442 --> 00:09:41.776
that there was a "very good chance"
they would participate in a protest

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.691
sometime during their college career.

00:09:43.715 --> 00:09:45.867
That might not seem very impressive,

00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:47.092
but consider the fact

00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:51.276
that it's the largest number
of students to say that since 1967.

00:09:52.073 --> 00:09:53.812
And 75 percent of those kids

00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:56.461
said that helping other people
who are having difficulty

00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:58.916
was a "very important"
or "essential" goal for them.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.454
Again, the highest number of people
to say that since the late 1960s.

00:10:02.984 --> 00:10:07.947
And research shows us that working
for justice doesn't just follow

00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:10.599
from building all those skills
I talked about earlier --

00:10:10.623 --> 00:10:12.372
it actually goes the other way, too.

00:10:12.396 --> 00:10:15.482
So working for justice,
engaging in activism,

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:19.770
helps students build skills
like leadership and critical thinking,

00:10:19.794 --> 00:10:22.901
and it correlates positively
with their political participation

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.299
and their civic engagement

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:26.943
and their commitment
to their communities later in life.

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.439
So in other words,

00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:32.332
students are telling us
that social justice matters to them

00:10:32.356 --> 00:10:35.811
and researchers are telling us
that it helps students learn.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.173
So now it's up to us to listen,

00:10:39.197 --> 00:10:41.033
and that might not be easy.

00:10:41.984 --> 00:10:46.400
In 1976, one of those kids
who participated in the Soweto uprising,

00:10:46.424 --> 00:10:49.067
he said that that event
represented divorce

00:10:49.091 --> 00:10:51.117
between black children and their families,

00:10:51.141 --> 00:10:53.721
because their families
had grown up under apartheid,

00:10:53.745 --> 00:10:55.984
and they knew how dangerous
it was to speak out.

00:10:56.008 --> 00:10:58.435
They wanted their kids
to lay low and stay safe.

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:00.429
And when our kids threatened to walk out,

00:11:00.453 --> 00:11:03.914
a lot of the adults in our community
were really conflicted, too.

00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:07.433
Some of us worried that they might
encounter violence.

00:11:07.457 --> 00:11:09.611
Other people worried
that they would walk out

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:12.207
but they wouldn't really know
why they were protesting.

00:11:12.231 --> 00:11:14.311
And some, including
some students' families,

00:11:14.335 --> 00:11:16.692
were really angry
that the school hadn't done more

00:11:16.716 --> 00:11:18.118
to prevent them from leaving.

00:11:18.142 --> 00:11:22.374
And all of those fears that adults have
about getting this stuff wrong --

00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:24.848
all of those fears make total sense.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.801
But despite those fears,

00:11:27.825 --> 00:11:32.467
we have got to prove to our students
that we will listen to their voices

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:35.422
and that they do have the power
to effect change.

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:39.350
It's our responsibility
to equip our students

00:11:39.374 --> 00:11:41.892
with the tools and the skills
that they need

00:11:41.916 --> 00:11:44.181
to insist on a more equitable world --

00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:47.607
and then sometimes,
to get out of their way,

00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:51.081
and let them apply those skills
to things that they care about.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.950
Living up to that vision
is going to require

00:11:55.974 --> 00:11:57.536
that we are flexible,

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.735
and it's going to require
that we're creative.

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:01.974
It's going to require
that we're brave enough

00:12:01.998 --> 00:12:05.522
to stand up in the face of people
who try to silence

00:12:05.546 --> 00:12:07.976
or delegitimize dissenting voices.

00:12:08.304 --> 00:12:09.551
And hardest of all,

00:12:09.575 --> 00:12:13.940
it's going to require accepting the fact
that sometimes we will be the ones

00:12:13.964 --> 00:12:15.940
our students will rebel against.

00:12:15.964 --> 00:12:17.334
(Laughter)

00:12:17.358 --> 00:12:21.398
Sometimes they're going to point out ways
in which systems that we have created,

00:12:21.422 --> 00:12:23.110
or in which we are complicit,

00:12:23.134 --> 00:12:25.027
contribute to inequity.

00:12:25.051 --> 00:12:28.048
It's going to be uncomfortable,
and it's going to be painful

00:12:28.072 --> 00:12:31.728
as they push us to question
our own assumptions and beliefs.

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:36.533
But what if we change the way we think
about rebellion in our kids?

00:12:37.842 --> 00:12:39.220
When our kids rebel --

00:12:39.244 --> 00:12:41.941
when they thoughtfully push back
against our ideas

00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:43.748
or the way that we do things,

00:12:43.772 --> 00:12:48.117
what if we chose to see that as a sign
that we're doing something right

00:12:48.141 --> 00:12:50.160
and that they're becoming liberated?

00:12:51.474 --> 00:12:53.310
I know it would be easier

00:12:53.334 --> 00:12:57.456
if their critical thinking skills
manifested in more convenient ways --

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.433
on their essays
or their standardized tests --

00:13:00.457 --> 00:13:01.607
I get it --

00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:05.313
but convenience and justice
do not often go hand in hand.

00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:09.258
And when our kids learn to think
critically about the world around them,

00:13:09.282 --> 00:13:11.932
they become the kinds of engaged citizens

00:13:11.956 --> 00:13:15.267
who will recognize and question
injustice when they see it

00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:17.077
and work to do something about it.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.142
Welcoming rebellion into our schools
is going to require some rethinking

00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:24.369
about what teaching
and learning look like,

00:13:24.393 --> 00:13:26.418
because there's this misconception

00:13:26.442 --> 00:13:30.425
that if we give students any wiggle room,
they're going to walk all over us

00:13:30.449 --> 00:13:35.246
and classrooms and dinner tables
will devolve into total chaos.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:41.088
And if we expect kids to sit silently
and passively receive knowledge from us,

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:44.315
then their voices will always
feel overwhelming.

00:13:45.488 --> 00:13:50.407
But if we accept instead
that learning is sometimes messy,

00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:54.010
that it requires opportunities
to brainstorm and mess up

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:55.555
and try again,

00:13:55.579 --> 00:13:58.654
that our kids dislike chaos
and want to learn

00:13:58.678 --> 00:14:00.659
when they come to school,

00:14:00.683 --> 00:14:04.409
then we can set up schools
to facilitate that kind of learning.

00:14:05.015 --> 00:14:07.826
So do me a favor and close
your eyes for a second

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.238
and imagine schools
where teachers are thought partners,

00:14:12.262 --> 00:14:16.249
letting students grapple 
with complex, hard issues

00:14:16.273 --> 00:14:19.056
and not necessarily giving them
the right answers.

00:14:20.482 --> 00:14:24.370
And imagine schools
where we let students make choices --

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:26.692
we trust them enough to do that

00:14:26.716 --> 00:14:30.104
and we let them experience
the consequences of those choices.

00:14:31.714 --> 00:14:36.478
Imagine schools where
we let students be humans,

00:14:36.502 --> 00:14:39.213
with all of the messiness
and the uncertainty

00:14:39.237 --> 00:14:41.167
that is bound to come with that.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.659
Whatever you just imagined,

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:47.701
it's not mythical,

00:14:47.725 --> 00:14:51.358
it's not unrealistically idealistic,

00:14:51.382 --> 00:14:56.464
because teachers all over the country
are already pushing the boundaries

00:14:56.488 --> 00:14:58.502
of what teaching
and learning can look like

00:14:58.526 --> 00:15:00.740
with amazing results for kids.

00:15:00.764 --> 00:15:03.046
They're doing that
in all kinds of schools,

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.407
and there are countless models
for teachers who want to get better

00:15:06.431 --> 00:15:09.683
at helping students learn
in a way that's more authentic

00:15:09.707 --> 00:15:12.017
and engaging and empowering.

00:15:13.837 --> 00:15:15.409
I was a reading a book recently,

00:15:15.433 --> 00:15:17.386
it's called "The Students Are Watching,"

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.045
and it was by Ted and Nancy Sizer,

00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:21.676
and in that book, they said
that the work of education

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.069
is often described as a series of nouns,

00:15:24.093 --> 00:15:27.140
like "respect," "honesty," "integrity."

00:15:27.164 --> 00:15:30.926
And they say those nouns
sound really impressive,

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.743
but often, they fail
to actually mean anything in practice.

00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:37.673
But verbs, they say, are "active,

00:15:37.697 --> 00:15:39.219
no less demanding

00:15:39.243 --> 00:15:41.756
but requiring constant engagement.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.934
Verbs are not structures
but, rather, engines."

00:15:46.618 --> 00:15:48.291
And so as I read that, I wondered:

00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:53.560
How do we make justice into an engine
driving our work as teachers?

00:15:54.478 --> 00:15:57.159
What's the verb form of justice?

00:15:58.618 --> 00:16:02.074
I think there might be an answer
to be found in the words of Cornel West,

00:16:02.098 --> 00:16:06.343
who famously said that "justice
is what love looks like in public."

00:16:07.544 --> 00:16:10.394
And all of my nerdy English
teachers in the crowd

00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:13.393
know that love can be a noun and a verb.

00:16:14.653 --> 00:16:17.416
School has to be bigger.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:22.368
It has to mean more
than "I teach my subject."

00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:26.530
School has to be about teaching people

00:16:26.554 --> 00:16:28.825
to change the world for the better.

00:16:30.132 --> 00:16:31.442
If we believe that,

00:16:31.466 --> 00:16:34.661
then teaching will always be
a political act.

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:39.393
We can't be afraid of our students' power.

00:16:40.185 --> 00:16:43.654
Their power will help them
make tomorrow better.

00:16:43.678 --> 00:16:45.016
But before they can do that,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.876
we have to give them chances
to practice today.

00:16:49.001 --> 00:16:52.571
And that practice
should start in our schools.

00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:54.729
Thank you very much.

00:16:54.753 --> 00:16:58.309
(Applause)
