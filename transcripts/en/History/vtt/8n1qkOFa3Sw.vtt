00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.537
FRANK: Danielle's sending
us out to a guy named Mark

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:05.872
in Wisconsin.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.674
ROBBIE: It sounds like
this guy's got a lot of...

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.409
of tonnage.
50 years, man.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.610
That's a long time.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.911
FRANK: Wow.
Look at that Blatz sign.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.012
ROBBIE: I know.
FRANK: Whoa!

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.647
ROBBIE: That thing's badass.
It says "Frank's"!

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.583
FRANK: "Frank's Drink Blatz"!
Jesus!

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.851
ROBBIE: Are you kidding me?!

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.652
If this pick's any good,
I'm gonna buy you a beer

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.222
at the end of the day.
FRANK: Oh, yeah!

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.557
FRANK: Here it is right there.
ROBBIE: Ah...

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.127
Yeah.
[rings doorbell]

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.328
MARK: Hi, there.
[laughs]

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.996
FRANK: I'm Frank.
How're you doing?

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.164
ROBBIE: Nice to see you.
Robbie.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.198
MARK: Hi, yeah.
FRANK: It's Robbie.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.266
You talk to Danielle
on the phone?

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.601
MARK: I did, yes.
FRANK: We hear you got

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.036
a lot of stuff.
MARK: Oh, do I ever.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.571
MARK: I'm a photographer
and artist

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.307
and sundry other things.
[laughs]

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.710
MARK: Come on in here.
I'll show you this room.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.412
I travel all over,
picked up things.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.280
ROBBIE: Ho-oly cow!

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.183
MARK: When I first came in here
all this junk wasn't here.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.786
And, uh, little by little
I changed it around

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.220
to what I've got here now.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.523
MARK: I have too many things now
that I'm trying to get rid of.

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.159
I don't want to leave it
to my children and grandchildren

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.293
to have to dispose of it.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.694
They don't know what
a lot of this stuff is.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.696
FRANK: Right off the bat, I'm
seeing some nice stuff here.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:06.699
There's books,
movie posters, folk art.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.703
ROBBIE: I mean, there is-- you
have acquired so many things.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.138
ROBBIE: The biggest
thing in the room

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.240
is this Japanese flag.
FRANK: It's huge.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.309
MARK: Yeah, it was flying over
Okinawa and it's all made out of

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.278
linen and all stitched together.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.780
FRANK: A flag this big
in this great a condition

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.781
is hard to find.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.819
ROBBIE: Do you
want to sell this?

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.086
MARK: Well, you know,

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.055
it was given to me as a gift.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.624
And I'd feel real bad
about selling it, I just...

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.460
MARK: I didn't feel I could
sell it to somebody else

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.561
because it was given to me.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.963
FRANK: I seen this
gambling device.

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.732
I mean, it's just a kind of
way of gambling, you know.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.069
You would put your money down
on something, bingo, anything.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.137
ROBBIE: Pick a number.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.538
MARK: I...
FRANK: 6...

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.006
10.
MARK: [laughs]

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.309
FRANK: Is this something that
you would consider selling?

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.110
I mean, we see a lot of these,
but I kind of...

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.445
I like the base and...

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.047
MARK: Again, another thing
that somebody gave to me,

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.748
came out of their attic.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.117
I just-- I can picture
the person giving it to me

00:01:58.117 --> 00:01:59.786
and the smile on their face.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.187
Can't do that.
I just can't.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.622
FRANK: Alright,
I can understand that.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.324
MARK: It does strike me through
that a lot of these things

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.726
that people gave me
that were very valuable,

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:08.695
that I would feel bad
about then selling.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.064
FRANK: Mark had a vast
array of different stuff,

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.832
but there were some items
I asked about today

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:14.868
that were given to him
by his friends.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.337
I mean, it's one of those
things where sentimental value

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.771
exceeds retail value.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.107
At the end of the day, we've
managed to buy some good stuff.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:24.010
FRANK: I'm glad I don't have as
much square footage as you do.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.745
Because I would be
just as packed.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.480
ROBBIE: Yeah.
MARK: Yeah, it's a problem.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.648
ROBBIE: Seriously, thank you.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:29.782
It was a pleasure
meeting you.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:32.218
FRANK: Thanks a lot.
ROBBIE: Alright.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.354
[honks horn]
FRANK: See you, Mark!

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.523
MARK: Bye, now.
FRANK: Thanks, buddy!
