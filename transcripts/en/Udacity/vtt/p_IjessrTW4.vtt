00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.650
&gt;&gt; In the same way that our genomes influence traits like eye color, hair

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.420
color, or susceptibility to cancer even, they

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.160
can also influence our ability to metabolize drugs.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.410
&gt;&gt; Like alcohol. A drug is defined as any chemical that when introduced

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.640
into the body, can influence biological processes.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.220
This includes things like alcohol, even caffeine.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.940
Now, we have a very special experiment set up for all you Udacious

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.660
students out there today. This is Lauren, you know Lauren. And this is Jennie.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.990
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Jennie.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.490
&gt;&gt; And they're going to represent how two people with two different genomes

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.740
can metabolize a drug differently. A drug like alcohol. Now, they're about the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.510
same height. They're about the same size. And we might expect them to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.730
have the same tolerance. But let's see

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.818
what happens when they finish their drinks.

00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:44.766
&gt;&gt; Cheers.

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.008
&gt;&gt; Cheers.

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:47.152
[MUSIC]

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:55.950
&gt;&gt; Alright, Lauren and Jenny happen to be above the

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.660
age of 21, which is the legal drinking limit in the United States. Neither of

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.950
them drove to work today. And because they're responsible with alcohol, they

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.210
actually didn't finish their drinks. So, let's see. How do you feel ladies?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.230
&gt;&gt; I feel okay.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.440
&gt;&gt; And what about you, Jenny?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.220
&gt;&gt; I feel amazing.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.340
&gt;&gt; You do?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.860
&gt;&gt; I do.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.700
&gt;&gt; You look a little you look a little red to me.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little warm in here, isn't it?

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.480
&gt;&gt; not really. I can see in your cheeks,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.760
though, you've got some you've got some redness there.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.400
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.170
&gt;&gt; Does that normally happen when you drink.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.610
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.860
&gt;&gt; that's what we call alcohol flush reaction, sort of

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.750
that, that redness in your cheeks that, that I see there.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I see a little bit on your chest as well.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.410
&gt;&gt; Hm. Yeah.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.290
&gt;&gt; And so that normally

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.710
happens when you drink, huh?

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.480
&gt;&gt; Yes it does.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.000
&gt;&gt; does it run in your family?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.030
&gt;&gt; Well my dad actually is allergic to alcohol and gets hives.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.640
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. Well the alcohol flush

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.700
reaction is known to be prevalent in those of

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.380
an Asian background. So, I'd like to know

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.850
from you, do you have the alcohol flush reaction?
