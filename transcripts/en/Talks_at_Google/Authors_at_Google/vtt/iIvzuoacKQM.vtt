00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.420
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, everyone.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.810
Welcome to another Authors
at Google event.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.730
Today, we're very pleased to
welcome a true icon in the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.660
Seattle restaurant scene, none
other than Mr. Tom Douglas.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.760
He has over 13 different
restaurants in the area, and

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.290
he's actually published a wide
variety of cookbooks as well.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.890
Today he'll be talking to us on
his life, his restaurants,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.750
entrepreneurship, but most
specifically, his latest book,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.640
which is the "Dahlia Bakery
Cookbook," which started out

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.730
with a desire to just have
excellent pastry in his

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.450
restaurant, and now itself is
a destination on the Seattle

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.430
restaurant scene.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.000
So without further ado,
please join me in

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.060
welcoming Tom to Google.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.920
Thanks.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.880
TOM DOUGLAS: Thanks.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.130
Thank you, Cliff.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.160
I'll start with I just flew
in from Manhattan.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.790
How many people are
from Manhattan?

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.920
How many people were happy not
to be in Manhattan in the last

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.885
week, where I've been?

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.510
TOM DOUGLAS: Yeah, it is kind of
crazy back there right now.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.630
Yesterday morning when I left
for JFK from downtown-- first

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.130
of all, I couldn't hardly--

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.820
I had to bribe a cabbie to take
me to JFK, $300, because

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.070
he didn't want to go, because he
knew what the other side of

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.120
it was, which was by the time I
got to the Triborough Bridge

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.190
coming out of midtown Manhattan,
there was a traffic

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.360
jam from the end of the bridge
on the Manhattan side of the

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.330
East River all the way to JFK.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.200
And it was taking some people
eight hours to get from JFK to

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.410
downtown Manhattan.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.930
So it is quite an interesting
time in that big massive city.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.340
Our hotel was a block away
from the dangling crane.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.870
Who saw the crane dangling?

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.180
I was right there when
it went over.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.580
We heard it.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.830
We were at 55th and 8th
Avenue when it went

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.110
over, and kind of freaky.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.330
And what else?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.740
It's just kind of an odd thing
right now in Manhattan.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.190
Above 34th Street, it's like
nothing ever happened, except

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.180
that everyone is on the
street, has no subway.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.270
5 million people a day take the
subway there, so they're

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.070
all on the streets, and it's
a very interesting time.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.810
I feel thankful to be here.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.610
As we flew out in our plane
right over the New Jersey

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.340
coast, we looked down at Staten
Island, Statue of

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.990
Liberty, all that kind of area,
and it's just kaput.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.300
So good to be a Googler today in
Mountain View, California.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.510
What you're seeing on
the internet is

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.500
actually very true.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.570
We are going to talk about
my book a bit, but I like

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.610
restaurants.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.510
We could talk about the book as
much as you like, questions

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.040
about pastry.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.170
I'm more interactive.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.270
I'm better interactive than I am
just sitting up here giving

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.230
you a speech.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.140
So if you have questions,
jump in at any time.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.420
This is our fourth book.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.220
The rest have been more savory
in nature, including the very

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.000
first one, which was flavors
from our first three

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.960
restaurants, and then from our
home, and then others.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.370
I have a little book called "I
Love Crab Cakes," which is all

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.260
about the crab cakes from the
area where I grew up was on

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.980
the Chesapeake Bay--

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.770
Newark, Delaware, so
45 minutes from

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.020
the Chesapeake Bay.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.980
It's interesting to me that the
change in restaurants to

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.540
this day-- and I think it's got
a lot to do with you all--

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.960
from the simplest things like
getting a review of your

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.570
restaurant.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.990
You still have to be three,
six months, a year later.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.290
You hope that the
local newspaper

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.680
would give you a review.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.720
Now you do a little friends
and family event the night

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.770
before you open, and you've been
reviewed by 20 people the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.910
next morning.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.935
That's been a big change in
the restaurant business.

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:26.570
I thought the other interesting
thing was during

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.550
the recession, that our customer
counts never went

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.630
down in our 13 restaurants.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.620
Not one time, not one quarter,
not one minute did we have

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.910
less customers than we had
before the recession started.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.230
The customers that came all
spent less, but the customer

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.750
counts were there.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.220
And it really gave me pause to
think about why that is.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.270
And this is the secondary
where you all come in, I

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.890
think, which is that people
are stuck behind their

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.610
computer screens for
so long every day.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.290
There's just this need to get
out, to be with people,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.050
socialize, to have a place to go
outside of your home where

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.390
you'd be by yourself again, or
just cooking by yourself.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.320
And I think restaurants have
become the hub of our

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.310
communities.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.320
And if you look at
cafeterias here--

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.850
I just walked through them with
the chef team, and it's

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.390
fascinating to see everyone just
kind of revolve around

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.510
the food here at Google.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.149
And I think it's happening
in everyday

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.250
restaurants at same time.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.390
People are revolving
around the table.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.530
The good news about that is that
it keeps chumps like me

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.890
in business.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.720
The good news is that people
are still talking over the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.380
dinner table, which I think is
the best way for politics and

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.920
things of that sort to happen.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.450
It's a good way for small
business to survive, as the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.930
Googles and the Amazons and the
Microsofts all kind of--

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.000
Apples all take over the world
in this business structure.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.330
It's a good way-- it's one of
the last bastions of small

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.020
business to be out there
surviving, being creative.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.140
And you see so many coffee
shops, and bars, and

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.680
restaurants of all sorts
of opening up still.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.230
It's a nice last bastion.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.700
As bookstores go away--
in Paris--

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.840
I was in Paris not too long ago,
and it seemed like there

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.910
was a bookstore on
every block.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.240
And the leading line
in the Parisian

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.870
paper was, poor Paris.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.040
We are out of bookstores,
because all the bookstores

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.770
have closed.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.300
And there's still a bookstore
on every block.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.320
Just imagine what it used to
be like, in a literary town

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.970
like Paris, and how the
retail has changed.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.820
My book is about family
and friends.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.180
My book's about being the person
at the water cooler to

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.300
talk about the hot restaurant
down the street, not about

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.610
what you bought at Walmart
yesterday.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.790
It's about not being the last
person with the recipe card

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.420
file, about taking the
responsibility of teaching

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.520
someone below you, whether it's
generational or familial

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.510
or whatever that is, a friend
and coworker, to extend your

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.610
recipe card file past
your own kitchen.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.660
It's about enjoying the treasure
that cooking is,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.910
instead of not having
time to cook.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.140
Cooking is a treasure.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.210
I say put your computer and put
your TV in your kitchen

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.980
and keep cooking, even if you
have to watch "The Voice"

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.400
while you're doing it.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.922
Go for it, nothing
wrong with that.

00:06:05.922 --> 00:06:07.810
We found out this morning that
we're number 14 on the New

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.580
York Times Bestseller list,
which is very exciting.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.560
TOM DOUGLAS: I don't know if
that's just cookbooks, or

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.370
how-to-do books, or hardcover
books, or whatever that is.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.310
I don't really give a shit.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.530
It's 14 on the New York Times
Bestseller list, and we'll

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.780
just leave it at that.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.610
One of my favorite recipes in
here is called schnecken.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.540
Anyone know what that is?

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.430
Schnecken, which is a German
word for kind of a cinnamon

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.790
roll pull-apart.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.560
We've all had cinnamon
pull-aparts, right?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.690
It's a classic--

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.250
maybe we'll haven't.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.190
But sticky buns--

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.470
cinnamon, carmel, nuts,
dough-- yeast dough.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.890
And if there's a recipe that
epitomizes why we have a

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.480
baking book now in our life,
it's that Grandma Douglas's

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.850
Schnecken that I used to smell
as a 10-year-old, and

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.580
earlier, I'm sure.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.750
But I remember it
from about then.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.920
Coming downstairs, you could
smell the yeast upstairs in

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.240
the bedroom, and grandma was
visiting from Chicago.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.390
And she'd have the big
sticky dough was

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.630
rolled out on the table.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.790
And maybe inappropriate, but
at 10 years old, when you

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.690
touch that dough, you
just know that it

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.080
feels really good.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.495
At 18, you know why it felt
good, because of the whole--

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:24.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.220
TOM DOUGLAS: If you
know what I mean.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.770
If you don't, never mind.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.760
But at 10 years old, you just
know it feels good and it

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.320
smells good.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.290
At 18, you just know it
really feels good.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.430
So she would have
it all laid out.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.870
And then you'd come down, and
she might, or might not, in

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.450
her younger days-- so in her
50s, 60s, as far as I

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.120
remember, she never
let us touch it.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.150
She would always make it and
shoo you away from the table.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.610
She was not the nicest person
in the whole world.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.360
But in her later years, when she
realized that this was a

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.770
tradition in our family and
something that she needed to

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.080
pass down, she would welcome
you in to do

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.790
parts of the process.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.750
So the big thing, maybe two feet
wide, 18 inches this way

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.270
to two feet this way.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.640
And she'd have the dough rolled
out with her little

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.040
red-handled rolling pin.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.860
And then she might let you
spread the butter on, and then

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.160
sprinkle the brown sugar, and
the nuts, and then you just

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.160
roll it up into this pinwheel,
this kind of squishy pinwheel.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.230
And then in the 9 by 13-- not
the 9 by 14, and not the 8 by

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.370
11-- just had to be the
right size pan--

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.240
you would cut them into one-inch
rounds and then pop

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.940
them in there, and
they'd bake up.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.799
And then the dangerous part
would happen when they pulled

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.010
it out of the oven, and the
hot caramel was bubbling.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.220
And then you'd have to turn it
over, and everyone would have

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.544
to clear out while
grandma did this.

00:08:40.544 --> 00:08:45.040
Of course, she's this tall and
her arms were this long.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.380
She would do it on her homemade
aluminum trays.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.410
That was kind of a big thing.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.270
She was a crafty person.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.570
So she did these hammered
aluminum--

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.330
does anyone remember--

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.880
you can see them in-- like
used stores now.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.120
Anyway, she had a bunch of
those, and we had a bunch.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.040
If she had them, we had them.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.280
So turned it out onto that.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.380
And then there was-- it was the
good time to use my girth.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.440
I have six sisters and a
brother, and I've always been

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.550
the biggest person
in the family.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.306
I was born 125 pounds.

00:09:12.306 --> 00:09:13.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.760
I know you probably don't
believe that, but that's

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.080
actually true.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.680
And I was the largest baby
in the state of Delaware.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.150
I know.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.920
Just kidding.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.050
But at that time, by 10 years
old, I was by far the largest

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.530
child in our house.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.870
Even my brother, who was six
years older than me, was not

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.030
larger than me.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.640
So that's just in time to
do the block and tackle.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.500
You just move over and you get
the pieces that you want,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.300
because everyone had their
favorite corner, the center,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.040
the gooey center, the crispy
corner, or whatever.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.420
And then when you go for
the seconds, you

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.850
go for what's left.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.230
And it doesn't really matter at
that point, because you're

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.750
in heaven with your
sticky buns.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.170
But that's kind of what this
book is all about, is recipes

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.020
like that, that are familial,
they've been passed down, they

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.950
are doable, approachable.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.050
They are--

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:10.160
in a sense, they're obligations
to my daughter,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.870
who's 22 now, who's been growing
up cooking with me for

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.930
the last 15 years in
our home kitchen.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.200
They're an obligation to her,
to get out, get in the

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.530
kitchen, and to continue the
process of not letting the

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.995
recipe card file stop with me.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.240
Tons of different stuff in
there, so I'm just going to

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.570
maybe open it for questions.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.140
We can talk about Seattle.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.720
We can talk about restaurants.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.310
I love restaurants.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.650
I eat in one of mine and
somebody else's every day.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:43.190
I was in Manhattan two weeks ago
for another event, and I

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.010
was there for almost a week.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.750
And we ate in 37 restaurants
in five days, because

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.330
that's what I do.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.490
I love restaurants.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.680
I was in Manhattan this time
for almost six days or so.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.160
And I couldn't have even eaten
half of that many.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.480
They weren't open.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.910
Everyone was closed, except
for hotel restaurants.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.640
And then you were on very
limited menus, because they

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.950
only had the cooks that they
could keep in rooms upstairs.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.710
And then as soon as the power
went out in southern

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.020
Manhattan, on the tip, they
kicked all the cooks and

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.690
people out of their rooms,
because then they could sell

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.530
out the rooms.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.160
Every hotel room in Manhattan
is booked right now because

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.260
people don't have power.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.910
So we can talk about Manhattan
and the floods, being in the

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.120
middle of a hurricane.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.170
We can talk about anything
you like.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.470
So I'm going to open up.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.858
Somebody just start us off.

00:11:29.858 --> 00:11:34.310
AUDIENCE: If anyone wants to ask
questions, ask for a mic.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.270
TOM DOUGLAS: We can talk
about entrepreneurial.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.050
Does anyone want to
open a restaurant?

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.310
Yes?

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.460
Do you?

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.330
I have a funny story.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.660
You guys might know
who Amazon is.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.370
They're expanding rapidly
in the city of Seattle--

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.970
largest urban campus
in the world.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.445
I have three restaurants,
almost--

00:11:50.445 --> 00:11:52.340
three restaurants in the middle
of their campus, and I

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.670
have two just a block outside
of the campus in South Lake

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.950
Union of Seattle.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.345
And we had this whole
building.

00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:01.720
It was 20,000 square foot.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.650
And I couldn't decide whether
to do one, two, or three

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.540
restaurants in there.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.770
I didn't want to do one,
because it was too big.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.960
But it's two levels, so
I decided to do three

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.000
restaurants, one on the bottom,
one upstairs, and then

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.910
one little one just for the
Amazonians in the back, a

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.430
little Tibetan dumpling bar.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.920
Because I had a Tibetan
chef on staff

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.710
for the last 17 years.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:22.520
So I got hold of--

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.790
I asked the guy who was a group
leader at Amazon for his

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.290
list of people that reported to
him, if I could do a little

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.130
survey so I could find out what
the Amazonians wanted

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.360
next to their offices.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.430
And talk about different
business cultures.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.430
You guys seem like you might
have a pretty strong culture

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.510
around here.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:45.120
Something tells me-- yellow
bikes and stuff, volleyball.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.600
So I wrote a note to all
600 of these folks.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.210
And I said, if you could
put any restaurant--

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.890
Stunned by this, I'm well-known
known in Seattle.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:54.630
If you could put any restaurant

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.680
right next to your--

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.600
if you could own
any restaurant.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.800
Cost is no object.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.660
Doesn't cost you a dime.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.870
You want your favorite
restaurant right

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.890
next to your office.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.350
What would it be?

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.425
And I got 150 responses.

00:13:07.425 --> 00:13:12.650
72% said exactly the same thing,
which is, I thought, an

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.550
incredible number to have the
similar response, out of all

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.870
the possibilities
of restaurants.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.070
Anybody here want to
take a gander?

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.600
You say you want to open--
what would you open?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.490
If you could open a restaurant
right next to your office,

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.340
have it be your favorite place,
all your friends would

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.740
come, what would it be?

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.010
AUDIENCE: Seafood.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.020
TOM DOUGLAS: Seafood?

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.630
Of any sort?

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.200
You just like seafood?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.230
So is that sushi?

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.410
Is that grilled salmon?

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:34.866
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:34.866 --> 00:13:37.700
Grilled and fried [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:44.760
TOM DOUGLAS: Delicious.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.660
Sounds great.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.330
Anybody else?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.750
Is that a family recipe?

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.156
Do you guys have a
family tradition?

00:13:49.156 --> 00:13:49.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.390
TOM DOUGLAS: So you'd bring
your family into it.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.300
You're passionate about--

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.080
TOM DOUGLAS: OK.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.590
There you go.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.190
It's right in here.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.320
Anybody else want to jump in?

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.170
What would you build right
next to your office?

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.750
AUDIENCE: Speaking of Manhattan,
I would say the

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.640
halal cart down at
53rd and 6th.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.310
TOM DOUGLAS: A la carte?

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.720
AUDIENCE: No.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.540
Halal chicken cart.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.150
TOM DOUGLAS: Oh, the halal
carts, one of those little

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.090
quick skewer jobs?

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:13.490
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.730
TOM DOUGLAS: With the
heavy fried rice?

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.160
Oddly enough, they were
not out either.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.220
That was another odd thing about
Manhattan during the

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.100
storm, was they just
disappeared.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.320
They started showing
up yesterday.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.300
So halal carts, chicken
skewers-- anybody else?

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.290
Nobody else here wants to--

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.780
look at all the white chef
coats in the back.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.212
Yes, sir?

00:14:30.212 --> 00:14:32.120
AUDIENCE: Franklin's barbecue.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.690
TOM DOUGLAS: Franklin's
barbecue.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.061
What do you like about it?

00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:37.470
AUDIENCE: Everything
on the tray.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.440
TOM DOUGLAS: Some good smoky
brisket, beans, mac and

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.440
cheese, cornbread.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.240
TOM DOUGLAS: Meat, meat, meat.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.595
AUDIENCE: Now, the funny thing
is I eat meat about once a

00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:47.480
week, but that would
be my last meal.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.160
TOM DOUGLAS: That would be it.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.830
TOM DOUGLAS: And where
is Franklin's?

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.610
AUDIENCE: Austin, Texas.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.860
TOM DOUGLAS: Ah.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.930
So I go to the Salt Lick, just
south in Lockhart, in the

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:55.710
barbecue belt.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.618
AUDIENCE: That would be a backup
on an all-star team.

00:14:57.618 --> 00:14:59.049
It's very good.

00:14:59.049 --> 00:14:59.526
TOM DOUGLAS: Ooh.

00:14:59.526 --> 00:15:00.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.080
TOM DOUGLAS: Have you
been to Smith's?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.280
AUDIENCE: What's Smith's?

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.660
TOM DOUGLAS: Smith's, it's
got the black crusted

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.150
brisked down in--

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.630
AUDIENCE: That's everywhere.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.203
TOM DOUGLAS: Yeah, but this--

00:15:11.203 --> 00:15:13.900
AUDIENCE: Are you talking
about Smitty's?

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.250
TOM DOUGLAS: Smitty's, down--
it's near Lockhart, but it's

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:15.990
not in the town of Lockhart.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.130
AUDIENCE: Smitty's
is in Lockhart.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.130
TOM DOUGLAS: Maybe
it's Smitty's.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.160
TOM DOUGLAS: Kreuz is
a more Germans.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.780
I'm not a big fan
of Kreuz market.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.830
TOM DOUGLAS: Yeah, that's
not my favorite.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.330
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.710
I always thought Salt Lick
was slightly German too.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.600
TOM DOUGLAS: It is slightly, but
to me, it's a little bit

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.070
more Texas.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.880
Kreuz's-- anyway,
so barbecue is--

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.720
getting back to our point.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.270
We don't want to--

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.030
So anybody--

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.210
so here's my point.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.260
Here's what I was
trying to get at

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.980
with my Amazon question.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:51.020
72% of 150 people that responded
to me said, well,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.836
really I just want cheap.

00:15:52.836 --> 00:15:56.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.020
TOM DOUGLAS: You could open
anything in the world right

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:58.650
next to your office.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.810
All they worried about
was the price of it.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.630
And that is definitely
an Amazon culture.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.900
And if you go to their offices,
their desks are made

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.750
out of old wood doors,
and on saw horses

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.850
and things like that.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.590
It's just fascinating
to me, the culture.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.525
I bet if I did the same thing
anonymously here, I bet it

00:16:16.525 --> 00:16:18.120
would be a very different
answer.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.926
Because this place seems much
more food-oriented.

00:16:20.926 --> 00:16:21.610
Kind of fun.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:22.240
Yes sir.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.400
AUDIENCE: Maybe following up
on that, what do you think

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.536
about the food truck culture?

00:16:27.536 --> 00:16:29.740
Are they--

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.570
do you feel threatened
by that?

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.500
Is it unfair competition?

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.890
TOM DOUGLAS: Is it unfair?

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.170
I mean, if you were to look at
the apples to apples, yeah,

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.210
it's a little unfair.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.970
Do I feel threatened?

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:39.900
No.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.500
What's the upside
to the truck?

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.660
There's really not
a lot of upside.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.690
You can do as many meals as you
can do a day out of it.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.430
And so from a financial
perspective, would I ever do a

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.500
truck personally?

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.590
There's just not enough in it.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.990
Passionate, young person's
job-- absolutely.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.340
Great place to try a concept,
absolutely--

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.250
same as a farmer's
market, though.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.550
I think they're interesting
and fun.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.430
You know, the new Amazon, they
just announced three million

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.430
more square feet in
downtown Seattle.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.480
And they're building a truck
rodeo spot in the middle of

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.430
the campus.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.220
They really like it.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.369
Those workers really like it.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:14.056
Why?

00:17:14.056 --> 00:17:14.869
AUDIENCE: Cheap.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:15.609
TOM DOUGLAS: It's cheap.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.250
It's really cheap.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.010
So no, I don't feel
threatened.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.319
But it is what it is.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:24.369
In Portland right now, there's a
lot of food trucks for sale.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.020
It's gone over the
tipping point of

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.060
viability in Portland.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.520
And so that's where we
just bought ours.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.180
We're moving our little Tibetan
dumpling business into

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:37.260
a truck, but only because my
Tibetan chef, who's 65, could

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.760
not handle the business
at our other place.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.410
So I'm moving her
out of there.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.670
I never wanted to open
outside of Seattle

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.930
until my kid was grown.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.300
Now she's grown, so maybe
we'd think about that.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.300
We're actually talking with a
company in South Korea right

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.590
now for Serious-- about
50 Serious Pies.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:56.520
In Paris and London and Milan,
we're kind of in negotiations

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.530
right now about Serious Pies,
what do we want to do with it.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.125
Six months after we opened, I
was offered $5 million for

00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:03.210
Serious Pie--

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.440
the concept--

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.990
for 300 units in North America,
and I had to be at

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.770
the opening of every unit.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.050
That was my only
responsibility,

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.730
other than the recipes.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.440
And it just didn't feel right,
just didn't feel good.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.490
Today, seven years later,
would I do it?

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.530
I would think about
it more seriously.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.380
But Serious Pie is
just a terrific

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.810
little organic pizzeria.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.090
How many people have been
to Serious Pie?

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.800
A couple?

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.580
Serious Pie is what happens when
a fine dining chef thinks

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.260
about pizza, and we put our same
values into pizza that we

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.200
put in, say, at the Dahlia
Lounge, our kind of flagship

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.040
fanciest restaurant.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.710
When we put those same values
onto a pizza, things change.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.550
You expect different
end results.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.600
And I don't mean that in
a, wow, my pie's better

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.380
than your pie way.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.640
It's just changed.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.570
Things that we wouldn't
accept went away.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.080
Like, by putting cheese on a
pizza, when you put it into

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.280
the oven, and then baking it,
you get a different product

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:01.900
when it comes out.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.970
You don't get cheese anymore.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.770
You get the whey and the milk
product, and you get a

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.580
separation of the fat
out of the cheese.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.180
You end up with two
different things.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.630
That's why when you order to-go
pizza and you get it at

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.920
your house, it comes with that
oil slick on the top.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.530
What is that?

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.280
That's your cheese that has been
overcooked, and the fat

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.660
and the whey is separated.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.210
And that's what ends up being--
because cheese is fat.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.620
It's going to turn greasy
when you break it.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.140
What happens when you make
mayonnaise and it separates?

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.130
Separate the egg and the mustard
and the lemon juice

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:30.740
from the fat.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.480
It separates.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.430
You wouldn't want to eat just
the greasy part of the

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.480
mayonnaise, just the fat part.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.000
You want to eat the combination,
the whipped

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.850
together, the emulsified fat.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.330
So in Serious Pie, we worked on
the crust for three months.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.280
We kept working on it,
working on it.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.200
Because we started with the
assumptions that it has to be

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.090
similar to what we know.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.830
And then as we got into it more
and more, we realized

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.360
that it has to be opposite of
what we know if it's going to

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.490
be a game changer.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.660
Why would I open a pizzeria if
it wasn't a game changer?

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.070
I'm not in it for the money.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.500
I'm in it for the passion.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.040
I like to make money, but it's
not my end-- my end game is to

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.920
make as good a pie as I
can make, something

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.600
that makes me happy.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.735
And so three months later,
we had this crust.

00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:08.480
It started with high-gluten
flour.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.610
All the other pizzerias, all
these Neapolitan style pizzas

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.900
they cook at 800 degrees, 850,
for a minute and a half with

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.130
double zero flour,
totally opposite.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.520
Very low gluten--

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.110
very high gluten in our flour.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.540
We have a much more
structured dough.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.560
It takes three days to make.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.650
When we run out of dough
tonight, we can't make any

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:27.340
more dough.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.150
It's three days for that
dough to happen.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.460
So we just close
the restaurant.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.600
It boils up-- the black boils
on it happen beautifully.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.690
It's probably the only thing
we changed about the pie.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.510
Because I love the black
boils on a crust.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.230
And my customers were sending
it back before they

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.000
would even try it.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.320
They'd say, hey,
this is burnt.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.330
And we were having this issue.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.860
And finally, I gave
a little bit and

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.760
sent it out dark brown.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.620
But I love the black
boils, that crusty,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.930
black, burnt flavor.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.250
We just--

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.170
simple things like extra
virgin olive oil.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.890
We use the best cheeses in the
world, and less of them, and

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.980
then we treat them correctly.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.290
How many people put herbs on the
pizza after it comes out

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.740
of the oven?

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.650
Herbs lose 90% of their flavor
if they're cooked.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.200
If you put them on after and let
the residual heat of the

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.010
pie bring out the fragrance of
those herbs, you have a much

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.190
different pizza experience.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.040
And so that's what we do.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.250
We have cheese and
herb afterwards.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.750
We put fresh extra virgin olive
oil on afterwards so

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.890
they get that good
olive-y flavor.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:33.190
And then we cook at 625 degrees
for six and a half to

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.390
seven minutes.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:38.020
So we had a real structured
crust already, and then that

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.390
slow bake cooks it all the way
through, compared to the

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.030
minute and a half at 850.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.320
So it's just a pie that
we thought about.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.420
And that's what happens when you
think about something and

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.950
throw away all the rules.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.100
And it sounds like maybe that
happens around here

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.745
once and a while too.

00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:55.100
AUDIENCE: Tom, I had a
quick question too.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.220
You've worked with the same
co-author for many your

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:57.860
cookbooks--

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.300
TOM DOUGLAS: Shelley?

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.600
AUDIENCE: --and this
one specifically.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.970
Could you describe how that
collaboration process works,

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.830
and how you go about
writing your books?

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.310
TOM DOUGLAS: Sure.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.940
So Shelley Lance is
my co-author.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.550
She was a saute cook for me at a
restaurant before I owned my

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.660
own places.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.060
So we've worked together now for
27 years, I want to say.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.950
And she's crotchety.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.730
She is a whiner.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.790
And so her, a busy night on the
line just was not the best

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.850
thing ever.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.040
And so we always looked for jobs
to get Shelley off the

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.740
line, because she had the best
palate in the company.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.260
And I didn't want to lose her
sense of food, just very, very

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.500
organic, natural, passionate
sense for food.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.640
And so we finally moved her into
the baking, and then she

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.500
started doing the baking.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.010
And then once we got to be
multiple units, once we got to

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.660
be three restaurants,
she became our

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.840
quality control person.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.860
So her job was to eat in each of
the restaurants every week,

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.000
and then write a
report for me.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.900
Because at that point, I was
starting to travel more.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.110
And now was she can't even keep
up with that, now that we

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.550
have 13 places.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.290
She is just our blog editor,
and our author.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.690
And she is really persnickety.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.550
"Food and Wine" magazine in
their review called it the

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.490
best-tested recipes they'd
ever come across, because

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.680
Shelley does that.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.650
Every recipe is tested
five times--

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.880
three by chefs, two
by home cooks--

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.680
and Shelley is the coordinator
of all of that.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.160
So when you go to make the
effort to cook, it's going to

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.890
come out the way we tell you
it's going to come out.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.810
So Cliff, that is why,
where we went to.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:35.100
Yes?

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.040
AUDIENCE: How long does it
take to write a cookbook?

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.430
TOM DOUGLAS: So the question is,
how long does it take to

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.590
write a cookbook?

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.470
AUDIENCE: From start
to finish.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.280
TOM DOUGLAS: From
start to finish.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.930
Well, if you're as ADD as
me, it takes longer.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.980
If I were to just sit down and
do it, I could do it in less

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.490
than a month--

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.100
not all the testing, and
not all that part.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.590
But writing the book, I
could do it no time.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:01.310
But doing it on airplanes and
weekends and all the times

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.350
that you happen to be in the
mood to write the right part

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.400
of the book, just the head notes
and the introduction and

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.150
things of that sort, they
take me a long time.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.800
We worked on this book
for almost two years.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.710
And I would say it's still
old school publishing.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.500
Things are changing.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.680
I'm surprised that my publisher

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.360
took that long, honestly.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.660
When I did my first
book, it was a

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.710
two-an-a-half-year process.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.800
Now it's a two-year process.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.590
I would've thought
they'd be faster.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.360
The good news is that it's
a really good book.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.000
Came out nice.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.900
Ed Anderson, a San Francisco
photographer, did the

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.690
photographs.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.710
It's printed in country, which
makes it easier for reprints,

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.070
and for all of those
kind of things.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.720
That's a big challenge, to not
spend three months on a boat

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.960
coming from someplace else.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.180
So that's been nice, compared
to my other books.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.590
It's already in its
second printing.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.240
It's been out for a week.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.810
My first book is in
its 14th printing.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.480
So, I mean, one of the things
I'm most proud about is, our

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.530
books work.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.660
And that takes extra time.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.340
And that takes dollars, to make
a recipe five times and

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.950
pay five different chefs to do
it, and then to do it again a

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.800
sixth time for a photograph.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.770
We spend a lot of money
to make sure that

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.020
everything is good.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.760
AUDIENCE: I wanted to touch more
on what you said, that

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.390
how Americans are having this
attachment to restaurants.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.270
We're, like, using it as
a hub of socializing.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.260
Have you seen that to be the
case in other countries?

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.550
I've been told that other
countries don't go to

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.900
restaurants as much as we do.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.650
I wanted to get your perspective
on that.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.130
TOM DOUGLAS: Well,
I think that--

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.820
I think every country
goes to restaurants.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.820
I would--

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.250
if you go to Hong Kong, the
restaurants are packed.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.440
It's hard to break out which
is tourism, which is not.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.740
Same in San Francisco.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.070
San Francisco gets over 40
million tourists a year.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.510
Seattle gets 10.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.400
It's hard to say
who gets what.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.900
If you took tourism out of San
Francisco, you'd have half the

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.130
number of restaurants
to choose from.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.060
It's an important part of
giving you the depth and

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.530
breadth of restaurants
that you have.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.120
In other countries, having just
spent five weeks in Paris

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:14.410
last October, you know, you
could put dog shit on a plate.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.190
There are so many people there
looking for cuisine

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.420
traditional.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.080
And there's not a Parisian
cooking it.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.510
There's a lot of North Africans
cooking it, just like

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.710
there's a lot of Latinos
in our kitchens.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.290
They're not connected to the
food in the same way.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.030
They're certainly
terrific cooks.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.710
But I don't know how it is
down here, but in our

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:38.260
kitchens, when one of our Latino
cooks wants to eat, he

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.910
or she would definitely rather
eat off of their own staff

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:45.120
meal than any of our menus.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.360
And that's what you find
in Italy, and in--

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.900
like, in Tuscany or areas like
that, you go to 10 restaurants

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.720
in Florence.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.270
Nine of them have exactly
the same menu.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.806
So they eat out, but if you ask
a Parisian today, where do

00:26:56.806 --> 00:26:57.890
you want to go for dinner
tonight, they go out for

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.580
French food.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.540
They don't go out and so, I feel
like Vietnamese tonight,

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.310
or I feel like Chinese,
or I feel like

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.310
Mexican food tonight.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.100
They don't think that way.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.870
That's a uniquely
American thing.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.970
And I'm thankful for it.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.210
My food definitely
reflects that.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.810
It sure seems like the
restaurants and cafes are busy

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:14.350
everywhere.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.740
London, you could hardly
get into a restaurant.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.620
Paris, the same way.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.580
I went thinking no reservations
and no stars, and

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.110
the only thing I had to change
was no reservations.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:25.770
I had to get reservations, or
else you eat at the worst of

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.770
the worst restaurants
in Paris.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.720
In Milan, some of the best food,
going, but got to have a

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.190
reservation.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.690
But it's very much
Milanese food.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.280
There's a reason for that.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.640
People, they live on tourism.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.990
And when people get there,
they don't want to

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.550
eat Chinese in Italy.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.040
Whereas in America, we're
a melting pot.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.040
You'd just as soon have-- we
have some of the best Chinese

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.970
restaurants in the world right
here in this country.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.280
Any other thoughts about
restaurants?

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.640
Yes?

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.150
OK.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:54.750
Oh, there you are.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.230
AUDIENCE: How do you stay--
or maybe you don't.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.540
How do you stay on top of food
trends, and, I don't know,

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.760
embrace them, and then
kind of make sure--

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.820
TOM DOUGLAS: That we're
part of the--

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.840
part of the conversation?

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.080
Without kind of coming
in too late.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.410
TOM DOUGLAS: Well, it's probably
the same as you do.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:13.350
You look around, and I eat
around everywhere, to make

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.740
sure that what we're doing is
current and now and delicious.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.580
And I got to say, the left coast
of this country is the

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.740
trendsetter.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.740
When you look at what's
happening in San Francisco,

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:30.370
and Seattle, and Portland, and
Vancouver, BC, and LA, there's

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.040
just no doubt that the best food
is happening on this side

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.500
of the country.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.870
You look in London and Paris,
some of the best restaurants

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:40.650
in Paris are being run by
American chefs, whether it's

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.470
spring or Verjus.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.460
It's not just American chefs,
but it's French chefs that

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.910
have been on the road through
the Americas.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.240
It's fascinating.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.840
This country is so willing to
accept change and growth,

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.660
unlike other cultures in the
food world, that it's probably

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.370
why Google does what it does.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:00.310
We're so willing to accept
the next new thing.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:02.740
And that's harder for other
countries that are steeped in

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.770
tradition than a young country
like this one, a melting pot

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:06.930
like this one.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.860
I think the trends really
are leaning themselves--

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.970
I know just Amazon alone in my
neighborhood in Seattle has

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.830
2,000 Indians working there.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.170
And we have virtually no modern
Indian restaurant in

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.030
the city, nothing that I would
be proud to say, this is a

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:20.830
great Indian restaurant.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.140
You should check this out.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:22.790
It's just the way it is.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:25.880
So there's no doubt that modern
Indian is going to be

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.850
the next wave of food.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.710
And we're already getting--
there's one in Vancouver that

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.100
I love called Vij's.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.540
And we're getting a second--

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.790
the new offshoot of Vij's is
happening in Seattle, in Lake

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.450
Union, in two weeks.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:39.200
So that's what I'm
looking for.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.690
And then I'm looking to break
India down like China got

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.710
broken down, the Szechuan
and Hunan and Canton.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.510
And as soon as India gets broken
down, I think that's

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.290
going to be very interesting,
not just southern and

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:51.510
northern, but regional
aspects of Indian

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.840
food, and Asia in general.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.450
AUDIENCE: Typically the chefs
that I watch on TV, like

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.000
Gordon Ramsay, they have
a signature dish.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.770
And I was wondering, like,
what would be--

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.350
TOM DOUGLAS: His signature
dish is fuck you.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.700
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.210
TOM DOUGLAS: That's all
he says, isn't it?

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:06.410
Every other word's a bleep.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.695
AUDIENCE: I think I chose
a bad example.

00:30:07.695 --> 00:30:10.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.570
TOM DOUGLAS: Would you ever work
at a restaurant if that's

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:12.860
what you thought that
they were like?

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:12.952
AUDIENCE: No.

00:30:12.952 --> 00:30:13.570
I wouldn't.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.120
TOM DOUGLAS: No.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.230
It's ridiculous.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.110
AUDIENCE: But, you know, what
would be a dish that you would

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.890
like to be associated
with the most,

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.530
like, one of your dishes?

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.804
TOM DOUGLAS: Of my dishes?

00:30:24.804 --> 00:30:26.960
It's probably with my oldest
restaurant, which is the

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.640
Dahlia Lounge.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.950
And we do this slow roasted duck
there that gets marinated

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.190
for two days, and then
five hours slow

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.930
roasted over a wood fire.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.110
And it just is beautifully
rendered and gets to a

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.080
fall-off-the-bone texture, which
I don't think you see

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.230
much in duck these days.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.800
Everywhere you go, it's either a
confit leg and a sliced rare

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.290
breast, or it's just
the rare breast.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.660
Well, I like a whole roasted
duck, just like I like a

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.400
fall-off-the-bone chicken.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.530
And we do it there.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.370
It's got a kind of a--

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:58.570
we call it a [? diki ?] rub, or
Chinese 12 spice, or some--

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:02.940
it's got this kind of
aromatic rub on it.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.760
And then when we pull that off,
we let them cool, and

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.840
they're just these lacquered
brown color from the rub and

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.000
the wood smoke.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.650
And then we break them down into
a thigh leg piece and a

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:13.680
breast piece.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.230
And then when you come into the
restaurant and you order

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.300
it, we take those and we put
them skin side down on a

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:21.850
sizzle platter, and just render
that skin until--

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.960
it looks black in the dining
because the dining room is

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.550
naturally darker than
the kitchen.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:29.820
But it's just this caramelized
toasty brown, like the outside

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.790
of a toasted almond that has
the skin still on it.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:36.380
It's dark like that.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.370
And it is glorious.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.610
And we'll serve it
with a little

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:40.830
quick stir fried gai-lan--

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.140
a Chinese broccoli-- or a wide,
fresh rice noodle made

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.526
in Chinatown in our city--

00:31:46.526 --> 00:31:49.050
Chu Chong noodle company.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.220
I love that kind of thing.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.980
AUDIENCE: What do you think of
the technological advances of

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.000
cooking, like using dry ice,
and the other things that

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.500
Myhrvold is kind of exploring?

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.170
TOM DOUGLAS: I think it's all
perfectly interesting.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.110
The young chefs are really
enamored with it, which I

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:09.350
think anything that gets them
engaged is great by me.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.770
In "The Modernist Cuisine"-- do
you know what he's talking

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.060
about, the book "Modernist
Cuisine"?

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:18.610
Where it talks about, not just
the new cooking styles, but

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.840
also it explains cooking in
general, from what happens in

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.610
a hot wok, to what happens
on your charcoal grill.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.120
How is that affecting the meat
or fish that you put right on

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.040
top of it, and the
caramelization process, and

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.970
all of those sorts of things.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.350
I think it's interesting now,
right now, Williams Sonoma,

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.930
Sur La Table, they all have home
sous-vide machines that

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.910
you can buy and take home
and do your own process.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:44.240
But sous-vide's been around
for 60 years.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.290
That's nothing new.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.870
I was using sous-vide on
Northwest Airlines,

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:51.420
15, 20 years ago.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.880
I love that it explains what's
going on in your kitchen.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.870
They cut the microwave
in half to show you

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:57.820
exactly what it is.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.930
I've been to the lab.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.200
I had my 42-course dinner
in the lab.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.300
I got to tell you, it's
not all that.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.450
It's certainly not
more delicious.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:08.220
It's just more--

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.280
it's interesting.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.760
It's centrifuges and
liquid nitrogen.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.340
I had what he called
the perfect ribs.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.870
I think in the new home
version of "Modernist

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.030
Cuisine," they call it perfect
ribs, where you drop them into

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:24.920
a nitrogen container and
freeze them rock hard--

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.130
just the outside, just
freeze the skin

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.090
rock hard on the outside.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.520
So it's like five seconds in
nitrogen, and then 10 seconds

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.910
in a deep fryer, because all he
wants to do is not change

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.350
the structure of the meat on
the inside with either

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:39.890
manipulation.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.730
So he wants that perfectly
smoky rib on the inside.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:46.500
But by freezing the outside
first, it takes that much

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:51.740
longer in the fryer to heat the
inside, so when you do the

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.840
deep fryer, it only changes the
skin texture, which gives

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.260
you a crisp skin.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.440
And the inside stays exactly
the same because it was so

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.040
cold to begin with, when
it went in the fryer.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.360
So those are the kind and
thoughtful things that come

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:02.730
out of that.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.240
I'm all for it.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.670
At the end of the day, food
manipulation is just that,

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.630
whether you're doing it with
nitrogen, or if you're doing

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:11.929
it on charcoal grill.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:15.170
You are manipulating
an end product.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.889
So at the beginning of the
day-- so that's at

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:17.400
the end of the day.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.540
At the beginning of the
day, what's important?

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.949
What kind of salmon is it?

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:24.500
Where do they come from?

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.234
How is it caught?

00:34:25.234 --> 00:34:26.489
Is it sustainably caught?

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:28.960
So are you leaving fish for
the next generation?

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.794
So then, how was it caught?

00:34:30.794 --> 00:34:34.150
Was it bled right after it was
brought onto the boat?

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.719
Was it packed in ice?

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:38.719
Was it taken to shore on a day
boat rather than sitting out

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:41.199
on a trawler for the
three or four days?

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.130
Was it then flown to
your restaurant?

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:44.590
When you touch it, does
it have bright

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.320
eyes and bright scales?

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.630
When you run your finger across
the flesh, does the

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.960
flesh come off on your finger,
or does it stay right on the

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.760
fish where it should be, which
suggests that it's only been

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.130
out of the water a day or two?

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.470
What's important for a young
chef is to know those details.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.250
Because if you don't start with
a great product, I don't

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.660
care what you do at the end of
the day, you're going to have

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.840
shitty fish, just plain
and simple.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.380
So you have to have your basics
down to understand what

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.670
a good fish is to begin with,
and to buy the best products.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.980
And then as I tell my chefs,
is, get out of the way.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.060
Don't screw it up.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:20.070
It's like, what can you do to
a 25-pound beautiful king

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.850
salmon from the Copper River.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.480
What can you do that's going
to be better than that?

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.416
You can't.

00:35:25.416 --> 00:35:27.288
AUDIENCE: You can dry it.

00:35:27.288 --> 00:35:28.800
TOM DOUGLAS: You can dry it?

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.530
Yeah, you can--

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.760
you know what I'm saying.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.160
All you can do is try to get
out of the way and let that

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.310
fish be everything it can be.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.360
And to put it into a sous-vide,
and to all this

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.770
stuff, infuse it with herbs, and
all those kind of things,

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:43.400
you have to have a pretty big
ego to think that you're going

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.290
to do something better than that
fish is already showing.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:49.440
Or, then that fish could be done
in a $10 Chinese bamboo

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.520
steamer with a little bit of
green onion and a little bit

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.130
of garlic or a fresh
shred of ginger.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:59.200
What can you do that's
better than that?

00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.720
I'm sorry.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.910
You can't.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:02.400
Yes?

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.630
AUDIENCE: I have a
couple questions.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.110
One is, what is your
favorite of your

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.350
restaurants that you have?

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.840
TOM DOUGLAS: My favorite is--

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.910
only because it's where my
office is, it's where the

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:11.810
Palace Kitchen is.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.590
And it also serves full
dinner until 1 AM,

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.060
and I'm a late eater.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.400
We have restaurants that go
til midnight, and we have

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.570
catering that goes often late.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.430
We have concessions at the local
theaters that go late.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.780
And I love just bringing my
team back and eating late

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.540
dinner at the Palace Kitchen.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.110
AUDIENCE: And then my other
question was, when I moved

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.390
down here a year ago, there was
this big craze in Seattle

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.700
about the menu-less restaurants,
where you just

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.090
tell them what you're allergic
to, and then they

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:41.280
just provide food.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.700
Have you thought about doing
a concept like that?

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.790
TOM DOUGLAS: No.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:46.710
I'm not about the chef.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.820
I'm about you, the customer.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.840
And maybe that's totally what
you're interested in, but when

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.290
I go to a restaurant,
I like a menu.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.410
When the chef's--

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.690
I just ate in New York, and I
happened to run into some of

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.060
my favorite chefs.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.140
I ran into Jean-Georges
Vongerichten at Jean Georges.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.910
I ran into Mario Batali at
Babbo, Todd English at Todd

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.490
English food halls.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.960
I mean, it was crazy.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.805
I ran into Daniel
at Cafe Boulud.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.905
I know all these-- these
are my peers.

00:37:17.905 --> 00:37:19.390
I want to see what
they're doing.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:21.510
I don't want to just walk in and
have whoever they have the

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:22.740
kitchen do what they do.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.210
I want a menu.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.990
I want to mix and match.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:29.610
I might order four entrees.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.080
It's what I do.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.390
So no, I'm more about being the
customer and looking for

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.300
that great experience.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:36.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.180
Giada De Laurentiis is one of
my favorite Food Network

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:39.390
personalities.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:40.130
TOM DOUGLAS: Me too.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:42.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.000
TOM DOUGLAS: For other
reasons, probably.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.880
AUDIENCE: I love the way
she says "spa-gee-ti."

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.060
TOM DOUGLAS: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.240
AUDIENCE: But I was wondering
if you could talk about the

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.620
episode when she tried your
donuts, and kind of what that

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.710
interaction was like.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.380
TOM DOUGLAS: Sure.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.250
Well, just to go back a couple
of years from that, I was

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.650
doing a cover shot for
Thanksgiving for "Food and

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.120
Wine" magazine.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.330
We were on the cover maybe seven
or eight years ago now.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.950
And they sent a crew
out from New York.

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:13.580
And of course, I keep all sorts
of china at my house.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.090
I keep every set of china for
each of my restaurants, so

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:17.830
that when I'm trying something
at home, I can see what it

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:19.050
looks like on a plate.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.690
That's where it would
be served.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:23.760
And then I have 15 sets of china
of my own at my home, so

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.160
we have 30 sets of china
at our house.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.640
And so I'm getting
these calls.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.980
I have platters from
all over the world.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.680
I've got lots of stuff.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.040
If you want to see my kitchen,
as a matter of

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.220
fact, something kitchen--

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.360
fine cooking.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.020
"Fine Cooking" magazine, just
in the online version of

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.370
exploration of our kitchen.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:46.100
And it's in the magazine too,
but the online is a more

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.970
narrated version of
our home kitchen.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:51.360
But anyway, so "Food
and Wine" calls.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:51.920
Will you do this?

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.650
Of course I'll do it.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:53.770
Cover of "Food and
Wine" magazine?

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:54.740
Sure.

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.010
So then they sent
out their team.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.340
Well, the assistant food stylist
on that particular

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.230
shoot was Giada De Laurentiis,
before she got famous.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.530
And you know, of course,
who she's family of?

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.040
Dino De Laurentiis,
the famous movie

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.390
Hollywood movie producer.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.730
That's her grandfather.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.900
And a lot of people don't
remember, but he tried to do a

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.750
big food thing in New York
called "The Dino De Laurentiis

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.530
Food Show." And it
was based on--

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:22.100
have you ever been to Harrods
in London, in the food thing

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:22.750
in the basement?

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.570
Or Takashimaya in Tokyo,
with the big food

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:26.510
center in the basement?

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.130
It was based on that,
in Manhattan.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.550
You've been to Eataly
now in New York?

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.110
Anybody been to Eataly, where
you have that kind of food

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:36.800
interspersed with shopping,
or to Peck in Milan?

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.620
Really incredible mix of food
and restaurant and cafe.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.480
And he went--

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.210
nine months, the whole place
went under, in Manhattan-- her

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.570
grandfather.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:46.840
So anyway, she was the assistant
food stylist.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.850
Then she went on to get
her own little show.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.920
And between the teeth and the
cleavage, she is just kick--

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.870
and that little--

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.070
what did you say,
"spa-get-tee"?

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.800
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.240
She has killed it.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.000
So she called me--

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.930
her producer called me and
said can Giada come in?

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:03.590
And I said, certainly,
absolutely.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.510
And that was pretty much it.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.100
We sat and chatted for
a bit on camera.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.540
And I don't think I made
the camera at all.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.860
I have a face made for radio,
as they like to say.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:18.440
And I don't think I was in
that shot at all on TV.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.890
And she just said it.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:21.550
And you know, Tyler Florence
said the same

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:22.440
about Serious Pie.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.720
And that was a huge--

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.160
they keep replaying that too.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.560
And you know, I was on "Iron
Chef." I was up against

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.670
Morimoto on "Iron Chef." And
they keep replaying that also,

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:32.800
which is kind of interesting.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.410
Whenever they say it's just OK
to be on the show, it's not

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:36.820
better to win or lose.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.070
It's better to win.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.670
Because every time they
show it, like,

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.360
it's been on 100 times.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.610
I'm 100 and 0.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:45.920
Every time, I win.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.100
It's quite fantastic.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.200
And every time they show
Giada or Tyler, the

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.260
restaurants win again.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.320
We can just feel the punch the
next morning of people that

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.390
have seen it the night before.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.990
So it's kind of interesting.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:58.070
AUDIENCE: What's your
comfort food?

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.370
Or what would you want in the
center of-- near you, the

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.720
question you asked--

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.480
TOM DOUGLAS: Boy.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.200
You know, what's so fun
now is to have my

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.120
daughter cook for us.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.750
That's pretty comforting
to watch her

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.170
stroll about the kitchen.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.660
And she still thinks
I'm an OK dad.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.290
I think that's pretty cool.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.160
My comfort food?

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:22.510
I mean, I think something like
orecchiette with broccoli rabe

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.520
and Italian sausage.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.270
I could eat that every--
once a week, at least.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:29.310
I love that kind of stewy
kind of thing.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:31.850
That same salmon that I
talked about, just--

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:33.450
I take up a bamboo steamer.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:36.040
I take a plate with a well.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.060
I put my two pieces of fish when
my wife and I are eating,

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.210
grapes, fresh ginger, squeeze
little bit of the ginger

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:44.280
juice, little soy sauce, a
little pat of butter, maybe if

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.630
I have it, a couple slivers of
green onion, a little sake or

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:49.780
white wine.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.190
And then my next level up--

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.400
those steamers are
layered, right?

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.980
So next level up, I'd put a
little fresh baby bok choy.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.030
And then in my rice cooker, I
have rice with a little-- one

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.600
pod of star anise in there.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.160
So I have this beautiful kind of
fragrant steamed rice, this

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:12.960
perfectly steamed gorgeous piece
of fish, and a hot al

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.930
dente broccoli rabe.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:16.240
I just think that's comfort.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.340
So if I was cooking for myself,

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.560
that's my comfort food.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.800
If my wife's cooking, I like
the sausage and rabe.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.050
She's Italian Greek.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.590
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.420
Do you have any favorite
restaurants in San Francisco?

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.320
TOM DOUGLAS: Favorite
restaurants in San Francisco?

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.160
Of course I do.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.710
I'm part owner of a restaurant
in San Francisco.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.150
Has anyone been to Prospect?

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.640
Yeah?

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.210
What did you think?

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.680
Don't say anything bad.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.620
Yeah, I liked it.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.750
That's sort of OK.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.735
TOM DOUGLAS: You live above it
and you haven't been there?

00:42:45.735 --> 00:42:46.810
You cheap son of a bitch.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:47.320
What do you--

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.650
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.360
TOM DOUGLAS: I'm trying
to make a living here!

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.280
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.080
AUDIENCE: I'd like to go, it's
a nice restaurant, but it's

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.340
like, I live right--

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:54.760
I don't know.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.130
I've been putting it off.

00:42:57.130 --> 00:42:58.500
TOM DOUGLAS: I guess.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.910
So Prospect is a sister
restaurant to Boulevard.

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:04.875
And I've been long many year
friends with Nancy Oaks, who

00:43:04.875 --> 00:43:07.050
owns Boulevard.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:10.400
They were going to start a new
restaurant group down here.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.093
And I don't even know
the name of it.

00:43:12.093 --> 00:43:13.510
I invested so long ago.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:14.870
I've invested in a ton
of restaurants.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.040
I never get a dime back.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.710
And so here, I'm part
owner of Prospect.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:23.150
I kind of had visions at some
point that maybe Serious Pie

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:24.920
would come down here and
they would run it.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.975
That's an interesting
angle to me.

00:43:27.975 --> 00:43:29.220
AUDIENCE: Do it.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:29.620
TOM DOUGLAS: Do it.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.060
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.070
TOM DOUGLAS: But, you
know, what's your

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:32.840
favorite pizza down here?

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.540
Like, A16 or something
like that, right?

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.180
That's a very different pie.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.500
That's more the Neapolitan
style pie.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.370
And it's just--

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:45.710
I'm always curious if my pie
will go well someplace else,

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:48.032
because it's so different.

00:43:48.032 --> 00:43:49.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:51.000
TOM DOUGLAS: Anywhere.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.940
First potato pizza I ever
had, the potato rosemary

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.245
pizza was in Rome.

00:43:54.245 --> 00:43:56.580
And I was just smitten by it.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.050
It was so delicious.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.100
But in Rome, the crusts
are very thick.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.870
A lot of the pizzerias in Rome,
they're kind of rolled

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:06.890
out into sheet pans, and more
like a focaccia base, and then

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.030
the toppings right on there.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.380
Finally, someone in a chef
coat speaking up,

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:12.815
representing.

00:44:12.815 --> 00:44:14.543
AUDIENCE: I'm off shift.

00:44:14.543 --> 00:44:16.020
TOM DOUGLAS: You're off shift.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.610
Did I scare everyone else away,
or do they have to go

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:18.150
back to work?

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.760
AUDIENCE: They had to
go back to work.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.190
TOM DOUGLAS: OK.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:20.470
AUDIENCE: I start super early.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:21.520
I want to own my own bakery.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.470
I'm in the very, very beginning
stages right now.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.600
[INAUDIBLE] working.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.980
And, what would you say
is your best advice?

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.130
I mean, the first few things
you think of when you're

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:34.720
talking to someone who
wants to start--

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.370
TOM DOUGLAS: Right.

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.370
So have you worked in
other bakeries?

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:37.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.510
I've been in the industry for
almost nine years now.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:41.730
TOM DOUGLAS: And have you worked
in some independent

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.160
bakeries, so you know
the pitfalls of

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.130
doing everything yourself?

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:44.525
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:44.525 --> 00:44:46.670
TOM DOUGLAS: Because sometimes
people forget about, you have

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.180
to do the books, and you
have to do the hiring.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:48.890
AUDIENCE: That's my hardest
part right now.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.210
TOM DOUGLAS: You can't just
make cookies, right?

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.800
TOM DOUGLAS: You have to get
all that other stuff done.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.540
Have you been in bakeries
that you like?

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.020
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.580
There's lots in the
city that I love.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.340
SusieCakes, I kind of want to go
that direction of pies and

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.290
cookies and bars, and still
cupcakes, but not--

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:06.670
everyone's cupcakes right
now, and I don't

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:07.640
want to only do that.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.010
TOM DOUGLAS: Right.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:13.240
I went to-- this morning, I went
to Craftsman and Wolves.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.040
Have you been there yet?

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:14.580
AUDIENCE: No.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.240
TOM DOUGLAS: On Valencia.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.080
It's down near where
Tartine is.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.920
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.280
TOM DOUGLAS: And that's much
more of a Pierre Herme style

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.650
bakery out of Paris, very
chi-chi, a little bit

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:28.210
laudreeish, without the
drama, but the same

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:29.145
kind of looking pastries.

00:45:29.145 --> 00:45:30.870
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:32.090
TOM DOUGLAS: Interesting
to try, but curious

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:32.890
if they make it.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:37.150
It's a hard sell in this town to
sell $7, $8, $10 desserts,

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.890
this big, in a place where you
don't really have any seating.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:44.970
So I'll be curious
how that goes.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.247
What else would I say?

00:45:46.247 --> 00:45:47.810
Know your neighborhood.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:48.760
Know your customer.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.610
Know what you want.

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.780
And then be willing to make the
adjustments once you get

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.430
open, to let your ego get out of
the way and realize that if

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:56.840
these folks don't walk
through your front

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.850
door, you're screwed.

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.900
And they might once, but they
have to walk through

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.420
more than one time.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.780
You have to learn a customer
service that is inviting and

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.470
makes them want to come back.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:12.120
And that's the number
one thing.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.570
So many chefs go in, they want
to open their own place

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:15.700
because they want to
cook their food.

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.540
Well, screw you.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.650
Your food is their food.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:19.862
That's who you owe to.

00:46:19.862 --> 00:46:22.300
And if they don't come back and
vote for you with their

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.880
dollars, you're done.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.610
And that's why you see the
restaurant churn so often.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:30.120
Because 75% of restaurants go
out of business through

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.180
employee theft.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.510
And the other 25% go out of
business because the chefs are

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.050
stupid, and they're egomaniacs
and they can't

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.390
get their act together.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:41.330
They have their tunnel vision
on what they do rather than

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:43.720
business as a bigger picture.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.770
Employee theft, you've probably
all benefited from.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:47.450
When's the last time you went to
a restaurant where you knew

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:49.730
the bartender, he handed you
a drink, didn't charge you?

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:50.810
That's employee theft.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:53.530
I'm sure he didn't go to the
till and pay for it himself.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.040
It's the most-- it's nice.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.180
We call it customer
service sometimes.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.300
But that's just-- that's
employee theft.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.770
And it happens through
the back door.

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:02.230
It happens through
the front door.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:06.130
And it is something that
you can't really stop.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.580
You just have to mitigate
the damage from it.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.540
But that's something to think
about building into your

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.410
pricing structure.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:15.170
And in bakeries, it's
all about waste.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:18.230
What do you do with those
cookies you didn't sell today?

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:19.480
There's a lot of--

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:24.420
you have to-- if you make 20
cookies, you can't think--

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.470
if you made 24 cookies, say, out
of a recipe, and you think

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.850
how to price those cookies, it's
not just the ingredients

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:33.010
of the cost of the dough, or the
labor it takes you to make

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.030
the 24 cookies.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.566
It's at the end of the
day, how many did you

00:47:35.566 --> 00:47:36.630
have to throw away?

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.350
So if you had to throw away
six of the 24, you have to

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:42.610
build the cost of those six back
into your first 18, so

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:44.370
that you know what you
should properly be

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:46.450
charging for the cookie.

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.220
Unless you want to have--

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.240
unless you build in that number,
your numbers aren't

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.970
going to work.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:53.840
Be thinking about
those things.

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.900
And always, you can email me.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.326
I'm tom@tomdouglas.com.

00:47:56.326 --> 00:47:59.640
And I really believe in
mentorship, and I'm happy to

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.240
share any sort of numbers
or anything like that.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.220
AUDIENCE: One final
question then.

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.520
How much of your cuisine in
your business do you think

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.250
just strictly comes
out of Seattle?

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.030
Do you think you would have had
a different path if you

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.860
started in Miami or another--

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.540
Chicago, another cultural
center?

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.440
And what you see is really
next for your empire?

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.190
TOM DOUGLAS: My empire
is kind of weird.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:26.225
You know, I'm the chef
for Amtrak Railroad.

00:48:26.225 --> 00:48:27.540
You probably didn't know that.

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.800
I'm the chef for Macy's
Corporation, one of 15 of us

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.670
on the culinary council
at Macy's.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.950
I'm the chef for Columbia
Crest Winery, the second

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:36.700
largest winery in America.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.320
So getting back to how do you
make your business, you have

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.260
to have these little things,
little things to intertwine to

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.010
help you pay the bills.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:46.860
Books help you get on TV and
get into Google, into

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:50.320
Microsoft and the Starbucks
campuses, and so I get to

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.890
spread your message.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.090
Where we end up,
I have no idea.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.420
We're starting a new grocery
line called Home Remedy right

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.230
now, which may or may not show
up, depending on how well it

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.310
tells the Seattle, in your
Draeger's Markets, in your

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:05.150
local grocery stores.

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.740
Who knows?

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.520
It's time to explore.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.000
I've been doing the restaurant
thing for 25 years.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.880
It's time to try a couple of
new things, so we're really

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.640
researching that right now.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.010
Thank you all for coming and
spending some of your

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:18.840
afternoon with me.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.600
I appreciate it.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.280
Where do they sign
up for books?

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.800
AUDIENCE: So, they're
forthcoming.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.180
But first of all, we
wanted to thank you

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.030
for coming to Google.

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:26.020
So thank you very much, Tom.

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:31.735
[APPLAUSE]
