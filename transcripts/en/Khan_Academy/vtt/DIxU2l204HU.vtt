00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.113
- [Voiceover] We've been working on

00:00:02.113 --> 00:00:04.344
an intuitive description
of the natural response

00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:06.209
of an LC circuit,

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:07.583
and in the last video,

00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:08.842
we got everything set up,

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.356
and now, we're ready to close the switch.

00:00:12.356 --> 00:00:14.273
Let's close our switch.

00:00:19.077 --> 00:00:21.994
And now our switch is closed again,

00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:26.614
and what happens?

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:28.307
Well, we had V naught.

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:30.424
We had some voltage on our capacitor,

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:32.417
and that means now we have some voltage

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.042
on our inductor.

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:35.720
That's what the switch closer did.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.310
So all of the sudden,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.833
our inductor finds itself
with some voltage across it,

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:42.678
so let's look at this equation here,

00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:44.543
the inductor equation.

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:46.935
And it says that V naught,

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:48.293
that's the starting voltage

00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:50.772
from the capacitor that we borrowed,

00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:53.772
is L times the slope of the current.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.709
Alright, so now we have a finite voltage,

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:02.724
and then we have a finite value on L,

00:01:02.724 --> 00:01:06.578
and that means that DI, DT is some number,

00:01:06.578 --> 00:01:08.930
and if we put positive charge up here,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.286
we know that V naught is positive.

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:12.784
So let's sketch that.

00:01:12.784 --> 00:01:16.534
Let's start a sketch of
what's going on here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.843
We're gonna plot together on the same plot

00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:30.973
the current in blue,

00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:33.679
and we'll put the voltage in orange,

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.816
and this is the time axis here.

00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:37.948
So, let's go back and check.

00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:39.373
What was our voltage when we started?

00:01:39.373 --> 00:01:43.206
Our voltage was V naught
when the switch closed.

00:01:44.148 --> 00:01:45.981
So I'll mark that out,

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:49.582
and what was the current when we started?

00:01:49.582 --> 00:01:51.337
The current was zero,

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:54.254
so here's a zero current down here.

00:01:57.194 --> 00:01:59.039
And now we're gonna sketch
in what we think happens

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.984
right after the switch closes.

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:03.144
So we decided that there was gonna be

00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:04.977
some kind of a DI, DT.

00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:09.184
DI, DT equals V naught over L.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.398
I'm just gonna sketch this in.

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:18.294
There's gonna be some rising slope.

00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:21.975
There's gonna be some
positive slope on the current.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.272
Alright, so we took our first step.

00:02:24.272 --> 00:02:26.869
Now, the other thing that's
happening here is that Q,

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:27.908
what is Q doing?

00:02:27.908 --> 00:02:30.617
Let's track our charge.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.383
Q is actually gonna start
flowing out of this guy.

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:36.184
This is the current that
we're talking about.

00:02:36.184 --> 00:02:38.436
DI, DT, this is a finite current,

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:40.074
and that current is made of the charge

00:02:40.074 --> 00:02:41.788
that's in the capacitor,

00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:43.936
so that current starts flowing around

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:45.649
and running around to the bottom side

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.452
of the capacitor, right?

00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:50.763
That means the amount of charge on the top

00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:52.504
is going down,

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.519
which means that the
voltage is going down.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.032
So let's sketch in some voltage.

00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:58.454
The voltage is gonna start going down

00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:02.121
because the charge is
leaving the capacitor.

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:05.970
Alright, so far, so good.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.218
So let's keep going back and forth

00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:09.453
between the inductor and capacitor,

00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:12.984
and see how the voltage
and current changes,

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.488
and the way we do that is we just look

00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:16.136
at the equation we had.

00:03:16.136 --> 00:03:20.772
Now, the voltage on the
inductor is not V naught anymore.

00:03:20.772 --> 00:03:22.605
It's changed to DI, DT

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.233
equals whatever V is over L,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.326
and we notice that V
went down a little bit.

00:03:32.326 --> 00:03:33.248
So that means what?

00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:35.026
That means the slope of the current

00:03:35.026 --> 00:03:36.835
went down a little bit.

00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:38.879
So let me make a little shallower version

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.379
of the slope here.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.015
Alright, now what happened
next to the voltage?

00:03:46.015 --> 00:03:50.095
A little more charge
has left the capacitor,

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:52.102
headed over to the opposite plate,

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:55.769
so the voltage is gonna
continue to go down.

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.806
So now we're just gonna edge forward

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.779
moment to moment and see what happens.

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.470
Every time the voltage goes down,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.596
the slope of the current

00:04:04.596 --> 00:04:07.505
gets a little shallower, right?

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:09.083
And then the voltage continues to drop

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:10.877
because the current's leaving,

00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:15.520
and eventually, that
voltage is gonna reach zero,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.865
and at the point the voltage reached zero,

00:04:17.865 --> 00:04:21.400
the slope of the current is zero.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.229
The slope of the current is zero.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.187
So right when this happens,

00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:27.937
the slope of the current is zero.

00:04:30.027 --> 00:04:33.845
Now, the value of the
current is some number.

00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:36.466
Alright, so now we have
some value of current.

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:38.195
We have a zero voltage.

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:39.454
Now, when we have zero voltage,

00:04:39.454 --> 00:04:40.865
let's go back up here.

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:43.164
When this value of voltage is zero here,

00:04:43.164 --> 00:04:44.506
when this guy is zero,

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:45.864
that means that Q is zero,

00:04:45.864 --> 00:04:47.066
and what that means is that

00:04:47.066 --> 00:04:50.419
the charge on either side of the capacitor

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.703
is equalized.

00:04:51.703 --> 00:04:53.131
The same charge exists on the top

00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:56.542
and the bottom of the capacitor.

00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:59.003
That's what this means here.

00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:00.181
So in our next moment,

00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:02.503
what's gonna happen next?

00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:03.659
Does the voltage go flat?

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.388
Does it go flat sideways?

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:06.264
Does it go up?

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.162
Does it go down?

00:05:07.162 --> 00:05:08.203
What does it do?

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:09.927
What does the current do?

00:05:09.927 --> 00:05:12.006
Let's figure it out.

00:05:12.006 --> 00:05:14.137
So I see we have a finite current.

00:05:14.137 --> 00:05:15.984
Okay, what that means is

00:05:15.984 --> 00:05:18.034
the charge is continuing to flow

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:18.883
in what direction?

00:05:18.883 --> 00:05:20.439
In this direction here,

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:24.299
charge is continuing to flow like this,

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:25.603
and what's happening now

00:05:25.603 --> 00:05:27.474
is we're getting excess plus charges

00:05:27.474 --> 00:05:30.641
flowing on this side of the capacitor.

00:05:33.128 --> 00:05:34.864
So we're actually building
up positive charge

00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:37.465
on the bottom plate of the capacitor,

00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:38.683
and what that means is,

00:05:38.683 --> 00:05:39.665
the charge is reversed,

00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:41.934
so the voltage is reversed,

00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:44.796
and that tells us that we're gonna have

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:46.160
a negative voltage.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.778
It's gonna start to grow here.

00:05:48.778 --> 00:05:49.880
I have a negative voltage.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.296
I go back to my inductor equation.

00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:54.321
This value of V right here,

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.854
this is now negative,

00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:57.515
so that means the DI, DT

00:05:57.515 --> 00:05:58.988
has a negative slope,

00:05:58.988 --> 00:06:03.030
and negative slope looks like
it's sloping down like this.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.946
It starts to roll over and slope down,

00:06:05.946 --> 00:06:08.029
and a little less current

00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:12.983
means a little less slope on the voltage.

00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:16.871
Now this positive current's gonna continue

00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:17.704
to keep flowing.

00:06:17.704 --> 00:06:19.982
It's gonna continue to deliver charge

00:06:19.982 --> 00:06:21.328
to the bottom edge,

00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:24.411
to the bottom plate of the capacitor.

00:06:25.578 --> 00:06:27.143
At some point, that current will actually

00:06:27.143 --> 00:06:29.054
go through zero again,

00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:30.976
and if we look at this situation,

00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:32.991
this is where we started from.

00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:35.127
This is almost the
situation we started in.

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:37.327
There's zero current,

00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:38.577
and there's a--

00:06:40.102 --> 00:06:41.614
This time it's a negative voltage.

00:06:41.614 --> 00:06:43.245
We started at a high voltage,

00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:44.453
and we went to a negative voltage.

00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:46.902
This voltage here happens to be

00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:47.985
minus V naught,

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:50.389
and the reason is

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.992
is that all the charge
that was on the top now

00:06:52.992 --> 00:06:55.558
has made a trip all the
way around to the bottom.

00:06:55.558 --> 00:06:57.759
So the situation is perfectly reversed

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.737
from when we started.

00:06:59.737 --> 00:07:00.952
Now, because of that symmetry,

00:07:00.952 --> 00:07:02.650
we're not gonna make
this video any longer.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.445
I'm just gonna say that this situation

00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:06.609
will repeat itself.

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:11.197
Basically, the voltage will
curl back down like that,

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.614
and the current will do this.

00:07:15.012 --> 00:07:18.012
Woops, let's just keep sketching in.

00:07:19.323 --> 00:07:21.298
So we've repeated the same story

00:07:21.298 --> 00:07:22.900
that we did at the beginning part

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.107
of the curve over here,

00:07:24.107 --> 00:07:26.474
just with the voltage sign reversed.

00:07:26.474 --> 00:07:28.363
And now we reach another state.

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:30.778
Now we have zero volts

00:07:30.778 --> 00:07:33.930
and we have a negative current here,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.399
and what we look at is we
duplicated this situation here,

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:40.414
just with the opposite
sign of the current.

00:07:40.414 --> 00:07:42.719
There's positive current,

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:45.081
and here's zero voltage.

00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.578
Now we have zero voltage
and a negative current,

00:07:47.578 --> 00:07:50.213
so the whole story I told over here

00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:51.653
is gonna be in reverse.

00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:55.236
This charge now is
gonna reverse direction.

00:07:56.987 --> 00:07:59.487
Let's take out all our arrows,

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:05.235
and all the charge we had

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:09.358
is gonna start flowing back
around this way like that.

00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:10.780
This positive charge that we had

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.080
is gonna flow around

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.567
and meet up with the negative charge

00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:16.243
that we accumulated up here,

00:08:16.243 --> 00:08:18.208
and that's what's going on

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.856
in this part of the cycle,

00:08:20.856 --> 00:08:21.971
and we can continue on.

00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:23.464
Basically, this is gonna go

00:08:23.464 --> 00:08:26.047
the same exact story like that,

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.107
and this, the current, will do the same,

00:08:32.107 --> 00:08:32.940
and we began.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.463
We've come back to the same exact point

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:36.746
as the starting point.

00:08:36.746 --> 00:08:40.618
Now we've replicated our starting point.

00:08:40.618 --> 00:08:42.109
So what's gonna happen next?

00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:43.599
Well, what happens next is the same thing

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.027
that happened in the beginning,

00:08:45.027 --> 00:08:48.025
and this curve actually repeats itself

00:08:48.025 --> 00:08:50.121
as long as we let this circuit

00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:51.704
sit here like this.

00:08:52.785 --> 00:08:54.370
So I don't have to
continue with the story.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.995
It's basically a repetition of everything

00:08:55.995 --> 00:08:57.377
that happened here,

00:08:57.377 --> 00:08:59.112
and what we're gonna
get is a rocking motion

00:08:59.112 --> 00:09:01.057
on the voltage, back and forth,

00:09:01.057 --> 00:09:02.999
and we're gonna get a rocking motion

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:04.946
on the current, back and forth,

00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:07.613
as these energy storage elements

00:09:08.482 --> 00:09:12.649
change stored charge for
energy in the magnetic field,

00:09:13.549 --> 00:09:14.809
and back to stored charge,

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:18.849
and then it rocks back
and forth like that.

00:09:18.849 --> 00:09:20.486
So this is our intuitive explanation

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:22.446
of what happens in an LC circuit

00:09:22.446 --> 00:09:24.933
when we let it do its natural response.

00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:26.019
There'll be this rocking motion

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:27.319
back and forth,

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:28.293
and now in the next video,

00:09:28.293 --> 00:09:29.147
we're gonna go through

00:09:29.147 --> 00:09:32.438
and see how this comes out mathematically.
