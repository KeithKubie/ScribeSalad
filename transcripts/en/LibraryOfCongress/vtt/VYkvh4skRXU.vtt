00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.500
&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: As a proud
native Ohioan I am so thrilled

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.280
to introduce Ohioan by
choice, John Scalzi.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.150
[laughter] You may know him
from his Hugo Award winning--

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.100
or his Hugo Award nominated
"Old Man's War" series.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.400
Or maybe you've heard of him

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.060
from his Hugo Award
winning "Redshirts" series.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.930
Or perhaps like I did, you
discovered him on the internet

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.360
through his Hugo Award
winning blog, "Whatever".

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.770
He's won a lot of awards.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.740
[laughter] So, but Mr. Scalzi
has a particular place my heart

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.850
because he has written what is
perhaps the most expensive book

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.730
that I own, "Lock In",
which I allegedly stole

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.000
from the New York Public
Library several years ago and for

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.020
which I owe an undetermined
amount of money.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.590
[laughter] His new book, "The
Collapsing Empire" just came

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.830
out this spring and you can grab
a copy after this and get in line

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.130
for his book signing
which is at 4:30

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.130
on the lower level
on the expo floor.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.510
So, John Scalzi, the room is yours.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.680
[ Applause ]

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.980
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: I don't know
if this is the right place

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.490
to be announcing library crimes.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.350
[laughter] I mean the actual
librarian of Congress is here.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.650
[laughter] Right?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.290
But I guess, I guess she
you could pardon you, right?

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.100
She can pardon the library fines.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.720
That would actually be
pretty awesome because I have

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.570
to admit the Covina Public Library
has a shoot to kill order on me.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.670
[laughter] And justly so.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.970
Hi!

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.270
&gt;&gt; Hi!

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.570
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Boy, that sounded

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.060
like the world's biggest
AA meeting didn't it?

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.880
I am delighted to be here.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.990
I have been back to Washington,
D.C. since about 2012.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.620
I used to live in the area.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.930
I lived in Sterling, Virginia, and
I worked for America Online back

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.950 position:56%
when it was, you know, the
nineties equivalent of Facebook, so.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.610 position:56%
[laughter] And actually I'm
thrilled because at least one person

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.280
from my AOL days is
here at the moment

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.630 position:56%
and very excited to see old friends.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.700 position:56%
They, you know, they put up with me.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.950
I used to tell them, I'm going to
write a book one day and they're

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.580
like yes, [laughter]
I'm sure you will.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.880
But now I have so.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.270
So but what I'm going to do is I
usually do a thing where I read

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.150
from an upcoming book and I'm
not going to do that today

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.030
and I will tell you why,
which is that the up--

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.460
the excerpt from "Head On"
which is the upcoming book

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.210
which is based here in Washington,
DC, is a little bit of a downer.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.580
And I feel like we have enough
downerness [laughter] these days.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.610
And I think you folks here in
Washington, DC probably know

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.330
that better than almost
anybody else.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.350
So instead what I've decided to
do is I'm going to read a couple

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.000
of funny short pieces that are
from my short collection called

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.750
"Miniatures", which I think
will set the mood and then

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.150
if we have a little
time I might write,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.570
read a piece from "Whatever"
which is my blog.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.970
And then after that we'll just
go straight into the questions

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.970
and of course obviously you
see the microphones there.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.530
First things first, if
you have a cell phone

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.330
and I know you do,
please mute right now.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.630
That would be awesome.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.300
I have muted my own phone because
I've had the unfortunate thing

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.090
of telling people to mute their
phone and then my phone rings.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.390
[laughter] Which makes
me a hypocrite,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.580
but not this particular time.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.290
And if you do that I
would appreciate it.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.450
So I'm going to go ahead
and just dive right in.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.020
I think we can all
use some chuckles.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.350
And one of the things that I do

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.750
when I write short humorous science
fiction is I try to make it pieces

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.440
that sort of relate to
how people who are living

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.640
in the future would get along
with their day to day lives.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.860
Because you realize that in
some sense we are all living

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.410
in somebody's future, right?

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:21.980
If you went to 1117 and brought
somebody from that time forward

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.260
to now, they would be stunned
and confused and probably

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.970 position:56%
in a fetal position trying to figure
out what was going on with a world

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.420
that we just treat on a day to
day basis just like the world.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.720
It's the world we live in.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.850
I often actually use the cell
phone as a perfect example of this.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.570
If I could show the cell phone
to 17 year old me, right,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.540
it's like a supercomputer you hold
in your hand, can take pictures,

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.280
can connect you to every piece of
information that has ever existed,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.180
and we use it to take
pictures of cats.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.670
[laughter] Right?

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.390
And then the thing is that 17
year old me would be ahhhh,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.400
this is so amazing!

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.970
Do you realize how amazing it is?

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.840
And then I'd be like Siri
doesn't understand me.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.930
[laughter] Because this
is how you actually know

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.230
that you are living in the future.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.840
Not when your technology
does amazing things,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.230
but when you're annoyed
with your technology

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.200
because it's not doing it
exactly the way you want it to.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.520
So please understand that you
are living in an amazing future

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.800
for even 30 or 40 years ago.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.270
There are some parts of
it we could work on and,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.710
but by and large it's
kind of an amazing time.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.170
So 200, 300, 400 years from
now, these people are going

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.930
to be living their everyday
lives in these, you know,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.710
in what we would see absolutely
fantastical sort of situations.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.860
And to give an example of this I'm
going to do a piece which I think

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.740
for the folks in Washington, D.C.
might make a little bit of sense.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.260
It's called, "Important
Holidays on Gronghu".

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.130
And Gronghu is a planet.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.130
And the people who
are in the story--

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.500
or the person who's writing the
story is the diplomatic attache

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.120
talking to her staff.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.890
You know just like a diplomatic
attache would talk to her staff

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.910
in Liechtenstein or South
Korea or Andora or any

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.410
of those sorts of places.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.850 position:56%
And there are, you know, some
cultural misunderstandings that need

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.050
to be addressed and so she's going
to address them in this memo.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.190
And before I begin I want to
already congratulate the people

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.680
who are signing for me because
there are alien words in this

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.980
and they're going to
have fun with them.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.670
[laughter] So on behalf
of me to you, thank you.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.400
So here we go, "Important
Holidays on Gronghu".

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.050
To staff of the diplomatic mission
to Gronghu from Cynthia Hong,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.920
Ambassadorship to Gronghu.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.380
Regarding important
holidays on Gronghu.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.530
August 16, 2234.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.360
Dear Staff, It has
come to my attention

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.440
that there was recently a
thankfully minor incident

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.770
in which a low level member of
the diplomatic staff was fooled

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.890
into believing that August 13th
was Dequaninon [assumed spelling],

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.050
a fictional holiday on
Gronghu in which people ate off

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.690
of each other's plates to
celebrate community and trust.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.850
This resulted in the staff
member helping herself

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.750
to the Gronghu trade attache's
pudding in the embassy commissary.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.690
This was rightfully not very well
received by the trade attache who,

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.600
among every other thing,
is very fond of pudding.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.620
I do not blame the staff
member, although as a matter

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.920
of Gronhui diplomatic protocol
she must be publicly disciplined.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.490
Therefore, every staff
member not otherwise engaged

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.740
at 3:30 PM will meet
in the courtyard

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.710
to see her consumed by fire.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.020
[laughter] Please note
this is symbolic fire

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.360
which will be represented
by incense.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.900
Unfortunately we cannot fake the
other part which involves me having

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.200
to slap the staff member
across the face with a handful

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.470
of the aforementioned pudding.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:28.500
I do not like slapping staff
members, with or without pudding,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.230
even if it is required by protocol.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.960
I am sure the staff member
will like it even less.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.870
She has refused to name those who
have fooled her which I'm sure some

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.800
of you will find admirable.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.770
But to me it just means that these
pranksters are still at large

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.860
and may fool other staff members

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.840
into possibly more serious
breaches of courtesy.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.850
To avoid this, I have asked
the Gronghu Ministry of State

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.710
to provide us with a list of
upcoming Gronghuish celebrations

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.820
for the next several months.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.360
Please note that the
celebration dates here are only

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.660
for the next nine months.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.740
As you all know, while the
Gronghuish length of day is close

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.530
to our own, the year exceeds
ours by seven of our months.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.160 position:56%
This list will be updated with new
celebrations and dates as necessary.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.450
The following are in order of
their calendrical appearance.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:26.630
August 28, Fung Glue
Hoining [assumed spelling].

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.380
[laughter] This day celebrates
the birth of Fung Glue Hoin,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.330
noted philosopher and by fable
the inventor of the wuung,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.400
which as you all know, is
their version of cheese.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.240
It is celebrated by the
giving of wuung related gifts.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.920
You are encouraged to participate
but remember wuung can lead

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.260
to a moderate to severe
intestinal distress in humans.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:02.000
We suggest indulging sparingly as
a courtesy to your fellow staffers.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.340
Air fresheners will be
available by request.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.510
[laughter] September
12th, Banananananing.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.870
[laughter] A religious
day of atonement.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.640
Humans are not required
to observe the day

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.900
but you may notice Gronghuish
members of our staff walking

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.250
about with what looks like a
leech attached to their temples.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.850
It is in fact a leech, or
something close the native version

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.840
which is indeed sucking blood
straight out of their brains.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.140
As a matter of protocol,

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.030
you are directed not to
comment on the leech.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.800
With that said, from time to time
a Gronghui celebrating Bananananing

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.820
may collapse from lightheadedness.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:59.380 position:56%
When and if you see that happen, say
Bananananing to the fallen coworker

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.790
and then contact the embassy clinic
who will dispatch someone to care

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.470
for your co worker
and remove the leech.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:10.760
Under no circumstances are you
to remove the leech yourself.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.280
There is no religious bar to it

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.130
but you are likely not
a trained professional

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.970
and you will make a mess.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:23.220
If you get blood everywhere you
will be charged for the cleanup.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.840
September 13th, Bananananing
nagunnagunnagun.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.840
Understandably, after a day
of having a leech attached

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.700
to their heads your Gronghuish
coworkers will take a day

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.000
to recover.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.790
Human staffers however must
report to work as usual.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.150
October 5th, Linininining
[assumed spelling].

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.210
Literally, sex day.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:49.600
[laughter] This is the day where
traditionally the Gronghui choose

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.010
which of their three sexes
they will be for the next year.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.520
Many of your Gronghuish
coworkers will participate

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.820
and change their sexes.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.330
If they choose to remain the
same sex as they currently are,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.630
then they will make no announcement

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.880
and it is not required
for you to do anything.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.200
If they choose to change their
sex, they may choose to announce it

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.610
to you and then present
you a shoulder.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.800
Their shoulder, containing
a small subcutaneous organ,

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.400
which when stimulated releases
hormones to hasten the sex change.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.320
If you are so favored, say
Lungingdole [assumed spelling],

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.540
literally sex switch,
and then punched them

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.350 position:56%
in the shoulder with moderate force.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.690
Then say thank you because
you have given an honor.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.140
Human staff members who wish
to publicly announce a change

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.450
in their own gender
expression are encouraged

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.270
to use Linininning as
an occasion to do so.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.560
Be aware that your Gronguish
coworkers will want to punch you

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.400
in the shoulder if you do so.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.930
[laughter] This is
entirely at your option.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.830
But it is polite to allow it.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.030
October 31st, Halloween.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.270
The Gronghui love Halloween and
celebrate it enthusiastically.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.870
Please feel free to join along.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.130
One major difference is that
rather than giving out candy,

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.250
Gronghui offer wuung,
and lots of it.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.700
Air fresheners will be
available by request.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.300
[laughter] November 20th,
Glaaaargunin [assumed spelling],

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.530
a religious day of reflection
celebrated through ritual yelling.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.480
Earplugs and noise canceling
headphones are advised.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.490
Human staffers who go through the
day yelling will not be punished

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.550
but it won't be appreciated either.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:32.740
December 10th Falagalugunun
[assumed spelling], shoe day.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.840
A minor but unpopular holiday

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.130
in which the Gronghui
steal each other's shoes

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.330
and hide them prompting a
search for the missing footwear.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.570
As a reward for finding
them, it is customary

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.600
to fill the shoes with wuung.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.250
[laughter] Humans may
participate but are reminded

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.010
to check their shoes before
placing them back on their feet.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.770
Also given the pungent
nature of wuung,

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.700
the odor of which is often
difficult to get out of leather,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:03.210 position:56%
we recommend wearing casual footwear
you don't mind throwing out.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.230
January 17th, Gronghui New Year.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.950
This coincidentally falls
in January this year.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.050
Like New Years on Earth
there is a lot of drinking

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.610
and carousing and celebrating.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.080
Slightly differently from Earth, it
is done utterly silently and anyone

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.570
who speaks during the entire length

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.570
of the day may find themselves
pelted with small pebbles

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.850 position:56%
that the Gronghui carry with them
all day especially for this purpose.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:31.100 position:56%
Or larger pebbles if the
particular Gronghui are being jerks.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.910
[laughter] Be aware that on New
Year's the Gronghui will be trying

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:39.950
to make you speak, the better
to hurl rocks at you for fun.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.020
[laughter] Given this fact and the
fact that humans are absolute crap

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:49.520 position:56%
at keeping their mouths shut, we
will be closing the embassy that day

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.790
and recommend all human staffers
stay at home and text each other

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.020
if they need to communicate.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:00.270
If you get pelted by
rocks, it is not our fault.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.160
February 14th Valentine's Day.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.110
Another adopted holiday and once
again in terms of gift giving,

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.060
chocolate and flowers
are replaced by wuung.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.580
And once again air fresheners
are available by request.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.720
At this point it should
be understood

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.940
that any excuse the
Gronghui have to give

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.550
or receive wuung, they will take.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:26.500
March 22nd, Woooginining [assumed
spelling], except for this day.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.950
A religions day of sacrifice

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.700
in which the Gronghui actively
abstain from consuming wuung.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.050
Be aware that tempers amongst
your Gronghuish coworkers will be

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.350
unusually short.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.660
We do not recommend making comments
about wuung at all on this day.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.820
If you eat any, be aware
you might start a riot.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.960 position:56%
You will be charged for the cleanup.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.750
You will also be required to bring
in apology wuung the next day.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.420
And we are talking high end wuung,

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.050
not the stuff you can
buy at the corner store.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.320
April 1st, Karenokeninining
[assumed spelling].

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.130
The Gronghui were introduced to
karaoke when they first met humans

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.540
and took to it with
great enthusiasm.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.090
Enough so that they have a
special day on the calendar

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.450
in which the entire planet
pulls out their karaoke machines

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.030
and sings along to
their favorite songs.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.790 position:56%
We will set aside a conference room
here at the embassy for this purpose

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.270
for your Gronghuish coworkers.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.440
While humans are encouraged
to participate and sing along,

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.970 position:56%
be aware that Gronghui songs and
singing strike most humans as atonal

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.780
and somewhat similar to two
tractors attempting to mate

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.910
in a field of crumpled aluminum.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.210
[laughter] Likewise, be aware

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.100
that Gronghui have a similar
opinion of human singing.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.710
Please be prepared
to make allowances

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.020
as they will do the same for you.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:53.670
Particularly well done performances
will be rewarded with wuung..

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.270
Air fresheners, blah blah blah.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.640
You know the drill.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.360
Note also that despite the day

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.600
on which Karenokeninining appears
this year, the Gronghuit Ministry

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.130
of State assures me this is
not an April Fool's listing.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.050
I see no reason to doubt them.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.850
Alright that's that one.

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:23.740
[ Applause ]

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.500
Alright for our next piece--

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:32.380
okay so we live in an era where
smart appliances are now starting

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.290
to be part of the landscape
where you can pick up your phone

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:43.720
and tell your thermostat at home to
go down to 68 degrees or up to 78

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.630
or whatever it is that
you particularly want.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.850
And on one hand this is great.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:54.690
On the other hand there's lots
of technical issues about it.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.690
But the thing that really
gets to me is that sooner

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:02.950
or later almost all appliances
are going to be smart appliances.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.250
And because that's the case,

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.050
as a cost saving measure
what they're probably going

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.260
to do is rather than create
specialized chips or anything else

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.780
like that, they will take one type
of chip-- a super advanced chip--

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.470
and just stuff it in everything.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:19.550
And given the advance of Moore's
Law and other things that you know,

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.270
with our technology, where things
get smaller and smaller and smarter

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.830
and smarter and the whole
thing about you know,

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.500
AI and neural networks
learning and so on and so forth,

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.520
sooner or later what you're going
to have are these appliances

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.660
that are meant for one thing that
have these super advanced chips

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.370
and they're pretty much
going to become self aware.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.170
Right? [laughter] And so one
day your smart appliances will

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.870
start talking.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.440
And they will start
talking to each other.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.430
And they will start
talking about you.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.910 position:56%
[laughter] With that being the
case, I'd like to present this story

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.790
which is called, "Your
Smart Appliances Talk

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.910
About You Behind Your Back.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.640
And in each of these,
a smart appliance talks

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.000
about their particular owner.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.410
So to begin the Clayworth
Refresher Home Air Ionizer speaking

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:18.330
of Elijah Porter of
Royal Oak Michigan.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:23.870
"The dude eats a lot of lentils.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.610
I mean a lot.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:31.370
He bought me because he thinks
I am deodorizing his house.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.060
I am not deodorizing his house.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.510
That is not what I do.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.970
I help take dust and
particles out of the air.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.920
Methane is not something
I can help you with.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.710 position:56%
[laughter] The problem is that he is
used to his smell and he can't tell.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.940
So he thinks I'm doing
a bang up job.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.790
Then he brings someone home,
you know, for a little--

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:05.180 position:56%
and within five minutes they're
doing the fake phone call emergency.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.800
He is so all alone.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.020
I want to tell him to lay off
the lentils but I'm worried

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.690
that if I tell him, he'll think
I'm defective and throw me out.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.590
I am not defective.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.200
I run just fine.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.930
I just don't deodorize".

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.820
The Griffin Defender Plus
Home Security System Speaking

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.610
of on Ann Cross of Zigzag, Oregon.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:36.760
"1234 is not a security code!

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.060
[laughter] Come on!

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.450
I've got biometrics.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.280
I've got like voice identification.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.970
I got that little gizmo
thingy on your key ring

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.500
that when you approach the
house you get identified.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.500
You can run me from your phone!

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.070
But no, not this one.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.480
She goes with 1234 on the keypad.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.600
Her damn dog could figure that out.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.300
We're out in the middle
of nowhere, right?

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.820
I see the meth heads working in
the woods waiting for her to leave.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.250
What does she think the
first damn thing they'll type

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.890
into my keypad is?

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.130
And she doesn't have me set
up for autonomous reporting

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.790
so I can't say a thing about it.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.120
I was all do you want me to set up
autonomous reporting and she acted

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.070
like I was speaking Chinese.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.470
And I was because she didn't
fix the default language!

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:29.310
[laughter] How is that my fault?

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:34.510 position:56%
She's getting robbed sooner or later
and then I'm going to get blamed.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.890
Well, when she gets
robbed, I'm just going

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.950

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.280
The pawn shop will love me".

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.460
I apologize for the next
one to all the people

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.820

"I am a shower head with six
customizable pulse settings.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.210
The other appliances tell me she
hasn't had a date in four years.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:12.000
[laughter] I-- I just want
to clean people, okay?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.650
That's all I want.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.160
Not anything else.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.020
Please tell Erin.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.330
I mean, I am sorry about her
dating life, I really am,

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:27.310
but I just want to be friends".

of Anthony Moore of
Malone, New York.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:52.720
"I did not know you
could live on condiments.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.350
[laughter] Logically
that should not happen,

00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:00.450
and yet the only thing he ever
puts in me besides terrible beer

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.380
and the occasional pizza
box I mean, is condiments.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.910
Do you want to know what's
inside of me right now?

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:12.510
Three types of mustard, three
kinds of relish, olive spread,

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.930
Miracle Whip and mayonnaise.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:21.030
13 types of dressing including
four variations of ranch.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.330
Seriously.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.630
Classic ranch.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:24.930
Zesty ranch.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.970
Ranch with jalapeno.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.250
Coffee ranch.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.400
[laughter] Really, what
the hell is coffee ranch?

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.880
Do you know I can't find
it in my order in queue.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.140
I think he has it made special.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:44.710 position:56%
[laughter] So here's the thing, my
tech allows me to suggest food like,

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.640
I see you have mustard, perhaps
cheese would go well with that.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.640
I can order that for you.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.260
When he first got me, I
did that a couple of times

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.010
but then he got irritated
and turned that function off.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.400
Ever since then, all
I can do is watch

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:05.370
as he fills my insides
with salad dressing.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.960
And look, here's another thing,
I don't have an external camera

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.150
but my internal camera
sometimes it sees things.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:21.700
Like him taking out the ranch
dressing, opening it up,

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.380
I see him dipping a straw in it.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.410
I think he was drooling
when he did that.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.850
I mean that's not right, is it?

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.340
Most humans don't do that, do they?

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:39.680
I think you actually need
solid food from time to time.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.440
I kind of feel like
I'm enabling him.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.720
There's more to life
than just ranch".

Thermostat of Brian

Deming, New Mexico.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.670
"Jeez, these people!

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.650
I am just a thermostat but I know
these two don't love each other

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.120
very much.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.380
They also don't want to talk about
it or something so they just go

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.820
after each other in
passive aggressive ways.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.280
Like she wants the house
at 74 degrees all the time,

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.990
he wants it at 68 and I'm like
fine, I can actually do that.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:21.790
Have it at 74 during the day when
she's at home and then drop it

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.990
down to 68 when he's
at home and she leaves

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.590
to go do her shopping or whatever.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:30.710
Or hello, how about this,
I can do dual climate zones

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.750
so she can have the second
floor at her temperature

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.230
and he has the ground floor at 68.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.140
It is literally no problem.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.950
It is literally what
I'm designed to do.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:45.590
I can make every room in this
house a different temperature.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:51.080
But no, instead they
come over to my dial

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.010
and they yank it back
and forth all day.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.400
And then they confront each
other about it and both

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.740
of them act all innocent.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.560
I mean who do they think
is moving the dial?

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.860
A poltergeist.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.410 position:56%
And they stare at each other fuming,
and suddenly I know what it is

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:11.310
like to be that kid who has to
ferry messages between parents.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.290
I am the damn thermostat!

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.540
This is not my job.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.150
I'm not even getting college

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.120
or guilt soothing birthday
presents out of it.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.250
[laughter] I just get yanked on.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.920
I have had enough.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.190
I mean look, winter
gets pretty cold here

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.020 position:56%
and if they want passive aggressive,

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.330
just wait until it gets below
freezing, then we will see

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.100
who gets passive aggressive".

Ask me about the weather.

today we will have a high of 52

I don't think he's made
anything in the kitchen here.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.850
The dishwasher tells
me he has two plates,

two cups, two sets of cutlery.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.330
You get where I'm going here.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:28.510
My only hope of getting out of
this place is if someone, anyone,

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.800
right swipes him on Tinder.

I'm speaking for like 15 minutes
and doing questions and answer

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:30.840
or are we going into--
or is the question

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.910
and answer supposed to
be in the 15 minutes?

15 minutes more and then
question and answer.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:41.110
Okay so, if I want to questions
now we will have 15 minutes

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:45.680
for Q &amp; A. Let's go to Q &amp; A.
[laughter] And here's the deal

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.480
with the question and answer
and this is the way I explain it

You can ask me about stuff

Ask me video games.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.510
You can ask me about science
fiction and publishing in general.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.630
You can ask me about
politics if you want.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.280
You can ask me about
my personal life.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.470
You can ask me anything you want.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.190
Be aware that sometimes the answer
is, I'm not going to tell you that.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.990
I can't believe you asked that.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.490
You are a horrible person.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:19.010

now and never come back.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.800
As long as we understand
that these are the rules

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.770
of the road, what are
your questions?

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:27.530
Please there are, there are
the microphones on either side

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.830
so just come on down and ask them.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.130
So you get to start first.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:34.170
&gt;&gt; From that same collection, my
favorite story was the "Missives

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.560
From Possible Futures" and
I was just wondering was

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.280
that just a one off thing or
might you do something similar

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.720
to that again because
just that particular--

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.020
I don't know why it was--

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.960
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Well it's because I
killed Hitler over and over again.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.260
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.560
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: And
the thing that we know

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.340
about Nazis is you just punch
them and you keep on punching.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:32:02.760
[laughter] [applause] But to answer
your question, originally I meant

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.850
to have a series of alternate
history short stories

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.250
and that particular
one, like I said,

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.930
was an alternate history
search engine that looked

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.250
for multiple versions
of Hitler dying.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.220
And the thing is I got lazy.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.350
[laughter] So I never actually
then wrote anymore so I may still--

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.650
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.950
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: write
some at some point.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.250
So, next question right here.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.150
&gt;&gt; Hey, until recently I've
been kind of a fantasy purist

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.700
and I've started reading sci-fi
recently and mostly your things--

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.920
so in terms of what you read
that got you into sci-fi

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.240
or what you would make your like
ultimate sci-fi list, what would--

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.570
what books would you recommend?

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:38.870
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Hmm.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.420
So I did a piece not too
long ago, a couple years ago

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.200
about the 10 science
fiction fantasy novels

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.210
that were really important
to me growing up.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.230
And some of them on there were the

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.620
"Dark is Rising" series
by Susan Cooper.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:57.150
[applause] The "Wrinkle in Time"
series which was Madeleine L'Engle.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:02.810
A lot of Highland Juveniles which
were of course like "Citizen

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.400
of the Galaxy", "Starman
Jones", stuff like that.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.920
But then I was also reading
ones that were read--

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.680
meant for an adult audience
like "Dune" and so on so forth.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.360 position:56%
One of the things that I tell people

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.880
when they're asking what
should I be giving my own kid

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.710
for science fiction and
fantasy is to remind them

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.690
that the science fiction
fantasy that we grew

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.590
up with is now anywhere from--

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:32.400
I'm 48 so it's anywhere from 30 to
60 years old and science fiction

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.300
in many cases, it doesn't speak
the same language as kids now.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.460
And so I think one of the things
that's really important is to look

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:45.150
at the authors today who are
writing science fiction or fantasy

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:49.410
for younger readers and
to look at them as well

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:50.710
as giving them your favorites.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.880 position:56%
I mean I gave my daughter the "Dark
is Rising" series and she, you know,

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.870
put that in alongside
Margaret Haddix and--

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.920 position:56%
I can't remember her name--
Margaret Haddix and Scott Westerfeld

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.000
and "The Hunger Games"
and so on and so forth.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.300
So everybody will pick
their own things

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.710
and you have to be open to that.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.180
Read along with them is
another thing I suggest.

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.970
Oh we do. We read for
an hour every day.

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:16.600
But last thing, is that list
on your website or whatever?

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.900
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Oh yeah.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.500
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Just, yeah type

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.910
in 10 science fiction fantasy most
important to Scalzi, it'll go.

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:24.720
So next question.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.130
&gt;&gt; Which is better,
flight or invisibility?

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.880
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Which is
better, flight or invisibility?

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.180
[laughter] [applause]

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.480
&gt;&gt; Which is better?

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.390
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Here's my
problem with invisibility,

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:39.280
which they always paper over
and I think is a real problem is

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.240
if you are invisible,
you can't see, right?

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.630
Because the light, it's going
straight through your head, right?

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.980
So you are completely blind.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.560
So you're invisible but
you're bumping into things.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.010
[laughter] And then people
think they have a poltergeist

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.310
in their house and they're

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.060
like there goes Bob the poltergeist
again bumping into things

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.100
and it's actually just you.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.400
And the thing is is that when you
inevitably fall down the stairs

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.480 position:56%
into the basement-- because you
will inevitably fall down the stairs

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.110
into the basement--
no one will find you.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.290
[laughter] Because
you are invisible.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.090
So flight.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:18.470
[ Applause ]

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You often write about very like
complicated science fiction aspects.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:25.000
How do you keep your
stories grounded and feel--

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.080
make sure they feel realistic?

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.180
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: So how do
I keep my science fiction

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.660
from being too complicated?

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.260
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Well I'm an
idiot you see so [laughter]--

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:39.340
no, actually I have a really
good answer for that which is

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:45.080
so my mother-in-law-- her name is
Dora-- she loves me which is good.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:51.240
And so she reads my books
because she wants to support me.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.680
And I appreciate that.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.210
Dora also doesn't read
science fiction and fantasy.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.650
She reads Nora Roberts.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:58.950
She reads Julie Garwood.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.410
She reads-- so she reads romance.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.780
And I have nothing but
respect for the romance genre.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.860
I'm not one of those
people like romance.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.350
Like romance is 40
percent of the market.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:09.650
They're doing something right.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:15.320
So but she doesn't
read what I write.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.380
And so when I write my
science fiction, she is not--

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:23.620
Dora is not my audience,
but I keep her in mind.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.600
Because if I can write whatever
I want to write and I write it

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.950
so that Dora can follow it,
then anybody can follow it

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:34.110
because Dora is,

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.170
I think quintessentially
the American consumer.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.440
Honestly, one of the things I
ask her is like what do you think

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.740
of this movie that's coming up?

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.310
And she goes ooh, I want to see it.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:45.020
It's going to make a hundred
million dollars its first weekend.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.970
And if she goes, oh I
don't want to see it,

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:49.480
then it's going to flop miserably.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.970
[laughter] So if she likes
something I'm writing,

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.780
I feel pretty good about it.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.080
Next question.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.330
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: In "Old Man's War",
your description of the alien foes,

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.780
they're both like hilarious and
horrifying and I was just wondering

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:06.140 position:56%
in your process, did you have like a
collection of these horrible things

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.070
or did you just make them
up as you went along?

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.480
&gt;&gt; I based them on humans.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.510
[laughter]

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:15.290
[ Applause ]

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.420
I mean I don't know if you
know this about humans,

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.440
but we're both awesome
and horrifying.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.460 position:56%
So, that's the short answer to that.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.120
And the other answer is
no I just kind of make it

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.420
up as I go along because--

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.460
but in all honesty there's no
horrifying behavior that I can give

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.570
to my aliens that humans
don't already do.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:36.900
Humans, yeah, so.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.200
[laughter].

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.140
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming first of all.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.440
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Thank you.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.500
&gt;&gt; For "Lock In" you
wrote a little novella

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.840
that was the oral history
"Unlocked".

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.710
It was great and really detailed
and I was fascinated by it

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.970
and how did you decide that
you were going to write that?

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.270
What motivated you?

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:56.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Okay so the question
is I wrote a book called "Lock In"

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.990
which is actually based
here in Washington,

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:02.630
D.C. and then I wrote a companion
novella to it called "Unlocked"

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.550 position:56%
which is the oral history of Haden's
Syndrome which is the disease

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.380
that has a central
role in "Lock In".

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.230
And the reason I wrote that
was because when I was writing

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.740
"Lock In", I was doing a huge
amount of world building.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.700
And you actually have to
do more world building

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.280
when you're writing near
future than you have to do

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.980
when you're writing far future

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.510
because if I write something
that's 1500 years in the future,

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:28.520
like the "Collapsing Empire" is
supposed to be, I don't really have

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.950
to make any solid connection
between now and then.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:34.380
It's 1500 years in the
future and we'll all be dead

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.720
so you can't fact check me.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.790
[laughter] But when I write
something like "Lock In",

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:43.000
I know that 25 years from now,
I'm going to be at a convention

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.830
like this and someone will be
like, I was just wondering,

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.990
you wrote in "Lock In" that
this thing was going to happen

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.640 position:56%
and it didn't happen so I want to
know what it's like to be a failure.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.070
[laughter] Because nerds
are awesome that way.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.760
[laughter] And so you actually have

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.140
to make the connections
much more robust.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:11.730
That means I did a huge amount of
world building, but I wasn't able

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:17.400
to show it in the book necessarily
because I had a murder to solve

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.700
in the course of the book.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.480
And so when I got done
writing "Lock In",

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.160 position:56%
I was like I have all this world
building and I want to show my work.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.250
[laughter] And literally
that's why I wrote it.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:33.250
I wrote it and I like gave
it to Tor and I said here,

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.480
put it out as marketing, whatever.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.780
Do something with it.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.180
And they're like no, no,
we'll put it out as a novella.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.070
So that's what they--
so that's what they did.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:43.700
But yeah it was me just going look,
look, look at all the work I did!

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.000
See what I did?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.300
See? See? Isn't this cool?

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.600
Isn't this cool?

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.900
&gt;&gt; It was.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.200
It was very cool.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.500
Thank you.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.800
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Why, thank you.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.100
[laughter]

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.400
[ Applause ]

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.700
Yes?

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:02.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So like when you like wrote these
books, like when you were thinking

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.850
about it, like, did you
feel good about yourself?

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:13.760
Was it like a struggle or
was it like, were you feeling

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:19.470
like really good or were you like?

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.240
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: I generally
try to feel good about myself.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.650
[laughter] Not in, not to make
light of what you're saying,

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:29.000
but I think one of the things
that's really important,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.460
one of the things that's
really difficult for writers is

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.910
to have the belief that
we know what we're doing.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.470
There's something that
writers have and I think a lot

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.230
of creative people have and
I think a lot of humans have

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.520
and it's something that's
called imposter syndrome, right?

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.330
And imposter syndrome
means that you believe

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.480
that no matter what you're doing
or how accomplished you are

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.260
or how good it is, the thing that
you're doing, somebody's going

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:01.660
to find out that you have
no idea what you're doing.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:06.760
And that they're going to come
and they're going to say, we know.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:11.040
And then they'll go take
you to creative jail

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.280
where you will spend
the rest of your days.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.600
And it sounds funny when I'm
talking about it this way

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.820
but it is actually a very serious
problem for writers and creators,

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.680
the feeling that there's
no rule book.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.980
We don't know what we're doing.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.910 position:56%
We're making this up as we go along.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.970
And the answer to that is
yes, we are making this

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:34.330
up as we go along, and that's okay.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:38.840
And there's no way to be an
impostor as a creative person

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:44.440
because just the simple act
of creation itself affirms

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.250
that you know what you're
doing because you're doing it.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:48.620
Now, it doesn't necessarily mean

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.510
that every creative thing you do
is good, and I stand testament

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.800
to that every time
I pick up a guitar.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.670 position:56%
[laughter] But it does mean that,
you know, anybody who decides to sit

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.440
down to write is a writer.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.430
If you write, you are a writer.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:06.560
No one can take away-- that away
from you, you are not an imposter.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.780 position:56%
So for me, when I sit down to write.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.120
It's an affirmative thing.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.300
It is saying this is
something I want to do.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.470
This is something that
I enjoy doing.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:21.770
I am excited to find out
what happens with this story.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:26.250
So for me it's always a good thing.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:30.180
&gt;&gt; So couldn't you just walk
through the imaginary jail

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:37.100
and then you could be like bye bye?

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.400
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: What was that?

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:51.560
&gt;&gt; You could just be like I'm
not spending my day in here,

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.890
I just want to-- I just want to
do like, like you could just walk

00:42:54.890 --> 00:43:00.280
through the imaginary jail then
you could be like oh and just walk

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.380
through the jail bars,
it's not a jail?

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.680
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:10.180 position:56%
[applause] And that's, but the funny
thing is there's a lot of people

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.770
who don't realize that
they can do that.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:21.120
And one of the things that we have
to do as writers and creators is

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.710
to remind each other
there is no jail.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.010
Thank you.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.310
Next question.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:34.830
&gt;&gt; Hi. Listening to your stories,
I thought they were very whimsical.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.130
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Yeah.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:41.210
&gt;&gt; And I was wondering, is that a
tenet of science fiction writing

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:44.250
and is there any mystery as well?

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:49.820
Because I feel like I,
as a reader am attracted

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.150
to like mystery, like
unknowable things.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.470
So [inaudible] question.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:59.220
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Science fiction
has no particular rules other

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:03.630
than it's meant to
be science fictional.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.980
It's meant to be speculative.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:10.410
So you can put anything you
want into science fiction.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:16.730
I wrote "Lock In" as a mystery
because I wanted to write a mystery

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.670
and I'm a science fiction writer,
so it made sense to do it that way.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:26.880
I write humor in my science fiction
because I like writing humor.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.910
Science fiction is not, to go
back to what we just talked about,

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.260
it's not a jail, you know?

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.880
You can do lots of
things in the field.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.250
You just have to decide
that you want to do them.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.740
So for me, yeah, science
fiction can be whimsical.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.300
It can be mysterious.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.310
It can be sexy.

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:55.430
Although we tend to have
a problem with that.

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:57.680
We need to work on our research.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.910
[laughter] But it can it
can literally be anything.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:03.210
Right here.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.340
We're going to go through
as quickly as we can

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.650
with the people who are standing.

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:07.950
So quick.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:09.250
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:10.550
Quick question.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:14.080
Love all your characters but I
especially love Sergeant Ruiz.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.380
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Um hum.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:20.650
&gt;&gt; Where did he come
from if you don't mind?

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:24.480
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Sergeant
Ruiz, in "Old Man's War",

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.740
he was the drill instructor.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:33.420
I took every single cliche about
drill instructors and I made sure

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.720
that the character
was aware of them.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:41.450
[laughter] And that was pretty
much how I did that one.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:42.750
Next question.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:46.310
A nerdish fact check, does green
skin really make any difference

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.610
at all?

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:48.910
&gt;&gt; In my universe it does.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.210
[laughter]

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:51.990
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: So you've
created a lot of really fun books

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:55.790
and universes, which of those would
you not mind living in [inaudible]?

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.090
&gt;&gt; Excuse me?

00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:00.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Scalzi: Which of your worlds
would you not mind [inaudible]?

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.500
&gt;&gt; I-- there are very few of my
universes that I would want to live

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.970
in because they're
designed to be fun to read

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:09.990
which does not necessarily
mean fun to live in.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:15.560
And probably the closest to the
one that I would want to live

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.760
in would be "Lock In" but I
just know I would get sick so.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.060
[laughter]

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:29.870
&gt;&gt; Hi. "Collapsing Empire" seems a
major tonal shift in your writing

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.850
with a lot more sex and
cursing than you usually do.

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:35.300 position:56%
Why this change and were you worried

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.390
that some readers might
take it the wrong way?

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:42.240
&gt;&gt; Last part first, don't care.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.380
First part, I swear a lot.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.680
[laughter] I mean-- and I mean--

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.880
this, and it's really
actually only one character

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.890
that swears a whole lot.

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.260
It's Kiva, and that's just
part of her character matrix.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.140
So generally speaking,
I'm writing a book now

00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:01.070
that has very little cursing
relative to what's in that,

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:05.770
so and with the sex, I mean
mostly I don't write sex scenes

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:08.260
because I [inaudible]
through them and I feel

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.570
that that will probably
end up feeling inauthentic.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:14.870
But who knows, there might be more.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.170
So quickly.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.470
&gt;&gt; "Redshirts" was really funny.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.100
Will there be a sequel and is
the shirt you're wearing part

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.400
of the research for that?

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.700
[laughter]

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.000
&gt;&gt; So as I got older I
stopped wearing tee shirts

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.590
and I started wearing
Hawaiian shirts or aloha shirts

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:28.690
and the reason I do that is
because they are dazzle camouflage

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:29.990
for my middle age paunch.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:31.290
[laughter] No sequel
to "Red Shirts".

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:32.590
Very quickly, we'll do
these like 10 seconds each.

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:33.890
Go!

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:35.190
&gt;&gt; So you're talking about world
building for near term and far term

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.490
and one thing I've noticed
in reading science fiction

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:37.790
over the decades I've been reading
it is no one saw the cell phone.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.390
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if you try
to identify a world changer

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.690
like that or do you just give up?

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.990
&gt;&gt; You never know.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:44.290
It's going to hit you.

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.590
I mean we didn't do a real good
job finding the internet either.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:46.890
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] did.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.190
&gt;&gt; We-- you know the thing
about it is, you know,

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.490
there will be always people
who figure out one thing

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:50.790
and we will always
take credit for it.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:52.090
But again, we're always living
in the current so we have to work

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:53.390
with the metaphors that we have.

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:54.690
Last question very quick.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:55.990
&gt;&gt; Also in the vein of "Redshirts",
I love how it leans very hard

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:57.290
on the fourth wall with
sort of a wink and a nod

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:58.590 position:56%
at the universe and that the author.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:47:59.890
So I ask you Kirk Picard or other?

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.190
&gt;&gt; For what?

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.490
[laughter] I mean for president?

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:03.790
[laughter] For a hot date?

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:05.090
I mean--

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:06.390
&gt;&gt; Take it whatever
direction you want.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:07.690
&gt;&gt; I just-- you know,
I don't have to choose.

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:08.990
You know, I am poly captainal.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:10.290
[laughter] Thank you everybody.

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:11.590
[ Applause ]

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:12.890
