00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.428 line:0%
<i> I'm a prince!

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.497
<i> And Radu, Vlad's brother,
 is like,</i>

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:32.999
<i> I kinda like it here.</i>

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.800
<i> I really like the salt

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.235
<i> And Memed's like,
 I like you too.</i>

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.104
<i> And then, out of nowhere
 this boyar shows up.</i>

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.539
<i> This nobleman.</i>

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:40.840
<i> And he's breathless,
 and he's like, Vlad!</i>

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:43.009
<i> I have bad news.
 Your father is dead.</i>

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:46.045
<i> He's dead. He was killed
 by rival boyars.</i>

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.547
And Vlad is like,

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:49.114
<i> I'd like to avenge
 my father's death, please.</i>

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:50.383
<i> Can you please
 release me?</i>

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.885
<i> And they're like,
 [belches] okay.</i>

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.820
<i> But Radu's gonna stay here
 if that's cool.</i>

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.221
<i> And Radu's like,
 yeah, I love it here.</i>

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.990
<i> So, um, he rides to Wallachia,</i>

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.159
<i> kicks down the door,
 and he's like,</i>

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.994
<i> you ain't gonna take away
 our freedoms.</i>

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.096
[giggles]
[loud thud]

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:07.400
- Ohh.
Watch that head.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.534

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.970
<i> Anyway.
 He's like, sweet.</i>

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.205
<i> I'm pretty much
 prince of Wallachia.</i>

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.341
<i> Let's have a partaaay!</i>

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.776
<i> And he invites
 all these boyars.</i>

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:20.680
<i> He's like, guys, let's
 [bleep] bury the hatchet.</i>

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.016
<i> I know you killed my father.
 That's fine.</i>

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.784
<i> You don't worry--
 but don't worry about it.</i>

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.252
<i> You killed my dad.
 That's okay.</i>

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.820
<i> So the boyars are like,</i>

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:31.657
<i> we'll [bleep] do whatever
 you feel like is good.</i>

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:34.093
They like, drink
and have a great time.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.028
<i> Uh...
 [giggles]</i>

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.997
<i> And then they're gonna leave,
 and they're like,</i>

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:40.699
<i> great, thank you so much,
 but we had such a great time.</i>

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.167
<i> We're gonna head out.</i>

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.571
<i> And Vlad's like,
 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:45.638
<i> Shut the doors.</i>

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:46.940
<i> [doors slamming]</i>

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.374
<i> All the boyars are like,
 wait, what?</i>

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.444
<i> So, Vlad's like,
 you know what I'm gonna do?</i>

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.914
<i> I'm gonna take a stake
 that's like sharpened</i>

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.316
<i> almost to a point--
 kind of.</i>

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.018
<i> Not to a point.
 A little rounded.</i>

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.954
<i> And I'm gonna shove it up
 your butthole.</i>

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.490
<i> And then I'm gonna, like,
 go into your esophagus,</i>

00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:06.792
<i> and then I'm gonna
 stick it out your mouth.</i>

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.496
<i> [whispers]
 I'm going to impale you.</i>

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:14.133
And he does that
to 200 boyars.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.834
<i> It's...
 [laughs]</i>

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.771
<i> It's [bleep] sadistic.</i>

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.874
<i> And he impaled
 [bleep] 200 boyars.</i>

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:27.046
In his court in...
[talking gibberish, laughing]

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:30.582
<i> Vlad is like,
 call me Dracula.</i>

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.287
<i> So, he's, like, going around
 doing this to everybody.</i>

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.755
<i> He's like, you, you look like
 you're an adulterer.</i>

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.424
<i> You, you look like
 you're lazy.</i>

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.493
<i> You, you look like
 you're a thief!</i>

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.328
<i> I'm gonna impale all of you!</i>

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.163
<i> And he impales them.</i>

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.066
<i> And he burns the whole
 [bleep] town to the ground.</i>

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.168
<i> And there's a German monk
 there and he's like,</i>

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.237
<i> [German accent]
 oh, mein Gott!</i>

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:55.441
<i> He's dipping his bread
 in the blood of his victims!</i>

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.777
<i> Und he's eating it!</i>

00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:58.945
<i> [normal voice]
 That's a vampire.</i>

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.380
He instorters...
He instorters?

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.849
He ins...he...
- [sniggers]

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:07.987
<i> - Instills order
 in Wallachia.</i>

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.556
So, Memed is like,

00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:13.025
<i> your brother wants
 to be called "Dracula."</i>

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:15.561
<i> And Radu's like,
 [laughs] Dracula?</i>

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:18.831
<i> That just means, like,
 son of Dracul</i>

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:20.299
<i> which we both are.</i>

00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:21.567
<i> That's lame.</i>

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:22.869
<i> And Memed's like,</i>

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.837
<i> we should definitely
 attack Vlad</i>

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:28.208
<i> because Vlad's being
 a super dick.</i>

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:32.111
<i> So, Memed crosses
 into Wallachia</i>

00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:34.013
<i> with these, like,
 60,000 troops</i>

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.515
<i> and Dracula's like,</i>

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:36.849
<i> I get it.
 I'm outnumbered.</i>

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:38.851
<i> So, I'm gonna retreat,</i>

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.752
<i> but what I want
 you guys to do--</i>

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.490
<i> my colonels and lieutenants
 and generals and shit--</i>

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.460
<i> I want you to burn
 [whispers] everything!</i>

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:48.828
<i> And they're like,
 all right, but we're, like,</i>

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:49.996
<i> [bleep] up our own land.</i>

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.430
<i> And he's like,
 yes!</i>

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:52.965
<i> [whispers]
 Destroy Wallachia...</i>

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:53.966
<i> Vallachia.</i>

00:03:54.032 --> 00:03:55.268
<i> So, they do it.</i>

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:57.467
<i> And they [bleep] up
 everything.</i>
