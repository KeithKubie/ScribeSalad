[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.450
MJ: Keyon Dooling
here at Google to talk

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.050
about his personal
experience with mental health

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.450
what-- and then what the
NBA is doing because he is

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.520
a former NBA basketball player.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.150
So a little bit about Keyon,
who we are very lucky to

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.360
have with us today.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.960
He was born in Florida and
attended the University

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.680
of Missouri, where he was the
10th overall pick in the NBA

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.656
draft in 2000.

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:30.110
Definitely good draft year.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.943
KEYON DOOLING: Yeah.

00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:31.756
Solid.

00:00:31.756 --> 00:00:34.690
MJ: He played for
seven NBA teams,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.090
so he knows a lot about
the NBA, including

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.140
the, Clippers which are
obviously based here in LA,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.580
and the Celtics, who are still
in the playoffs right now.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.500
Go Celtics.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.430
And now he is currently serving
in the NBA Players Association

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.090
as a player rep.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.630
He also is an author,
a motivational speaker,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.560
and the founder--

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.590
the co-founder of the Respect
Foundation with his wife,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.250
and he's doing a lot of work
in the mental health awareness

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.750
community.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.124
So we are very lucky
to have him here.

00:01:04.124 --> 00:01:05.290
So thank you for being here.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.356
KEYON DOOLING: MJ, thank you
for that kind introduction.

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:09.910
MJ: So just to get
started, I thought

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.326
it would be useful for the
group to hear a little bit more

00:01:12.326 --> 00:01:15.100
about your personal background
and why mental health

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.545
is so important to you.

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:19.330
KEYON DOOLING: So I
grew up in a little town

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.350
called Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.900
And I grew up in an era
where we knew our neighbors.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.190
We could go and knock on the
door and borrow some sugar.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.180
But also during that time
in the '80s crack hit.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.360
And so I saw my community
go from being this united

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.520
community where you
could go and borrow sugar

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.890
and you knew all the neighbors
to really like a war zone.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.320
And so my upbringing
was awesome.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.230
I come from a
two-parent household.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.000
My father worked for himself.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.310
We had a florist, so we
had a family business.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.690
And he also used to skycap
at Eastern Airlines for my 80

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.590
babies.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.010
And my mother was an educator
for a great part of her life.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.310
She was a teacher,
and during the 80s,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.330
she switched careers to go
as a drug counselor because

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.275
of the epidemic.

00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:15.025
It hit our family.

00:02:15.025 --> 00:02:16.730
It hit our neighborhood.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.280
And so she was
passionate about it,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.602
and she became a drug
treatment counselor.

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:22.310
And so that's a little
bit of background.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.265
I'm the youngest of four, and
that's a little bit about me.

00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:27.610
MJ: Cool.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.380
So what is your personal
experience with mental health?

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.070
Why are you spending
your time now

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.260
that you don't have much free
time promoting this awareness

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.085
work?

00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:43.300
KEYON DOOLING: So I was forced
to deal with my mental health

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.440
issues.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.140
I went through a few
tragedies as a child.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.610
At the heart of
it, I was sexually

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.800
abused when I was
seven years old,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.820
and I had never really
dealt with that.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.010
I took that into my adulthood.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.140
And so in my twelfth
year in the NBA,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.670
I was doing some trips--
some charity work in Seattle,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.180
Washington, and I was
using the restroom

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.350
and a guy felt on me while
I was in the restroom.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.870
And it triggered me.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.400
And so all these things that
I had pretty much pushed down,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.120
compressed I was going to lock
the door and throw away the key

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.350
and not ever have to deal with
some of those experiences,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.210
but in that moment
I got triggered.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.240
And that barrier, that block
that I put up in my mind

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.850
to block it out
came tumbling down,

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.730
and I was forced to deal with
this intensed, intensed battle

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.270
with PTSD.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.660
And so in doing my work
and in overcoming that

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.220
is when I became a
mental health advocate.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.820
And I felt like I found
a recipe for healing.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.340
And I'm vulnerable enough
to share that experience

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.670
so that others may benefit
from it so that they

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.915
don't have to hit rock bottom
in order to build themselves up.

00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:00.610
MJ: It's so brave of you for
sharing that story as well.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.651
KEYON DOOLING: Thank you.

00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:04.210
MJ: And what you just
mentioned is something

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.550
that you've spoken about
publicly in the past.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.383
KEYON DOOLING: Sure.

00:04:07.383 --> 00:04:10.600
MJ: And one question that I've
had in just getting to know you

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.200
a little bit is that was
that the first time that you

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.620
acknowledged that
you did have PTSD?

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.519
KEYON DOOLING: Yeah.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.399
Yeah.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.130
For me, the symptoms of
being abused as a child

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.710
and seeing gunshots and
things like that as a child,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.460
it didn't really--

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.010
I'd never allowed
myself to feel it.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.670
The way it would come
out is with my behaviors

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.110
and in my emotions.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.290
And so I suffered from anxiety
in my childhood quite a bit.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.700
And I took that into adulthood.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.880
That's one of the ways
that it manifested.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.840
I had anger issues at
different points in my life.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.270
I think it made me
overcompensate and become more

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.670
macho because when something
happens to you as a child,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.160
you build up these walls.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.120
Another thing in my behavior is
being promiscuous early in life

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.750
is something that
I had to overcome.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.600
But PTSD didn't manifest until
I was triggered at 32 years old.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.640
So I was able to manage
the anxiety, self-care,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.860
but when I got triggered, those
little techniques that I had,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.510
they were out of the
door because that

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.930
was too powerful for those
little mild techniques

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.290
to work on.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.080
MJ: So can you talk
a little bit more

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.110
about how you actually
went about confronting

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.440
that you did have
PTSD, especially being

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.580
an NBA athlete at that time.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.260
This is now six years
ago, and there--

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.200
today luckily there are
athletes coming out--

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.890
Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan
publicly about their own

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.440
experiences.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.060
But at the time,
you were probably

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.920
the first one to really be--

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.090
to openly discuss it.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.910
So can you talk
about what barriers

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.490
you had to overcome in terms
of addressing that stigma

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.790
and still being able to
successfully play in the NBA?

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.120
KEYON DOOLING: Yeah, so I
would say the first thing

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.430
the stigma is that
I was embarrassed.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.010
I was ashamed because my abuse
came at the hands of a man.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.970
I was seven years old.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.900
He was about 14, 15
years old at that time.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.000
I was really ashamed about that,
really embarrassed about that.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.380
So I decided at a very
early age that I just

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.030
wouldn't tell anybody.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.770
And so I just really wanted to--

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.150
how do I say it?

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.160
When you're young,
you don't understand.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.760
It was no examples of
where to go to heal.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.500
When I was looking
around for examples

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.380
of men who had been
through some of the things

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.010
that I had to overcome, I
didn't see a lot of examples.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.370
And so I knew I wanted to
be an example for people

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.490
once I built myself up.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.750
But, yeah, it was
a tough situation.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.520
I'm actually glad that
I went through it,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.760
that I got triggered,
that I had to battle PTSD

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.890
because if I had not
I would probably still

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.320
have some of the same behaviors.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.870
My anxiety would still
probably be through the roof.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.880
So it forced me to do my work.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.844
But what I want to
tell everybody else

00:07:14.844 --> 00:07:17.010
is that you don't have to
be forced to do your work.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.970
You can actually take the
step to start doing your work

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.380
to start building yourself up.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.500
And I always say that
the first step of healing

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.480
is really embracing the
pain in the first place.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.790
And that's the first step.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.140
MJ: Exactly and now you are the
example for a lot of people, so

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.830
hopefully just you being
open about your experience

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.390
and getting help and what
that has done for you

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.180
will help others in
similar situations

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.700
be able to take that first
step without that trigger.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.630
KEYON DOOLING: Absolutely
because when you get triggered,

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.460
it's a very vulnerable time.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.780
And you don't know how
you'll react to that trigger.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.250
So if I would have gone out
and gotten help actively,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.500
I probably would have never
had to deal with PTSD.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.027
I probably would have
been able to catch

00:08:04.027 --> 00:08:06.780
it, learn the tools
and the techniques

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.030
to be able to manage it.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.270
But for me, I just didn't
embrace mental health.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.550
I didn't know what
it looked like.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.900
I didn't see many examples
of people going to therapy.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.250
And so-- I also
was very successful

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.660
at every intersection in life
I had like to bust through

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.360
and break through and become.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.850
And a lot of times when
you're successful when you're

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.890
climbing, you don't
get to process

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.530
what you've experienced,
especially as athletes.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.960
We don't necessarily get
to process what we've seen,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.419
what we've been through,
what we've encountered,

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.370
the punishment that we
put our bodies through,

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.300
and so we internalize
our pain, our issues.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.800
We mask it.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.220
And so I don't want
to do that anymore.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.560
I felt like in order
for me and my family

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.620
to get to the next
level, I had to heal.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.260
I feel like I ran
away from basketball.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.117
I didn't play with
PTSD because I didn't

00:09:03.117 --> 00:09:04.200
think I was strong enough.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.860
I didn't know what
I was experiencing,

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:11.200
so I decided to retire from
the NBA to get myself healthy.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.360
MJ: And that's the most
important thing for sure.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.700
So when you did confront
that you were experiencing

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.330
PTSD, what are some of the
things that did help you

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.669
get back to a healthy place.

00:09:22.669 --> 00:09:24.210
KEYON DOOLING:
[EXHALES DEEPLY] Well,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.300
I don't think it was one
thing that helps me on a daily

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.260
basis--

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.590
I say it in the present tense
because I'm still healing.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.720
And I believe like I'll be
healing the rest of my life.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.240
And so I had to
learn these tools

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.340
to be able to manage all
these different emotions.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.110
As men a lot of
times we can resonate

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.840
with like pleasure and anger.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.670
And there's so many emotions
in between that and enduring

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.830
the therapy process and in going
through the healing process,

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.990
I was able to
identify and recognize

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.040
all these emotions that as a man
I never allowed myself to feel.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.750
Perfect example, as
men a lot of times

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.480
we're told to shut up,
suck it up, be tough

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.035
when the first natural language
that we speak is a cry.

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:05.160
If you're not crying,
they'll smack you on the butt

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.040
and make sure you cry
because that's normal.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.430
We have these tear ducts
that produce water that

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.530
allows us to cry but we are--

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.770
we're told a lot of times
as men to suck it up.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.480
And so for me, I
wanted to make sure

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.680
that I understood my emotions,
I understood my triggers,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.190
I understood what I'm
grappling against so

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.040
that I can have the best
recipe, the best tools, the best

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.110
resources to be able
to take care of myself,

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.680
not just for a short time
but over the course of time,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.890
over the course of my life
and then also generationally.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.590
I think a lot of times
families, we pass down

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.770
negative stigmas to our kids.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.570
And so in regards
to mental health,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.560
the way that it's
talked about, a shrink,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.140
a head doctor, you're crazy, all
these different negative words

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.340
that we associate
with mental health.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.960
And if we just shift that up,
if we shifted a little bit

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.240
and have the right
word magic around it,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.400
we could really
de-stigmatize mental health

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.410
and really treat it
for what it's worth.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.940
MJ: Yeah.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.400
You made a great point in
just the conversation with men

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.150
specifically with
the stigma attached.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.740
And I think every different
group, whether it's your family

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.140
or where you're from or the
type of job that you're in,

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.120
has a slightly different
stigma attached to it.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.080
And that's obviously why
these types of events

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.780
are so critical in helping
us all come together

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.550
to open up this dialogue
because we're all

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.010
experiencing different
types of mental health.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.270
So can you-- going back to
your support system, which

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.664
did allow you to access
treatment without saying Keyon,

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:39.163
suck it up.

00:11:39.163 --> 00:11:40.286
You're a man.

00:11:40.286 --> 00:11:42.410
Can you talk a little bit
about your support system

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.066
through this experience
and what types of things

00:11:45.066 --> 00:11:46.190
they did that were helpful.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:50.120
There are a lot of people
here and probably watching

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.730
that are either
experiencing PTSD themselves

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.800
or have friends,
family, coworkers

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.430
who are, so how can we
be supported and support

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.120
each other?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.940
KEYON DOOLING: I would say
the first thing is my family.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.830
My family really
supported me through what

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.160
I was going through.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.400
They knew I was going
through something.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.910
We just didn't know what it was.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.600
We didn't understand
what PTSD was,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.120
but they knew something
was going on with me.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.272
And they didn't run away.

00:12:18.272 --> 00:12:18.980
They didn't hide.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.570
They leaned in,
and they made sure

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.160
that I got the right resources.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.610
They made sure that they
protected me around that.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.800
And another thing,
a lot of times,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.900
we'll internalize
things because we

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.780
don't think people
will understand

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.500
or our infrastructure
is not there

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.910
to help us, love us, support us,
and I was so wrong about that.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.280
The Boston Celtics,
man, were there for me.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.220
Danny Ainge, Doc Rivers,
Rajon Rondo, Avery Bradley,

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.700
all of my teammates,
they were there for me.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.580
And a lot of times we think we
were struggling with something,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.750
we're in it by ourselves.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.375
And what I learned
through this process

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:56.450
is that when I needed my
village to be there for me,

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.280
that village was
there for me, and I'm

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.610
so thankful and so grateful
for all the resources

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.640
that the NBA and the Players
Association had in place

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.130
because that played a
big part in my healing.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.160
All the love and support that I
got from my Celtics family, all

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.970
the love and support that
I got from my friends,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.270
and that combination
allowed me to give myself

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.090
permission to heal.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.220
MJ: So do you--

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.970
going back to your
teammates, do you still

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.030
keep in touch with them?

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.800
KEYON DOOLING: Absolutely.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.910
I mean, not everybody.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.610
Everybody is so busy, and
those guys, a lot of them

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.950
are still playing
and being excellent.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.620
But, yeah, I have great
relationships with my friends.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.620
Now also I did lose some
friends in this process.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.460
Mental health is so
misunderstood that people

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.650
will tar and feather you.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.390
They'll isolate you,
and they'll make you

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.270
feel like you have an issue.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.590
And they might not be
comfortable with that.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.529
But what I'll say is
if I have a knee issue,

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:54.320
I'm going to try and
go to the best surgeon

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.190
to get it repaired.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.860
If I have an issue
with my teeth,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.010
I'm going to go to the best
dentist to get it prepared .

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.500
But where do you go when
your heart and your head

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.840
is out of whack
or you're feeling

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.310
emotional about something?

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.710
Where do you go?

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.350
And for years I would go
to maybe a glass of wine

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.190
or try and distract
myself another way.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.570
But therapy to me was a place
where I really, really got

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.500
a lot of healing.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.020
I spent four days in
a mental institution.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.110
And for me I didn't
get healing there,

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.160
but I got the epiphany there
that I needed to do my work.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.140
So that-- I appreciate that
experience for that alone.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.500
But the therapy process--

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.860
in three weeks of therapy,
I was able to dump off

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.010
about 25 years of baggage
that I had been holding onto,

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:47.470
that I had never processed,
allowed myself to feel

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.130
that I was still carrying.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.820
And every time I
would go to therapy

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.390
and I would drop off
some of this baggage,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.780
I would feel a little
lighter when I came out.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.010
And then I would go back
the next wait-- the next day

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.960
and I would drop off
some of that baggage

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.850
and I would feel
a little lighter.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.220
And it wasn't just the
cathartic experience

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.720
of dropping off the baggage,
but it was the tools that I

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.460
was able to get from
my therapist to be

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.840
able to manage that emotion--

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.830
to be able to
identify that emotion.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.350
And so I start more--

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.880
maturing more emotionally.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.710
It's called emotional maturity.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.340
And I'm so thankful that through
the therapy process that I

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.660
learned how to process things.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.790
MJ: Yes, therapy is
one of the best things

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.650
that we can do to
maintain our mental health

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.450
and to improve it.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.210
But you mentioned the tools
that your therapist gave you.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.850
Can you talk a little bit
about any specific tools

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.752
that have helped you
maintain on a daily basis?

00:15:36.752 --> 00:15:38.710
KEYON DOOLING: Absolutely
because the same plan

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.260
that I got from my
therapist six years ago

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.070
is the same plan that I'm
working with a few tweaks

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.210
here and there.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.250
But I take a holistic approach.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.655
I believe in the mental,
the physical, the spiritual,

00:15:51.655 --> 00:15:54.430
and the emotional
part of health--

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.810
holistic health.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.910
And so the first
place that I started

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:02.500
was in my spiritual experience,
praying, talking to the Lord

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.370
and just getting that
connection point.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.360
The second thing that
I did from there--

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.380
excuse me, from getting my
prayer life together and making

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.800
sure that I talk with God
and consulted with him first.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.470
But the next thing
I did was therapy.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.510
Therapy to me was the
biggest gateway for healing.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.764
It was unbelievable what
I was able to accomplish

00:16:26.764 --> 00:16:28.180
in the therapy
process, what I was

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.550
able to learn
about myself, where

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.030
I was able to trace some of
the origins of my behavior

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.529
and my trauma.

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:37.570
And it's very difficult.
The most difficult thing

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.030
about therapy is going,
taking that first step.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:45.490
Once I got in there, it was
just a very awesome experience.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:46.780
And then physical .

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.570
I'm an athlete, and so I believe
that in all the mind, body,

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.570
spirit, it all works together.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.600
And so I still have
a physical routine

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.090
that I do five,
six times a week.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.540
I implemented yoga into that.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.010
I go get treatment on my body.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.530
I have two degenerative hips.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.240
And so I do a lot of things
to make myself feel good.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.630
I get massages.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.069
I learned about essential oils.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.510
I'm on no prescription drugs.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.109
But I take a lot
of natural things.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.910
I like herbs, and I
like essential oils.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.940
And I like different things like
that, chamomile tea and things

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.470
that help me relax.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.020
And so I had to learn how to--

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.940
I had to learn my system.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.490
And it's not for everyone.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.280
I think everybody has-- it's
no blueprint for success.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.440
There's many
blueprints for success,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.800
and you have to find out what
your interests are, where

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.730
your pride is and where your--

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.884
excuse me, where your prizes
are in regards to health.

00:17:40.884 --> 00:17:41.800
And that's what I did.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.550
I explored it.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.580
I still explore it.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.710
I still get therapy.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.210
I still work out.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.340
I still try and eat
right and I just try--

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.330
if I have an off day,
I don't internalize it.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.180
I talk about it.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.740
I talk about it
with my therapist.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.870
I talk about it with my family.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.380
We've created an environment in
my family where it's OK for us

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.766
to talk about mental health.

00:18:00.766 --> 00:18:02.140
And so we have
those discussions,

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.495
and we embrace it
totally as a family.

00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:07.510
MJ: I love your phrase
learn your system.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.490
I think, again, what
you were mentioning

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.377
earlier for so long mental
health was this taboo thing.

00:18:12.377 --> 00:18:14.335
It wasn't talked about,
and it was thought of--

00:18:14.335 --> 00:18:15.730
thought to be
completely separate

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.300
of our physical health.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.720
But in reality, the more
research that comes out,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.030
the more we understand that
everything is intertwined,

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.740
and learning your system
is a great way to put it.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.570
There will be no one
solution that fits everyone

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.920
because we are all different
and unique, and that's awesome.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.560
But it's a lot about
knowing yourself and finding

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.970
those ways that you can maintain
both aspects of your health.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.290
KEYON DOOLING: No, absolutely.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.600
Sometimes a video game--
playing the video game

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.340
could help relax me.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.670
Sometimes going for a nice
little walk can help relax me.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.710
I think everybody
has to find out

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.020
their interests, what makes--

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.140
what allows them to get
to their happy place

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.000
and be able to go
back to those places.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.270
Also the power of
visualization, sometimes I

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.890
can't go back to
Bahamas physically,

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.760
but I can close my eyes
and visualize that view

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.580
and [INHALES] suck up that
air and smell that scent

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.190
and it will help.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.290
And I think sometimes
that mind-body experience

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.820
needs to be highlighted.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.640
Sometimes we have-- as
kids, we can imagine things.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.890
I remember going to
the park as a kid,

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.320
and it would be no scoreboard
no crowd out there.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.487
But I'll be having my
eyes closed and Dooling

00:19:25.487 --> 00:19:26.070
for the game--

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.840
3, 2, 1, and the
crowd goes crazy.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.280
[IMITATES CROWD NOISE] Open
my eyes, nobody's there,

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.610
but in that vision,
it was real to me.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.620
And a lot of times
with our healing,

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.580
we have to sometimes
visualize ourselves as healthy

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.230
and then wake up and then take
the necessary steps to find

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.146
that health.

00:19:45.146 --> 00:19:47.020
But, yeah, the power of
visualization I think

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.670
is awesome, too.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.872
MJ: Luckily, we're not
too far from the beach

00:19:50.872 --> 00:19:53.080
so you don't have to visualize
the Bahamas we're only

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:53.860
a couple away--

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.946
a couple of blocks
away from Venice Beach.

00:19:54.946 --> 00:19:56.800
KEYON DOOLING: I
know that's right.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.060
You know what.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.015
I got some exercise
clothes out there.

00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:02.365
I might have to hit Muscle
Beach up, minus the muscles.

00:20:02.365 --> 00:20:05.050
MJ: Gold's Gym is right outside.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.920
I could talk about your
story all day long.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.590
It's extremely powerful
and brave of you

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.120
to share that with
all of us, but I

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.790
want to spend some time
to talk about the work

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.340
that you're doing now and
in the awareness space.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.330
KEYON DOOLING: Please.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.977
MJ: To start off, what made you
take this step from treating

00:20:22.977 --> 00:20:24.810
yourself and making
sure that you're healthy

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.480
and make the decision that it's
important for you to share this

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.765
and why is it important to
take work on this awareness?

00:20:30.765 --> 00:20:33.465
KEYON DOOLING: So I got to
give my wife some credit.

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:36.060
When I was going through
my break down situation,

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.491
I just didn't want to share.

00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:38.740
I didn't want to tell anybody.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.810
I just wanted to heal,
get my individual healing,

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.180
and then ease back into life.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.470
But she challenged me.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.410
She said, hey, you've gone
through this for a reason.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.370
And there are so many people who
are going through what you're

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.100
going through, and they
might not have the resources

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:56.880
that you have.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.000
They might not have
the access to therapy

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.800
and the right health care and
all those different things.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.280
And so you got to
help people with this.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.650
And so I'm so glad she
challenged me because also

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.790
as a man because I was abused at
the hands of another young man,

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.040
hey, man, I was
ashamed about that.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.990
And the fact that
she didn't judge me

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.660
and that she didn't look
down on me for going

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.520
through what I went through--

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.020
the only thing she
was mad about is

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.810
that I didn't tell
her because she

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.480
could have helped me
heal along the way

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.640
and that I kept from her.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.640
And so yeah that gave me enough
courage to be able to go out

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.280
and do this work
that I'm doing now.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.620
I believe the biggest
room in all of our houses,

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.550
in all of our lives is
the room for improvement.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.250
The biggest room in our house
is the room for improvement.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.720
And I want to share what I
learned through my processes

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.910
with the masses so that
they can get healing.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.590
It's so many people
who are walking

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.040
around right now with a
big smile on their face,

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.235
but they might be
suffering with anxiety.

00:21:57.235 --> 00:21:59.310
It's so many people
who might be walking

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.530
around looking
gorgeous, and they might

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.390
be suffering with depression.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.900
There's so many people who
are one step away from getting

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.097
triggered to having
a battle with PTSD,

00:22:10.097 --> 00:22:11.930
but they might not even
know their triggers.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.670
And so I want to be a
mirror to each person

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.820
so that they can find
healing for themselves

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.730
through looking at the way
that I attacked this healing

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:21.520
process.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.080
It was not easy.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.975
It was not easy.

00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:26.100
There were some days there
was some parts of myself

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.650
that I didn't like to see
when I peeled back some

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.840
of those layers in the onion.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.300
But in doing that, that's where
the accountability comes in.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.940
That's where the growth
opportunities come in.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.792
And so I would encourage
anybody right now

00:22:39.792 --> 00:22:41.250
if you're grappling
with something,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.380
if you don't even know
why you have anxiety

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.082
or why you're angry or
why you're isolating,

00:22:47.082 --> 00:22:48.540
man, I really want
to challenge you

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:53.310
that the first step to
healing is embracing the pain.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.950
And a lot of times when
you embrace the pain,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.570
you'll find power in that.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.501
You'll find purpose in that.

00:22:59.501 --> 00:23:01.500
And then you'll be able
to help other people who

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.450
might be grappling or going
through the same thing

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.491
that you're experiencing.

00:23:04.491 --> 00:23:06.967
MJ: Yeah, exactly again,
none of us are alone in this.

00:23:06.967 --> 00:23:09.050
We're all experiencing--
we all have mental health

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:09.640
to deal with.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.841
So it's sometimes a
very powerful thing

00:23:11.841 --> 00:23:13.590
is just asking someone
how are they doing.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.697
KEYON DOOLING: No doubt.

00:23:14.697 --> 00:23:16.530
MJ: So do you want to
talk a little bit more

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.469
about your foundation?

00:23:17.469 --> 00:23:20.010
KEYON DOOLING: Yeah, let's talk
about the Respect Foundation.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:26.700
So the Respect
Foundation is a 501c3.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:32.890
We believe that we can help
eliminate sexual abuse.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.810
We believe that we can raise
awareness around mental health.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.470
I believe the number are 1
out of every 4 young ladies,

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.760
1 out of every 6 young men
are abused in this country

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.140
before the age--

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.820
as children.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.310
And there's about
30% that are like me

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.060
who don't talk about it.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.480
And so I learned in doing
my research in doing

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.700
this work that if
we equip our kids

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.980
and if we equip people
with the knowledge,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.420
they can help prevent
some of these things.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.180
And what I mean is
like teaching kids,

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.190
hey, what is a healthy touch?

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.220
What is healthy dialogue?

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.950
Hey, if something
going on in your life,

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.270
where do you share that with?

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.050
Just really equipping
kids and empowering

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.970
them to not be silent.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:23.740
I think a lot of times we're
told within families shut up.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.130
What happens in this
house, stays in this house.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:26.940
It never happened.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.890
Don't tell anybody our business.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.890
And what happens is
these cycles continue,

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:35.040
not only in our families
but in our safe havens,

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.230
in schools, in churches,
in all these places

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.489
where it should be safe havens.

00:24:39.489 --> 00:24:41.280
So I wanted to make
sure that I reached out

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.100
and I touched kids through
my I Am Respect Tour.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.380
I bring music.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.760
I bring artwork.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.960
I bring spoken
word entertainment.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.570
I bring all these
different elements

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:54.060
to distract you a little
bit so that we can give you

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.760
a good positive message and
give you some great tools

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.490
to be able to help
your family maybe

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.380
prevent getting abused one day.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.530
And if you have been abused,
what healing looks like.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.780
How does healing look for you?

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.680
What's the process?

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.370
What's the steps to heal?

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.990
And so we wanted to be a
resource with our 501c3,

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.605
the Respect Foundation.

00:25:13.605 --> 00:25:14.320
MJ: Yes.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:14.820
Amazing.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.861
KEYON DOOLING: Thank you.

00:25:15.861 --> 00:25:18.120
MJ: In all of the different
communities that you've

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.690
gone to, have you seen major
differences in the types

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.390
of stigma that exist amongst
different communities

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.305
across the country?

00:25:27.305 --> 00:25:29.710
KEYON DOOLING: I
think mental health is

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:34.980
it's a lot of negative
stigmas across--

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.210
I don't think it's
a cultural thing.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.080
I think that
there's room to grow

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.050
for every culture
around mental health.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.770
But I'll speak
from my experience

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.100
as a member of the
Black community.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.640
I think that less than 6%
of black men get therapy.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.890
It's a crazy number like that.

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.669
Less than 6% of us get therapy.

00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:56.460
And I believe we come
from some of the most

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.410
traumatic experiences
in this country.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.380
And I believe that
there is so much

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.662
room for healing if
we start embracing

00:26:05.662 --> 00:26:07.620
our mental health the
way that we have embraced

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:12.990
our physical health and
if we start really locking

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.870
in and diving in and trying
to understand our experience,

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:20.790
understand what we went through,
understand what makes us hurt,

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.580
I think it's a great opportunity
for us to grow and get better

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:30.000
and do a better job
of just fighting

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.010
that negative stigma
of mental health.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:36.150
So, yeah, I think there's room
to grow for every culture.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.030
And I'm so glad and I'm
a part of this dialogue

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.980
because just because I'm from--

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.170
I'm a black man from
the black community,

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.300
my skills are transferable.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.420
I've lived in the suburbs
a great part of my life.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.550
And I know that there
are certain issues that

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.850
are doesn't matter if you're
in the hood or the suburbs,

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.960
an issue is an issue.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.330
I tell my kids all the time
because they didn't grow up

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.210
in a traumatic environment
the way that I did,

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.820
I'm not going to
minimize their experience

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.740
because that is real to them.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.600
And sharing is caring.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.360
As long as we show compassion
and we share these tools

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.690
that we learn, it's
transferable no matter

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.670
what culture you're from.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:15.960
MJ: Exactly.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.720
And in your work
with the foundation,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.320
you're obviously connecting
childhood sexual abuse

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.500
with mental health.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.375
KEYON DOOLING: Right.

00:27:24.375 --> 00:27:29.220
MJ: How do you see those
two things working together?

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.880
What's the relationship
between them?

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.921
KEYON DOOLING: Well, I
think they go hand in hand

00:27:32.921 --> 00:27:35.040
because when you've
gone through trauma,

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.770
there's going to be some mental
health issues that come along

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.670
with that.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.100
They say the top four
symptoms for somebody

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.360
who's been abused, whether
it's physical abuse,

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.280
mental abuse, sexual abuse,
or whatever, abuse in general,

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.980
is anxiety, which I
suffer from, depression,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.660
which at one point in my
life I've experienced,

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.750
sexual dysfunction, and PTSD.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.277
And at some point
in my life, I have

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:01.110
struggled with all of
those different things

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.180
at different moments in my life.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:09.040
And so it's not just
about the mental health.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.280
It's about how do I
get better from it.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.490
I think some people get stuck
at just saying, hey, I have a--

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.720
I'm having an emotional
issue, and they choose

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.000
to not do anything about it.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I want encourage people
to activate their faith,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.620
activate their resources
because healing awaits you.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.329
It's right there.

00:28:28.329 --> 00:28:30.245
You just have to take
it, and the hardest part

00:28:30.245 --> 00:28:32.640
is getting up and taking that
first step and pursuing it.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.140
MJ: And everything
that you're doing

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.056
is making it easier
for people to do that.

00:28:36.056 --> 00:28:37.306
KEYON DOOLING: I'm trying, MJ.

00:28:37.306 --> 00:28:38.370
I'm trying.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.380
MJ: You're sharing
your own story.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.450
You're working with
your foundation.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.040
And you're also working with
the NBA Players Association.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.290
KEYON DOOLING: That's correct.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.950
MJ: And they-- the
NBA's been very active

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:50.700
in the mental health
dialogue this season.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.770
Kevin Love has come out and
openly about a panic attack

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:55.200
he had during a game.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.210
DeMar DeRozan has talked
about his depression.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.130
Obviously, you were
recently featured

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.114
in several articles in May.

00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:03.030
We had a celebrity amongst
us everyone in case

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:03.960
you didn't know.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.600
KEYON DOOLING: I
don't know about that.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.330
MJ: So can you talk a little--

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.260
and they just also during
the Western Conference

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.199
finals had a commercial
about mental health.

00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:12.990
KEYON DOOLING: Yes.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.156
MJ: That featured both Kevin
Love and DeMar DeRozan,

00:29:15.156 --> 00:29:16.860
which brought tears
of joy to my eyes

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.900
to see that the message
is being that broadly.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.500
KEYON DOOLING: It's happening.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.100
MJ: Yes.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.490
KEYON DOOLING: It's happening.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.170
MJ: So can you share
a little bit more

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.860
about what the NBA is
doing and potentially how--

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.810
when you were a player
how you were supported

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:31.020
and how that has evolved over
the last five, six years?

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.820
KEYON DOOLING: So
the latest thing

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.280
that we've done at the
NBA Players Association

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.880
is we're building this program
called the Mental Wellness

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.510
Program.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.550
I'm an advisor for the program.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:44.790
And basically we're putting
the resources in place

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.780
all across the country where
guys can get their healing

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.320
outside of just the team
concept because a lot of times

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.932
in athletics it could be
a conflict of interest.

00:29:55.932 --> 00:29:57.390
If you having-- if
you're grappling

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.310
with an emotional
issue, you may not

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.064
want to go to the team doctor
because they could potentially

00:30:02.064 --> 00:30:02.980
hold that against you.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.820
So we wanted to create
something that was set aside

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.970
that players could truly
get their healing in a way

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.850
where it would be
confidential and healthy.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.070
We just really want to meet
our guys where they are.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.480
Our guys are young.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.270
They're talented.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:16.980
They're famous.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.210
They have wealth.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.600
And along with that,
it's a whole host

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.870
of issues that come along
with the pressures of being

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.616
as excellent as they are.

00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:27.990
So we want to make
sure that just

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.150
like we have the best
trainers and we have the best

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.997
medical doctors and we have the
best coaches and the best GMs,

00:30:33.997 --> 00:30:35.580
we want to make sure
also that we have

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.913
the best resources for their
mental health and emotional

00:30:37.913 --> 00:30:38.610
health.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.190
And I'm so glad to
be a part of that.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:41.850
MJ: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.610
When you first had
this idea, what--

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:47.816
how is it received by everyone
else in the organization?

00:30:47.816 --> 00:30:48.690
Was there excitement?

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.170
Were there anyone-- were
there any camps that weren't

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.550
interested in [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.250
KEYON DOOLING:
Yeah, well, look I

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.440
didn't start this discussion
about mental health.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.244
I helped contribute
to it, so I don't

00:31:00.244 --> 00:31:01.410
want to take all the credit.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.690
I don't want to take
all that credit.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.950
But I think that the stigma is
changing, slowly but surely.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.220
I think six years ago
when I had my breakdown,

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.870
I think it was a
negative perception

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.050
around mental health.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:18.750
And I think I wasn't able to get
another job because of that--

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.656
because of the negative
stigmas associated with that.

00:31:21.656 --> 00:31:24.030
There wasn't a lot of people
talking about mental health.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.755
There wasn't a lot
of people who really

00:31:25.755 --> 00:31:27.990
were trying to dive into it.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.284
But I think as a
country, as a society,

00:31:30.284 --> 00:31:31.950
I think we're in a
place right now where

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:33.660
we're ready to have
these discussions.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.090
And I think so many
brave people are-- have

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:37.710
been telling their stories.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:43.680
And as athletes, we have a lot
of visibility, a lot of fame.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.350
We also have resources to
be able to get behind things

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.000
that we're passionate about.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.580
And I'm so encouraged that
these guys are starting

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.240
to share their stories.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.610
Because there are some really--

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.640
people see the glory, but
they don't see the story.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.980
And it's so many
stories that guys

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.740
have to overcome that help
them to be as excellent as they

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.155
are on the court.

00:32:03.155 --> 00:32:06.100
And so I'm just glad to
be a part of the dialogue.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.740
I think the timing is right.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.890
And I'm just happy that DeMar
and Kevin Love and the NBA

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.590
Players Association has
given us this platform

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.600
to be empowered
about mental health.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.240
MJ: So obviously there
are a lot of players

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.060
who are open about it, but
around the league are--

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.519
do you think that
players will be

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:24.810
receptive of actually accessing
this type of treatment?

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.060
KEYON DOOLING: Oh, absolutely.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:26.880
Absolutely.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.320
I think our guys, man, are
ready to get to the next level.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.429
I think like I said, we
have the best trainers.

00:32:33.429 --> 00:32:34.470
We have the best coaches.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.290
We've got the--
we're very visible.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.070
But also there's
a personal growth

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:43.860
that I think our guys
are ready to pursue.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.890
You're starting to see
them get more educated.

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:50.310
We're starting to see them
get more business oriented.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.370
But now you're starting to see
the emotional maturity and guys

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.910
really trying to get
better as people, deal

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:58.890
with their issues
in a positive way,

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.440
make sure that
they're not masking

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.840
their pain in a
negative way but they're

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.280
dealing with their
pain in a positive way.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.490
And so I think that's going
to translate to society.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.490
As athletes, I think they
have a great platform.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.760
They have fans who follow
them and appreciate them.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.960
And so if they become more
awake about their mental health

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.180
and more aware about
their mental health,

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.570
I think that can translate
into all these great fans who

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.210
follow us.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.530
MJ: Yeah, that's a great
point and speaks to the power

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.860
that a lot of NBA
athletes have just

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.560
using their platform for
these positive messages.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.950
When you think about the
evolution of this program

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.700
and of the state of
mental health in the NBA,

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.280
what do you see success
looking like in five years?

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:49.020
If we sat down here
in May of 2023,

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.984
what story do you want to
be telling about the NBA?

00:33:52.984 --> 00:33:55.290
KEYON DOOLING: I want
people to say that, hey, you

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.050
know those guys that
lead the NBA, they really

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:00.690
normalize mental health.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.030
They de-stigmatize
mental health.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.020
They treated a
mental health issue

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.770
the same way and with the
same love and care that they

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.770
treated a physical injury.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:14.517
And if they can do it in the
NBA, they can do it at Google.

00:34:14.517 --> 00:34:16.350
If they do it-- if they
can do it at Google,

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.030
they can do it in the
police department.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.409
If they can do it in
the police department,

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.179
they can do it in
the teacher's union.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:24.840
And it could almost infect
our country in a positive way.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.179
If we start having these normal
talks about mental health,

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.060
man, people can really
get their healing.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.830
I'm telling you, healing--

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.500
I never thought I could heal
from some of the things that I

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.550
went through-- being abused as
a child, growing up in poverty,

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.260
seeing a--

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.610
I saw my first gunfight
at 11 years old.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:44.370
I saw a gun shootout
at 11 years old.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.469
And I just never
knew that I could

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.630
be this happy and this
healthy emotionally

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.690
without having to get loaded.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:53.980
Straight up.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.840
And so I'm just so excited to
be a part of this dialogue.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.600
I'm happy that I was
vulnerable enough

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.260
six years ago to share my story
because if I hadn't got out

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.860
in front of it, I wouldn't
even have this platform.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.300
And a lot of times when
you're funding your purpose

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.110
and you're finding
your mission, it

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.080
might not be pretty, the thing
that you have to overcome.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.130
Some people grapple
with addiction.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.640
Some people grapple
with gambling.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.230
Some people grapple with all
kinds of different things.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.750
And I found so much power in
overcoming my shortcomings.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.170
It's really helped me as a man.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.589
MJ: Yes, absolutely.

00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:31.630
I'm just going to ask a
couple of more questions,

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.450
then I'm going to open it up
to questions live in the room,

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.330
and also we have some online.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.270
Obviously your work
is very focused

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:44.980
on de-stigmatizing mental
health, and a lot of people

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.410
unfortunately are still
suffering silently.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:52.510
So if there were someone who
is watching or in the room who

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:56.042
is suffering silently right
now, what would you say to them?

00:35:56.042 --> 00:35:57.500
What would your
piece of advice be?

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.230
KEYON DOOLING: Well, so the
first thing-- look, I've

00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.740
been there.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.210
I've suffered in silence.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.310
I didn't talk about
my sexual abuse

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.560
until I had a major
breakdown, and I

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.170
was 32 years old at the time.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.540
And so 25 years, I
suffered in silence.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.800
So the first thing I would
say is I understand that.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.210
And the next thing
I would say is

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.150
I wish I would have
done my work earlier.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.742
The hardest part about healing
is taking that first step.

00:36:21.742 --> 00:36:22.450
And I know I've--

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.150
I'm echoing that
message, but it's so hard

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.429
to set that appointment
to go see that therapist.

00:36:28.429 --> 00:36:29.845
It's just like,
oh, I'm not crazy.

00:36:29.845 --> 00:36:33.400
Oh, what if people going
to think I'm crazy.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.560
Man, I got so much
healing in doing that.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.300
So the first thing is embrace
the pain, embrace the hurt.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.597
The second thing
is find examples

00:36:44.597 --> 00:36:46.180
of success stories
of people who might

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:50.500
have overcome an issue that
you might be struggling with.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.960
The next thing I would
say is go to therapy.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.900
Go get your help.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.590
If you have an issue
with your body,

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.330
I know you go get
that checked out.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.480
So it's the same
thing if your heart,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.070
if your head, if your
emotions are out of whack,

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.260
go to therapy.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.730
Last thing I would say
is activate your network.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:12.154
A lot of times we don't know
how much our network loves us.

00:37:12.154 --> 00:37:13.570
And a lot of times,
we don't allow

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.592
people to be friends
or be relatives to us.

00:37:15.592 --> 00:37:17.050
When we're going
through something,

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:20.140
we say I'll take care
of this by myself.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.470
Don't self-care when
it's about mental health.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.360
Get people involved who love
you who you trust so that they

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.480
can support you because I
couldn't be as healthy as I

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.430
am without my support system.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.930
And so if I'm having an off
day and my anxiety is up,

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:37.360
like, babe, my anxiety
is up a little bit today.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.210
I just want to share
that with you so you

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.320
can help me through that.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.850
And there's things
that the people

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:47.350
who love they'll do for
you that really helps you.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.144
And so just don't
think you're alone.

00:37:49.144 --> 00:37:50.060
That's the last thing.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.101
Don't think you're alone.

00:37:51.101 --> 00:37:53.290
Because when we're
alone, we isolate.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.390
That's when our mind
can get to racing.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.820
That's when those negative
behaviors can come out.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.195
So just remember
you're not alone

00:38:00.195 --> 00:38:01.319
if you're going through it.

00:38:01.319 --> 00:38:02.320
MJ: And-- absolutely.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:07.090
And if you aren't suffering,
sometimes the most powerful

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.400
thing that you can do
is just lend an open ear

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.377
and ask someone
how are you today.

00:38:11.377 --> 00:38:12.460
KEYON DOOLING: Absolutely.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.320
MJ: Even if they
don't say anything,

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.140
just knowing that someone
is there supporting

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.670
you can make a big difference.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.940
So everyone, ask the
person next to you

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.190
or when you're going to get
your lunch later today how

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.520
someone else is doing.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.740
And we'll all be better off.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.270
All right, I'm going
to move to questions.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:30.960
Do we have any live in the room?

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.850
There's a microphone over
there if you want to go up.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.380
We have livestream
so people can hear.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.960
But in the meantime,
I'll ask one from online.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.480
Dan in San Francisco-- hi, Dan--

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.580
Chris Bosh said that if
players like Kevin Love

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.413
continue to speak about
their mental health,

00:38:47.413 --> 00:38:49.480
players will look to
exploit that info.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.190
Have you talked with
Chris about this?

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.260
Is there currently
an on court culture

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.000
where mental health
should or should not

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.750
be the subject of trash talk.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:57.880
Go Celtics.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.897
I think Dan's a Celtics fan.

00:38:59.897 --> 00:39:01.980
And I'm pretty sure he is
wearing a Celtics jersey

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.095
and wishes he could be here.

00:39:03.095 --> 00:39:03.970
KEYON DOOLING: Right.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:05.680
Right.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.450
Well, I'm not sure what
Chris said, but as far

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.510
as mental health, I don't
think your mental health

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:19.810
can be exploited no different
from your physical health or--

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.470
when you go on the
court, you're focused.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.101
You're ready to play.

00:39:24.101 --> 00:39:25.850
But everybody is
grappling with something.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.420
See we have these negative
stereotypes about mental health

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.190
that it's like schizophrenia
or it's paranoia.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.760
And it's not.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.680
Sometimes mental
health is very subtle.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.030
It might be through anxiety.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.900
It might be through-- there's
30,000 people in here looking

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.530
at me, and I might get stage
fright or something like that.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.580
That's not a negative thing.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.980
It's just a human-- it's a
part of the human experience.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:52.720
And so I would say
that I don't think

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.091
you can be exploited for your
mental health on the basketball

00:39:56.091 --> 00:39:56.590
court.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.390
When guys are on the
court-- trust me--

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:00.850
if you're on the court in
the NBA, you are locked in

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:04.500
and you are focused on your
job, your role on the team,

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.710
and trying to win a basketball
game and support your family.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:10.980
You're not really thinking
about, hey, how can I get under

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.450
this guy's skin to
make him explode.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.660
I think there's a
healthy level of respect

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.510
we have for NBA players
amongst one another.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.280
We respect each other's craft.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.009
And I don't think anybody
would try and exploit

00:40:23.009 --> 00:40:25.050
if somebody is going to
do something emotionally.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.460
MJ: Absolutely.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.110
Although Chris Paul did
shimmy in Steph Curry's face

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:29.700
the other day.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.910
KEYON DOOLING: Yeah, well,
that's not an emotional attack.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.510
MJ: That was just
an automatic reflex.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.032
KEYON DOOLING: That's
just competition.

00:40:36.032 --> 00:40:37.260
MJ: That's being locked in?

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.040
KEYON DOOLING: That's right.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.320
MJ: We have a live question.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.290
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.396
This is related to
the previous question.

00:40:42.396 --> 00:40:43.770
But do you think
there's anything

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.350
about playing in the NBA that
makes it harder for those

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.180
with mental health
issues, for example, I

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.384
guess the constant
media pressure,

00:40:50.384 --> 00:40:52.050
maybe if you miss a
free throw, everyone

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.340
labels you as a choker.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.500
It's this drive that
you have to win.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.765
Otherwise, it's like
this failure of a season.

00:40:57.765 --> 00:40:59.890
KEYON DOOLING: Yeah,
man, great question.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.580
I think NBA players and
professional athletes and not

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.870
just professional athletes.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:07.750
I would say high achievers
to much is given,

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.360
much is required.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:13.320
I think we experience
more than others.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.670
A lot of times, we're young.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.390
We're from impoverished
communities.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.380
And we're thrusted into the
patriarch of the family.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.090
That's a struggle in itself.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.210
I think a lot of
times we're judged

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:28.290
on how much we weigh, how
we look, our appearance,

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:31.230
and so that's always
tough to deal with.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.830
Now we have social media.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.400
So you can hear all--
you can go on your phone

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.070
and see all these negative
comments about yourself,

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:40.860
or you could be
having a meal and get

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.160
a phone flashed in your face.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.960
So, yeah, I do think
that high achievers,

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.790
in particular famous
people, have more

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:50.980
to deal with than
the average person.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:55.620
I enjoy not being famous
more than I enjoy fame.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.360
I get so much more
peace of mind--

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.390
so much-- such-- a
much easier experience.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:04.170
Fame is a very tough thing to
deal with and not only fame.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:09.060
Fame, you compound that
with money and youth, that's

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.014
a very dangerous antidote.

00:42:11.014 --> 00:42:12.180
So thanks for that question.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:17.000
MJ: Kind of going off that,
you mentioned youth and money

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.040
and being thrown
into the spotlight.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.980
Do you think there's anything
specific to rookies or younger

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.904
players that the
NBA could be doing--

00:42:24.904 --> 00:42:26.445
in our education
system, for example,

00:42:26.445 --> 00:42:28.486
we're not really taught
about a lot of the skills

00:42:28.486 --> 00:42:31.950
that we need to succeed,
especially in those situations.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:32.845
KEYON DOOLING: Right.

00:42:32.845 --> 00:42:36.510
MJ: Are there plans to
introduce any type of education

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.800
or mentoring program.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.600
KEYON DOOLING: Yeah, well,
we have several programs.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.290
I think that-- well, I'll
speak for the NBA Players

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:43.830
Association.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:47.740
I think we do about
40 different programs.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.530
We have everything
from broadcast

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.680
to leadership, which is
training for if you want

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.760
to go into the front office.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.280
We have a transition
program that's

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.720
helping guys in
their transition.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.580
We just started the
mental health program.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.890
We have career development.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.630
We have the programming.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.320
The programming and the
infrastructure is in place.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.110
The key is to make sure that the
guys get it while they're still

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:10.770
in the game.

00:43:13.235 --> 00:43:13.860
That's the key.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.710
A lot of times guys wait 'til--
it's the end of their career

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.110
to try and start building
themselves up and preparing

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:21.190
for the next phase of life.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:25.140
And I think if we can get them
to start developing themselves

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:29.866
earlier, I think that transition
will be a lot more smooth.

00:43:29.866 --> 00:43:31.249
MJ: Well, you're on top of that.

00:43:31.249 --> 00:43:32.540
You want another live question.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.026
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here today.

00:43:35.026 --> 00:43:37.825
So going back to the
work of your foundation,

00:43:37.825 --> 00:43:40.694
you talked about working with
children and I'm a new mom.

00:43:40.694 --> 00:43:44.676
And so I was wondering what are
techniques that you use maybe

00:43:44.676 --> 00:43:48.312
even with your own family or
with the children to promote

00:43:48.312 --> 00:43:51.982
and create and foster
an environment so

00:43:51.982 --> 00:43:54.511
that your children feel like
you're taking care of them?

00:43:54.511 --> 00:43:55.260
KEYON DOOLING: Oh!

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.134
Thank you for asking.

00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:58.380
I had to lean in on that
one because, man, it's

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.390
all about the kids, man.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:05.370
And I think we can stop this
vicious cycle on their watch.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:06.960
I would say the
first thing is that I

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:12.720
think we make conversations
around our bodies too hard.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.060
And I would say normalizing
that conversation--

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.480
when I talk to my kids
about their bodies,

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.860
their private parts,
I tell them, hey,

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.560
this is your private part.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.000
This is your body.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.440
Daddy, shouldn't
touch you there.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.970
Mommy, shouldn't
touch you there.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.800
This is your body.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.290
And if anybody ever
touches you in that way,

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.110
you have to let me know so
that mommy and daddy can

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:35.880
protect you.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:40.920
Conversations, hey, this
is healthy conversations.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.354
Don't let anybody talk
to you about your body

00:44:43.354 --> 00:44:45.270
or if somebody says
something that's offensive

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.610
or cursing or something
like that, baby,

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.170
you can always talk to me.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.510
I think it's just really
about communicating.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.307
And then also watching
because a lot of times

00:44:54.307 --> 00:44:55.890
when a kid is going
through something,

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:57.880
you'll see some
behavioral changes,

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:02.010
whether they're aggressive
or whether they're aloof

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.880
and just being in tune with your
kids, asking them questions.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.510
How are you doing,
looking at their bodies

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.750
from time to time making
sure that-- oh, you

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:12.810
got a bruise on your leg.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.767
Oh, you know mama
see everything.

00:45:14.767 --> 00:45:16.350
Come on let's put
some Neosporin on it

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:17.516
or whatever the case may be.

00:45:17.516 --> 00:45:21.480
But just really
you know empowering

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.520
them to be able to
communicate with you.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.830
The worst thing that I
did was internalize it

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.230
at seven years old.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.570
See I ran the tape in my head.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.210
I couldn't tell my
dad because I didn't

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.160
know what he would do
like would he go back

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.020
and he would get revenge?

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.920
I couldn't tell my mom because
I just didn't know how to.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.370
I couldn't share
with my siblings

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.100
because I didn't
think anything of me.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.320
I couldn't tell my friends
because I didn't want them

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.550
to think my manhood was gone.

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:49.410
And so I decided
to internalize it.

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.840
And that wasn't the
healthy way to do it.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.960
I could have lost my life
by internalizing that.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.709
And so thank you for
asking that question.

00:45:57.709 --> 00:46:00.000
I think it's very healthy to
communicate with your kids

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.980
in an honest way.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.840
And don't sugarcoat it
because the world is

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.180
a very cruel place,
and the people

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.770
who are out there
being predators,

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.410
they are aggressive to
try and get it done.

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:14.400
And so I think we have to be
just as aggressive or proactive

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.290
against their aggression
towards our kids.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.260
KEYON DOOLING: Thank
you for asking.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.985
MJ: Great.

00:46:20.985 --> 00:46:22.620
Another live question.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.120
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.824
You touched on some of this a
bit, but like playing sports

00:46:27.824 --> 00:46:29.490
and especially at the
professional level

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.910
can definitely cause mental
challenges, whether it's

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:37.870
the fame or your paycheck
relies on how well you play.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.410
And you said the NBA had
some programming available,

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:42.630
but I was wondering
if the NBA as a whole

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.330
or any specific teams
proactively reached out

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.730
to the players and said
these are some challenges you

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:48.900
might be facing.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.730
Here are good ways
to deal with it.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:51.670
KEYON DOOLING: Yeah.

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:52.169
Yeah.

00:46:52.169 --> 00:46:54.360
Good question.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:59.100
I think each team has
resources in place and has--

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.220
some teams might
be further ahead

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.460
in their development of programs
around helping guys and others.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.810
But I would say our league
has great resources.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.410
We have-- I believe every
team now has a mental health

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.850
specialist that they work with.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:25.110
I believe every team also
has a player development

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.660
coordinator who can
be a liaison to help

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.450
them get to all the resources.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:33.390
The infrastructure
is great in the NBA.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:36.090
It's just a matter of
it's hard to do your work

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.780
and develop yourself when
you're trying to be excellent

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.200
and trying to earn
in this short window.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.780
But I think this
generation is changing.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:49.400
I see that these Millennials
are so much stronger

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.930
than we give them credit for.

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.920
They speak their truth.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.580
They are very talented,
a little entitled,

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.220
but I think this
generation is bold.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.070
And I'm so proud
of this generation.

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:07.450
And I look forward to
helping transfer information

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.000
from one generation
to the next so

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.580
that they don't have to start
all over with doing their work.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.446
So they can build off of this
discussion about mental health

00:48:16.446 --> 00:48:18.070
and not have to start
from ground level

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.930
because I believe
that in 10 years,

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.980
mental health will be
so normal that I believe

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:28.360
like a great part of people
will just be advocates for it.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:34.801
It'll be normal the same way
getting physical therapy is.

00:48:34.801 --> 00:48:35.800
Thanks for the question.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:36.670
Thank you.

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:37.910
I love these questions.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:41.442
Thank you for asking questions.

00:48:41.442 --> 00:48:45.530
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you for
the very open discussion.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:46.580
I really appreciate it.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.830
KEYON DOOLING: Thank you.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:51.720
AUDIENCE: Back to
the topic about kids,

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.240
does the Respect Foundation have
any sort of therapy programs

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.780
for let's say like if
you were seven years old,

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.820
you had no one to reach out to.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.180
But if there had been like
some kind of therapy program

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.990
that maybe you could have
reached out to as a kid,

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:10.540
maybe you wouldn't have
had to internalize it

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.382
when you had no one else to
turn to because of the stigma

00:49:13.382 --> 00:49:15.340
of what you went through
and the shame that you

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:20.600
felt even though it wasn't
your fault. That happens.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.290
But can you just speak to that
like therapy programs for kids.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:25.720
KEYON DOOLING: Yeah, so
our main program right now

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.820
is called the I Am Respect Tour.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.960
And like I said earlier, we
bring music, entertainment,

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.520
spoken word, a DJ, but the
content that we deliver

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.430
is very conscious.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.510
And it's around mental
health and sexual abuse

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.390
and how to prevent it.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.910
I'm not a therapist, so I
can't do that work myself.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:49.690
I'm a life coach, so we
have grown and evolved

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:55.420
to that point where we
can send kids to therapy.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.900
But what we do is we
raise awareness around it.

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.660
We've touched probably about
10,000 kids in the last four

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.560
years, and in doing that, we
connect them with the resources

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.280
that they do have access to.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.470
And so if you have
access in the community,

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:12.280
we usually partner
with an organization

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.160
that has great
infrastructure resources,

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.200
but we don't provide
the resources ourselves.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.286
We use our network to
be able to help people.

00:50:20.286 --> 00:50:21.410
AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:22.000
Thank you.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.296
KEYON DOOLING: Thank you.

00:50:23.296 --> 00:50:26.650
MJ: And we have another question
from online again from Dan.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:27.505
Big fan.

00:50:27.505 --> 00:50:29.200
The Kawhi Leonard
injury has shown us

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.820
that when the team
and players seek

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.910
different medical opinions,
drama and disagreement

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:34.960
can occur.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.030
How do you anticipate
handling similar situations

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:38.510
involving mental health?

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.240
What if a player's
therapist disagrees

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.640
with the team psychologist
about his ability to play?

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.350
KEYON DOOLING: Ooh,
that's a good one.

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:46.135
And I think we had--

00:50:46.135 --> 00:50:49.240
we've been dealing with
that issue around the NBA

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.170
for quite some time.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:53.230
There was a high-profile
case of a draft

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.200
pick probably about
five or six years ago

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.960
who had a phobia around flying.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.210
And so I'm sure
that there's going

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:05.197
to be a learning curve as we try
and get this system worked out.

00:51:05.197 --> 00:51:07.780
But I believe the hearts and the
minds are in the right place.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.570
I think we're still learning
about mental health.

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:13.880
And so I don't have a definite
answer to that right now,

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.080
but I do believe that that's
something that will come up

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.694
at some point or another.

00:51:18.694 --> 00:51:20.110
And there's going
to be people who

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:23.760
are higher pedigree than me who
will be able to handle that.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.270
MJ: Well, it's
comforting to know

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:26.770
that you'll be in
the conversation

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.214
because you are definitely--

00:51:28.214 --> 00:51:30.463
your head and heart are
definitely in the right place.

00:51:30.463 --> 00:51:31.504
KEYON DOOLING: Thank you.

00:51:31.504 --> 00:51:33.460
MJ: Another one,
Becky in San Francisco

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:36.190
asks what is the best way to
support a friend or family

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:39.668
member who has suffered
from childhood abuse?

00:51:39.668 --> 00:51:41.890
KEYON DOOLING: Becky,
I'm so sorry your family

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.950
member or your friend
had to endure that.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:47.860
I've been there so
I know how that is.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.760
The thing about abuse is not
only does it hurt the victim

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.940
but it hurts the infrastructure
around the victim

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.860
because there is a
certain guilt that might

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.990
be associated with the parents.

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.260
Oh, maybe I didn't protect it.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.614
Oh, what could I have
done differently?

00:52:03.614 --> 00:52:05.530
There are siblings who
like, man, I would have

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:06.780
rammed through a wall for you.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.650
I couldn't protect you.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:11.140
I would say the most
important thing that you do

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.180
is love them, love on them.

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.850
Let them know that it's OK.

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:17.626
Try and help them
get to the resources

00:52:17.626 --> 00:52:19.000
because you have
to do your work.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.560
If you don't do your
work, you really

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.240
open yourself up to these
behaviors, these behaviors that

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:29.060
could be very, very
detrimental to your health.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.860
And so the first
thing love on them.

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.770
Let them know-- support them.

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:34.210
Help them get to the resources.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:36.220
Let them know that
you understand.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.410
Sometimes you don't
have to say anything.

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:40.754
Sometimes you've just got
to be there and just smile.

00:52:40.754 --> 00:52:41.670
Let them know you're--

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:44.650
hey, I'm here for you
whenever you want to talk.

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:45.940
Do preventative things.

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.106
Go and check on them.

00:52:48.106 --> 00:52:49.480
Spend some time
with that person.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:54.600
Maybe go to a group
session with them.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.180
I think that is also good when
your support system supports

00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.490
you in those group sessions.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:02.320
That's helpful as
well but just knowing

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.600
that they trust you to
be able to talk about it,

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.390
just continuously check
in with them, make sure

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:15.280
that they're OK because a lot of
times flashbacks can come back.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.890
You can smell something that
might take you back to a place.

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.560
You could see something that
might take you to a place.

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.260
You can hear something that
could take you back to a place.

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.090
And those flashbacks are real.

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:28.900
And a part of my PTSD when
the abuse was coming back,

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.320
I was trying to push it down,
and that confliction I believe

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.930
is where my mind
really start to race.

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:37.270
And that's a
dangerous place to be.

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:40.090
So just making sure that
they have the resources

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:42.110
and they feel
supported is important.

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:43.680
MJ: None of us have
all the answers,

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.990
but it's important just to show
up for our friends and family.

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:50.260
We are at the hour,
so we'll end here.

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.390
But I do have one
burning question for you.

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:53.431
KEYON DOOLING: Okey doke.

00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:57.180
MJ: Who do you think is going
to win tonight, Celtics or Cavs?

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.080
KEYON DOOLING: So
I'm a Celtics fan.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.230
I played for the Celtics.

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:02.680
That's the organization
that helped save my life,

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.520
but I believe the Celtics
are on the road tonight.

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.530
And the home team has won
every game in this series,

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:12.375
and so I will say tonight I
believe the Cavs will get them.

00:54:12.375 --> 00:54:13.250
MJ: All right, well--

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.500
AUDIENCE: What about tomorrow?

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.520
MJ: What about tomorrow?

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.489
Live question.

00:54:16.489 --> 00:54:17.530
KEYON DOOLING: I'm sorry.

00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:17.995
I couldn't hear that.

00:54:17.995 --> 00:54:19.161
MJ: Warriors Versus Rockets?

00:54:19.161 --> 00:54:19.862
[LAUGHS]

00:54:19.862 --> 00:54:21.820
KEYON DOOLING: No, I
believe the home team will

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.260
win that game as well tomorrow.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.421
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:26.900
MJ: All right, seven
game series all the way.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.770
Well, Keyon, thank you
so much for sharing

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.320
your story, all the
work that you're doing,

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.060
and coming here today.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.470
You have so much going on.

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.845
We are so appreciative of you
spending your time with us.

00:54:37.845 --> 00:54:38.928
KEYON DOOLING: No problem.

00:54:38.928 --> 00:54:39.670
MJ: So thank you.

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:41.000
And I'm excited to see
everything else you do.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.041
KEYON DOOLING: Thank you.

00:54:42.041 --> 00:54:42.667
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:42.667 --> 00:54:43.541
Thank you, MJ.

00:54:43.541 --> 00:54:44.280
Great job.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.430
MJ: You also.
