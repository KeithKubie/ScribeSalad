to understand why we are here we also
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.029
to understand why we are here we also
need to understand where we come from

you were very active in the discussion
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.259
you were very active in the discussion
already back then in discussion about

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
already back then in discussion about
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.530
already back then in discussion about
globalization you wrote a book in 2002

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
globalization you wrote a book in 2002

globalization you wrote a book in 2002
on globalization and the disc contents

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
on globalization and the disc contents
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.290
on globalization and the disc contents
so can you just take us back for a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
so can you just take us back for a
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.229
so can you just take us back for a
moment to that discussion and and and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
moment to that discussion and and and
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.270
moment to that discussion and and and
let's see if there is a link to what you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
let's see if there is a link to what you
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.060
let's see if there is a link to what you
identified back then and the rise of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
identified back then and the rise of
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.910
identified back then and the rise of
populism and the kind of politics that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
populism and the kind of politics that
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.510
populism and the kind of politics that
we are now in yeah I think there is a is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
we are now in yeah I think there is a is
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.330
we are now in yeah I think there is a is
a link one of the problems is that some

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
a link one of the problems is that some
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.910
a link one of the problems is that some
of our political leaders oversold

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
of our political leaders oversold
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.039
of our political leaders oversold
globalization they said that everybody

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
globalization they said that everybody
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.479
globalization they said that everybody
was going to be better off as a result

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
was going to be better off as a result
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.620
was going to be better off as a result
of globalization it didn't happen and in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
of globalization it didn't happen and in
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.370
of globalization it didn't happen and in
fact standards of living of many people

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
fact standards of living of many people
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.859
fact standards of living of many people
got worse to the point just in the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
got worse to the point just in the
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.560
got worse to the point just in the
United States the median income of a

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570
United States the median income of a
 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.420
United States the median income of a
full-time male worker and the ones who

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
full-time male worker and the ones who
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.010
full-time male worker and the ones who
have full-time jobs are the lucky ones

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
have full-time jobs are the lucky ones
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.990
have full-time jobs are the lucky ones
of a full-time male worker in the United

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
of a full-time male worker in the United
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.539
of a full-time male worker in the United
States are what the look at the level

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
States are what the look at the level
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.840
States are what the look at the level
that they were some 42 years ago and the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
that they were some 42 years ago and the
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.940
that they were some 42 years ago and the
real wages at the bottom are the same

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
real wages at the bottom are the same
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.050
real wages at the bottom are the same
level that there were 60 years ago so

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060
level that there were 60 years ago so
 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.670
level that there were 60 years ago so
the fact that they are doing very badly

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
the fact that they are doing very badly
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.990
the fact that they are doing very badly
is unambiguous and they were told that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
is unambiguous and they were told that
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.690
is unambiguous and they were told that
they perceived some of that as a result

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
they perceived some of that as a result
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.270
they perceived some of that as a result
of globalization there are other forces

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
of globalization there are other forces
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.780
of globalization there are other forces
like technology but globalization did

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
like technology but globalization did
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.179
like technology but globalization did
play a role and the fact that it did

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
play a role and the fact that it did
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.999
play a role and the fact that it did
play a role means that if you have

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
play a role means that if you have
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.480
play a role means that if you have
people demagogues like Trump so much

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
people demagogues like Trump so much
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.589
people demagogues like Trump so much
easier to blame others for your problems

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
easier to blame others for your problems
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.199
easier to blame others for your problems
then saying we didn't do enough to help

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
then saying we didn't do enough to help
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730
then saying we didn't do enough to help
people adapt to the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
people adapt to the
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.250
people adapt to the
in technology we didn't do enough to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260
in technology we didn't do enough to
 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.770
in technology we didn't do enough to
help those people who were facing stress

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
help those people who were facing stress
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.620
help those people who were facing stress
and so that's been where the the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630
and so that's been where the the
 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.690
and so that's been where the the
dialogue went it was to blame others and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700
dialogue went it was to blame others and
 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.430
dialogue went it was to blame others and
this is how it fits into our discussion

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
this is how it fits into our discussion
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.420
this is how it fits into our discussion
today the fact that what the political

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
today the fact that what the political
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.520
today the fact that what the political
leaders said was not correct it was not

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
leaders said was not correct it was not
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.150
leaders said was not correct it was not
true

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
true
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.170
true
was not true undermined trust not in

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180
was not true undermined trust not in
 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.270
was not true undermined trust not in
only in those political leaders but in

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
only in those political leaders but in
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.110
only in those political leaders but in
the elites and the institutions of the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120
the elites and the institutions of the
 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.600
the elites and the institutions of the
leaks that seem to support that but they

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610
leaks that seem to support that but they
 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.910
leaks that seem to support that but they
thought they were doing the right thing

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920
thought they were doing the right thing
 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.980
thought they were doing the right thing
or are you suggesting that they did it

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990
or are you suggesting that they did it
 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.290
or are you suggesting that they did it
with the knowledge that it would hurt

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300
with the knowledge that it would hurt
 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.850
with the knowledge that it would hurt
our societies that's a good question

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860
our societies that's a good question
 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.330
our societies that's a good question
there were some of us that were raising

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
there were some of us that were raising
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.190
there were some of us that were raising
questions about what globalization was

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
questions about what globalization was
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.500
questions about what globalization was
going to do to inequality and for the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510
going to do to inequality and for the
 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.670
going to do to inequality and for the
most part I think I was in the Clinton

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680
most part I think I was in the Clinton
 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.220
most part I think I was in the Clinton
administration when some of these bad

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230
administration when some of these bad
 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.700
administration when some of these bad
trade agreements were done and I don't

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710
trade agreements were done and I don't
 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.540
trade agreements were done and I don't
think that anybody thought they were

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550
think that anybody thought they were
 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.790
think that anybody thought they were
going to have the magnitude of the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800
going to have the magnitude of the
 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.870
going to have the magnitude of the
adverse effects that they did but we

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880
adverse effects that they did but we
 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.520
adverse effects that they did but we
were aware that there was a problem and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530
were aware that there was a problem and
 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.370
were aware that there was a problem and
we advocated what was called Trade

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380
we advocated what was called Trade
 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.740
we advocated what was called Trade
Adjustment Assistance we we realized

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750
Adjustment Assistance we we realized
 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.790
Adjustment Assistance we we realized
that people were going to lose their

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800
that people were going to lose their
 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.590
that people were going to lose their
jobs and we argued that there needed to

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600
jobs and we argued that there needed to
 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.490
jobs and we argued that there needed to
be assistance but the Republicans

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500
be assistance but the Republicans
 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.100
be assistance but the Republicans
consistently pushed back on that so bad

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110
consistently pushed back on that so bad
 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.740
consistently pushed back on that so bad
so that was the main problem you think

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750
so that was the main problem you think
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.900
so that was the main problem you think
with the policies that we're not dealing

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910
with the policies that we're not dealing
 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.810
with the policies that we're not dealing
with the adverse adverse consequences of

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820
with the adverse adverse consequences of
 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.780
with the adverse adverse consequences of
a free trade or what was what was what

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790
a free trade or what was what was what
 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.670
a free trade or what was what was what
was really the problem if you would've

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680
was really the problem if you would've
 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.949
was really the problem if you would've
seen that I mean what I'm saying the

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959
seen that I mean what I'm saying the
 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.480
seen that I mean what I'm saying the
people who were losing the jobs were the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490
people who were losing the jobs were the
 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.930
people who were losing the jobs were the
people who were the obvious sources you

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
people who were the obvious sources you
 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.490
people who were the obvious sources you
know they were feeling at front on but

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500
know they were feeling at front on but
 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.909
know they were feeling at front on but
the the broader problem was that as we

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
the the broader problem was that as we
 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.270
the the broader problem was that as we
open up our markets

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280
open up our markets
 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.990
open up our markets
we put unskilled American workers in

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000
we put unskilled American workers in
 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.360
we put unskilled American workers in
competition with unskilled workers from

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370
competition with unskilled workers from
 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.290
competition with unskilled workers from
developing countries from China and

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300
developing countries from China and
 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.790
developing countries from China and
economic science if you want to use that

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800
economic science if you want to use that
 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.540
economic science if you want to use that
word economic science predicted that in

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550
word economic science predicted that in
 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.840
word economic science predicted that in
that context wages of unskilled workers

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850
that context wages of unskilled workers
 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.780

00:22:59.970 --> 00:22:59.980
has to happen and they are other they're
 

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.270
has to happen and they are other they're
either

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:00.280
either
 

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.490
either
there should be pressed to do it with

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:02.500
there should be pressed to do it with
 

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.160
there should be pressed to do it with
regulation or or what should be done

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.170
regulation or or what should be done
 

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.050
regulation or or what should be done
well I think they have to be regulated

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:07.060
well I think they have to be regulated
 

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.210
well I think they have to be regulated
in what in what way so well who do you

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:09.220
in what in what way so well who do you
 

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.670
in what in what way so well who do you
recommend and got a government liberal

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:11.680
recommend and got a government liberal
 

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.760
recommend and got a government liberal
and liberal democratic government to do

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:13.770
and liberal democratic government to do
 

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.700
and liberal democratic government to do
and not becoming a liberal yeah so I

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:17.710
and not becoming a liberal yeah so I
 

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.010
and not becoming a liberal yeah so I
don't worry about Sweden becoming a

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:20.020
don't worry about Sweden becoming a
 

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:27.330
don't worry about Sweden becoming a
liberal yet so if and let me be there

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:27.340
liberal yet so if and let me be there
 

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.860
liberal yet so if and let me be there
are some easy things and there's some

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:28.870
are some easy things and there's some
 

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.290
are some easy things and there's some
more difficult things so some of the

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:31.300
more difficult things so some of the
 

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.020
more difficult things so some of the
easy things are disclosure requirements

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.030
easy things are disclosure requirements
 

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.940
easy things are disclosure requirements
you know if you have a paid

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:35.950
you know if you have a paid
 

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.430
you know if you have a paid
advertisement you have to know who is

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:38.440
advertisement you have to know who is
 

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.330
advertisement you have to know who is
paying you and disclose that when that

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:42.340
paying you and disclose that when that
 

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.400
paying you and disclose that when that
message has been circulated so you would

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:44.410
message has been circulated so you would
 

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.810
message has been circulated so you would
then know and when Americans are getting

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:45.820
then know and when Americans are getting
 

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.600
then know and when Americans are getting
a message paid by a Russian or Russian

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:48.610
a message paid by a Russian or Russian
 

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.740
a message paid by a Russian or Russian
bond they would know where it's

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:49.750
bond they would know where it's
 

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.410
bond they would know where it's
companies II check exactly that would be

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:52.420
companies II check exactly that would be
 

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.280
companies II check exactly that would be
very easy

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:53.290
very easy
 

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.430
very easy
you could have systems of verification

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440
you could have systems of verification
 

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.680
you could have systems of verification
you know if you make an assertion you

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:58.690
you know if you make an assertion you
 

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.549
you know if you make an assertion you
could have

00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559
could have
 

00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:01.230
could have
of institutions that verify young you

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240
of institutions that verify young you
 

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.149
of institutions that verify young you
would say this has been verified this

00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159
would say this has been verified this
 

00:24:03.159 --> 00:24:04.799
would say this has been verified this
has not been verified this has been

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:04.809
has not been verified this has been
 

00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:07.669
has not been verified this has been
falsified so that kind of information

00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679
falsified so that kind of information
 

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:14.450
falsified so that kind of information
you can slow down the speed with which

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460
 

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:18.180
information gets transmitted so that you

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:18.190
information gets transmitted so that you
 

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:22.409
information gets transmitted so that you
don't get these cascades the mafiocracy

00:24:22.409 --> 00:24:22.419
don't get these cascades the mafiocracy
 

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:25.259
don't get these cascades the mafiocracy
that I talked about there locks you know

00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:25.269
that I talked about there locks you know
 

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:27.269
that I talked about there locks you know
that the whole thing is how you trend

00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279
that the whole thing is how you trend
 

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:30.239
that the whole thing is how you trend
and that is how you man

00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:30.249
and that is how you man
 

00:24:30.249 --> 00:24:33.119
and that is how you man
manipulate the media so you the the

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:33.129
manipulate the media so you the the
 

00:24:33.129 --> 00:24:35.009
manipulate the media so you the the
whole framework so you can slow that

00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:35.019
whole framework so you can slow that
 

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:37.499
whole framework so you can slow that
down if you slowed it down by just a

00:24:37.499 --> 00:24:37.509
down if you slowed it down by just a
 

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:40.529
down if you slowed it down by just a
little bit and McCrone did that during

00:24:40.529 --> 00:24:40.539
little bit and McCrone did that during
 

00:24:40.539 --> 00:24:43.799
little bit and McCrone did that during
the the frank selection that that worked

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:43.809
the the frank selection that that worked
 

00:24:43.809 --> 00:24:46.109
the the frank selection that that worked
so there's a whole variety of things

00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:46.119
so there's a whole variety of things
 

00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:47.789
so there's a whole variety of things
that in the PowerPoint that didn't have

00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799
that in the PowerPoint that didn't have
 

00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:50.489
that in the PowerPoint that didn't have
a chance to present where I align things

00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:50.499
a chance to present where I align things
 

00:24:50.499 --> 00:24:52.830
a chance to present where I align things
that would do not represent in any way a

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840
that would do not represent in any way a
 

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.350
that would do not represent in any way a
threat to it can't be done that can't be

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360
threat to it can't be done that can't be
 

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.659
threat to it can't be done that can't be
done but there are stronger things if

00:24:57.659 --> 00:24:57.669
done but there are stronger things if
 

00:24:57.669 --> 00:25:01.200
done but there are stronger things if
they won't do it there is a sense that

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:01.210
they won't do it there is a sense that
 

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:05.820
they won't do it there is a sense that
this is a public utility what we call

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:05.830
this is a public utility what we call
 

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.590
this is a public utility what we call
the public utility is something that is

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600
the public utility is something that is
 

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.859
the public utility is something that is
a platform over which this is what you

00:25:10.859 --> 00:25:10.869
a platform over which this is what you
 

00:25:10.869 --> 00:25:13.560
a platform over which this is what you
have to operate and everybody and public

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:13.570
have to operate and everybody and public
 

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.710
have to operate and everybody and public
utilities probably should be if they

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720
utilities probably should be if they
 

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.690
utilities probably should be if they
can't be well regulated need to be

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:18.700
can't be well regulated need to be
 

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.669
can't be well regulated need to be
publicly owned so I think that

00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679
publicly owned so I think that
 

00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:26.269
publicly owned so I think that
public ownership has been obviously

00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279
public ownership has been obviously
 

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:29.039
public ownership has been obviously
Facebook has an incentive to try to tell

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:29.049
Facebook has an incentive to try to tell
 

00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:31.970
Facebook has an incentive to try to tell
you that public ownership won't work and

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980
you that public ownership won't work and
 

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.529
you that public ownership won't work and
they've been remarkably successful in

00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:34.539
they've been remarkably successful in
 

00:25:34.539 --> 00:25:37.440
they've been remarkably successful in
that kind of propaganda but I think

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.450
that kind of propaganda but I think
 

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.519
that kind of propaganda but I think
there's absolutely no today the

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:41.529
there's absolutely no today the
 

00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:45.899
there's absolutely no today the
technology was publicly developed I

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:45.909
technology was publicly developed I
 

00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:47.940
technology was publicly developed I
think there are systems of checks and

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:47.950
think there are systems of checks and
 

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.009
think there are systems of checks and
balances that would make a public

00:25:50.009 --> 00:25:50.019
balances that would make a public
 

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:52.529
balances that would make a public
utility work professor Stiglitz thank

00:25:52.529 --> 00:25:52.539
