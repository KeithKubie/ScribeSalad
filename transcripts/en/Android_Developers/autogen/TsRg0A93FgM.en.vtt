audience and that's why we provide the
 

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.699
audience and that's why we provide the
TV input framework and also the examples

00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:13.709
TV input framework and also the examples
 

00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:16.340

the necessary metadata that's read by TV

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:32.190
the necessary metadata that's read by TV
 

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.310
the necessary metadata that's read by TV
input framework and then you rate your

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320
input framework and then you rate your
 

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.139
input framework and then you rate your
channel is ready and you will start to

00:20:36.139 --> 00:20:36.149
channel is ready and you will start to
 

00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:40.130
channel is ready and you will start to
get up and running so this is the

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140
get up and running so this is the
 

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.340
get up and running so this is the

channel information the program

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:51.210
channel information the program
 

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.080
channel information the program
information that you fill in and

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.090
information that you fill in and
 

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.430

information you just need to put it into
 

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.669
information you just need to put it into
into the content content provider so if

00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679
into the content content provider so if
 

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:03.500
into the content content provider so if
you look at this file what we did with

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:03.510
you look at this file what we did with
 

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.110
you look at this file what we did with
what we do is basically content create a

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120
what we do is basically content create a
 

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.399
what we do is basically content create a
Content values object and and then at

00:22:10.399 --> 00:22:10.409
Content values object and and then at
 

00:22:10.409 --> 00:22:13.100
Content values object and and then at
the input ID the name of your channel

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.110
the input ID the name of your channel
 

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:17.120
the input ID the name of your channel
the display number then just get the

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.130
the display number then just get the
 

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.340
the display number then just get the
content resolver and then just push it

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:19.350
content resolver and then just push it
 

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.430
content resolver and then just push it
in another thing is you don't hate to

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440
in another thing is you don't hate to
 

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.289
in another thing is you don't hate to
have separate applications if you have

00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299
have separate applications if you have
 

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:26.450
have separate applications if you have
multiple channels just like we saw in

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460
multiple channels just like we saw in
 

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.529

can just repeat this this thing if you

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:35.910
can just repeat this this thing if you
 

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.120
can just repeat this this thing if you
is how many channels you have and then

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:38.130
is how many channels you have and then
 

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.860
is how many channels you have and then
all of them will be available to for

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:39.870
all of them will be available to for
 

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.770
all of them will be available to for
viewing for the users of course this

life cycle of the TV input service that
 

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.880
life cycle of the TV input service that
you're implementing everything starts

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:07.890
you're implementing everything starts
 

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.560
you're implementing everything starts
with the launch of live channels

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:09.570
with the launch of live channels
 

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.200

channels those light blue boxes are the
 

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.140
channels those light blue boxes are the
things that you are responsible for the

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:39.150
things that you are responsible for the
 

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.750

first one is the on tune method the on

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760
first one is the on tune method the on
 

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.840
first one is the on tune method the on
tune method is where you get the channel

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:44.850
tune method is where you get the channel
 

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.420
tune method is where you get the channel
URI that you need to tune to and then

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:47.430
URI that you need to tune to and then
 

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.610
URI that you need to tune to and then
you need to get the channel information

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620
you need to get the channel information
 

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.250
you need to get the channel information
it's just a URI then you need to get

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260
it's just a URI then you need to get
 

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.350
it's just a URI then you need to get
where the video is going to be played

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360
where the video is going to be played
 

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.930
where the video is going to be played
for him if you have any captions what is

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940
for him if you have any captions what is
 

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.780
for him if you have any captions what is
the title of the channel you're going to

00:23:59.780 --> 00:23:59.790
the title of the channel you're going to
 

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.760
the title of the channel you're going to
get it from this database that you're

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:01.770
get it from this database that you're
 

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.100
get it from this database that you're
using can be content provider it can be

using can be content provider it can be
 

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.110
using can be content provider it can be
some other database or you can just get

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120
some other database or you can just get
 

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.860
some other database or you can just get
it from from from the web then you need

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:09.870
it from from from the web then you need
 

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.360
it from from from the web then you need
to check if to your program is still

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:11.370
to check if to your program is still
 

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.990
to check if to your program is still
available by available I mean if it's

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000
available by available I mean if it's
 

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.330
available by available I mean if it's
still available for viewing if the media

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340
still available for viewing if the media
 

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.120
still available for viewing if the media
is available or it can become it can be

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:20.130
is available or it can become it can be
 

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.460
is available or it can become it can be
blocked so you you may have some age

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:22.470
blocked so you you may have some age
 

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.910
blocked so you you may have some age
restricted content so it is possible

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:25.920
restricted content so it is possible
 

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.100
restricted content so it is possible
that the media controls parental

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.110
that the media controls parental
 

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.320
that the media controls parental
controls are set up and it's not really
