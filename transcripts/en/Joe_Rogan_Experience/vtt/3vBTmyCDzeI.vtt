00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.480
The Joe Rogan experience. It's a conversation that I think is a fascinating one,

2
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:06.680
the conversation of reparations.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.190
Cause it can be no doubt that something horrible happened to the black community

4
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:12.980
and they're still suffering from it. But I'm especially in the deep South,

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.860
when you look at these places where the people who lived are the direct

6
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:16.850
descendants of slaves.

7
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.630
And then these are the same impoverished neighborhoods that no one's ever done

8
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:22.880
anything to try to fix, right? So how do you fix it?

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.890
<v 1>Uh, you first have to start with a subconscious monitor, the black mind. Uh,</v>

10
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:31.440
and the problem with the black mind is defect that the black mind starts off

11
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:35.100
with a defeatist mentality from the day you're born, you're taught, uh,

12
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.420
the white man is out to get you. So you start off with a boogeyman and then, um,

13
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.570
you're taught that you're a slave, right? Uh,

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.600
so when your subconscious mind believes that the beginnings of your race is a

15
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:51.360
slave, how do you aspire to be more than that?

16
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.480
So in order to correct a black community,

17
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:58.110
you have to teach black history or so-called black history, or what?

18
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:02.490
I would say African history and chronological order. Before we were slaves,

19
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:04.380
we were Kings. So how do you,

20
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.470
how do you have a whole entire nation of 40 some odd million black people and

21
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:13.890
majority of them never heard a queen and Gola who never heard of the Songhai

22
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:18.300
empire to Mali empire? You know, none of this stuff, right? King, Masa, Masa.

23
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.340
How do you, how do you,

24
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.850
how do you raise a people's level of awareness about this stuff?

25
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:26.970
When and how do you elevate them to want to do things in life when they think

26
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:27.804
they are asleep?

27
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.690
That's the first thing that you have to do to help black people.

28
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:31.950
You have to teach them who they are.

29
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.590
<v 0>That expression, before they were slaves, they were Kings.</v>

30
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:37.510
The problem with that as a King, as a Monarch,

31
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:40.120
and a Mark is one person who controls giant groups of people.

32
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:41.440
You can have a bunch of Kings.

33
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.710
There's not a lot of Kings can have a nation of Kings.

34
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.550
<v 1>Correct. But that's very different from saying,</v>

35
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.750
you know that we had four kinks, right? Let's say there were just four, right?

36
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.460
That's better than saying Harriet Tubman, Fred Douglas, and these free slaves.

37
00:01:57.461 --> 00:02:00.310
Right. You actually have to see at least one King.

38
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.700
<v 0>I see what you're saying. At least say so.</v>

39
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.180
See one advanced human being that also looks like you,

40
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.120
that came from the same part of the world where your ancestors came from.

41
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.480
So recognize that the trajectory that you and your family are on as a direct

42
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.560
result of being enslaved at someone was enslaved in the past and brought over

43
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:26.610
here against their will. That's why there's the negative mindset.

44
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.320
That's why there's a negative self image is because there's this great history

45
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:32.060
of oppression.

46
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.550
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. You know, when you think you are a slave,</v>

47
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:36.140
you can't operate outside of that.

48
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.040
<v 0>And even if you don't think you're a slave, you think you're inferior. You know?</v>

49
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.910
Do you know who ms Pat is? No. Hilarious comedian,

50
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.000
one of the funniest human beings alive and she was here and one of the things

51
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:49.780
she was talking about was when she was younger that when she would see why

52
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:52.060
people, she wouldn't look him in the eye. She would get nervous.

53
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:56.230
She felt inferior being around them. She just wanted to get away.

54
00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:57.850
She didn't feel like she belonged. Right,

55
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.820
<v 1>right. And a product of not knowing who you are,</v>

56
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.790
not knowing your own personal power. You know,

57
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.340
when you look at the second Punic war as a Carthage,

58
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.580
you had a Hannibal went through the Alps, which is, you know,

59
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:13.990
mission impossible. And he went all the way to the, to the doors of a Rome.

60
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.360
And Rome said, yo, we ain't coming outside to fight you, bro. When he come back,

61
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.780
that's how strong or powerful the army was. They said, we don't want to fight.

62
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.950
They knew if they came outside those Gates, they would get their ass. Whoop.

63
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.810
So how do you,

64
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.280
how do you have a people that walk around not knowing that a Hannibal,

65
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.010
a Barco is a WellStar, uh,

66
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:40.060
studied war general today. The Pentagon still studies him,

67
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.720
right? So how do you, how are you operate in,

68
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.630
in America as a black person and not know who Annabelle Bargo knows?

69
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.940
<v 0>Well, it's difficult, I think for people that were born in American,</v>

70
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:54.720
all their known ancestors from America to even relate. Like I'm,

71
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.750
my family's mostly from Italy and Sicily and some of them from Ireland.

72
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.410
I don't relate at all. I visited Italy in the summer times.

73
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.520
I don't relate at all.

74
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.800
<v 1>Right? So then the other,</v>

75
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.530
the other CYOP is the effect that we would have natives.

76
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.860
We were not brought here on slave ships.

77
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.180
That's not economically sound. Does that make sense? Uh,

78
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.880
so when Christopher Columbus guy who wanted to, well,

79
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.330
Chris Willem has got to the Caribbean according to a primary source.

80
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.850
They basically said the first thing he did was take slaves.

81
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.560
He didn't bring slaves. He took slaves from the Island. He captured people.

82
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.390
So when you have colonization,

83
00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:35.420
you gotta remember United States was only built 13 colonies at first, right?

84
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.860
You think this whole land was empty? No, there were natives here. Right?

85
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.070
But today we're taught that natives as some other people know,

86
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:47.800
natives are the melanated African being that has come here since the, the, the,

87
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:51.860
the beginning of the Mali empire would soak on about, uh, 14,

88
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.660
13th century. We had already come here from Africa. Really? Oh,

89
00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:57.590
yeah. Yeah.

90
00:04:57.591 --> 00:05:01.960
We had already come here to the United States or to this land mass.

91
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.070
This landmass we call the United States.

92
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.760
So the way to the ocean current works is it works, uh,

93
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.950
from Africa leaves out of, uh,

94
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.650
West Africa comes to South America and the Caribbean.

95
00:05:12.651 --> 00:05:15.140
That's just how the currents go. You don't need no paddle boat and nothing.

96
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.780
It'll just occurrence. It's take you there and then you travel up.

97
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.250
But we had already been here.

98
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.470
All you gotta do is look up the story of Sarah erector.

99
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.600
Sarah Wright is a wealthy, so-called native American. Uh,

100
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.510
I think she was a Choctaw tribe or one of these tribes,

101
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.670
but she was wealthy and, uh, she wanted to VIP pass to go somewhere and,

102
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.450
um, they had her classified as a free person.

103
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.900
Why don't we know about the wealthy so-called black people in America?

104
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.860
Why don't we know that there were black slave owners in America?

105
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.380
Why is that not taught? Why is it not true? How many black slave owners, man,

106
00:05:54.381 --> 00:05:56.300
this did the natives here had slaves.

107
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.880
They would trade in with the so called white man. Well,

108
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:02.120
they definitely did that. Natives and slave people of other tribes, right?

109
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:02.691
So if those,

110
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:07.691
if those people are us to so-called black man at those natives or us,

111
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.170
then we have to tell that history and say how we did have territories and we

112
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:19.130
did, you know, carry our commerce and we weren't slaves. We were slave owners.

113
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.940
But the majority of African Americans that lived here were brought over here.

114
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.510
No, no, no, no. That's not economically sound.

115
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.570
What do you mean by it's not economically sound like there were slave ships.

116
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.410
All right. Let's say you wanted to have a, you want to sell marijuana, right?

117
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.040
Right. Would you, uh, import marijuana?

118
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.130
Would you grow it here if it's already here? Well,

119
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.580
it depends on whether or not marijuana grew here. Well,

120
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.210
can you go marijuana here? You can, but we're just talking about marijuana.

121
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.970
Like, what is something that you can't grow here? So,

122
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:56.750
so what I'm saying is people were already here.

123
00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:01.340
Does it make sense to go all the way to this other continent to bring people on

124
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:04.340
a boat when we know that half of your stock is going to die?

125
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.470
You wouldn't do that.

126
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:09.650
So how many people do you think were brought over from Africa on slave ships?

127
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.160
Cause that definitely happened. Uh, I don't believe it.

128
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.740
What do you mean you don't believe it? I don't believe that story.

129
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.580
You don't believe that Africans were brought over on slave ships, correct?

130
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.640
I believe it may have happened. You know,

131
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:25.130
maybe people were brought over as slaves,

132
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:30.131
but I don't think that the black people in America came from Africa on slave

133
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:34.550
ships. I believe the people that were here were slowly conquered.

134
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:37.640
First they got to East coast and then he started spreading out West,

135
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:40.970
little by little Cochran. And when you conquer a tribe, what do you do?

136
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:45.770
You went slave them. Their pow right. Okay. That's what you do.

137
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.360
So you, after you conquered his tribe, you, you, you make them slaves. Now,

138
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:52.550
how do you conquer the natives here?

139
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.400
So let's say you got this tribe is warn against this tribe. Well,

140
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:57.710
this tribe goes talk to the white man. Why? Man says, yo,

141
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:00.590
if you help me wipe out these people, then boom, you know,

142
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:02.180
I'll help you with whatever, whatever.

143
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.000
So they get together and they wipe out this other tribe,

144
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.240
not guess what the white man now outnumbers this Trop say he wipes them out.

145
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.660
You just kill two birds with one stone. You just keep moving like that.

146
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.770
But I'm still confused.

147
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.880
There's a great history of slave ships being brought over from Africa with

148
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:21.140
Africans that became slaves and worked in the South.

149
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.700
Do you think that's lies? History is his story, right?

150
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.630
What about my story is my story now Valley,

151
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:34.690
but if you do 23 and me on someone from these parts of the country,

152
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.490
you'll find out 20 days. That's is 23 and me. So when I,

153
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:43.640
when I, when I take a a 23 and me test, right? Yes.

154
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.070
What's it going to tell me about Africa? That's a good question.

155
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:47.990
We should find probably going to say, Oh,

156
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:52.730
you're from Kenya or you're from Angola, you're from this, right? Right.

157
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.240
These things, these borders were created by Europe

158
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.050
<v 0>in terms, yes. Right.</v>

159
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.500
In terms of like what parts of Africa and how it's distributed and what's a

160
00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:08.240
country and what's not a country. Yeah. Find the Afrikaner's and Dutch.

161
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.220
Yeah. Okay. So you can't classify me based upon a European name.

162
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.590
I understand that. But they're saying geographically geographic location,

163
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:20.300
you can call it whatever name you want. Right?

164
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.690
They can tell you where your genetics originated.

165
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.690
I've got some weird shit in me. I've got like 1% Asian.

166
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.120
I don't know why it's there. 1.6% African.

167
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.140
Cause also the weird stuff that you find in your DNA that like your ancestors

168
00:09:33.141 --> 00:09:35.600
and ancestors, ancestors, this was somewhere.

169
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.950
<v 1>Let's walk down that path. Right? So either way,</v>

170
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.350
if you take black people here in America,

171
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.580
do they DNA sample and it point back to Africa. What does that say?

172
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.420
Says black people in America are Africans.

173
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.590
Now the argument is where we brought here or where we already here.

174
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.760
Did we bring ourselves here or did the white man bring us here? You see,

175
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.500
when you say to white man brought us here,

176
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:02.710
what you're doing is you're removing our ability to transport ourselves.

177
00:10:03.681 --> 00:10:07.490
You're saying, Oh, we didn't know anything about boats. That's a draw. Tommy.

178
00:10:07.491 --> 00:10:10.040
You try and tell me that we didn't know that there was a landmass here.

179
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.140
The only the, the Holy white men knew there was land to the West.

180
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.380
But when you look at the Holy white man, he said, when we got here,

181
00:10:18.381 --> 00:10:21.130
we met black people. Go look at the primary source is the guy.

182
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.300
We met black people. When you got to Caribbean, me, my black people.

183
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.080
You think the Caribbean is right next to America and a Warren in America.

184
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.790
<v 0>That's interesting. Does it make any sense? Well,</v>

185
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.960
you go to Suffolk sense that you do have people that have traveled,

186
00:10:35.961 --> 00:10:38.810
whether it's Polynesians that traveled to Hawaii or people,

187
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.880
I mean there's the Omex, uh,

188
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.670
who has thousands and thousands of years ago in South America.

189
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:47.540
They have purely clearly African faces on this.

190
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.060
I mean really the noses, the lips,

191
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.990
I mean they look African and that was a South American culture that existed and

192
00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:56.720
we don't know anything about them other than the fact that they have these

193
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.130
gigantic stone sculptures that have African faces. Like again, again,

194
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.100
just go to have, you can pull up the ocean currents.

195
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.470
I've seen that Graham Hancock is, I've heard about him.

196
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.430
You read his stuff. It's really fascinating because he's all about that.

197
00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:18.431
He's all about the fact that the idea that human beings were probably living in

198
00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:21.680
advanced civilizations far longer than 14,000 years ago.

199
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.390
They did travel all over the world and that you do find the remnants of these

200
00:11:26.391 --> 00:11:30.110
ancient cultures that we have no explanation for throughout the Amazon,

201
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.960
you know, and throughout different parts of, of uh,

202
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.430
South America and central America.

203
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.290
<v 1>I mean, when you go and you look at rail European history,</v>

204
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.640
you had the Magyars would believe that if they took a bath that was bad,

205
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.950
right? They didn't even want to change their clothes. They,

206
00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:51.490
they thought that dirty was purity.

207
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.930
When we talk about the more going into Spain and into Europe,

208
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.110
the stories in the history,

209
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.360
our history says that when we met the So-Cal Caucasian,

210
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.090
he was sleeping in the barn with the animals and we told them, no,

211
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:10.120
you can't sleep in a barn with the animals. We taught them etiquette.

212
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.200
We taught them running water. We brought that technology to Europe. Now,

213
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:18.790
if we brought the technology to Europe that saved Europe from the black plague,

214
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.110
you mean to tell me that if we save the white race,

215
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.010
that we weren't already in America already. When we brought the technology,

216
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.400
when Rome was dependent on Africa for food,

217
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.770
I remember when the black print black plague hit Rome. The cause was,

218
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:37.810
uh, one of the, uh,

219
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:41.590
officials was still in the grain that was coming from Africa.

220
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.860
So there was famine hit Rome.

221
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.290
If your source of sustenance is from Africa,

222
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.420
how will you superior? You're not,

223
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.650
you get your full from me. So if you get your full from me,

224
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.240
who's more likely to travel this globe? May. I'm the source of food.

225
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.450
And that's the first thing you need to survive on this planet.

226
00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:09.790
So if your whole civilization is depending on me to plot, to plot,

227
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.780
to dependent on me, to supply fool, I made it to America first.

228
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.180
It's just that you won the war and you got to tell the story.

229
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.240
<v 0>Is that their only source of food? I mean, it's a source of food that Rome hat,</v>

230
00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:23.690
right? But Rome is also very close to Africa. Well, let's talk about that.

231
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.980
What kinds of food did they have? Well, I don't know. Some very rudimentary.

232
00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:32.270
It was a very rudimentary, uh, civilization that wasn't all, uh,

233
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.380
what is cracked up to be when you go look at what the Greek said about Egypt,

234
00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:39.500
when you go into Egypt, it's like, yo, it's like [inaudible] city of that time.

235
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.363
The ultimate,

236
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.450
if you really want to talk about African civilization being advanced,

237
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.890
Egypt is the ultimate because Egypt to this day is still unexplained.

238
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.710
No one really understands how they built those things.

239
00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:54.590
No one understands the how old the culture is.

240
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.460
That's another thing that Graham Hancock and dr Robert Schoch from Boston

241
00:13:58.461 --> 00:14:03.260
university who's a geologist, he's pointing to water erosion and the temple,

242
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:03.771
the Sphinx,

243
00:14:03.771 --> 00:14:08.771
that leads you to believe that that place might have been as old as 9,000 plus

244
00:14:09.261 --> 00:14:13.640
BC. So it absolutely is, if not older to Pharaoh Ramsay.

245
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.730
There's also different styles of architecture, right?

246
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.640
There's an older styles of architecture they find deeper in the sand.

247
00:14:19.641 --> 00:14:22.730
They think it might have been indicative of an earlier kingdom.

248
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.060
And then there's also the new Bian structures of some of the faces,

249
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.190
particularly the Sphinx, the Sphinx, they believe had a lion's face.

250
00:14:31.191 --> 00:14:33.140
And then when they were conquered by the new beacons,

251
00:14:33.141 --> 00:14:37.880
they changed the actual structure of the face of the Sphinx and turned it into

252
00:14:37.881 --> 00:14:39.620
a, a King's face. Well,

253
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.730
the way it was told to me was that it is upper and lower Egypt. So, uh,

254
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.570
upper Egypt is actually our new South, right? That's our South. And what,

255
00:14:47.571 --> 00:14:52.220
what the way it's taught to me was that was the mind of Egypt and the

256
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.570
<v 1>economic section of Egypt was what we see Giza pyramids.</v>

257
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.800
And it's economic.

258
00:14:57.801 --> 00:15:00.860
Because if you look at it as sits between three continents on the Mediterranean

259
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:04.910
sea, so it's a perfect place to carry your commerce. It's the perfect place.

260
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:06.470
That's why everybody wants to beat it.

261
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.470
That's why is there war in the middle East? Because it's a perfect place to be.

262
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:10.640
So do you believe that

263
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.000
<v 0>some Africans came over here and slave ships or none?</v>

264
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.610
<v 1>Very minimal. Very minimal, really minimal. So you think it's a myth almost.</v>

265
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.700
<v 0>Now, does there any scholars that support these opinions?</v>

266
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:24.950
Are these your opinions or the, where are you getting this from?

267
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.060
<v 1>So here's the thing.</v>

268
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.320
This is stuff I've studied probably close to 15 years ago.

269
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.830
So I don't remember a lot of my sources or who I learned it from.

270
00:15:35.831 --> 00:15:37.060
But I can give you a couple of names.

271
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.580
What you gotta do is you gotta look up Shaka Atmos.

272
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.810
You got to look up dr Kaaba Kamin, dr Phil Valentine, Bobby Hemet.

273
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.340
Uh, who else is a good Egyptologist? Uh, shock Atmos is real good.

274
00:15:48.341 --> 00:15:52.330
Egyptologist I think you should start dealing with Shaka Atmos, but um,

275
00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:52.781
these are,

276
00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:55.690
these are videos I used to watch and Lexus I used to watch back in a day.

277
00:15:55.691 --> 00:15:58.030
Now I focus on like startups and that's where my brain is.

278
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.490
That's where my knowledge is focused on, right?

279
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.420
But a lot of this stuff comes from my own common sense.

280
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.780
It just does not make sense.

281
00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:12.760
The justically to take people from all the way from over there to bring them

282
00:16:12.761 --> 00:16:13.390
here,

283
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.930
especially when half your stock is going to die when you got people right here,

284
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.080
you have human resources right here. All I gotta do is pop them,

285
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.410
shoot a couple of them. The rest of them are like, all right, fine,

286
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.100
and you enslave them and none of them died except for the ones I actually

287
00:16:27.101 --> 00:16:29.530
killed. Right? I got a whole millions of people right here. Like,

288
00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:33.250
why would I go all the crazy all the way across the ocean that bring people back

289
00:16:33.251 --> 00:16:36.370
across the ocean. It just doesn't make sense. It's a stupid that,

290
00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:39.970
didn't nobody run a business like that. What's up

291
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.360
Jimmy PBS? How many the title was,

292
00:16:46.361 --> 00:16:50.110
how many slaves landed in the U F [inaudible]. Well,

293
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.840
<v 0>roll it up, scroll it up so I could read that whole thing right there.</v>

294
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.040
Perhaps you like me,

295
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.920
were raised essentially to think of the slave experience per mile in terms of

296
00:16:58.921 --> 00:17:01.230
our black ancestors here in the United States. In other words,

297
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.510
slavery is primarily about us,

298
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.900
right from the Crispus attacks and Phyllis Wheatley,

299
00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:10.890
Benjamin Banneker, and Richard Allen, all the way to Harriet Tubman.

300
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.230
So Jordan truth and Frederick Douglas.

301
00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:17.850
Think of it as an instance we were might think of as African American

302
00:17:17.851 --> 00:17:20.550
exceptionalism and other words that it's the black experience.

303
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.270
It's got to be about black Americans. Well, black Americans will think again,

304
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:27.240
the most comprehensive analysis of shipping records over the course of slave

305
00:17:27.241 --> 00:17:31.890
trade is the transatlantic slave trade database edited by professors,

306
00:17:31.891 --> 00:17:34.320
David [inaudible] and David Richardson.

307
00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:37.050
While the editors are careful to say that all the figures are estimates,

308
00:17:37.051 --> 00:17:39.540
they believe that the best estimates that we have,

309
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.430
the proverbial gold standard in the field,

310
00:17:41.431 --> 00:17:46.431
the study of the slave trade between 1525 and 1866 the in the entire history of

311
00:17:47.491 --> 00:17:51.870
the slave trade to the new world, to the trans Atlantic slave trade database,

312
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:56.871
12.5 million Africans were shipped to the new world.

313
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.470
10.7 million survived the dreaded middle passage.

314
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.520
Disembarking in North America, the Caribbean and South America.

315
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.820
How many of those 10.7 million Africans were shipped directly to North America?

316
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.800
Only about 388,000 that's right. A tiny percentage.

317
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.090
So a small percentage of all the Africans that were enslaved were actually

318
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:24.300
shipped to North America. That's probably closer to truth. Hmm.

319
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.870
Danny come from Africa, bro. That don't make no sense. Nobody.

320
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.170
I run a business like that. Well, they,

321
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.000
they're saying that a lot of people did though.

322
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:33.810
That's 10.7 million people came on boats.

323
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.420
That's what they're saying. [inaudible] slave trade.

324
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:38.280
I don't know if that means that they necessarily came here.

325
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:40.350
They could have been going to Europe. They know that. They were saying,

326
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.620
they were saying that it was in the Caribbean trade does not have to come from

327
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:46.860
Africa. I can trade with you right here in America.

328
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.890
But was it directly to North America is only the under 400,000 right?

329
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.840
Right. Involved in the shipping and going all over the world.

330
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.270
That could be going anywhere. But from Africa,

331
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.050
that's less than 10% African shipped. Yes.

332
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.150
That's less than 10% less than 10% in North America.

333
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:07.440
But 10.7 million Africans in slaves and moved.

334
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.890
Yeah. 10.7 survive. Right. Were were shipped,

335
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:13.080
but it didn't say where they were shipped. It says to the new world,

336
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:14.890
new world is very vague for sure.

337
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:20.150
Only 388,000 actually made it to North America from Haiti or Jamaica or South

338
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.150
America. So you think, yeah. Right.

339
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.530
So you think that there was probably already a significant population of

340
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.640
Africans that were C bearing that made it all the way over here? Yes.

341
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:38.160
Well if you listen to the words of Hancock and the discussion of pre historic,

342
00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:41.310
what we would consider prehistoric use of boats and ships,

343
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:44.730
it's probably likely look at ancient Egypt. Don't you see pictures of boats?

344
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.150
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So they would burry them. I mean if you could, there was the,

345
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.370
um, what is the big science, uh, museum in LA that had the,

346
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.900
the Egypt, uh, exhibit really recently. It's fucking incredible.

347
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.620
But they had a depiction of the boats they used. Yeah,

348
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.620
I mean they had boats for sure. They definitely traveled. So,

349
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:09.621
so how can you tell me that a civilization had boats before Europe was literate,

350
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.350
didn't come to America, didn't set up shop. It's just not common.

351
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.630
I mean, just, I don't need to read a book to understand that,

352
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.140
but definitely makes sense if they made it to South America. I mean,

353
00:20:22.141 --> 00:20:26.430
if the old Macs were, I mean if you look at, you pull up a, an image of a,

354
00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:29.730
the OMAC heads. This is heavily disputed.

355
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.590
John Henry Clark is author. You should study. John Henry Clark has a book.

356
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:38.460
They come before Columbus. I mean, look at that. I mean, these all make heads.

357
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.480
They all looked like that and I stopped the Mexico. Yeah, so it kind of,

358
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:43.800
if you have a zing,

359
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.350
there has to be a large population of people in order to create these things.

360
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:48.040
Right. It has to be,

361
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.420
<v 1>you know, these have to be advanced,</v>

362
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.700
so if they're here already in South America,

363
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.980
why are you going to go across the sea when you got people right here,

364
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.040
you can just in slave South America's connected to America.

365
00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.740
Do you think we didn't come up North and they wouldn't take that whoop. Right.

366
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.480
It's just common sense. Well,

367
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:04.570
particularly when they're finding all this evidence of people that were here

368
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.590
thousands and thousands of years before they ever thought people were the

369
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.510
evidence in the grand Canyon from Egypt.

370
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.790
What I didn't know about that was that is you heard about that part of it?

371
00:21:15.791 --> 00:21:18.370
Yeah. There might be some gold down there. Oh,

372
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.550
is this Egyptian gold in the grand Canyon? Hey,

373
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.930
imagine if they found a fucking Egyptian tomb.

374
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.760
There's Egyptian stuff that's been found in Ohio. Yeah. Yeah.

375
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.050
Although I was looking some stuff up at grandma's telling me I went home and

376
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:35.020
looked up the separate Mt stuff and like right up the road from where the

377
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.000
serpent mound is, there's been a couple of artifacts found.

378
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.230
They're like 800 artifacts and call mountain. Pull that up. Yeah.

379
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.830
There's mounds in America which supposed to be like pyramids or whatever.

380
00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.430
So there's even an Egypt, Ohio. I don't think it's named after that,

381
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:53.110
but it's literally like in the same spot. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. This, this,

382
00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:56.350
this, this history of human travel is fucking fascinating.

383
00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.640
Circumnavigated this globe before a man, it's, this isn't new stuff.

384
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.380
It's new to Europe. It wasn't new to the African race man. Hey,

385
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:07.300
we been here. They got the mounds,

386
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.950
the archeological evidence from Egypt in the grand Canyon. It's right there.

387
00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.030
I've never heard that before. That is interesting.

388
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.260
Archeological evidence in the grand Canyon. This is not part of his story.

389
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.580
He's got to keep you thinking he's got to keep the black people thinking you

390
00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:23.890
were slaves and you came from Africa on boats.

391
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.360
That's what they got to keep you ticking.

392
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.510
But you really think that there's some sort of grand conspiracy to withhold

393
00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:29.344
information

394
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.190
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
