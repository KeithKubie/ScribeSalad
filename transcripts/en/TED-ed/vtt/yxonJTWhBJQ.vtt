00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:08.305
The sun is shining.

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.053
The birds are singing.

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:12.595
It looks like the start
of another lovely day.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.297
You're walking happily
in the park, when, "Ah-choo!"

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.999
A passing stranger has expelled mucus
and saliva from their mouth and nose.

00:00:20.023 --> 00:00:23.082
You can feel the droplets
of moisture land on your skin,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.079
but what you can't feel are
the thousands, or even millions,

00:00:26.103 --> 00:00:29.681
of microscopic germs that have covertly
traveled through the air

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.618
and onto your clothing, hands and face.

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:34.411
As gross as this scenario sounds,

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:38.617
it's actually very common for our bodies
to be exposed to disease-causing germs,

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:41.361
and most of the time,
it's not nearly as obvious.

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:44.634
Germs are found on almost every surface
we come into contact with.

00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:45.877
When we talk about germs,

00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:50.272
we're actually referring to many different
kinds of microscopic organisms,

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:52.651
including bacteria, fungi,

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:54.247
protozoa and viruses.

00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:59.197
But what our germs all have in common
is the ability to interact with our bodies

00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:00.965
and change how we feel and function.

00:01:01.897 --> 00:01:05.282
Scientists who study infectious diseases
have wondered for decades

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:09.363
why it is that some of these germs
are relatively harmless,

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.879
while others cause devastating effects
and can sometimes be fatal.

00:01:13.522 --> 00:01:16.038
We still haven't solved the entire puzzle,

00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:19.547
but what we do know
is that the harmfulness, or virulence,

00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:21.706
of a germ is a result of evolution.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.249
How can it be that the same
evolutionary process

00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:27.142
can produce germs that cause
very different levels of harm?

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.743
The answer starts to become clear

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:32.417
if we think about a germ's
mode of transmission,

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:36.041
which is the strategy it uses
to get from one host to the next.

00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:38.827
A common mode of transmission
occurs through the air,

00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:40.540
like the sneeze you just witnessed,

00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:43.653
and one germ that uses
this method is the rhinovirus,

00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:45.491
which replicates in our upper airways,

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:48.468
and is responsible
for up to half of all common colds.

00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:50.430
Now, imagine that after the sneeze,

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:53.982
one of three hypothetical
varieties of rhinovirus,

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:58.305
let's call them "too much,"
"too little," and "just right,"

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.549
has been lucky enough to land on you.

00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:03.492
These viruses are hardwired to replicate,

00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:06.946
but because of genetic differences,
they will do so at different rates.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.649
"Too much" multiplies very often,

00:02:09.674 --> 00:02:11.852
making it very successful
in the short run.

00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:15.212
However, this success comes
at a cost to you, the host.

00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:19.078
A quickly replicating virus
can cause more damage to your body,

00:02:19.102 --> 00:02:21.259
making cold symptoms more severe.

00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:23.711
If you're too sick to leave your home,

00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:27.583
you don't give the virus any opportunities
to jump to a new host.

00:02:27.607 --> 00:02:29.550
And if the disease should kill you,

00:02:29.574 --> 00:02:32.726
the virus' own life cycle will end
along with yours.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.386
"Too little," on the other hand,
multiplies rarely

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.593
and causes you little harm in the process.

00:02:37.617 --> 00:02:41.370
Although this leaves you healthy enough
to interact with other potential hosts,

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.642
the lack of symptoms means
you may not sneeze at all,

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:49.456
or if you do, there may be too few viruses
in your mucus to infect anyone else.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.777
Meanwhile, "just right" has been
replicating quickly enough

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.197
to ensure that you're carrying
sufficient amounts of the virus to spread

00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:58.864
but not so often that you're too sick
to get out of bed.

00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:02.439
And in the end, it's the one
that will be most successful

00:03:02.463 --> 00:03:06.631
at transmitting itself to new hosts
and giving rise to the next generation.

00:03:07.442 --> 00:03:10.976
This describes what scientists call
trade-off hypothesis.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.994
First developed in the early 1980s,

00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:16.555
it predicts that germs will evolve
to maximize their overall success

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.430
by achieving a balance between
replicating within a host,

00:03:19.454 --> 00:03:22.846
which causes virulence,
and transmission to a new host.

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:25.902
In the case of the rhinovirus,

00:03:25.926 --> 00:03:30.575
the hypothesis predicts that its evolution
will favor less virulent forms

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.036
because it relies on close contact
to get to its next victim.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.147
For the rhinovirus,
a mobile host is a good host,

00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:38.959
and indeed, that is what we see.

00:03:38.983 --> 00:03:42.761
While most people experience
a runny nose, coughing and sneezing,

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:46.093
the common cold is generally mild
and only lasts about a week.

00:03:46.117 --> 00:03:48.153
It would be great
if the story ended there,

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:50.504
but germs use many other modes
of transmission.

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:55.384
For example, the malaria parasite,
plasmodium, is transmitted by mosquitoes.

00:03:55.408 --> 00:03:58.826
Unlike the rhinovirus, it doesn't need us
to be up and about,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.029
and may even benefit from harming us

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:05.088
since a sick and immobile person
is easier for mosquitoes to bite.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.855
We would expect germs
that depend less on host mobility,

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.831
like those transmitted
by insects, water or food,

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:12.965
to cause more severe symptoms.

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.748
So, what can we do to reduce
the harmfulness of infectious diseases?

00:04:16.772 --> 00:04:19.348
Evolutionary biologist Dr. Paul Ewald

00:04:19.373 --> 00:04:22.277
has suggested that we can
actually direct their evolution

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:24.535
through simple disease-control methods.

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:27.987
By mosquito-proofing houses,
establishing clean water systems,

00:04:28.011 --> 00:04:30.137
or staying home when we get a cold,

00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:33.108
we can obstruct the transmission
strategies of harmful germs

00:04:33.132 --> 00:04:35.911
while creating a greater dependence
on host mobility.

00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:38.672
So, while traditional methods
of trying to eradicate germs

00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:41.428
may only breed stronger ones
in the long run,

00:04:41.452 --> 00:04:45.838
this innovative approach of encouraging
them to evolve milder forms

00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:47.666
could be a win-win situation.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.113
(Cough)

00:04:49.137 --> 00:04:50.993
Well, for the most part.
