JANE MCGONIGAL:
Um, and now I think

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.374
we're going to do some Q&amp;A.

00:00:13.374 --> 00:00:16.545
AUDIENCE: Um, so from
a teaching perspective,

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:20.510
how come kids who
are gamers don't

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.910
seem to apply the sort
of being OK with failure,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.950
and exploring the system, and
all of that in the classroom

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.710
setting?

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.165
And how can I make them do that?

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:30.420
JANE MCGONIGAL: Yeah.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.003
I mean, there are a
couple of reasons.

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.300
I mean, in classroom
environments,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.850
there tend to be more
consequences for failure,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.460
right?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.300
I mean, even at
the younger levels,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.440
if you don't do
well on something,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.815
you will be perceived as
not being good at that.

00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:49.460
That could affect what
group you're put in.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.520
As you get older
and you fail a test,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.480
it counts towards your grades.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.310
You don't get to retake it.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.740
I know there are a lot of
schools that are experimenting

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.230
with trying to create
structures for failing that more

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.489
closely resemble games.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.100
So schools where you can
take a test as many times

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.400
as you want, the same way
you would play a level

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.530
as many times as you want,
to focus on mastery rather

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.090
than performance anxiety.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.630
There's a chapter-- Chapter
4 in the book talks about,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.040
though specifically, why
do only some people seem

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.020
to bring the gameful
mindset to everyday life?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.870
And at least 41%
of gamers do not

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.090
bring this to everyday life.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.290
And it has to do with
whether you view games

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.150
as being escapist or whether
you view them as being

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.250
a part of your real life.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.290
So we have this bias.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.460
We talk about games
as being escapist,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.860
and you leave reality, and it
helps you forget, you know,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.424
everyday life.

00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:54.840
And when people
are playing games,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.130
we tell them they're
wasting time, right?

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.050
People who feel that
way tend to play games

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.966
more when their life gets more
stressful, because they see it

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:07.340
as this kind of
coping mechanism,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.740
the same way some
people drink more

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.990
when their life gets stressful,
or they eat junk food,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.732
or they just-- and so then
their problems get bigger.

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.690
And so then they have to
play games more 'cause

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.270
they're more stressed out now.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.400
And it creates this
downward spiral,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.649
and that's actually the
number one predictor of, like,

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.440
who becomes addicted
to games are people

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.470
who see games as escapist.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.310
People who benefit and
sort of the way out of that

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.970
seems to be people who
focus when they play games

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.160
on how they're getting better.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.080
So I play this game,
I'm getting better

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.400
at spatial intelligence, or
teamwork, or coordination,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.692
or designing, or creativity,
or whatever it is.

00:02:42.692 --> 00:02:44.650
So the really practical
answer to that question

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.020
is to talk to kids about
the games they play and say,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.060
what do you have to be good
at to be good at this game?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.060
Or to model back to them.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.330
Wow, it took you four
days to finish that level?

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.620
That sounds really hard.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.910
You must be somebody who,
when you have a goal,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.640
you don't give up until
you really succeed.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.830
And start to help kids see
that there are real character

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.220
strengths that are
part of who they are,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.720
not just when they're
playing games.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.820
They don't have to escape
reality to have those feelings

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.400
or have those strengths.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.270
So it's like a whole
chapter about how

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.278
you do that in Chapter 4.

00:03:23.278 --> 00:03:24.111
AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:24.610
Thank you.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.815
JANE MCGONIGAL: Yeah.

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:28.699
AUDIENCE: Oh, now
I have the mic.

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.490
I've been talking about
"SuperBetter" a lot

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.031
with a friend,
because there was just

00:03:32.031 --> 00:03:34.410
an article in the last
"Psychology Today" about it.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.910
And we thought it was cool, and
we had this whole discussion

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.880
about what are our powerups
and what are our bad guys.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.990
And that was cool.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.700
So my question is
actually a question

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.750
from my friend, who
says, please ask, I'm

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.540
curious as to how effectively
people use "SuperBetter"

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.590
to deal with issues I
might be concerned about,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.910
like procrastination
and mild anxiety,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.460
rather than deeply debilitating
depression, et cetera.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.810
JANE MCGONIGAL: Right.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.979
OK.

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.380
So I'm going to give it
to you straight here.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:08.110
This method seems to work better
and better the more difficult

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.730
your challenge is.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.820
So we crunched the numbers, and
people who signed up to, like,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.080
I want to lose 10 pounds,
I want to run my first 5K,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.810
I don't know, I'm just bored
with my life, I want to change,

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.990
those people do not
register a lot of benefits.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.120
There's measurement tools
inside the system where

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.950
we look at changes in
things like courage,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.070
and optimism, and
things like that.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.610
Those people don't
register as many changes.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.990
Whereas people who come
with big problems, you

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.180
know-- I just lost
a family member,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.930
I've been diagnosed
with something,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.360
I have always
suffered with anxiety,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.740
they register the
biggest changes.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.310
I think that's important.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.410
And there are lots of reasons
that would make sense why.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.840
I mentioned the idea of
post-traumatic growth earlier.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.450
As I explained in the book,
the "SuperBetter" method,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.980
at its heart, what
it seems to do

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.030
is promote
post-traumatic growth.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.020
In order to have
post-traumatic growth,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.111
you have to have some kind of
serious challenge or trauma.

00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:17.110
Now, there is a version
of post-traumatic growth

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.780
that does not require trauma.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.330
It's called
post-ecstatic growth.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.170
So I also talk about
that in the book.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.880
But it still requires
you to do something

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.800
that is extremely difficult--
so running a marathon, not

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.500
a 5K, a marathon.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.160
Trying to maybe write your
first book, starting a company,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160
becoming a parent
for the first time.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.470
So positive things,
but that will really

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.457
force you to dig
deep and cultivate

00:05:43.457 --> 00:05:44.540
that new form of strength.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.020
So the short version
is it might help,

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.150
but it will make a
bigger difference

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.430
in the lives of
people who are really

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.840
struggling with something.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.167
So one suggestion is,
put it on your phone now

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:01.500
and hopefully you don't need it.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.785
But maybe someday it
will help you more.

00:06:05.785 --> 00:06:07.160
AUDIENCE: I've
tried to use games

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.660
as a way of developing
particular cognitive styles,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.830
and I've often found
I'll start playing

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.310
a game with the intent of
I'm going to be practicing

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.520
some cognitive skill or other.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.560
And then I find an
hour has passed,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.900
and I notice I slipped
totally into complacency,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.450
and I wasn't practicing
that cognitive style.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.540
I wasn't trying the new strategy
that I had intended to try.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.730
How do I maintain
the focus required

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.970
when playing games to make sure
that I actually do use them

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.400
as that sort of practice, rather
than idly passing the time?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.110
JANE MCGONIGAL: Well,
that's really interesting.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.680
Because on one hand,
I mean, I would

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.360
think, from what I've seen,
that idly passing the time

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.880
is actually totally fine.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.070
I mean, that it will
do the same thing.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.630
You don't have to adopt a
particular style of gameplay

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.405
or strategy.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.420
So we talked about playing
a game you've never

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.890
played before will make
that mindset happen faster

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.840
than playing a game
you've played 100 times.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.820
So maybe it'd be more
a matter of making sure

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.750
that you're exposing
yourself to different games,

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.340
different genres of games.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.790
You know, if you've never
played a certain genre,

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:49.550
to try to expand your competency
with different kinds of games.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.680
I would think that aspect of
making sure that you're always

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.500
requiring yourself to be
learning and improving

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.760
is probably the most
important aspect of it.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.970
But other than that, there's
not a particular, you know.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.390
Just make sure that it's
really challenging for you,

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.532
and challenge yourself to
learn different games is just

00:08:12.532 --> 00:08:14.662
a really good way to do that.

00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:15.162
Cool.

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:17.050
What else?

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.575
You guys pick.

00:08:19.575 --> 00:08:21.440
AUDIENCE: Um, so
you said we should

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.455
ask this question earlier.

00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:26.830
What can go wrong with violent
video games that doesn't--

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.580
JANE MCGONIGAL:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.510
OK.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.980
So all of the stuff
they report in the media

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.320
is hype and not true
except for if you

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.130
spend most of your
time playing violent,

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.480
aggressive-themed games--
we'll use "Call of Duty"

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.060
as an example--
against people you

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:50.650
don't know online-- not in
the same space-- the one

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.050
negative side effect of
that is that it boosts

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.610
your testosterone in a
way that does not happen

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.910
in other gameplay contexts.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.466
It doesn't happen if you
are playing against people

00:08:59.466 --> 00:09:00.500
you know in real life.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.166
So we don't have to
be in the same room.

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:04.940
But if I know I'm playing
you and we're cool,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.270
I'm not going to get this
sort of testosterone-jack.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.020
There's a lot of research behind
it that I explain in the book.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.980
But for now, we'll
just say you can get,

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.700
basically,
testosterone poisoning,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.320
is how one researcher
describes it,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.440
where after you're done
playing, for hours afterwards

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.250
can make you just more
hostile in your interaction

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.880
with other people,
more aggressive, less

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.050
compassion and empathy,
'cause you're really

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.230
jacked up on testosterone, which
just has that effect on people.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.470
So, you know, that's why
some game communities

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.570
may have a reputation
for the kind of people

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.310
that become kind of jerks.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.110
So I recommend that you spend
less than half your time

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.690
doing that.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.020
If you're going to play
a lot of these games,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.270
make sure you're spending a
significant amount of time

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.930
playing them with people you
know, that you have to continue

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.220
to have relationships
with, because that's

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.210
what dampens the testosterone.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.100
However, I'm a very
open-minded person.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.850
I think people should use games
to benefit themselves however

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.630
they want.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.860
There may be people who want
to jack up some testosterone.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.135
I'm going into a
contract negotiation,

00:10:12.135 --> 00:10:14.120
and I do want to be aggressive.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.420
Or you may want that.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.810
So I am not to judge.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.220
There may be benefits to it as
well, but that is the genre.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.840
So thanks for
coming back to that.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.775
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
if you've investigated

00:10:26.775 --> 00:10:30.400
a relationship between your
work on PTSD and other work,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.740
like van der Kolk's "The
Body Keeps the Score,"

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.462
ideas of trauma being stored
somatically, physically.

00:10:36.462 --> 00:10:38.420
JANE MCGONIGAL: No, I'm
not familiar with that,

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.310
but the name is very evocative.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.940
"Your Body Keeps the Score"?

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that was a new book,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.140
"The Body Keeps the Score."

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.080
JANE MCGONIGAL: I'm going to buy
that. [LAUGHING] That's great.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.770
Thank you for that.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.020
AUDIENCE: So I was kind of
curious about the reference

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.920
to motor neurons,
knowing some of that.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.080
It's pretty controversial,
A. And it only

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.664
applies to sort of where
motor activity's involved.

00:10:58.664 --> 00:11:01.080
I'm kind of curious, not knowing
anything about the gaming

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.570
world, I'm people-watching
these videos screens

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.700
of other people playing.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.670
How much of that is, like,
actual, physical activity

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.500
that their motor
neurons can actually

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.590
relate to versus
intellectual, like if it's

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.530
Scrabble or some boring thing?

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.570
I can look at golf, and
I'm always turned off.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.445
JANE MCGONIGAL: Yeah.

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:22.100
I mean, I would contest
the idea that it's

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.700
just-- I know there are
discussions now going on

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.230
about this sort
of-- what is that?

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.280
The hype cycle, the hype chart?

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.910
It went into the trough
of disillusionment.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.560
But you do absolutely still see
mirror neurons even in things,

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.710
you know, conversations.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.840
If we're close friends
and you're telling me

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.210
about your day, we do see that
my brain will, as you tell me

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.680
your story, start to
mirror the experience is

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.040
if it happened to me.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.310
And I don't know that
that necessarily-- I mean,

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.630
you see the same kind
of emotional activation.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.250
I feel like there's a
sufficient body of literature

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:12.790
that there is a general
processing of experience that

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.250
can be mirrored.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.380
That's where I come down on it.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.840
It's just sort of the--
people are arguing about it.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.740
You know, there is a
strong physical component,

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:33.540
I mean, in the same way that
speed typing has a component.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.960
You have to be able
to input decisions

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.722
and execute decisions very
quickly through the interface.

00:12:40.722 --> 00:12:42.180
It could be possible
to be part of.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.070
I mean, you think about
the piano example.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.240
I mean, that is
probably similar,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.720
playing the piano, and the
controls of a video game.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.941
You still have to be
mirroring the musicality.

00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:55.690
I mean, you have to
have the understanding

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:01.850
of the musicality, and not just
the execution of the interface.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.770
But--

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.270
So we have time for
one more, maybe.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.120
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.270
JANE MCGONIGAL: Yeah.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.820
AUDIENCE: So
sometimes when you're

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.195
achieving a goal
in a video game,

00:13:09.195 --> 00:13:11.130
it feels really frustrating.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.802
So is there a value, positive
or negative, in the frustration,

00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:16.760
or is there only a value
in achieving the goal?

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.110
JANE MCGONIGAL: Oh, no.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.610
No, no, no.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.370
Most of the value is
in the frustration.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.800
I mean, it is.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.930
The value is in staying
motivated and optimistic while

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.110
being frustrated.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.135
So when we were
looking at that--

00:13:31.135 --> 00:13:32.760
what is the mindset
of a super-powered,

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.593
hopeful, individual?

00:13:33.593 --> 00:13:37.410
That is somebody who's highly
motivated, and optimistic,

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.150
and able to learn, and try,
and be flexible, and try

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.670
different strategies, so that
in the face of frustration,

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.840
they will continue to
engage with the obstacle.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.670
It's why I like to
play games myself

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.560
that are very challenging.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.550
I love it when I have to try
a level 100 times before I

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.180
get past it.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.930
That's where a lot of
the resilience that

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.180
seems to be one of the most
essential-- what do games

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.050
make us good at?

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.430
Being resilient in the face
of that kind of frustration.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.060
So yeah.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.200
Don't play games that you're
good at and always winning.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.520
That's just positive emotion.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.610
But the actual
positive psychology,

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.980
the strengths will come
out of playing games

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.440
that you are bad at, which is
why we played a game that you

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.527
guys would-- you guys,
you're surprisingly

00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:33.610
good at massive and
multi-player Scrabble, though.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.950
It was good.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.450
Good.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.510
Well, good to meet you.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.010
Thank you.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.160
[APPLAUSE]
