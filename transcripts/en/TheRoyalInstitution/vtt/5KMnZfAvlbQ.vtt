00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.260
Our brain uses a combination of senses to
provide information about where our body parts are.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.340
This awareness is known as proprioception.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.440
Although this mostly comes from internal body
information,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.150
it can be tricked or confused by external
senses such as sight and touch.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.390
In this activity your kids will work through
a number of illusions

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:52.210
that are designed to trick and confuse your
brains ability to sense your body.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.460
So first of all we're going to do a little
experiment:

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.089
I'd like you all to touch your nose.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.950
Wow you're so clever, you can all touch your
nose!

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.640
As well as having senses like sight and touch
you also have a sense of where your body is.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.600
This can be introduced with this simple demonstration.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.690
Now what I'd like to you do, slightly more
challenging,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.729
is take your finger from your nose, put it
behind your back,

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.490
close your eyes... now touch your nose.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.510
Wow, took a little bit longer but you all
managed to find your nose,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.939
Give yourselves a quick round of applause!

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.939
So the sense that is at work that makes you
know where your own nose is,

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.420
even when your eyes are closed,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.560
is called proprioception.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.579
Can everyone say that?

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:35.579
"Proprioception".

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.579
Proprioception!

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.700
And today, we're going to do lots of experiments
to find out how proprioception works,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.350
So we're gonna have some illusions that will
blow your mind!

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.909
Are you ready? Yeah!

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.840
There are 8 illusions which you can work through
in this activity.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.580
Each of them are designed to trick or confuse
your senses in a different way.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.619
Don't worry if some illusions work better
than others, everybody responds differently.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.531
Many of these illusions work best when you
don't know what to expect,

00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:17.030
so try them out on your children before telling
them what will happen,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.480
this way they should get the full effect.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.000
The ‘working in a mirror’ challenge shows
just how

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.780
disorienting it is when what you see doesn’t
line up with what you feel.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.630
Sit at a table in front of a mirror, with
something blocking your direct view of your

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.630
hand.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.630
Looking only in the mirror,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.630
try to write your name

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.459
and if you want a real challenge try completing
the maze which you can find on our website.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.940
The ‘rubber hand illusion’ is a classic
experiment

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.500
to show how our sense of self can be tricked.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.060
Sit your child at a table, with a screen slightly
to one side,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.200
blocking the view of one of their hands.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.409
In front of them, create a fake hand with
a stuffed rubber glove

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.680
and a towel to hide the space where the rubber
glove’s arm would be.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.180
Now using a paintbrush, stroke both the rubber
hand and the hidden real hand for about a minute

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.540
The participant should start to feel that
the rubber hand is actually theirs.

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:24.660
If you want to see how well it's really worked,
try surprising them by slamming the fake hand.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.000
Try this to give someone the sensation of
having six fingers!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.489
Set up the participant in front of a mirror
like this

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.220
and ask them to look at their reflection in
the mirror.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.950
The other hand should be hidden by the mirror

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.020
On both hands stroke each finger, from knuckle
to fingernail at the same time,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.960
counting each finger as you go.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.120
Repeat it again, but this time, on the hidden
hand

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.879
stroke the inside of the little fingeron ‘5’,

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.349
and then add a sixth stroke, on the outside
of the little finger.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.740
On the visible hand you should pretend to
stroke an invisible sixth finger

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.019
next to thelittle finger.

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.690
They should feel like they have a sixth digit!

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.590
This simple illusion demonstrates how your
brain can get confused

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.599
when different body parts feel different things.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.590
Cross your fingers like this, and stroke them
across your nose.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.770
Because the outside edge of your fingers are
touching the nose,

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.480
it might feel like you have two noses!

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.700
Get your child to stick their arms out, with
their thumbs facing down.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.320
They should then cross their hands over and
interlock their fingers.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.660
They should then twist their hands downwards
and then pull them back up towards their body

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.330
Ask your child to wiggle a single finger on
their left hand,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.700
it's likely that this tangled orientation
confuses their brain

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.440
and makes getting correcthand a little tricky!

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:56.790
Try the ‘cutanous rabbit’ to investigate
how precisely our body can locate sensations.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.340
Ask your child to close their eyes and stick
their arm out.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.210
Next, tap them 4 times at the wrist, 3 times
just above the elbow, and then twice on the

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.540
upper arm.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.870
Try to make sure that the taps are at a constant
rhythm.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.860
It should feel like that taps were spaced
across the arm,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.280
rather than in the individual areas.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.500
This illusion should give the impression that
your arms are sinking through the floor.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.190
Get your child to lie down on the floor with
their arms straight out and eyes closed.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.600
Carefully hold their arms up by the wrists
and hold them for about a minute,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.880
then very slowly lower them back to the floor.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.100
As the arms are slowly lowered, the child
should feel that their arms are falling through

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.270
the floor.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:52.590
Finally, the ‘heavy boxes’ test demonstrates
how expectations based on the appearance of

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.590
an object

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.940
can conflict with how heavy we perceive an
object to be.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.890
In this demonstration, place two equal weights
inside boxes of different sizes,

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.160
cans of baked beans or soup work well for
this.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.710
Get your child to lift each box and then ask
them which they think is heavier.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.740
People tend to assume that the smaller box
is heavier, even though they actually weigh

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.940
the same.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.710
You can turn this activity into a scientific
investigation by recording your observations

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.710
in a table.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.620
For each illusion you should note which senses
are being confused

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.002
and then rate the level of confusion out of
10.

00:06:33.002 --> 00:06:34.002
It felt like my elbow was going through already
and my hand was still trying to get through!

00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:46.210
I think it was tricking my touch, and that
would be a 9.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.910
Looking over the table, they should start
to realise that removing just one of their

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.910
sense,

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.590
especially sight, is enough to disrupt their
brain's understanding of what is going on.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:06.400
I felt like that was my real hand because
I couldn't see the real hand,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.580
and when she stopped stroking this hand I
thought she was stroking this one!

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.720
Which of the experiments did you find the
most puzzling, and why?

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720
OK, Naimah...

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.780
Throughout the activities don't forget to
ask your kids loads of questions

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.590
about what they think is going on

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.950
and how their brains and their body's are
being confused.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.770
The kids have had an absolutely brilliant
time today.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.470
If you've enjoyed this video and want to try
