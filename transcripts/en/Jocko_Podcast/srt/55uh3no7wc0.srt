1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,860
Please discuss how discipline in one
area doesn't make up for slack in other

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:09,720
areas. For example, the fit is
guru who has no savings. Mm.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,070
Yeah. You know, this is something
that we all have to work out,

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,750
watch out for, is the fact that
we, we focus on our strengths.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,630
That's what we do.
That's what people do.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,510
So you get a person that's smart,

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,000
really intellectual person and they let
themselves go physically, right? You know,

8
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,310
or you get a person
that's a physical stud,

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,520
but then they're not going to
challenge their brain power.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,210
Or like the question that was,
you know,

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,260
the example here that was posed,
you know,

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,210
someone that's a fitness
guru or a party goofy.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,860
I'm throwing that one out there because
some people are really good that sure.

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,840
Or they, you know,
they're an entrepreneur,

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,750
entrepreneur and so they're driving
a new Mercedes, but it's at least,

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,600
and they're behind on payments.
So strategically yet. Yeah,

17
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:07,950
yeah. That, um, so you know, I mean,

18
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:11,400
you take another example is what about
the business person that doesn't have

19
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,250
time for their family, right.
And so that's not good.

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,850
So I think the focus here is
we try and we all have to be,

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,200
try to be well rounded and not focus so
much on one area that you're going to

22
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,140
let some ed area go. That's target
fixation is what that is, right?

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,160
Is you walk into a room and you get
fixated on one target, one bad guy,

24
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:33,510
you think there's one bad guy.

25
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,970
So you focus all your energy
and then you're getting flanked.

26
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,310
That's target fixation.
You can't let that happen.

27
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,610
You can't let it happen on
the battlefield. You can't
let it happen on the life.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,880
So look out for that when you do this.
Um,

29
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,180
and I'll tell you this is actually
a reality of the situation. Um,

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,900
I try and maintain this balance,

31
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:56,901
but I've been actually
working a lot lately and what,

32
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:03,561
and this is a clear indicator to me that
I've overbooked myself is last week,

33
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,410
um, we had to, we had to skip
a day of Jujitsu to record.

34
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,300
I mean, we don't do that right? When do
we record? We recorded after Jujitsu.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,530
But I knew I had so much
stuff going on that I said,

36
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:22,920
hey we gotta we gotta record at this time
cause I gotta get all this other stuff

37
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,370
done because I'm traveling and this and
that until we had to skip the huge it's

38
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:30,180
called. So that is a red flag
to me that says I need to,

39
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,700
I need to tighten up,
I need to get my,

40
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,390
get my schedule back in check so that
I can do the things that I need to do.

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,110
Of course, what do I say about the
situation? It's fine. You know what?

42
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,860
Can't train Jujitsu that day cause I'm
trying, I've got some travel coming up.

43
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,710
Good. I'm going to heal up my shoulder a
little bit more. I'm going to, you know,

44
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,970
I'm going to, it's good, it's fine.

45
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,570
But it is an indicator of when things
start going in the wrong direction.

46
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:00,400
Maybe I'm getting targeted,
fixated on, you know,

47
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,440
too much work at a certain time,
which to me again,

48
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,090
I will run this thing in the red as you
say. I like, I like running in the red,

49
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:12,460
right.
I'm in the red and I got no problem.

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Like we will go hard and the numbers
of hours I've been where I will work,

51
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,690
we'll have actually no impact on how
much I'm going to tell them to spend with

52
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,270
my family and do Jujitsu and all
that stuff cause I'll just do it all.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,690
But there is a capacity
that you reach where you go.

54
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,270
Okay now one of these things
that is just started to slide.

55
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,660
Now I need to make sure that
my levels get re re levels,

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,130
I guess you might say equalized
is what I should have said. Uh,

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,810
so back to the subject. Don't
be a one trick pony. You know,

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,830
be a jack of all trades and
master a few of those traits.

59
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,980
And so you can emphasize fitness guru,

60
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,370
you can emphasize intellectual power,

61
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,920
you can emphasize Jujitsu,

62
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,420
but don't put 100% of your effort into
one area because eventually it will take

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,730
you, you won't have anything else. And by
the way, if you put all your, you know,

64
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:19,480
if you put all your, all your eggs
in the basket of intellectual power,

65
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,350
now you're unhealthy. And You die,
right. That that doesn't, you know,

66
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:27,490
I don't care how smart you are. You
can't do two plus two when you're dead.

67
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,260
So don't put all your
focus 100% into one area.

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,960
Don't become unbalanced
in your disciplines.

69
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,270
Spread it around and hold the
line. Yeah man, it's good. Yeah.

70
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:46,090
I guess it kind of feels like,

71
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,470
like you can be understood
that, um, let's see.

72
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,570
I'm real good at, I dunno, fitness

73
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,170
and it's easy to justify
your yourself, you know, like
your, your, let's say, okay,

74
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:07,060
I'm real good at fitness in the fitness
guru and I go around and then I see on

75
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,280
and all,
I go to the store,

76
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,240
go to some party and I see this
other guy who's like socially,

77
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:17,740
he's just hundred percent. Everyone
likes him. Such a nice, charismatic guy,

78
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,290
makes a lot of money in on all this stuff,

79
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,310
but he's not in that good a shape or
I don't know. You smokes in whatever,

80
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,710
you know, it's ease. I
think a lot of people,

81
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,583
cool.

82
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,970
It feels like it's easy to justify wolf
that gets in bad shape. So who cares?

83
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:35,000
I already didn't want any of that. I
wouldn't want all the money, you know,

84
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,350
all this stuff.
It seems like you

85
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,600
got to justify that and you know
if the other guy saying, yeah,

86
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,480
you might be in good shape.
Guessing what? Yeah. Nice.

87
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,650
Toyota Corolla you're driving. He's
all negative on it. Yeah. Yeah.

88
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,480
So both those guys should, you should,
instead of saying, hey, you know what,

89
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,460
they should do, walk up and be
like, hey man, you know what?

90
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,080
I noticed you're pretty
successful financially.

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,640
I like to get in the game with you a
little bit and learn from you about that.

92
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,440
Any other guys should say to
them, well, you know what?

93
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,200
It looks like you're in
pretty good at fitness levels.

94
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,330
I would like to get in the game with that.

95
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,370
Let's work together and improve ourselves
and go out and kick ass and dominate.

96
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,800
Are you in, I'm in, let's do this
instead. What does a normal person do?

97
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,980
They do exactly what you
said. Justify, criticized,

98
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,090
cut people down instead
of building them up. Yeah.

99
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,080
And once you have to be careful of,
if I was to go to you and say, hey,

100
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:34,040
you know echo, I got a lot of money.
I can tell you don't have a lot,

101
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,900
I'll help you out. That's, that can
be offensive to some people. Yeah.

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,430
Cause you think dude, who you think
you are at risk and need your help?

103
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,550
I'm going to worry about money.
I think I'm worried about money.

104
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:47,870
When I got abs like
Yup.

105
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,830
So we have to do is instead of, if
I came to you and said, echo dude,

106
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:55,610
I want to add is like you got,
can you help me get in the game?

107
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,250
And then we formed a little
relationship and now I say to you, man,

108
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,840
so what do you got? What's your, what's
your main income stream dude? You know,

109
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,180
what are you doing? And you say, well
you know I've got these two clients.

110
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,900
If you've got a website, no, not
really. Why don't you have a website?

111
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:10,820
Do you got any social media
to advertise on it? You know?

112
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:14,420
And we go though that road and we
build up. We take care of each other.

113
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,310
That's what we want to do as people.
Yeah.

114
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,120
Kind of like you ever
seen the guys who go,

115
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,520
they see like a football player
or something. It'd be like, Hey,

116
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,930
kick his ass though.
You know,

117
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,190
you know that Kinda guy who can always
like some successful person that he,

118
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,810
I kick his ass though. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

119
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,670
Well I've told the story in four in the
seat, in the seal teams, it's a, Eh,

120
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,860
no one, no one is good. If a guy, look,

121
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,890
we have guys in the seal teams
that are literally, you know,

122
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,540
world class athletes in whatever world,
class triathlete,

123
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:52,250
world class, sailor worldclass, whatever.

124
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,780
And so, oh you, oh, you're, you're
world class triathlete. Oh yeah.

125
00:07:56,781 --> 00:08:01,190
That guy is really good traffic.
That's cool. He's a really bad shot.

126
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,400
Someone who's going to chime in and
cut them down and just the way it goes.

127
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,030
Little slack, no slack. Slack.
