00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.970
We're asked to factor this
expression by grouping.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.380
Now, they mention grouping,
we're going to see what

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.130
grouping is, but we're going
to see very quickly that we

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.230
have to do this thing called
grouping because you can't

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.850
just factor this expression.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.610
If you look at these, each of
the terms, all but one of them

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.750
is divisible by 5.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.590
So you can't just
factor out a 5.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.210
Not all of them are divisible
by either r or s.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.620
This is only divisible by r,
that's only divisible by s,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.060
that's divisible by neither.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.820
So there is no common factor
across all four of these

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.400
terms. That's why we have to
group them into groups where

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.940
there are common factors, and
then see if that simplifies

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.010
the whole thing.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.890
And there is a little bit of an
art to recognizing when you

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.230
can factor by grouping, but
they've set this problem up

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.450
nicely for us.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.620
So if you look at these first
two terms right here.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.240
You have a 5rs and a 25r.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.180
These two guys clearly have
some common factors.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.770
They're both divisible by 5,
they're both divisible by r.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.415
So if I just wanted to factor
this one out, or if I wanted

00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:04.790
to rewrite it as a product
of two expressions, how

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.269
could I write it?

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.080
Well, I could write it as a
product of 5r times-- what's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.420
5rs divided by 5r?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.650
Well, you still have
an s left over, you

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.810
just have an s there.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.010
Plus-- what's 25r
divided by 5r?

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.070
Well, 25 divided by 5 is 5, and
r divided by r is just 1.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.000
So 25r over 5r is 5.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.210
So these first two terms can
be factored into these two

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.230
expressions.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.450
And then let's look at these
second two terms. Well, they

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.660
definitely have a common factor,
you have a negative 3

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.210
or positive 3 common
to both of these.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.710
Let's just go with
the negative 3.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.770
And our goal is really to factor
it into a negative 3

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.830
times, hopefully, something
very similar to s plus 5.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.240
And you might already be seeing
that it's going to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.210
factor into s plus it.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.950
5.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.580
So let's factor out
that negative 3.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.970
So these two terms you can
rewrite as negative 3 times--

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.770
what's negative 3s divided
by negative 3?

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.510
Well, you're just going to
have an s left over.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.220
And then what's negative 15
divided by negative 3?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.470
Well, that's just positive 5.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.570
And just like that, we've
grouped them and we're able to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.400
factor each of those groups, and
then something interesting

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.620
might pop out at you.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.410
And one, you can always verify
that you factored this

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.690
properly by distributing each
of these expressions.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.380
Distributing the 5r times s
plus 5, and the negative 3

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.340
times s plus 5, you'll
get exactly this.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.590
But something maybe jumped
at out you just now.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.170
You have 5r times s plus 5.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.170
Then you have negative
3 times s plus 5.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.420
So now this expression, we
have two terms instead of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.360
four, right, this is one term,
this is another term.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.530
And they both have s plus 5 as a
common factor, so we can now

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.445
factor out s plus 5.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.020
So this whole thing can
be rewritten as s

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.490
plus 5 times 5r.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.720
Right?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.570
If you take 5r times s plus 5,
and you factor out the s plus

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.670
5, you're just left
with the 5r.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.640
And then similarly, if you take
negative 3 times s plus

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.820
5, and you factor out the s plus
5, or divide by s plus 5,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.800
you just have a negative
3, just like that.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.650
And then we're done!

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.310
We've factored this expression
by grouping.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.520
It's s plus 5 times
5r minus 3.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.270
And you can verify it by
multiplying it out.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.860
If you distribute the s plus
5 onto each of these terms,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.660
you'll get this expression
up here, and then if you

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.900
distribute the 5r over there
you're going to get that

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.340
expression.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.180
If you distribute the negative
3, you're going to get that

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.710
expression.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.040
So this does simplify to that,
so we have factored
