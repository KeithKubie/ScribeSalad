1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,430
What is scripture and what his canon,

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,190
these are not necessarily the same thing.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,550
When you call something scripture,

4
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:15,810
what you simply mean is it some kind
of writing that is taken by somebody as

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,590
holy and authoritative, somehow
sacred. Now different religions.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,130
Some religions don't have what we would
normally think of the scripture and

7
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:27,420
Islam, Judaism or Christianity. They
might have lots and lots of holy writings,

8
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:31,530
but they don't have a particular
bounded body of writings that they call

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,780
scripture.
They have lots of inscribed in scripture.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,290
What makes something scripture though is
that it's taken to be authoritative and

11
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,970
holy by some particular community.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,540
Now that notice that does not necessarily
mean it's canonical because scripture

13
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:48,240
in some religions refers
to a bunch of stuff,

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,740
but they don't have a set list of
things that make something. The cannon,

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,830
Judaism, Islam, and Christianity
all have basically cannons. That is,

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,840
it's the Quran for Islam.

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,170
It's a the Hebrew Bible for Judaism
and it's the Hebrew Bible plus the New

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,210
Testament, and we'll talk about some of
the other writings too. For Christians.

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,180
What does it mean to cause something
Canon that makes it different from

20
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,640
scripture?
What by calling it Canon,

21
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:19,641
we're saying there's an actual list
that are religious body adheres to with

22
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,140
books that are either in
our books that are not in.

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,800
So scripture can refer to any kind of
writing that a bunch of people consider

24
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:29,670
holy or inspired or some
are authoritative. But when
you call something cannon,

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,940
you mean that there's a group of
writing that has boundaries to it.

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,240
And of course it just comes
from the Greek word Kennan,

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,380
spelled with one n not to

28
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,570
this Greek word means a list.
It can mean a Rod, a staff,

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,980
it can be a measuring rod.

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,750
And so it comes to be a list that
accounts as authoritative in early

31
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:56,430
Christianity. So that's what, um, that's
what it means to cost anything canonical.

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,070
When you talk about something
like the Shakespeare Canon,

33
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,620
the Canon of Shakespeare,
or the Canon of Great Western literature,

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,880
that's actually using the term in a bit
of an expanded sense because we don't

35
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:09,900
really consider Western literature
to have an actual closed canon of

36
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,890
authoritative text.

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,430
And Christianity though it means the
list of texts that are scripture and

38
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,210
recognized as different from other things.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,710
We have to for first also recognize
that the early Christians,

40
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:26,040
it seems like from the very early period
at least a lot of them accepted Jewish

41
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,880
scripture as their own. So for
example, when the Apostle Paul says,

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,600
scripture says he's not talking
about the new testament.

43
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:38,070
He's talking about Jewish scripture.
So almost all the early Christians,

44
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,530
they didn't know that most of the people
writing the New Testament didn't know

45
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:41,760
they were writing the New Testament.

46
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,690
They just thought they were writing
a gospel or a sermon or a letter or

47
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:48,690
something like that.
So when you see the term scripture in the,

48
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:51,480
in the new testament all,
all every time,

49
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,940
except maybe one time we'll talk
about this when we get to it,

50
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,960
it refers to Jewish scripture
that Christians excepted,

51
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,040
followers of Jesus accepted as their own.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
The oldest materials that
we have for Christianity.

53
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:06,940
And so I'd like to lecture today is going
to be about is how did the particular

54
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,210
27 books that came to be
the New Testament Canon,

55
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,900
how do those get chosen? By
whom? Who made the decision?

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,840
When did they make the decision and
what were the criteria that you used?

57
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,920
Why did they allow some books in and
other books not in the oldest written

58
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:24,010
materials of Christianity or
actually the letters of Paul.

59
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,400
This may come as a surprise because
you get to the gospels first in the New

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,040
Testament and most people assume, oh, the
gospels there about the life of Jesus.

61
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,460
That must be the oldest stuff with the
gospels were actually all written after

62
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:36,370
the letters of Paul were
written by 20 or 30 years.

63
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,360
So the oldest material we have or
the letters of Paul and the oldest,

64
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,520
one of those letters
is first Thessalonians

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,350
probably dated to around
the year 50 or thereabouts.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,160
Pretty quickly though,
different churches,

67
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:55,330
probably Polish churches initially
started sending around copies of Paul's

68
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:57,820
letters. Remember there's no
printing press in the ancient world.

69
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,180
Whenever you have, whenever your church
would get a copy, when he says from Paul,

70
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,350
you would have scribes,

71
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,290
often slaves because slaves are
especially trained to be scribes.

72
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,530
They would take that letter and they would
make a copy of it and then they might

73
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:11,120
keep the original and they'd send
the copy off to somebody else.

74
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:13,090
So they might keep the copies
in the original offices meds.

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,600
And so letters would be copied in books
would be copied and sent around from

76
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:20,970
different communities. Communities.
This obviously happened um,

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,000
in Colassians for 16, which is actually,
I'll argue is not written by Paul,

78
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,500
although it claims to be written by Paul.

79
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,160
The writer says when this
letter has been read among you,

80
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,850
have it read also in the Church of the
layout of seasons and see that you read

81
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,590
also the letter from Laodicea.

82
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,680
So notice this author who I
think is a suit of pig refer.

83
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:40,780
He's riding in the name of Paul,
but not really Paul.

84
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,410
He's saying that there's another letter
sent by Paul to the layout of see in

85
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:47,660
church. So let them send
you their copy and use it.

86
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:48,910
And a copy of this letter to them.

87
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,820
So we quickly see that even in
the letters under Paul's name,

88
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,650
this activity's being spread around.
Also, we see the letter of Ephesians.

89
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,070
Again, claims to be by Paul,
but I'll argue is not by Paul.

90
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,650
When we get to the lecture
way into the semester,

91
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,980
the letter to the Ephesians looks like
it was not actually written to only one

92
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:06,640
church.

93
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,240
It looks like it was a circular letter
meant to be circulated to different

94
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,390
churches.
And one of the ways we think this one,

95
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,720
the reasons we think this because in
some of the old manuscripts of the law of

96
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,690
Ephesians to the Ephesians is not there.

97
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,840
It's either blank or it's
that to somebody else. So we,

98
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,260
some scholars have suggested that maybe
delay the Ephesians was originally

99
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,220
intended as a circular letter and maybe
the original writer sort of even left

100
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:33,370
some copies blank so that somebody
could fill in. Oh well let's see.

101
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,460
We're in Laodicea,

102
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,390
let's say to the loudest he ends and
we can act like Paul's and it just us.

103
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,990
So the manuscript tradition suggests
that it was a letter that was a circular

104
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,280
letter in itself.

105
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,870
We also have imitations of Paul's
letters developing. For example,

106
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:50,650
I said Collagen's I don't think is
written by Paul, by disciple of Paul.

107
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,970
Maybe after his death,

108
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,890
Ephesians was written by a different
disciple of Paul and he was using as his

109
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,230
model for appalling letter.
They actual letters of Paul that he,

110
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,360
or at least some of them
that he possessed new off,

111
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,870
but he was also using the letter to
the Collagen's. So notice this guy,

112
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:10,871
another guy sort of forging another letter
by Paul and he's using another Ford's

113
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:15,740
letter by Paul as his model that
the almost quotes than in places.

114
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,950
So we can tell that the writer of the
Ephesians seized have been a different

115
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:22,760
author, but he used the letter to
the Collagen's as one of his models.

116
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,670
So Paul's letters were being imitated,

117
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,430
new ones are being written and
they were being circulated.

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,710
Paul's letters actually became so famous
and respected and at least in some

119
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:37,160
aspects of early Christianity that
they were called themselves scripture.

120
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,100
And this is the one exception I said
to win. They win. In the New Testament.

121
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:41,990
You see the word scripture,
first of Jewish scripture,

122
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,700
the guy who wrote second Peter.
Again, not really Peter, uh,

123
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,500
but a rider riding and Peter's name talked
about Paul's letters as if any caused

124
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:52,334
them scripture.

125
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,160
He says there are many things in Paul's
that are very difficult to understand,

126
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,920
and some people twist them to their own
destruction as they do other kinds of

127
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:01,220
scripture. So already by the
time second Peter was written,

128
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,620
which was much later than the
lives of the letters of Paul,

129
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,030
Paul's letters have come to be regarded
by at least some early Christians as

130
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,290
scripture themselves.

131
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,710
So collections of Paul's letters were
gradually being made and copied and

132
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:18,460
circulate it. That's the first
development of what you have,

133
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:22,180
a collection of what would be
considered holy riding among Christians,

134
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,170
that it was more than just the Hebrew,
the Jewish scripture.

135
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,020
We also know though about, uh,
oral traditions in Paul's letters,

136
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,480
and this gets us back to how
do the gospels come about?

137
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,840
So the Paul's letters came about that way.
How did the gospels come about?

138
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,080
We know that they were oral
traditions about Jesus.

139
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,050
People would tell stories about
Jesus in their churches. Uh,

140
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,040
sometimes they would tell sayings.
So in Romans 1214,

141
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,730
Paul says,
bless those who persecute you.

142
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,490
Bless and do not curse them.
Now,

143
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:57,400
he doesn't say this is
a quotation of Jesus,

144
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,460
but it sounds an awful lot like
you find in some of the gospels,

145
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:04,540
like in Matthew five 44.
So Paul is saying this,

146
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:09,541
probably passing this along as a quotation
of Jesus in First Corinthians 1123

147
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,450
through 26 here,
I'll read this to you.

148
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,700
I wouldn't start bringing your Bible to
class if you haven't today because you

149
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:21,130
know, uh, you don't
know. You can't trust me.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,620
And so you have to check me out and
make sure I'm not lying to you. Oh,

151
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,660
I should do this now perhaps because
it's the beginning of the semester,

152
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,360
the official motto of the class.

153
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,590
Yeah.

154
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,010
And you have to memorize this

155
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,430
day, Omni booths, doobie
tandem. Say it with me, please.

156
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,730
Day Omni booths to beat with
feeling day on about twice as loud.

157
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,610
Write it down.
Say it tonight before you go to sleep.

158
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,610
Say it in the morning when you
wake every day this semester.

159
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,900
Say it before we go to sleep.
Say it when you wake.

160
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,080
Can anybody tell me what it means?

161
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,260
Got It.

162
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,430
Doubt everything.
Doubt everything.

163
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:18,850
Okay,

164
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,850
and that includes me because I'm going
to lie to you a lot all semester long or

165
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:28,390
at least somebody would accuse
me of that, I guarantee. Okay?

166
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:32,110
First Corinthians 11 if you've got your
Bible, follow along with me. Verse 23

167
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,913
Okay

168
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,470
for I received from the Lord.
Paul says,

169
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,330
what I also handed on to you that the
Lord Jesus on the night when he was

170
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:48,500
betrayed, took a loaf of bread and when
he had given thanks, he broke it and said,

171
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,070
this is my body that is for you.
Do this in remembrance of me.

172
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,460
In the same way he took the
cup also after supper saying,

173
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,770
this Cup is the new covenant in my blood.

174
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,330
Do this as often as you drink it in
remembrance of me for as often as you eat

175
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:06,170
this bread and drink the cup, you
proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.

176
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,850
Where did Paul get this? He says, I gave
it to you as I was received at myself.

177
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,670
This is traditional Greek
language of passing on tradition.

178
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,730
So Paul knows he's passing
on a bit of tradition, very,

179
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:18,200
very early Christian tradition.

180
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,010
But Paul was not a disciple of
Jesus during Jesus' lifetime.

181
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:24,740
Paul never saw Jesus
except in his visions.

182
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,480
Paul saw Jesus in apocalyptic visions,
but he never saw Jesus a flesh and blood.

183
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,090
Uh,
and so Paul was not a disciple.

184
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,940
He must have gotten this from
other disciples of Jesus.

185
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,020
So what does this tell us?

186
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:39,290
This tells us that different disciples
of Jesus were remembering some of his

187
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,380
sayings and passing them around
to other people after his life,

188
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,240
uh, after. Now the first time. Uh,

189
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,370
well also there's another interesting
passage in First Corinthians nine 14 where

190
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,670
Paul says this in the same way the Lord
commanded that those who proclaim the

191
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:59,210
gospel should get their
living by the gospel. Now,

192
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:04,211
we actually don't have a saying in the
gospels that Jesus actually says that it

193
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:08,960
does sound a little bit like maybe
Luke chapter 10, verse seven.

194
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,810
But this is a saying that
Paul attributes to Jesus.

195
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,870
It's not actually in our gospels.
It also shows though,

196
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,760
it's interesting too that Paul says,

197
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,580
preachers should beit make their
living from preaching the Gospel.

198
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:23,420
That is churches should support uh,
the preachers and missionaries.

199
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,520
Paul says that's a command from Jesus.

200
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:29,510
He actually doesn't obey it though cause
he makes the point that himself is not

201
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:31,130
going to take money from
his churches at that point.

202
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,960
So the earliest gospel though that pulled
together some of these things that we

203
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:40,400
possess is the gospel of mark. It
probably was written around the year 70.

204
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,750
And in the next couple of lectures I'll
show you why we think we can pinpoint

205
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,630
around the date that the
gospel of Mark was written.

206
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,640
It's a very interesting little process.

207
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,120
Then the Matthew and Luke
were both written after and
they used mark as sources.

208
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,060
This is what, when you get
to the discussion section
on the synoptic problem,

209
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,680
which is your first discussion section,

210
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,610
you'll learn all this theory about
the relationship between Matthew,

211
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:07,360
mark and Luke, who was written first,
who copied, whom, who used whom.

212
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,140
And that sort of thing. The beginning
of Luke though starts off like this.

213
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,310
Since many have undertaken to set down
an orderly account of the events that

214
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,390
have been fulfilled among us,

215
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,780
just as they were handed onto us by
those who from the beginning were eye

216
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,610
witnesses and servants of the word.

217
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,410
I too decided after
investigating everything
carefully from the very first to

218
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,000
write an orderly account for you,

219
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:32,050
most excellent Theopolis so that you
may know the truth concerning the things

220
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,830
about what you have been instructed.
Now what does that tell us?

221
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,220
That tells us that this, whoever
wrote the gospel of Luke, and again,

222
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll tell you that it wasn't
the historical person called
Luke who's a companion

223
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:47,290
of Paul probably, but whoever wrote
this says that he did some research,

224
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,130
he collected other sayings about Jesus.

225
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,150
He even looked at other written accounts
and from those different things,

226
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,670
he himself compiled his own gospel.

227
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,530
So we can tell that the gospel
is start off with oral tradition.

228
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:01,330
It's being passed around different
sayings and stories about Jesus.

229
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,040
And then gradually, uh, but only about
40 years after the death of Jesus,

230
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,250
the gospel of Mark is in the year 70.
If Jesus was crucified around near 30,

231
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,450
that's a 40 year period of time between
the death of Jesus and the appearance of

232
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,400
the First Gospel that we possess.

233
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,580
Although there were other written
materials being pastor under at that time.

234
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,790
Now what does this say about this?
Um,

235
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:33,030
some of this we tend to think as modern
people that a written text is actually

236
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,324
the best thing.

237
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,800
It's better than just rumor
or hearsay or oral tradition.

238
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,420
It's interesting though that some ancient
people didn't think that. In fact,

239
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:45,730
there's a guy named [inaudible],
he's on your handout.

240
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,620
He was a Christian leader who lived,

241
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,910
probably wrote about some of this stuff
in around the year one 30 or one 40.

242
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,010
And he says this about
his own little research.

243
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,840
I shall not hesitate to put down for
you with my interpretations whatsoever.

244
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,670
Things I well learned at one time from
the presbyters just meaning the old

245
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:11,411
people,
old guys,

246
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:14,890
elders and well remembered confidently
asserting truthfulness for them.

247
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,020
For I did not take pleasure
as the multitude does in
those who say many things,

248
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,970
but in those who teach
the things that are true,

249
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,240
nor did I take pleasure in those
who recall strange commands,

250
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,720
but in those who recall the commands
given by the Lord to the faith and coming

251
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:29,620
from truth itself.

252
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,620
But if per chance there came also
anyone who had followed the presbyters,

253
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,853
the elders,

254
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,420
I made inquiry concerning the words or
the presbyters what Andrew or what Peter

255
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,260
had said,
oh,

256
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:44,950
what Philip or Thomas or James or what
John or Matthew or any of the other

257
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:48,430
disciples of the Lord said, and what
things are STN and the presbytery,

258
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:51,040
John Disciples of the Lord
used to say for I did not.

259
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,920
Suppose if the things from the books
would aid me so much as things from the

260
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:59,250
living and continuing voice. Notice
what paper says he's doing. He,

261
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,360
he's not,
he doesn't interview the actual apostles.

262
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,620
He's too long after their death,

263
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,190
but he tries to find people who are old
men who knew the apostles and he tried.

264
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,740
He says he questioned them about
what they said. Jesus had said.

265
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,110
That's interesting because it
shows this continuing tradition,

266
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,640
but it's also interesting in he says he
trusted that traditional living voice

267
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,860
more than he trusted written documents,
so that's important to keep in mind.

268
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,490
The next time we see some development
in how this new testaments was coming

269
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:30,650
about is around the middle
of the second century.

270
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,130
We have a guy named Justin martyr,
he we,

271
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,220
he's called that because he was martyred
for the faith around the year one 50 he

272
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,770
mentions the memoirs of the apostles.

273
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,900
We think he's probably
talking about the gospels,

274
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,200
but he doesn't actually use that term
as much as he talks about the memoirs of

275
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:47,690
the apostles, so he knows that
there's written documents.

276
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,310
We also know that around this time
there are several different things being

277
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:56,330
passed around that looked like gospels.
There's Matthew, mark, Luke, and John,

278
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,860
which are in our Bible,

279
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,400
but there's also the gospel of Thomas
that we know about very early on.

280
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,533
And then we,
we,

281
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,830
you've heard the news about the gospel
of Judas being discovered recently and

282
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,200
published. So there's,
there's a gospel of Mary.

283
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,770
There are several other gospels that are
floating around in the second century.

284
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,140
So that's how these written
documents come about.

285
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,040
How did they settle on these four
though first then you have to,

286
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,670
we have to talk about Marcien. I think
he's on your handout, is that correct?

287
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,141
Yes.

288
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:29,141
Marcien who died around one 60
Martian was this guy from Asia minor,

289
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,700
modern day Turkey,

290
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,510
and just get used to that term because
whenever we say Asia minor were talking

291
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:38,840
about that section around the
Mediterranean that now is called Turkey,

292
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,110
but it was called Asia minor generally
in the Roman imperial period.

293
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,250
Martian came to Rome from Asia Minor.
He seemed to be a successful man.

294
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:51,620
His ship builder. He gave the Roman
church a huge sum of money and as,

295
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:54,410
and so he got a lot of honor,
but then he started teaching some,

296
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,490
some doctrines that struck
other Christians in Rome
as being a little bit off.

297
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,110
For one thing, Marcien said that
the, the God who's mentioned in that,

298
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,340
in the Jewish scripture,

299
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,580
the God who created the earth is
not the father of Jesus Christ.

300
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,280
He's a bungling or evil or bad God.

301
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,330
He gave all these people these
bad rules and he'd pinch,

302
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,990
punish them if they didn't obey the rules.

303
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,860
That's not the God that Jesus talked
about as being the God of grace and love

304
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:23,120
and mercy. So he said that God is
not the the father of Jesus Christ.

305
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,700
That's not the god that
Jesus was talking about.

306
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,300
So what we need to do is throw
away Jewish scripture. So he said,

307
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:33,620
we Christians don't need Jewish scripture.
That's all about a wrong God. Anyway,

308
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:38,450
it's about a false god. We don't need
that. What we need, he said is the Gospel.

309
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,260
And in fact, he chose one of these
gospels. He took the gospel of Luke.

310
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,240
Why did hit the gospel of Luke?

311
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,450
Because he believed Luke
had been a companion of Paul
and Luke correctly passed

312
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:54,420
on Paul's Gospel because Paul
was Martians, fave, fave,

313
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:56,580
apostle,
marching,

314
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:59,910
believe that Paul had been the only one
of the different apostles who got it

315
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:04,410
right because he taught people you don't
have to obey the Jewish law. In fact,

316
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,780
he taught people you
shouldn't obey the Jewish law.

317
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,130
So Marcien said Paul got it right.
He threw out the Old Testament.

318
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,730
He threw out the Jewish God and he
introduced the correct gospel of Jesus and

319
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:18,690
Luke Record that in his gospel. So
Marcien said the only thing that could be,

320
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:21,360
should be scripted for us is not a
Jewish scripture. Get rid of that.

321
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,450
We just need the 10 letters
of Paul that he knew about.

322
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,750
Now there are actually 13 letters of
Paul that claim to be like by Paul in our

323
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,900
Bible.
Marcien seem to know only 10 of them.

324
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,720
That might be interesting
later on in the semester too,

325
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,140
but he seemed to only include 10 letters
in his list and then the 10 letters of

326
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:40,650
Paul and Luke.
Now,

327
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:43,680
you may have noticed if you've actually
read any of the letters of Paul and the

328
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:46,680
gospel of Luke,
that these people seem to blend,

329
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,830
believe that the creator God mentioned
in Jewish scripture actually was the

330
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:53,050
father of Jesus Christ marching and
noticed some of those places too.

331
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,670
Or like when Paul Singh be quoting
Jewish scripture. So Marcien said, Aha.

332
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,560
The other Jewish apostles,

333
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:02,250
the bad apostles got hold of Paul's
letters and they got hold of the Gospel of

334
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:05,070
Luke and they adulterated.
They put all this other stuff in,

335
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,520
so loose marching claimed that he could
edit out all the added stuff out of

336
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:14,820
Paul's letters and of the gospel of Luke
and this edited version of the gospel

337
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,650
of Luke and the 10 letters of Paul.

338
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,060
That's what and published as his cannon.
He was,

339
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,850
this is the first time
we have in Christianity,

340
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,090
someone attempting to say this is the
authoritative list and all these other

341
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,290
things are not part of the list.

342
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,480
Marcion who came to be considered
a heretic by Orthodox Christians.

343
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,300
Remember that at this time, there's a
lot of different kinds of Christianity.

344
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:43,140
So how do you tell an Orthodox Christian
from an heretical Christian? Well,

345
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,390
it's your judgment.
Call her mind in the second century,

346
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,540
you hadn't had yet the creeds that would
try to settle these things for good

347
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,790
like you did in the third and
fourth century, the fourth century,

348
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,940
but a lot of Christians in Rome,
the Bishop of Rome,

349
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,520
a lot of other people considered
Marty and a heretic for this.

350
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,420
They kicked him out of the church that
gave him back his money that he could

351
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,254
give him to the church,

352
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,410
and they kicked him out and
they declared this is heretical.

353
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,030
The creator God really is God. The Jewish
scripture really is our scripture. Uh,

354
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:13,140
and the Jewish God is really the god
of Israel, is the God of Jesus Christ.

355
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:17,980
Also the father, Jesus Christ. But
Marcien seems to really put the scare,

356
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:21,270
but Jesus into the Roman church.
If you didn't have,

357
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,760
if you didn't accept
Martians Canon his list,

358
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,410
what was going to be your list if you
said that the other gospels were just as

359
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:28,660
much,

360
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,540
just as important as the gospel of Luke
who said so and why and who's going to

361
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:37,550
pronounce this Marcien though seem to
have spurred other Christian leaders to

362
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,990
decide what they thought, um,
Christian scripture should do.

363
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,130
So what do you do about the gospels?

364
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,290
You have four different gospels
excepted by some people,

365
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:50,050
five or six by other people
generally in roam around this time,

366
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,200
the four gospels that we have in our
Bible seem to become the most popular

367
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,870
excepted gospels, Matthew,
mark, Luke, and John. Now,

368
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:02,350
some people still try to figure out that
you've got four. Why do you have for,

369
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,130
so you have other people like [inaudible].
He's on your handout list too.

370
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,690
He decided to take the four gospels and
do an addition that would string all the

371
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:13,210
stuff from the different
four gospels into one book.

372
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,320
So he made what we call the dia tests are,
which is a Greek word.

373
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:20,140
It means through four. He took four
books and created one gospel out of it.

374
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,280
You had other people
who said, well, um, uh,

375
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,090
you accept the gospel of mark because
mark was a disciple of Peter. Uh,

376
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,260
this is the way papists
believed elsewhere.

377
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:35,920
He said that mark had traveled
with rum tote with Peter to Rome,

378
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,260
and mark wrote down Peter's version
of the Gospel and that's, and so pay.

379
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:44,050
Pia said, that's why mark is a
reliable, or people would say,

380
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,460
Luke wrote down the gospel that Paul
had preached. So Luke was authoritative.

381
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,480
They also say, well, Matthew
was actually one of the apostle,

382
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,750
one of the disciples of Jesus. He's
mentioned in the Gospel. So He, he,

383
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,080
the gospel of Matthew
is also by a good one.

384
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,750
And John also was believed to be that.

385
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:07,170
Now the problem with this
is that paperless and these
other people didn't really

386
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:10,690
know what they were talking about.
Papists for example,

387
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,790
thought that the gospel of Matthew had
originally been written in Hebrew and

388
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,750
only later translated into Greek.
This is wrong.

389
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,970
Any of us who know Greek and no Hebrew
can tell that the gospel of Matthew was

390
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:28,420
written in Greek. It doesn't look
like a translation from Hebrew,

391
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,650
so we tend to doubt all of
these different traditions.

392
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,620
That mark was the disciple of
Peter who wrote Peter's Gospel,

393
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,170
that Matthew was written by
the actual disciple Matthew,

394
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,620
that Luke was written by the disciple
of Paul and that John was written by the

395
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,120
the disciple John.

396
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,670
Basically what modern scholars believe
is that all four of these gospels were

397
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:55,150
anonymously published.
They don't tell us who their author is.

398
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,420
They notice they don't.
They're not pseudonymous.

399
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,670
There's a difference between suited suited
pseudonomas writing's easy for me to

400
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:04,504
say.

401
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,003
Yeah,

402
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,550
and anonymous.

403
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,300
Anonymous means we
don't know who wrote it.

404
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,580
It's published without an
author's name being listed.

405
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,660
Pseudonymous means it's
published with a false name,

406
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,150
a false author attributed the got the
four gospels are not pseudonymous because

407
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,100
the earliest manuscripts of these gospels
we believe did not contain the titles

408
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,980
Gospel of Mathew Gospel of Mark Gospel,
the gospel of John.

409
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,130
They just published the
text as it was at least we,

410
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:41,530
if it ever did have an
author's name attached to it.

411
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,920
We don't have any evidence
in the manuscript history
nor we have any evidence in

412
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:47,600
any other, uh, historical place.

413
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,700
What happened was these names
got attached to these documents

414
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,950
and that's eventually how they
got included into the cannon.

415
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,690
People thought that these
documents eventually were
written by the people whose

416
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,140
names that they possess and therefore
they thought they had some kind of

417
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:10,970
connection to the apostles.
Notice.

418
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,120
What's your,
the Canon list eventually being a have I,

419
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,610
this is on your handout also.
Look at the mirror. Torian Canon.

420
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,590
This is,
I remember the word Canon just means list,

421
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,830
so this was a list of books that some
author believed where scripture and should

422
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:34,970
be read by Christians and churches and
he mentions others that he believes they

423
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:37,430
should not. Sometimes he didn't
believe they were bad books.

424
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:40,670
He sometimes he believes they just
weren't supposed to be included with the

425
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,960
highest canonical books.

426
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,400
There's a big debate about whether this
Canon list was composed around the year

427
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:51,401
200 or are around the year 400 scholars
tend to line up one side of the other.

428
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,710
It used to be when I was in Grad
school that most people said, oh,

429
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:58,040
it was written around the year 200 now
I understand that probably the majority

430
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,900
of scholars who say, no, it
comes from a later period.

431
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,890
That's not really all important for us
because what's important for us to see at

432
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,970
this point, uh, either 200 to 400
what was included, what was not.

433
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,580
This Canon list,
uh,

434
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,740
includes these books that aren't in
our Bible. The wisdom of Solomon,

435
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,400
which is actually in the Apocrypha and
I'll talk about that and the apocalypse

436
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:23,900
of Peter. We do have an apocalypse of
Peter along with the apocalypse of John.

437
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,740
It's just not in our Bible.
It's considered new testament
apocryphal writings.

438
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,090
They also, this rider excluded
these books that are in our Bible.

439
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,300
The letter to the Hebrews.
One letter of John.

440
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,080
He rejects the shepherd of Hermas,

441
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,650
which was is a book that we
include in groupings of Ryan.

442
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,970
We call the epistatic fathers.

443
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,320
It was written in the second century
sometime by a guy in Rome named Hermis and

444
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:52,610
it's called the shepherd and
he, he excludes other books.
He calls gnostic books.

445
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,760
We'll talk later in the semester about
what does gnostic mean at this time.

446
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,470
So notice that this is,

447
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,490
this could be a very early can
enlist and it doesn't match our list.

448
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,500
It does have the four gospels though.

449
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,170
Then the first time you get a list by
any Christian that we serve that we still

450
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:11,450
possessed.
It's extent that survives.

451
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,780
That has the 27 books of the New Testament
that is in our Bible is in the year

452
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:22,541
367 it's an Easter letter by the Bishop
Athanasius who is bishop of Alexandria

453
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,200
bishops at this time,

454
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:30,730
especially a major cities would sometimes
send around what we call a pastoral

455
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,380
letter and Easter letter in which they
get instructions are different kinds of

456
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:37,130
things to their churches and in one year
when he's doing this he says these are

457
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:39,680
the books that you should
read and should not read.

458
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,510
And this is the first time that the
precise 20 books that he lists are the 27

459
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,030
books that we list.
It's interesting though,

460
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:53,031
he does list the letters of Paul last
but behind the other letters rather than

461
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,590
before them as we have in our list.

462
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:01,380
And then we don't really start getting
any kind of consistency with this until

463
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,290
into the third and fourth and
fifth and sixth centuries.

464
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,730
So on I'm saying now is it took a long
time for this to solidify and one of the

465
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:13,731
things we think made it solidify was
the development of codices a codex.

466
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,180
What is a codex?

467
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,010
Early books were all scrolls,

468
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,450
so you might have a book if he had a book,
as long as the gospel of Matthew,

469
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,160
it'd take up a pretty thick scroll.
Now, what happens if you want to read,

470
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,810
not the whole book of Matthew, but you
should want to read Matthew 1313 will.

471
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:40,830
You have to unroll your scroll. You're run
row, row, row, row, row, row, row, row.

472
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,500
You have to find the place
and they roll it all back up.

473
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,530
And what happens if you want to move back
and forth between a bunch of different

474
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,880
letters? Well, you have to
unroll different scrolls
scrolls. And in synagogues,

475
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,410
they didn't have books like this.

476
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,220
They just had a basket or a box or a
place called uneasy and they just had

477
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,860
scrolls all in it.
So if you wanted to read Isaiah,

478
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,420
it actually was more than one scroll,

479
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,060
so you'd have to take that
scroll out and undo it.

480
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,330
Now what some scholars may have have
speculated, we don't know this for sure,

481
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,880
sometime around this period of
time when early Christianity,

482
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,010
if somebody got the big idea,
hey,

483
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,220
let's cut up the scroll into pages and
so the pages together and then put it all

484
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:20,160
in a book, and that way you can
flip around and it a lot easier.

485
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,780
Some scholars have even speculated that
Christians may be the first to do this

486
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:29,310
because they were arguing with their
friends. The Jews are their enemies,

487
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:30,330
the Jews in some cases,

488
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,250
and if you want to prove that
Jesus really was born of a virgin,

489
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,100
well you need to go to that passage in
Isaiah where at least the Greek version,

490
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:41,881
it's not in the Hebrew,

491
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:46,200
but the Greek version of the Jewish
scripture said that a woman would be born,

492
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,730
this man would be born of a virgin.

493
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,350
That's the prophecy that we read around
Christmas time. A virgin will bear a son,

494
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,610
but you might have to also refer to a
psalm over here or to another patch is

495
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,910
over here and it's too difficult if
you're unraveling scrolls and everything.

496
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:02,940
So some people believe that Christians
precisely because they wanted to proof

497
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:07,020
text a lot. They wanted to run around
through a lot of different texts.

498
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,830
They actually invented the Codex.

499
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,870
I'm not talking about tampons.

500
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,040
Code decks with an e.
Okay.

501
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,910
All that means is this is a codex.

502
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,590
It just means pages sewn together and
placed within the covers of a book.

503
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,090
So what we call, when you see the
word book in ancient Greek or Latin,

504
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,390
they didn't think of this.
They thought of scrolls.

505
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,740
So when you see where book there,

506
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,440
the mechanical thing they're
actually talking about is a scroll.

507
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,710
This was an interesting new invention
of a new piece of technology.

508
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,050
Maybe not quite as
revolutionary as the computer,

509
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,120
but clothes because all of
a sudden cumbersome scrolls.

510
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,630
This would what's would be
contained in the code of CS.

511
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:59,470
We have the plural of this is
either codex is sometimes our,

512
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,620
if you want to act like you
actually know Greek, I mean Latin,

513
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,160
you'd use the old Latin plural codices.

514
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,080
You'll see both of those
written in different sources.

515
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,830
A Codex of the Bible
would be pretty big bay,

516
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:17,860
that thick and that why
that some the ones we have,

517
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:19,990
we have there are stored
in the Vatican museum.

518
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:22,090
We have a few of them that
survive from this period.

519
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,640
They're pretty impressive looking.
Uh,

520
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,470
but there'd be big but still that would
be a lot easier to transport and handle

521
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,410
than a whole box or
closet full of scrolls.

522
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,820
So this was a very innovative
piece of technology.

523
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:42,070
But one problem with it, this also
caused is if you're going to put all the,

524
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,150
the books,

525
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,920
the documents that you think are scripture
between two covers and not just have

526
00:30:47,921 --> 00:30:50,680
a bunch of scrolls lying in a
box or a closet with the scrolls.

527
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:51,910
You can take one out and put another in.

528
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,300
If you decide that you think
Daniel is not scripture,

529
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,000
do you think the revelation of John, not
scripture, just take it out of the box,

530
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,700
put it somewhere else in the,
in the synagogue or the church.

531
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,480
But once you start publishing
things in between covers,

532
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,470
you actually have to decide
what goes in and what goes out.

533
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,190
And so around this time, the
third, fourth, and fifth century,

534
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,340
we get different codices different codex
is that his books and they will and we

535
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:21,250
can tell them what sorts of books
they included in their scripture.

536
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,460
And notice on your handout,
just some examples of this,

537
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,660
the Canon of Momsen early Fourth
Century Canon includes Matthew,

538
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,400
mark, John, and Luke in
that order. So it has,

539
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,530
there are four and only are
four but in a different order.

540
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,550
It excludes the letter to the Hebrews,
the letter of James, letter of Jude,

541
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,931
and it argues,

542
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,020
this is one the interesting thing about
it argues that the books must be exactly

543
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:52,021
24 because revelation four 10 has 24
elders in God's throne room convincing

544
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:54,274
argument,
right?

545
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,830
A Codex Sa Synetic Skus,

546
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,750
which is around the year three 50 we
think this is one of the earliest codices

547
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,650
of the Bible we have,
it includes the letter of Barnabas,

548
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,990
which we don't have in our bibles,
but we do possess it.

549
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,630
And the shepherd of Hermas,
which I already talked about,

550
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,990
which was written somewhere
around the year 100 and Rome,

551
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,180
or after the right after that,
it also excludes Jude.

552
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,750
So it has two books that we don't include
and exclude one that we do include

553
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,900
codex, Claremont, tennis
from the sixth century.

554
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:29,230
So in the five hundreds
includes Matthew, John, mark,

555
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:31,630
and Luke again has all four
of us in a different order.

556
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,860
It has led her a Barnabas, the sheep,
the shepherd of Hermas, the acts of Paul,

557
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,730
not the, uh, along with the acts of the
apostles and the revelation of Peter.

558
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,040
So it has that revelation of Peter.
Again,

559
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,640
it excludes Paul's letter to the
Philippians, which is in our Bible,

560
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,040
Hebrews and first and
second Thessalonians.

561
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,130
Now notice this means that some people
would say that they use that three 67

562
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:59,060
date when bishop Athanasius send around
his Easter litter and they say that's

563
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:02,170
when the Christian Canon of
the New Testament was set
because it's the earliest

564
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:04,610
as we have. But that's not
really right. That was just,

565
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,100
he was just bishop of one city,
one area.

566
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,000
His letter was not binding on anybody
else except the churches in his

567
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:12,500
Alexandrian diocese.

568
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,810
So it didn't set the cannon three 67
is simply the time when we'd get the

569
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,380
earliest list that matches our list
of 27 books in the New Testament.

570
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,900
But you can see when you look at
all these different code disease,

571
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,280
different Canon list from a century
later in the four hundreds two centuries

572
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:31,970
later in the five hundreds three centuries
later in the six hundreds you still

573
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:35,090
get different lists.
So there was,

574
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,120
it took a long time for the 27 books that
we have to get settled on and it was,

575
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,460
and we'll talk about how that
actually happened. Also still

576
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,700
wear what really happened was consensus.

577
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,350
Different bishops in different major
cities and different councils would

578
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:56,630
sometimes try to decide
and they'd put out decrees,

579
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,860
but they never completely settled the
question for all Christians everywhere

580
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:05,000
around the world.
This is surprising,

581
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:10,990
but what counts as the Bible is still
not agreed upon by Christians around the

582
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:15,950
world. So generally the
Canon of the New Testament,

583
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,360
our 27 books is accepted by all
Christian churches generally,

584
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:25,660
except that the revelation of John is
still not part of the lectionary or Canon

585
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:30,530
in some eastern and Middle Eastern
churches. So for example, if you,

586
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,480
I can't remember which
of these, uh, there are,

587
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:35,540
but there are churches all through
the Middle East in the east also,

588
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,870
and some of them don't have the
revelation of John in the New Testament.

589
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,040
The Canon of all of scripture therefore
has never been completely the same for

590
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,150
all Christians everywhere.

591
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:49,640
The western Roman Catholic Canon
and the Greek Slavonic bibles have,

592
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,563
for example,

593
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,400
Tobit part of the Old Testament Judith,

594
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,730
the wisdom of Solomon
Ecclesiasticus Baruch and the
letter of Jeremiah and first

595
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:03,260
and second Maccabees.

596
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,740
They also have a longer version of
Daniel and a longer version of Esther.

597
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,480
So if you, the western Roman Catholic
Canon and Greek and Slavonic bibles,

598
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:15,110
we'll include our canon that
we have that you have probably,

599
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,050
but they'll also maybe include things that
if you grew up in a Protestant church,

600
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,620
was not in your Protestant Bible.
The Greek and Slavonic.

601
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:26,621
Bible's also accept first as
dress the prayer of Manasseh.

602
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,670
Psalm one 51 they have another
song and third Maccabees,

603
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,360
another Maccabean book.
You don't need to memorize all this is,

604
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:38,550
I'm just trying to give you an idea
of the variety of different canons for

605
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:39,840
different churches in different regions.

606
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:45,230
The Slavonic and Latin vulgate also accept
psalm one 51 and third Maccabees and

607
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:49,500
the Greek cannon also
accepts fourth Macka B's.

608
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,690
Why is the Protestant Canon like it is?
Well,

609
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,460
at the time of the reformation,

610
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,800
Roman Catholics had not only the 27 books
of the New Testament Canon that we now

611
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:05,520
have and they had what Protestants
came to accept as the Old Testament,

612
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:10,790
but they had several other books that
we now call the Apocrypha such as Judith

613
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,270
Tobit or the Maccabee first and second
Maccabees. When you buy your Bible,

614
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:16,410
if you buy the one I ordered,

615
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,400
it's called the new Oxford annotated
Bible with Apocrypha. And they take these,

616
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,350
they certain books and they put them in
a special section of the Bible to show

617
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,140
that they're not exactly
part of the Hebrew Bible,

618
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,820
but they're also not part
of the New Testament.

619
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,370
But early Christians
accepted all these books.

620
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,060
Early Christians didn't read
the Hebrew Bible in Hebrew.

621
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,830
They all read it in Greek.

622
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,130
So when they were first
dealing with Jewish scripture,

623
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,460
they didn't read it in the Hebrew.
They read it in Greek, Greek.

624
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:48,720
There were several other Greek Jewish
documents that weren't part of the

625
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:52,530
traditional Hebrew Bible, but they
were still accepted by a lot of Jews.

626
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,510
And therefore by a lot of
Christians as scripture,

627
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,870
those books were accepted by Catholics,
by Roman Catholics,

628
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:02,610
and by Christians up until the reformation
at the reformation, the reformers,

629
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,820
Martin Luther, Calvin, uh, my lengthen,

630
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,820
they decided that this was member of the,

631
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,270
the after the renaissance
and the beginnings of the
enlightenment and not the

632
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,510
enlightenment,
but the renaissance and,

633
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,110
and the rediscovery of the
study of Greek and Latin texts.

634
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,050
In the original documents,
they want to go back to the Hebrew.

635
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,950
So they learned Hebrew. They started
reading the Hebrew Bible in Hebrew,

636
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,660
not in Greek or Latin translation.

637
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,440
They also tried to come up with the
correct Greek text of the New Testament

638
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:30,030
documents by doing textual criticism.

639
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,410
They were practicing what was burgeoning
scholarship of the period in the 16th

640
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:38,760
century to go back to the original
texts as close as they could get.

641
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,580
What these reformers then
did, they said, wait a minute,

642
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,730
look at all these Greek Jewish books
that aren't part of the Hebrew Bible.

643
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,280
They don't exist in Hebrew. They
only exist in Greek. So they said,

644
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,560
we're not going to accept those
as part of the Old Testament.

645
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,760
They decided to go back to what,
uh,

646
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,050
the Hebrew texts of the Old Testament and
not accept the Greek Jewish documents.

647
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,740
The Roman Catholics decided, no, we're
going to keep these documents also,

648
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:10,050
which is why the Roman
Catholic Old Testament is
larger than the Protestant Old

649
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:10,710
Testament.

650
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,650
The Roman Catholic Old Testament has
the same books that the Protestant Old

651
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,160
Testament has,

652
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,420
but they kept these other Greek
Jewish documents and we call those the

653
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,080
Apocrypha. The hidden writings
just is what it means. Yes, sir.

654
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,350
The Jewish Bible started developing
when in the rabbinic period.

655
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,110
So what the rabbis, and then this
is all after Jesus and Paul's,

656
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:34,770
we're talking about the third, fourth, and
fifth and sixth centuries. They started,

657
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,410
uh,

658
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,410
teaching people that only the Hebrew
scriptures in Hebrew should be used.

659
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,380
In other words,

660
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,430
that the rabbis eventually
started rejecting the use
of the Greek Bible. Also,

661
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,550
this took time though,
because at the time of Paul and Jesus,

662
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,420
more Jews actually had Greek
as their first language,

663
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,010
then had Hebrew as their first language.

664
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,760
Most Jews in the first century would've
used Greek as their first language,

665
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,540
not Hebrew, or even Aramaic. So
they read their scripture in Greek.

666
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,870
What happened was, and some people would
believe this is a debated question,

667
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,490
I would even say that one reason the
rabbi's started using Hebrew more with

668
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:14,110
precisely and taking the Hebrew Bible is
because they were reacting against the

669
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:16,420
predominance of Christianity as
it grew and more and more strong.

670
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:22,050
So as rabbinic ideas and as rabbinic
practices developed in late antiquity,

671
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:26,350
they taught that they should reject the
Greek Bible, not use the Greek Bible,

672
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:28,630
except you know, you could use it,
but not use it as authoritative.

673
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,960
And they started teaching that the
Hebrew Bible should be the ones Jews use.

674
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,240
So the Jews today where
they call it [inaudible],

675
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,670
which is an acronym from Torah, and
then profit, the, the Torah, the law,

676
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,271
the prophets,

677
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:44,050
and the writings so that they will call
their Bible to knock often or just the

678
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:44,620
Bible.

679
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,620
And it includes only those Hebrew
documents that the rabbis eventually said,

680
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,720
we're part of the Hebrew Bible.
Good question.

681
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,250
So notice how Jews have one bible
that's basically centered on the ancient

682
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:58,084
Hebrew.

683
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,460
Protestants have followed the rabbis in
a sense and accepted the Hebrew Bible as

684
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:07,810
being the Old Testament Roman Catholics
actually followed more what was ancient

685
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:10,870
Christian tradition of accepting
not only the Hebrew Bible,

686
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:13,870
although it was translated into
Latin and Greek most of the time,

687
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,260
but also Jewish documents
that came from that period.

688
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,210
And we're surviving in Greek itself.

689
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,100
So that's why Christian Protestants
have one tech, a set of text.

690
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,260
Robin cabinets have another
and Jews have another.

691
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,710
Now what about those Episcopalians?

692
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,930
As one of my friends says
those whiskey Balian's,

693
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,990
they decided to be in the middle.

694
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,580
So they want the somewhat
Protestant and somewhat Catholic.

695
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,580
So if you go to an Anglican church,
they will also,

696
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:47,470
most of the time except the
Roman Catholic Canon, uh,

697
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,130
along with Roman Catholics, even though
a lot of Episcopalians Anglicans,

698
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,680
a lot of them, not all of them will
consider themselves Protestants.

699
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,730
So Anglicans follow the Roman
Catholic candidate a bit more.

700
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,810
Protestants and Jews have different ones.
That's kind of where we are right now.

701
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,970
But notice how long it took us to get
there, how many centuries it took. Now,

702
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:10,870
the big question is who did
it and why did they do it?

703
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:17,250
Basically some councils in the early
church councils to be called by the of,

704
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,980
by Constantine or his successors.

705
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,650
Sometimes they would get so
tired of churches, you know,

706
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,080
you know how Christians
squabble all the time. You know,

707
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,660
when I was a kid growing up in Texas,

708
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,550
one of our sayings was let's make
like a baptist and split like,

709
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:36,400
like a Baptist church and
split. So tr, you know,

710
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,620
Christians are always squabbling.
So councils would try,

711
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,500
the emperors would try to call and get
the councils to get them to agree on

712
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:45,500
things, to get them to agree on doctrine,
to get them to do, to agree on the Canon.

713
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,730
So some councils did try to set the
cannon and so you had some councils doing

714
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:53,660
this, but generally the
cannon developed over time,

715
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,560
through a process of general consensus.
And then as I said,

716
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,800
through these different institutions
of Christianity ending up coming to

717
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,860
somewhat different decisions,
but why do they include things?

718
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,370
Why were some texts included in the new
testament and other techs not including

719
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:08,204
the New Testament?

720
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,600
The reason is not the one that most
modern people think is the reason most

721
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,540
people today is why is this
text scripture? Why is it Canon?

722
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,210
And most Christian will say,
because it is inspired.

723
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,380
That's not what the ancients believed.
They believed that inspiration.

724
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:26,660
There were lots of texts that were
inspired and there are different levels of

725
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:31,130
inspiration. So just because
of text is inspired, uh, even,

726
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,210
even if you believe it's inspired
by God and that God told my variety,

727
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,800
that wasn't enough for ancient
Christians to include it in their Bible,

728
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,230
in their cannon.
So inspiration,

729
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,700
contrary to modern assumptions was not
the criteria you hear ancient people talk

730
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:50,600
about. Epistolic of authorship
was one thing they talk about.

731
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:55,460
So for example, pape IOUs and other
ancient writers, they said, well,

732
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:58,430
we accept the gospel of mark because well,
if it wasn't written by an apostle,

733
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,080
it was written by someone
very close to an apostle.

734
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,900
And it was Peter's Gospel
that mark just published,

735
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,290
or Luke published Paul's Gospel.
Now.

736
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,830
And so often some people
in the ancient world,

737
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,160
if there was a gospel they didn't like,
they didn't want it to be included.

738
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,880
They would argue against it
being authored by an apostle,

739
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:21,590
so that at least they claimed for some
that through these texts that they wanted

740
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,650
at the static authorship or
close to episodic authorship.

741
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,920
The problem was we can tell historically
that these texts were not written by

742
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:31,094
apostles,

743
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,120
nor do we believe they were written even
by the closest disciples of apostles.

744
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:36,890
They're anonymous texts.

745
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,930
So if that was the reason they were
included in the ancient world, uh,

746
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,690
it is not the reason they're still in
now because modern scholars don't believe

747
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:47,810
the apostles actually wrote all of
these texts in the new testament

748
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,350
flexibly.
Here are the criteria.

749
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,190
If it's not necessarily a puzzle
ship and it's not inspiration,

750
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,770
what are the real reasons?
First,

751
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,180
it seems that the texts that at least
these people believed were the most

752
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,080
ancient and had the closest
proximity to Jesus. Like I said,

753
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:08,360
they wanted them to be
traced back to the apostles.

754
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,080
So even if they weren't is because that's
what people believed about these texts.

755
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,310
A second big reason was
simply general acceptance.

756
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:21,610
Apparently the texts that were the most
popular over a bigger geographical space

757
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,480
tended to be the ones that got
in. Now, there were, it's true,

758
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,030
there were different gospels that
were popular in different parts of the

759
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:29,900
Mediterranean,
so for example,

760
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:33,660
the gospel of Thomas seems to have been
especially popular in certain parts of

761
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:36,300
the east and in and Rome.

762
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:39,210
There'd be other document or
different parts of the Roman empire,

763
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,430
but generally as timeline on it seems
like Christian leaders tried to include

764
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,750
those gospels, those documents that
were more generally accepted. In fact,

765
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:51,420
if you wanted to argue against,
say the letter of Hebrews being included,

766
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:52,380
you could,
you could say,

767
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,310
but all the people in the east don't
accept the letter of Hebrews as part of

768
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:59,460
their canon, so we shouldn't either.
So general acceptance was a big,

769
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,360
but the most important criterion
is probably won't shock you,

770
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:08,361
especially if you're a cynical as I am
theological acceptibility people tended

771
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:15,150
to want to include the documents
that matched their own theology.

772
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,341
In other words,

773
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:21,180
you believe something was epistolic
if it taught stuff you believed.

774
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:27,300
So of course documents that did teach
that the creator God was an evil demonic

775
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:29,610
God and not the father of Jesus Christ.
And there were,

776
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,700
there are early Christian documents
that teach this. They were excluded.

777
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,300
Why were they excluded? Well, some
of them claim to be by apostles.

778
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,030
Nobody exactly knew how old they were.

779
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:44,270
They were excluded because they taught
a doctrine that other Christians thought

780
00:45:44,371 --> 00:45:46,080
was heretical and not accurate.

781
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:51,770
So when you say though theological
appropriateness is what ended up being the

782
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:55,110
most important criteria for
including stuff in the Canon,

783
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,110
you actually have to say
then appropriate to whom?

784
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,000
And of course that means
you have a judgment call.

785
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,150
But generally the documents
that came to be accepted,

786
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:06,120
and we're the ones that people
we call the pro tow orthodox.

787
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:08,310
This is a term that Bart
Erhman uses in his textbook.

788
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:11,430
You'll see it and he explains
what he means by this. In
the second century, it's,

789
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,100
you can't really use the term
Orthodox Christianity versus heretical

790
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:17,460
Christianity because there wasn't
orthodox, he hadn't been established yet.

791
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,300
It was all in a state of flux. The people
believed all kinds of different things.

792
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:24,240
And what are these classes we'll
do is talk about how did Orthodox,

793
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:25,440
what came Orthodox Christianity,

794
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,590
how did it become Orthodox Christianity
rather than than one of the other kinds

795
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:29,280
of Christianity.

796
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,070
And we'll talk about that repeatedly
in the second century though,

797
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:36,030
it's an it's anachronistic to talk about
Orthodox Christianity versus heretical

798
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,780
Christianity.

799
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,020
So what some scholars have done is
create this word pro tow orthodox,

800
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:45,170
and all they mean is those Christians
who believe the kinds of stuff that would

801
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:49,350
later be proclaimed as orthodox
and creeds and councils.

802
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,330
So what happens was the people who are
the Christians in the second century and

803
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:59,331
the third century who resembled
what later became Nice Ian Orthodox

804
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,410
Christianity,

805
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,670
they were the ones who had the most say
eventually in what became part of the

806
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:08,040
Bible.
So in the end,

807
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,280
the Canon is a list of the winners in
the historical debate to define Orthodox

808
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,650
Christianity questions,

809
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,110
comments, outburst, rantings and ravings.

810
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,320
Nope.
Yes sir.

811
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,360
Fulfilled.
How would the name tag on,

812
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,770
okay.
If the books were written anonymously,

813
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,390
how did the names that
are associated with them?

814
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,900
Other fields where we've done that,
we read a book

815
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,320
that would sound metal up
what we think so and so, yeah,

816
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,720
the most of the stuff that we'll say
has a wrong name attached in the new

817
00:47:54,601 --> 00:47:57,390
testament is not anonymous,
although there are songs,

818
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,930
it's pseudonymous but there are some
that are anonymous to the gospels.

819
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,260
We'd say are anonymous because they
didn't come attached with a name as far as

820
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:09,260
we know. Um, how did those names get
attached by different people at parties?

821
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:12,930
Because they wanted this
text to be authoritative in
some way and so they tended

822
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:17,820
to attach the name of a particular apostle
to them are particular disciple art.

823
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:18,900
In some ways. For example, the Gut,

824
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,410
the gospel of Luke may have gotten his
name Luke because in the acts of the

825
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:24,780
apostles,
which is also written by the same author,

826
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,600
Luc is an actual character
who follows Paul around.

827
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,610
So it may have been that the name Luke
in acts of the apostles got connected

828
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:35,280
with the acts of the Apostles and
the gospel of Luke as its author.

829
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,240
So sometimes it's as something in the
text itself that may have prompted someone

830
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:41,520
to think that often we just
don't know how it got in.

831
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:44,130
It just happened because somebody
has said it's authoritative.

832
00:48:44,131 --> 00:48:46,590
It must have been written by an apostle.
We have time for one more question.

833
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,700
I think I saw a hand up then we need
to dismiss no more questions. Okay.

834
00:48:50,701 --> 00:48:52,470
See you next time.
Remember we are meeting on Friday.
