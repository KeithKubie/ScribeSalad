00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
Let's say we build a graph like this. We have a structure that represents the variable x₁.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.990
We have a structure that represents the variable x₂ and a structure that represents the variable x₃ here,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.090
and we have a clause that say, it goes like this--x₁ or not x₂ or x₃.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.420
And what we said with regards to the past between A and B, we said that going this way

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.160
means true and going this way means false.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.420
So what we'll do now is we have x₁ here in this clause,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.290
we will connect this vertex over here and over here.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.810
What that means is that we can visit this vertex here for just one extra edge

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.370
as long as we're taking the path--that means x₁ is true.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.890
Here, this is not right because we have not x₂, so we have to connect it in another way--

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.260
we have to connect it in exactly the reverse way because then when we take the path

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.130
that means x₂ is set to false, then not x₂ becomes true and again, in that case,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.489
we would want to be able to visit this vertex here for just one extra edge.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.130
Now, my question to you is--how would I have to connect this vertex here to this part here

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.340
of the graph that represents x₃.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.930
Would I have to connect it in this way or would I have to connect it in this way.

00:01:16.930 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check the one that is correct.
