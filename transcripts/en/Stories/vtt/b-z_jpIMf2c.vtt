00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:02.397
NARRATOR: Although
this kid is smiling,

00:00:02.397 --> 00:00:05.190
he is actually hard at
work pouring molten metal

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.050
in a shipyard in Dhaka.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.940
Not exactly an ideal
environment for a child.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.010
Sometimes it's easy to dismiss
the influence of an image

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.640
like this, to assume that
the photographer is just

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.030
another silent witness to an
atrocity like child labor,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.490
and that policymakers can
easily turn a blind eye.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.160
But there is proof
that a photo like this

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.910
can have a huge impact.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.010
In developing nations
like Bangladesh,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.410
child labor is a huge problem,
with around five million

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.050
children between the ages of
five and 14 currently employed.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.780
Poverty is the
driving factor that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.900
causes families to
send children to work

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.670
in hazardous and low
wage jobs, such as brick

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.040
chipping, construction,
and waste picking

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.700
instead of attending school.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.500
In many nations, labor laws
exist to protect children,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.690
but they're not often enforced.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.340
In developed
nations like the US,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.430
labor laws are strict to
ensure that children stay out

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.740
of the workforce.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.200
However, this wasn't
always the case.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.340
Lewis Wickes Hine
from Pennsylvania

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.130
was a photographer and
sociologist in the early 1900s.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.570
Now, you may know his work.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.690
He took the iconic
photos of the workers

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.360
who constructed the Empire
State Building in Manhattan, New

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.285
York.

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:19.240
But his first job was
documenting the child workforce

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.210
of America for the National
Child Labor Committee

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.420
during the Industrial
Revolution.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.860
At the turn of the 20th
century, kids in America

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.000
could be found working in
factories, plantations,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.620
and even coal mines.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.530
Across the country,
children as young as four

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.830
were making glassware,
textiles, and cigars.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.250
Children worked long
hours with minimal pay,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.520
and the work was often extremely
dangerous and sometimes deadly.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.400
Hine's work also put him in
danger, and by all accounts

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.960
he received several death
threats by factory police

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.410
and foremen, and that's
because at the time

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.510
using children in the
workforce was something that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.200
happened behind closed doors.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.770
But Hines continued, often
disguising himself, sometimes

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.870
as a fire inspector
or Bible salesman,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.300
among others, just
to gain access

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.120
to the factories,
plantations, and mines.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.620
It was Hines's photos that
brought the issue of child

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.789
labor to national attention.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.600
Over the course of a decade, he
took thousands of photos that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.250
documented the practice .

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.410
His work convinced and some
say shamed US lawmakers

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.580
to introduce new
industrial regulations

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.400
to protect children.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.370
The photography of Lewis Hine
shows that images like these

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.700
assures that child
labor issues continue

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.590
to stay in the conscience of
those who can influence policy,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.480
and for the photographers
who document child

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.100
labor all over the world, that's
the main motivation of the job.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.720
As Bangladeshi photojournalist
and humanitarian

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.995
GMB Akash put it, "I knew
that as a photojournalist

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:46.800
that it was my duty
to tell the truth.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.000
But besides that,
as a human being

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.790
I believe that it
was my moral duty

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.120
to find ways to alleviate
the pain of abuse and poverty

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.280
of those people in
my photographs."
