00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.670
This is another brain teaser
that deals with people trying

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.240
to logically deduce what's
on their forehead.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.939
And it's called the Forehead
Number Game.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.400
So what's going to happen is I
guess you could say the god of

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.760
brain teasers is going
to get three

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.790
people in a room together.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.250
Once again, these three people
are perfect logicians.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.710
Which means they have infallible
powers of logic.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.750
And they know that the other
two people-- they're three

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.190
people in total --are also all
perfect logicians and have

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.740
infallible powers of logic.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.910
We get them into the circle,
and we'll say

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.790
this is the top view.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.630
So this is the top of
one guy's forehead.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.410
They're all bald for
convenience.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.910
To make it easy to paint
things on their head.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.780
This time we're not going
to paint blue

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.700
paint on their forehead.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.790
We're actually going
to paint numbers.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.040
So you could say the dungeon
master of this game, or the

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.510
the god of this game says I'm
going to pick three numbers.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.830
So three numbers
will be picked.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.560
They will be unique.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.260
Which means that no two of these
numbers are going to be

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.880
the same number.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.030
There are going to be three
different numbers.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.210
They're all going to be
greater than zero.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.840
And this is key: One of the
numbers is going to be the sum

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.090
of the other two.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.740
And they tell this to all
of the logicians.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.390
So this is the method that they
use to pick the number.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.940
And they tell this to the three
parties right there.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.790
And what they do is they take
these three numbers.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.970
And they write them on
people's foreheads.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.260
So say the numbers
are a, b and c.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.670
And we know that a plus-- let me
scroll down a little bit b

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.030
is equal to c.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.640
We know that a, b and
c are different.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.490
And we know that a is
greater than zero.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.520
b is greater than zero.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.540
And c is also greater
than zero.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.160
What they do is they paint
them on their heads.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.790
So this guy will have
a on his forehead.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.820
This guy will have b
on his forehead.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.900
And let's say this guy has
c on his forehead.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.100
And so when this guy looks out--
and you know, the reason

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.290
we're even putting things on
people's foreheads is because

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.070
you can't see what's on
your own forehead.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.370
No tricks involved here.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.960
All you can see is what's on the
forehead of the other two

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.100
people in the game.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.290
So this guy is going
to see a and b.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.470
This guy right here is going to
see the foreheads c and a.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.520
And then this guy's going
to see these two

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.220
foreheads, c and b.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.690
So that's the rules
of the game.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.800
And of course, you don't know;
this guy, the number on his

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.500
forehead is c.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.050
And it happens to be
the sum of a and b.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.960
But he doesn't know that.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.010
He doesn't know whether
it's the sum or not.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.950
He doesn't know he has
the sum number.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.580
This is just the way I
happened to draw it.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.740
So given those rules
of the game.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.415
And let's say you're
one of the players.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.110
And this is the view you see.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.200
You look at the two other
people in the game.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.020
Let me see if I can draw them
a little bit better.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.050
So you look at one person.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.740
This is your view.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.870
So this is one person
in the game.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.810
On his forehead-- which
is fairly large-- you

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.430
see the number 20.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.630
And on the next guy, who
I'll draw in purple.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:43.640
The next guy, you see
the number 30.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.000
And what happens is-- so this
is literally your view.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.570
So they're seeing you with some
number on your forehead.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.400
And this guy can
see this 20 and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.370
whatever's on your forehead.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.210
This guy can see this 30 and
whatever's on your forehead.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.600
And the game show host, or the
dungeon master or soon.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.920
whoever, says, OK what's
on your forehead?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.970
And you look at these two
people, and you say, gee, I

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.090
don't know what's
on my forehead.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.660
I'm a perfect logician, but I
still can't figure out what's

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.450
on my forehead.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.930
And they say, OK fair enough.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.790
Then they go to this guy.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.010
We call him whatever we
want to call this guy.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.390
And they say, hey you,
do know what

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.510
number's on your forehead?

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.560
And he looks at whatever
number's on my

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.350
forehead over here.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.500
Let's say this is my forehead.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.710
I don't know what number's
written on it.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.290
Some number's written up here.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.390
He looks at this number and then
at that guy, and says,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.620
you know what, I really don't
know what my number is.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.070
They say, OK fair enough.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.970
Then you turn to this guy.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.230
And you say, hey you, look
at this guy and that guy.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.450
Do you know what
your number is?

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.340
And he looks at that number, and
he looks at the number on

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.890
your forehead.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.620
And he says, you know what?

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.615
I really don't know
what my number is.

00:04:51.615 --> 00:04:53.850
And then they come
back to you.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.060
And then you, as a perfect
logician says, oh, now I know

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.980
what my number is.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.160
So my question to you-- and this
is the question of the

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.570
brain teaser-- is, what
is your number?

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.820
And why?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.110
So that's the question.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.130
And everything I'm going to do
from this point on in the

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.750
video is essentially
going to be a hint.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.340
And then I'll actually
give the solution.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.410
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.760
And pause it, stop
it, whatever.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.730
Think about it for a while.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.620
And I would say this
is a fairly

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.940
advanced level brain teaser.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.190
And it takes a lot of
trial and error.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.400
But the solution-- just as a
little bit of a hint-- isn't

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.600
an ultre-complicated one, where
you have to know some

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.160
higher level math.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.130
It's, once again,
very logical.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.010
You can make very logical
deductions here.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.100
You don't need any higher
math to really come

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.550
to the correct answer.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.880
So let's lay it all out.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.970
So if I were to draw
the top view.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.360
We'll do it in yellow.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.890
This is you.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.420
This is the guy with
20 on his forehead.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.480
And this is the guy with
30 on his forehead.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.320
And what do we know?

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.210
Let's call whatever's
on your forehead a.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.150
That's what you want
to figure out.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.260
So we know that a is
greater than zero.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.680
These are obviously
greater than zero.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.270
You see those already.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.110
We know that a can't
be 20 or 30.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.310
Now this is the interesting
thing.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.780
They told us that the numbers on
one of our foreheads is the

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.400
sum of the numbers on the
other two foreheads.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.120
So either-- this
is a big hint.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.660
I think you might be able
to run with this after

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.580
you get this hint.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.110
You say either a is a sum
of these two numbers.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.420
So a is equal to 20 plus
30, which would mean

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.680
a is equal to 50.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.600
What's the other option?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.940
Either these two numbers, when
you sum them, is equal to a.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.230
That's one possibility.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:10.100
The other possibility is 20
plus a is equal to 30.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.500
Or, a is equal to 10.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.980
And of course I can't say that
30 plus a is equal to 20,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.800
because a can't be minus 10.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.150
That's the only other
possibility.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.930
And we already said that
all the numbers are

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.550
greater than zero.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.840
So every one of these players
knows that their number on

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.760
their forehead is either the sum
of the other two numbers,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.850
or it's the difference of
the other two numbers.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.250
This guy says, you know what?

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:40.720
My number is either 30 plus a,
or it's the difference between

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.510
a and 30, depending on
whichever is bigger.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.960
And he can see which
one's bigger.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.550
I can't see.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.900
So you can say the absolute
value of 30 minus a.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.090
He knows that about
his number.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:55.540
This guy, he knows that his
number is either 20 plus a, or

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.695
the absolute value
of 20 minus a.

00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:03.730
And this all comes from the clue
or the rule that one of

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.080
these numbers you is the sum
of the other two numbers.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.220
Although, you don't know if
you have the sum number on

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.880
your forehead, or you don't know
if you have one of the

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.030
numbers that make up the
sum on your forehead.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.860
But let's go back to our-- So
right from the beginning of

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.000
the game, before anyone asks
us a question, we know that

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.800
the number on our forehead
is either 50 or it is 10.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.370
And that's a pretty good hint,
and you might be able to take

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:29.960
it from there.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.970
I mean, we've narrowed down the
universe of numbers from

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.230
an infinite number of numbers
to two numbers.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.929
And this guy can just deduce
that automatically.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.360
So what other information
was given in the game?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.300
Well, we actually went
around the circle.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.670
So the first time you asked this
guy what number he had,

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.740
he didn't know.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.990
He would be able to say, well
I either have 50 or 10, but

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.740
that's not enough for me to make
a bold statement that my

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.640
number is definitely 50,
or that my number

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.360
is definitely 10.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.040
And so what other information
was there?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.730
We went to this guy, and
this guy wasn't able

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.070
to guess his number.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.940
Then this guy wasn't able
to guess his number.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.730
And now the argument is that
now you should be able to

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:07.160
guess your number.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.940
So let's think about
what happens.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:16.800
In the situation where this
guy is 50-- Well actually,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.860
let's take the other
situation.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.530
Let's take the situation
where this guy is 10.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.490
If this guy is 10, what
will this person see?

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.050
And I'll do this situation
in green.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.280
This guy will say, I'm
either 30 plus 10.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.560
So he'll say, I'm either 40.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.230
Or I'm 30 minus 10.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.660
Or I'm 20, right?

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.810
And he says, well, you know, no
real good conclusion I can

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:42.170
make there.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.980
I could either be 40 or 20,
and I can't figure it out.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.130
Fair enough.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.630
Now you turn to this guy.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.030
In the situation where this
guy is 10, what's this guy

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.160
going to say?

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.730
He's going to say I'm
either 20 plus 10.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.880
I'm either 30, or I
am 20 minus 10.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.760
So 20 minus 10 would be 10.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.420
And you say, wait, wait, hold
on a second though.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.430
I can't be 10.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.920
Because if I were 10 and this
guy were 10, that would

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.540
violate the rules of the game.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.990
One of the rules of the
game said that every

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.480
number had to be unique.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.730
Every number had to
be different.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:23.290
So if you were 10-- you know
from the beginning to you're

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.790
either 50 or 10-- if you are 10,
then when you go to this

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:32.080
guy, he would be able to
deduce that he is 30.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.840
And how would he be able
to deduce that he's 30?

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.540
Because he sees this
20 right here.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.000
If you were a 10, he'd
see a 20 and a 10.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.020
And he would say, I'm either
the sum of those numbers or

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.080
the difference.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.860
If I'm the sum, I'm 30.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.690
If I'm the difference, I'm 10.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.480
But then he would say, I can't
be 10, because you're 10.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.030
And all the numbers
are different.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.960
So I have to be 30.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.570
Right?

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.660
So in the reality where you are
10, when you go around the

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.290
circle, this guy would
be able to figure out

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.910
what number he is.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.200
Right?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.510
Because he's a perfect
logician.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.190
But in the problem statement I
gave you, we went around the

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.790
circle and this guy couldn't
figure out what number he is.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:18.620
He couldn't establish the fact
that he is definitely 30.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.360
So given the fact that he
couldn't establish that he is

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.160
30, it means that he did
not see a 10 here.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.580
He definitely did
not see a 10.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.740
If he saw a 10 there, he
would say, I am 30.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.600
Because I know I cannot be 10.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.180
So we know that you don't have
a 10 on your forehead, and so

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.920
that's why when you come
back to you, you say, I

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.900
know I must be 50.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.490
50 is the number on my forehead,
because if I were

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.000
10, this guy would have been
able to get it before me.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.960
He would have been able to get
the number on his forehead

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.900
before coming back to me.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.020
Anyway, I thought you would
enjoy that brain teaser.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.030
I didn't think of this one.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.300
I actually didn't think of any
of these, although they have a

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.870
little bit of my twist
on some of them.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.760
But I'll be sure to add more.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.010
